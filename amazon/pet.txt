3 #### I purchased this cd for my Pocket Parrot . It has both a woman and a man speaking . Pet store recommends to buy a female voice Only on bird cds because birds respond to female voice better . Con : there 's some real stupid things said on this CD . Prefer female voice because pet shop recommends female voice . Pros : it 's cheap . I will review again in 6 months see if my Polly picks up few words .
3 #### Maybe it 's just my Amazon parrot , but she 's not picking up very quickly or very well .
5 #### I bought this to help me teach my blue quaker named Booger to talk and it sure has helped . I put it in the CD player and let it play all day while I am at work . It might drive Booger nuts , but he sure has learned a lot of words .
2 #### Did n't do a thing for my African Grey ! He hated it and it was very obnoxious ! !
4 #### I like it - but the Cockatiel I am not so sure - he listens but so far does not speak .
3 #### This is a CD . I should have read better , I was expecting a DVD .
5 #### my parot loves this CD ! started repeating the phrases after a week of listening .
1 #### I was reLly disappointed the cd has a lot of sayings that are really stupid . I was looking for one that repeats the same saying like six times in a row . Not all the unnecessary saying .
1 #### It does not contain many words that we would want our bird to incorporate into his repetoire ......... description of item not extensive enough . Shipment and transaction were handled professionally .
4 #### Very fast service . My parrots are still not saying anything new , but I will continue to use it with the hope that after many repetitions they will pick up some more words .
1 #### If you want your bird to interact with you , then interact with your bird . Parrots have the mental capacity of a 3 - 5 year old child . This is like plopping your child down in front of the TV and calling it quality time . Parrots learn to communicate dynamically not by rote . I have 5 parrots and all are chatty because we chat , while cleaning , cooking , doing laundry .. whatever . Turn off the TV and read aloud , talk , sing , dance .. be one of the flock .
4 #### Really like this CD . You can choose to repeat whatever phrase you want your bird to say . Or just play the entire CD . Wish some of the phrases provided included the word " parakeet " since it includes others such as cockatiel or parrot .
1 #### This is the biggest waste of money - do not buy it - it will not work ! It 's just people saying a certain word , then a 10 second pause ... then a different word and another 10 second pause . You can create your own if you really want to try this . But you really should not leave this on for your bird all day - it should be done in 10 minute intervals only or your bird may get irritated by it ( i know i get irritated by it after only 2 words ) . Do n't waste your money on this .
1 #### seriously , buy a tape recorder and just play it continuously to your bird . at least then , it will be your own voice he 's hearing and not just some random person saying ' hello ' over and and over again . i 'm sure repitition is good for them to learn , but i paid $ 11.99 for this ? the entire cd is made up of random words or phrases all about 3 - 5 seconds long . the idea is to choose the one you want your bird to learn and then put the that track of the cd on repeat . it makes sense , but really , could n't you do it yourself for free ? also , alot of the words are things i wouln't want him to learn anyway , just random stuff you would n't normally even say yourself .
4 #### finish reading this book in 2 days . this book covers pretty much everything from the caring to selection of tridacnid clams . i hv 5 clams in my reef tank . this book has really taught me a lot of things i hv overlooked such as feeding . i highly recommend this book .
3 #### I purchased the Trilogy with hoping my two cats , age 3 and 5 would be interested . The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on , she got bored . The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away . It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder , that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version . I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that do n't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do .
2 #### My cats do n't watch TV ... If they ca n't smell it , they do n't care . Maybe yours do . But , well , unless yours do already , do n't bother with these TV time cat videos .
5 #### Really wish that I had just purchased volume one . It is the best . based on what my cats preferred . It is hysterical watching your cat as they watch the video . worth every penny ! ! ! !
5 #### My cats actually watched these DVDs . In the beginning they tried to get the birds by reaching behind the television but once they got used to the deal they settled down and just watched intently . It was funny when a bird would fly out of the picture the cats would want to dart that way too .
4 #### I bought the triliogy and have tested out all the DVDs . It appears that volume 2 is the most well received of the three and the one I would recommend . It 's funny to watch my cat watch it bc she looks behind the TV trying to find the birds . I turn this on sometimes when I 'm leaving the house , by the time I get home , she does n't seem to be paying attention anymore but figured she 'd at least enjoy the sounds .
3 #### If I had gotten just volume two , I would have given it five stars , but since I got the trilogy , I can only give it three stars . I read all the reviews , and knew that vol . two was the best , hands down , but for few extra dollars I decided to get all three in a combo pack . Since birds are a natural source of food for cats ( feral ) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol . two . Contrary to all the cartoons , cats are not fishermen , and thus , fish , either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to . Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live , they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell . Rodents are also a natural food , so volume one was much better than volume three . Also , the quality could have been better ( for my eyes only ) but my cats could care less about video quality ... they just see birds .. LOL
5 #### My two year old Egyptian mau kitten loves watchng birds , at first she loved watching the birds over and over , and now she knows that it is a dvd . Terri
4 #### My female kitty could care less about these videos - but she cares less about almost everything . My little male however digs these . He does n't go ape over them , but he really does watch them for a bit and it makes me feel better to throw them on when I have to go out to work and leave him .
5 #### Puppy Booster Herbal Supplement for Dogs is my puppy best friend , my puppy even as for it every morning . better price than in petco here
5 #### good for puppies who not have problems to keep not having problems . easy to give to active do . many useful vitamins .
5 #### puppy booster is perfect for my puppy , I love it , works almost right away , great strength , easy to give to puppies . large size , almost no smell , herbal supplement
5 #### powerful protection for the dog immune system . i really love that product and my dog also loves it . great herbal supplement . does not leak
5 #### Amazon is the place to shop and this seller is exceptional . Mistakes happen , but it 's the way the mistakes are handled that convince a buyer that a seller is one to trust and use repeatedly , as we shall this seller . We were looking for a booster for our dog and decided on this one after reading positive reviews . We received the product promptly , but there was a tiny perfectly round hole in the bottom of the vial through which much of the gel had leaked . We were very disappointed , as our pup really could have used an immune booster . The seller arranged immediately for a refund and sent a new bottle of the gel without charge . What more can be said ? Trust this product and this seller .
5 #### power mune by vet vitals is good for immune system , really works , good for fixing immune system , this one is chicken flavor , power mune will make a tiger out of your dog or cat . actually powerful .
5 #### I'VE OWNED AND TRAINED DOGS FOR 20 YEARS AND HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT NON ABUSIVE METHODS TO WORK WITH PROBLEM DOGS , AND I BELIEVE CESARS APPROACH IS NOT ONLY THE MOST SIMPLE AND HUMANE BUT IT WORKS . HE SHOWS HOW SIMPLE CORRECTIONS CAN BRING ABOUT INSTANT RESULTS WITHOUT HAVING TO BE AGGRESSIVE OR ABUSIVE TO THE ANIMAL . I'M NOT SURE WHAT BOOK OR PROGRAM THE OTHER REVIEWER IS WATCHING , BECAUSE ANYONE WHO IS CONSISTENT WITH CESARS TECHNIQUES WILL GET THE DESIRED RESULTS . I'VE WATCHED HIS PROGRAM SINCE THE BEGINNING AND HAVE ADDED HIS BOOK TO THE MANY OTHERS I REFER TO IN MY WORK . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DOG ! !
5 #### I Love Love Love Any & All of Cesar 's Teachings ! He 's Soooo ... Practical & Makes So Much Sense ! ! He Always Gives a Deep Understanding ( explanation ) of Why or What Causes a Dog ( or animal ) the behavior & then " How to Correct " that unwanted animal behavior . 10 Thumbs Up for Cesar Millian ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Loved it . I could n't stop watching this series . Saw it in 2 sittings this weekend . I learned so much I did n't know about dogs .
3 #### I love lots of Cesar 's tips but he needs to update his old school rather aggressive methods .
5 #### How can you miss with Cesar Milan ? He 's the best Dog Whisperer ! ! !
2 #### He seems really full of himself and I 'm not so sure the dogs are " trained " . I just get the feeling that they are putting the best examples on the show and the failures hit the editing room floor .
4 #### fun to watch , learned allot of useful information , worth watching
5 #### gives me ideas on how and why dogs act like they do .
5 #### I am such a huge Cesar fan , and this was worth every penny , he is a godsend
5 #### Please see the other reviews we 've written about " Dog Whisperer . " The show is great , both educational and entertaining . And Amazon needs to develop a way to rate multiples of the same thing ! Why write the same review for every year 's episodes of " Dog Whisperer " ? ? ?
5 #### I ordered this DVD Series " used " . Normally , I do not buy " used " DVD 's , CD 's or Books unless the product is rated " nearly new " or in " very good " condition . The seller rated this product " good " so I was hesitant but ordered anyway because of the great price ( under $ 8 for the entire first season ) . I was ecstatic when it arrived only a few short days after I ordered it and in my opinion was in " nearly new " condition . I appreciate the sellers honesty regarding the condition of the outer casing and would not hesitate to order from this seller again . I greatly appreciate the speed and integrity in which they demonstrated with this fantastic DVD series .
5 #### Cesar shines a light on many issues modern dog owners have , and how to remedy them . Its fascinating to watch him work .
5 #### In my opinion , ca n't go wrong with Cesar Millan . Have admired him and his abilities from the very beginning . Would highly recommend anything from The Dog Whisperer !
5 #### I thoroughly enjoy watching Dog Whisperer episodes . I think that Cesar Millan 's philosophy regarding dogs can apply to every aspect of life ... Do n't reward bad behavior ! ! !
5 #### Getting a rescue dog which you never know what past comes with the dog .. So I wanted to see how Cesar handled various situations ... He is so good understanding the minds and behaviors of dogs ... Each episode is different in its own way ... Love the dvd ..
5 #### The first season of Cesar is a great introduction to his methods and does not assume that you know anything about him or his methods . From time to time I go back to this first season to refresh myself on some of the basics of his method and philosophy . I enjoy these episodes every time .
4 #### Cesar is truly a genuis of what he does . He has the ability to get the most misbehaved dogs and rehab them to get them back to being great companions . The only problem with the series that I have is the story is almost always the same . Aggressive dog , Ceasar comes and teaches the owners to be better pack leaders , thus dog becomes less aggressive . I would love to see more episodes focused on other problems besides aggressive dogs .
5 #### I have four dogs -- different breeds , different personalities , different temperaments . All have come from homes where the original " owners " tired of them for one reason or another . This motley crew did not immediately become a happy pack . I had no idea how to deal with the problem . Then I watched Cesar Millan 's Dog Whisperer -- over and over . I immediately began to use Cesar 's approach : seeing myself as the pack leader , exercising the dogs more ( and together ! ) , behaving more like the dogs ' mothers would have behaved ( yes , I applied a bit of pressure to the neck with my fingertips -- the Mom " bite " ) . Now I have a happy , peaceful pack of contented , well - exercised , balanced dogs . And I am a happy , peaceful pack leader . Now my dogs are not a source of frustration and guilt , but a source of joy , love , and connectedness . Cesar is a wonder !
4 #### I 've recently got hooked on Ceasar 's dog whisperer show and have been trying to rehabilitate my 8 year old dog . She 's improved amazingly on her walks but there is still a lot I need to train her on . Watching what he does dog after dog , makes me want to stop everything a get to work . I think he 's amazing at what he does , and watching the video you are reminded of that over and over again . The only negative thing I have to say about the disc set is that unlike when the show airs on the national geographic channel , it does n't give you an update on how the dog is doing after the session . Otherwise , it 's highly recommended !
5 #### I was impressed how he handled the dogs . What do you do with dogs digging in the garden when you do n't see them doing it ?
4 #### I read the book , and after watching the program , I have a much better understanding of the techniques Cesar uses to bring dogs under control . It gets a bit repetitive but the repetition does bring home the lessons . My dogs and I are better for it ; much more cooperation between us . The extras were a waste of time , quite frankly , and could be left out . All in all , worth the time .
5 #### Interesting and tasty ( at least according to our dogs ' response ) recipes that are clearly written and easy to follow . If you want to make your own food and treats this book is a must .
5 #### I was curious about making home cooked food to supplement our new puppy 's diet . Not exclusively , mind you , but I definitely wanted to incude some fresh food along with her ( high quality ) kibble . This book has plenty of great recipes for every meal , from breakfast to dinner , desserts , special occasions , and even training snacks . There are also recipes for homemade kibble and Kong toy stuffing . Plus there is some information on what not to feed a dog ( like onions and grapes ) . I 'll definitely be preparing some of the recipes from this .
5 #### Lots of good recipes for your furry babies . Easy to make , and lots of them to choose from in the book .
2 #### A lot of options to make . But nothing for Diabetic Dogs or Senior dogs .
3 #### Not my go - to book for home cooking for my dogs
4 #### like this it has recipes for my budget that I can make and 3 types of treats I 've made so far my dog loves , I 'm now gathering things to start making his meals and freezing them , hope he likes them as much as his treats , way cheaper than buying treats for him ...
5 #### Easy to read , easy to make Dog Treats ! ! ! Minimal ingredients ...
5 #### My dogs love the recipes ! I have 8 and have tried many of the recipes . So much better for your critters than ready made store bought brands .
5 #### like the book a lot . thank you for your fast service .
5 #### Love the cookbook ca n't wait to start cooking for my dogs ! ! ! !
5 #### nutri calm works great , my puppy does love it and so I love to use it to give to my puppy . puppy actually becomes calmer within few hours after it . almost no smell
1 #### I am disappointed in the quality of these . They have significantly deteriorated in just a few uses . I am going to stick with using foil .
4 #### I have now purchased all 4 of these bands . I already have a full home gym and use it nearly daily but these bands have provided an awesome addition allowing me to work muscles I do n't think I 've ever worked . They 're guide could be more extensive because I 've found many new / interesting ways to use them and work even more muscles .
5 #### Got it for my brother 's dog , since she was having a lot of stiffness in her hindquarters . It has helped .
5 #### Replacement blades are so expensive that my husband decided it 'd make more sense to just buy a new razor ; however , he discovered that was n't the case . He liked his existing Norelco so much better that he returned the new razor and bought the replacement heads for his old . He said he 's glad he did , and the blades are doing a great job !
5 #### Bought this set about two months ago and never got a chance to use them , needed a white elephant gift last minute so this is it . It was a hot item for sure , my receptionist was the final winner and she said she 's amazed at how soft the bristles are . A great little set that 's affordable and makes good gifts .
5 #### Have been using this hair spray for years . The 5 pc set was a great buy
5 #### Strong magnets once you remove the plastic film . Using them on a steel peg board they work great .
5 #### Light weight and quite warm . Just right for me .
5 #### Got two for my backyard to hang on the fence . They look great there ! ! THanks ! !
5 #### Love this brush . I have an older brush that is not retractable and have never been able to clean it thoroughly . I have six dogs and they all like It , my one dog Frenchie loves it . She has always like me scratching her back , I think this is why she like it so much .
5 #### Just tried it out on my Yorkie and my terrier chihuahua and this brush is amazing ! My dogs loved how it felt and it left them feeling nice and smooth ! The clean up was the best part , it did n't leave the hair clumped up in the brush like my old brush ! I 'm going to tell all my friends about this brush !
5 #### Great product ! This came auickly as alwsys , packed great as always . The bands come in a small black bag that is a huge advantage because all of my gym gear always gets list and just laying around everywhere . The color is vaibrant and size is great for these bands . Over all great gor your workout !
5 #### I bought it for my daughter who is a fitness instructor . ( She used other brands before and was unhappy ) . Now she 's so satisfied with those and says they are the best . Easy to work with , comfortable and friendly .
5 #### The silver name tag is a little bit crooked but I still think this bag is adorable ! ! ! !
5 #### This product is fantastic . I use it for steaks also , to make sure they are cooked just right . I have had this product for several years and the battery is still good . I wanted to get one for my son , but I ca n't find it anywhere online . Amazon does n't have it and does n't know when they will again . Even the AcuRite website does n't have it . I guess it was discontinued . How can you discontinue such a great item ?
5 #### Used these for a Star Wars theme cupcake order , they worked just fine for baking and the kids loved the liners and cute BB8 toppers !
5 #### Best Stuff to make your own fish feed - Really happy with this and the fish love it
5 #### worked great and even better then ones that came with Grill
5 #### Great bands ! I bought two red ones for some resistance training on the barbell , these are a little smaller but with the right use you can get what you need . I also bought a green band and I think this one is a little narrower than the standard green bands you see in the gym . I wanted this to help my wife do pull - ups , and this does the trick ! She 's pretty excited she can work her way up to unassisted pull - ups !
5 #### This is the best and safest dog treat on the market . My dogs actually refuse to eat any other treat . There has never been a recall ( to my knowledge ) , on these treats . Highly recommend !
5 #### dog 's love it my baby 's are doing so great on this food also feed the dry they have not had any problem 's with hot spot 's since feeding this brand thank u so much for this wonderful food will never switch again
5 #### Love it . Soft , light , and breezy . A little difficult to place over comforter as there are no ties but once placed the comforter stays put . It 's perfect . I recommend . - not sure if these covers come without ties or if it was just the one I got , either way it worked out .
4 #### I like laundry bags , these are nice quality it appears . The zipper has a " lock " so it wo n't open in your washer . It 's nice to have more so you can put less in each back and use a couple . That way your clothes get cleaner in my opinion . The thing I do n't like so much is that the biggest size is gigantic and you get 4 ( of each size ) . I do n't really need 4 gigantic bags , the medium and small size are perfect although smaller is more needed than medium . Another thing is that the mesh is really fine , that is nice for bras with hooks or other things with small buttons but it feels very stiff and inflexible which is also a draw back for getting your stuff clean . Maybe they get softer with use .
4 #### Colors are virtually exact as in the photo . We bought this to lay over our dogs ' bed to cut down on having to wash the actual bed cover . While I am happy with the item it is not as heavy as what I expected . We have purchased similar throws from Walmart that are heavier and more durable . My only concern is how long this one will last . If you want it just for ' pretty ' , or a light weight cover , it is a lovely throw . But if you are expecting something durable , you might want to keep looking .
4 #### If you have 40 + year old Paul Revere from Oneida , you 'll notice a difference . Does n't perfectly match the existing pieces ( more noticeable on flatware , especially when you stack it ) , but you have to be looking to tell .
5 #### Perfect ! Exactly what I needed , and I like being able to alternate colors . It helps with sorting somehow
3 #### I LOVED these sheets when they first came . They are SO soft and wonderful . Unfortunately within a few days there was a small hole in them :( I had only washed them once before putting them on . Not sure if I just got a bad one , but other than the small tear , I love them .
5 #### I love correlle ! With kids doing the dishes I got tired of stoneware chipping but with correlle plates there is no worry ! This design is perfect for our woodland house . I 'll definitely be collecting more pieces .
5 #### Fun calendar . Bought this for my Grandmother to quiz us every day . So far she has enjoyed it and I would recommend to others .
3 #### Good price , but is made of shiny slippery rubber . I prefer the ones that are n't slippery .
4 #### This calendar is beautiful ! The prints are fun and have fantastic color , the grid is also very clean with lots of space for notes . Only complaint is the pages are not glossy so sharpies will bleed through ( which is my pen of choice for calendars ) .
5 #### Adorable ! A little bit heavy but not too bad . The weight gives it a nicer feel . Nice details , nicely painted . Very nice handiwork . I think the little bone on the bottom is to add a name , but we are n't going to do that . It 's cute just a blank bone ( or can remove it if it bugs us ) .
5 #### Delivered as advertised . Works great ! The price was a little steep , but when you 're buying a discontinued item , that 's the reality .
5 #### It is solid metal with exception of nozzle and rubber grip . Grip feels like high grade rubber but still the kind of rubber that will degrade if exposed to chemicals or oils . My hose is broken but it pressure tested ok . I will update this review if it later turns out to be crap but so far I would say its a good unit over all .
4 #### These spatulas are a little smaller than I expected , but they are silicone and do the trick .
5 #### Now my 3/8 " sockets are nutdrivers . The 3/8 " female end makes this into a 10 " extension to really tighten these bolts . The handle is not as comfortable as my other 3/8 " spinner , but being able to attach my ratchet more than makes up for it . It 's a very solid tool .
5 #### This review is for Premium Stainless Steel 5 Piece Kitchen Essentials Knife Set with Stainless Steel Knife Holder Stand . This set is really sharp with the metallic looking butcher block . Definitely a change from the standard wooden ones . As for the knives themselves , they are quite sharp and have a quality feel to them . I am hoping they will hold up like my ceramic ones do . They really do look good sitting on my countertop . I have stainless steel appliances and black and brown granite -- so this really fits right in .
5 #### Had a plastic hose reel that was problematic from day one and it finally fell apart . Decided to go simpler , with a hose holder that I can simply wind the hose into . Not as big as I thought , but it holds over 100 ' of Craftsman rubber hose without a problem . Not sure if the post in the center made any difference when it comes to winding up the hose , but it does n't get in the way , so it is fine in my book . Nice finish with thick lacquer which I am hoping will keep it from corroding or rusting out anytime soon .
5 #### This is the perfect size to carry coffee . the double vacuum will keep coffee hot or cold drinks cold for a long time . It has a very sleek look and it will fit nicely in back pack pockets . the quick release cover allows for easy access with one hand . I received a discount to review this product .
5 #### A very well balanced spatula that is strong as well as flexible .
4 #### I have used it with pasta . Did not work the greatest , had to add water twice . But it works for old fashioned rolled oats . I use the orange one . 1/2 cup oats , dash of sea salt , and one cup boiling water . Let set about 7 min with lid secure . What I like is that I can let this sit and get other things done . No babysitting a pan . Have not tried veggies yet .
4 #### Great vibrant purple ! Looks great with my mixed media projects . Tip : if you push the spray 1/2 way , you get a droplet effect ( or splatter effect ) , if you press it all the way you get a nice fine mist .
5 #### I 'm obsessed with these suddenly . Use them as a dinner mat , use as a cutting board , use as a hot tray ... these things are so handy . I got 2 of them in the bright green . I was thinking they 'd be like any other silicone mat but these are even better ! Once you place them on your counter you have to peel them if you want them off . Which is a good thing , because they wo n't slip around . And they do t leave any residue behind as they are simply silicone . I would definitely recommend these ! They are so handy to have around . Plus they were really low cost and fast shipping ! A+ all around
5 #### What can I say ? This was a replacement for a bowl cover that had chipped badly . It fit my work bowl and I 'm happy it was available .
5 #### I am satisfied with my purchase and am glad that I went through here . Thank you !
5 #### This set is so cute ! I love to get all dressed up for my husband every once in a while , and surprise him with a really nice meal . This apron is perfect for covering up and protecting my outfit and still looking cute at the same time . When I first ordered this , I mistakenly thought it was a set of 4 aprons . Had I read the description in detail , I would 've seen that it 's actually a set of 1 apron , 1 napkin , 1 kitchen towel , and 1 hot pad , all matching . They are made out of sturdy cotton , so they are all very easily machine washable . I would definitely recommend this set to all home cooks . It 's cute , practical , and unisex too . I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review . I hope this was helpful to you !
5 #### These bags are awesome and help me when I travel . I travel a lot for work and I 'm always looking for ways to pack better and more efficiently . These are really lightweight and do n't add any weight to the luggage . They 're drawstring and stay closed . There are ; different sizes in a set and I use them for different things - clean clothes , dirty clothes , socks , etc . They 're not too big . They 're a lot smaller than a laundry bag . I included a picture of the largest for reference . They 're also really cute . I love having fun travel accessories . I received this product at a discount for my honest review .
5 #### These made a great gift for my friends . I 'll have to ask them if they keep the wine cool , but either way they were a hit .
5 #### These work great with seed / pantry moths . I always keep one going next to the love bird cage .
4 #### I had a party and wanted it to be as green as possible . This table cover helped with that . I did n't feel nearly as guilty as if I 'd used a plastic one , although it did come sealed in plastic . Nice color , too .
5 #### A very nicely made , small - size gnome .... almost too nice to use in the little contest we have going with our neighbors where we surprise each other from time to time with a well - hidden garden decoration . This guy is a cut above most garden gnomes ...
5 #### Friends : We do n't often have Canaps at our Horse ranch in the remote Sangre de Cristo mountain range of Colorado but we do eat big meals so I mostly used these for individual butter dishes . The match a large collection of flat wear by the same company ..... I bought four sets of everything from www.amazon.com on a single morning of on - line shopping . This stuff can go into the dishwasher . It looks so Good I keep the Kitchen center island which is nine foot by five foot set all the time as if we were having guests . Google my name to Learn more ...... Arthur von Boennighausen
5 #### Friends : I use this pitcher for flowers in water ...... It matches a bunch of plates , cups and other flat wear made by the same company . This is a large pitcher with a wide base . Someone once told me that flowers are God 's thoughts in physical form ...... Google my name to Learn more ...... Arthur von Boennighausen
4 #### As described and got if quickly . Well made and looks great at my front entrance . A like pricy but could not find anything like this in my area .
5 #### Beautiful item and you can actually use it Nice size canisters . Would buy from seller again
5 #### Love Pimpernel . My first set was received as a gift in 1983 . Since then I have 5 different large placemat sets and mix and match the patterns . My guests appreciate the fact that they do n't worry about spilling sauce or gravy on their placemat because they wipe clean . BEAUTIFUL ! I love the Jason pattersons also , but their placemats are a little too large for my table .
5 #### Works great , well made . We have two of these .
5 #### These are just what I wanted last Christmas , but I could not find them . So when I saw them on Amazon I bought ahead for next xMas . They are very pretty , and look to be quite well made . If I have any problems using them I will update .
5 #### Like the idea of personalizing Nora Fleming platters for different occasions . This ducky is adorable and looks great on the dish .
5 #### Perfect for cleaning up after the dogs . I may have to buy another one for the garden . Very solid better than I expected .
5 #### It is affordable , beautiful and there is room to write my appointments for each day of the month . Also , it is light so I can carry it in my purse all the time .
5 #### I purchased this because my favorite architectural style is " storybook " and I was looking for something along that vein . This fits the bill perfectly and looks very cute on my deck .
4 #### We needed a night light next to the bathroom and this one fit the bill . It gives off just enough to see but not wake you up .
5 #### I LOVE this colander . The old one I had lasted for about 20 years , so I ca n't complain . But it was stained and one handle had broken off . It was time for a new one by a long shot . lol I looked specifically for one that was purple - my favorite color - and was delighted to find this one . The holes are cheerful smiley faces , the size is perfect , the handles are easy to grip , it is well balanced , and of course the color is beautiful .
5 #### I just bought this set on sale for 10 bucks and have to say they are definitely worth it . They are heavy duty , not delicate . You do not have to be afraid to use them . The short stem and the foot are thick as well , so no worries there either . There is very slight seam , which is to be expected when buying " cheap " " crystal . The way it is positioned , along with the pattern on the glass , makes it barely noticeable . You will only see it if you really search for it . I am picky and I usually never buy any type of crystal or glass that has a seam - this was the first time and it was only because it is n't noticeable and the price was too good to pass up . They look great and the design can blend in with practically any dcor theme .
5 #### Different from the " Fat Max " tape measure , these MaxSteel tapes are durable and stand up to heavy use . It 's a shame they are discontinued . Bought one just to have a backup in case they become impossible to find anymore .
4 #### After watching a series of YouTube videos by Tim Holtz I decided to try some of his products . The price was right at Amazon . I 'm not very experienced with using these yet , but so far so good !
5 #### i never thought i would be using curlers again ! bought those velcro ones and pulled out several strands of hair with each roller . searched and searched - so surprised when i found them . only looked on amazon cause i was getting so many other hard to find items . they are made just as good as they use to be 45 yrs . ago .
5 #### This coffee cup is really nice and great with the bright colors ! ! ! If you love the wizard of oz or shoes , you will love this cup ! Best part about it is it 's microwave and dishwasher safe !
4 #### It 's better than most , but I feel that Shun 's quality went down over the years . This knife does n't feel as sturdy as my old Shun for some reason . I 've had this knife for over a year now . It became my " beater " . It holds an edge , but dulls out quicker than my other knives . It also takes a lot of work to get it razor sharp .
5 #### Like the above reviewer , I too believe this is the best ever , conceived , designed , and produced , large / covered bowl on the market ! ! ! I am currently trying in vain to find another one . It is hard to find a lot of Bodum in the US . There is an Adobe pdf online , of all their products , & if you are a kitchen princess like me , you would drool perusing it . Although they do have this bowl listed , it does n't say how to purchase one . I had mine for about 8 yrs . It was perfect for when you have to make tons of say potato salad , or maybe 2 pounds of macaroni salad & want to take it to a gathering & have it look absolutely beautiful . The cover fit well . It was a beautiful object ....... until I made the mistake of sending it with my husband to a hunting weekend . Broken on the trip home ! If anyone knows where to find one ..... please email me !
5 #### I bought this for my husband to BBQ . This is our 1st silicone brush . We do n't realize it can hold that much BBQ sauce . We were considering OXO brush but this one is on sale . We have been happy with Mario Batali 's product so we decide to give it a try . ( We have Mario Batali pizza cutter and dough cutter ) I think this is a good purchase and will recommend to anyone . It holds up sauce good and easy to clean .
5 #### Excellent product , very sharp as advised , the packaging was little on the cheap side . Word of advise , be very careful using the Shun knives , they are not very forgiven and will treat your fingers no differently than the meat your are cutting ! Highly recommended .
5 #### If you make dessert souffles ( chocolate or jam - filled ) these small heart shaped ramekins are just the thing to dress up your table . THey also hold cheese , dips or other small side dishes . The colors are very modern and interesting ; if you know someone who has used deep brown and kiwi or aqua in their decor , this would make quite a housewarming gift . Or Valentine 's day present .
4 #### I like having something like this on hand when my dogs are slightly under the weather , because if I ran to the vets for every little health problem , I would n't be able to afford having my two lovable dogs I love so much .
5 #### the book finally arrived and was so worth the wait ! ! ! It is full of stories and first hand accounts that are excellent and helpful
4 #### Working very well on my health helper . No more calling and then getting myself worked up
5 #### Something new I 'm trying with my puppy seems to be working . Training is easy with the explanation and cards that came along with book . Thank you .
5 #### going tp have fun with my new dog training
5 #### This is an excellent , concise book , outlining the best and most efficacious way to train a dog - or any animal , for that matter . We give a copy to almost everyone who adopts one of our dogs , and this is the method we use to train them , prior to adoption . Dogs love clicker training , and they are able to learn quickly and happily , without any fear of making mistakes .
5 #### Bought for a friend , Karen is spot on the mark when it comes to clicker training . Having " written the book " so to speak , all of her teachings are clear and to the point . She has saved the lives of many animals . I credit her methods to allowing me to reach my way smart and fast JRT ! We never would have made it without the ' clicker ' ! ( note : works on people too . )
5 #### Hope this works . Clicker is so loud , my Pug jumps . May be more a deterrent than a training incentive .
2 #### Do n't understand the concept . Wait for your dog to stumble along and do something right then giv e them a click and a treat . I 'm more of a traditional " negative " reinforcement kind of guy . Dog does something wrong and he gets a squirt of water or a blast of the ultrasonic dog trainer along with a negative tone from me . worked on all my dogs for 40 years
5 #### If you purchase this book , when you get it and peruse the contents you wo n't imagine that the ideas within it could help in training your pet dog . That is what is so unique about the book . I have used the ideas within it 's pages and trust me they work without having to beat on your pet .
3 #### Unless you plan on becoming a full - fledged trainer encountering every kind of dog and advanced tricks , this may not be for you . It is a fairly simple , low - budget publishing offering . The author could have used an editor for formatting and compartmentalizing the sections . I honestly ca n't remember anything that stood out . I learned the basics of clicker training by summarizing the greater text , which is what I asked out of the book . There just is n't anything special about it .
1 #### I normally do n't go for stuff like this . I gave it a try . I think obediance classes are optimum to a great relationship with your pet ... even if you do n't ahve the money to dish out , go to friends who have dogs .
4 #### Went to Clicker Training Classes in my area . Wanted a refresher course for myself . Happy with this purchase , and the lessons provided .
4 #### Got the clickers yesterday and my dogs already respond to them . Will read the book for more info . This and the silent whistle , which works GREAT , keeps us from yelling at them .
4 #### We give this book to our clients for them to get a basic understanding of clicker training so when they come to our training class they are ahead of the game . We have gotten good feedback from them . I add homework that I 've made up straight from the book to make sure they have read it .
5 #### This book is good for any dog owner . Even if you do n't actually do the training the dog psychcology information is invaluable .
2 #### READ REVIEW ON I - CLICKER 5 PACK ! I BOUGHT INTO THE HOLE DEAL AND IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE FOR ME ! SORRY
5 #### Great book easy to follow I ca n't wait to read the next one . I have learned so much about clicker training and my dog has too .
5 #### I purchased this book and I have had amazing results from my Morkie puppy ! Due to the book and clickers , she has learned to sit , shake hands , lay down , stand on her hind legs plus I leash trained her in less than a month ! She is currently 13 weeks old very young to know so much . I credit the achievements made by the book ! I have read it twice ! Very understandable !
5 #### Found this book to be well - written , easy to understand , and even though I was skeptical before reading , it really does make sense . The training is based on operant conditioning ( positive reinforcement ) which has been scientifically proven to work . My dogs really do get it which makes behavioral training much easier than with traditional ( negative ) effects . I like Karen Pryor 's approach so much I purchased another of her books , " Do n't Shoot the Dog ! The New Art of Teaching and Training " which goes in - depth as to how and why this style of training works . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND both titles .
4 #### It 's thorough , but I use the clicker in a much different way . Throughout the book , the idea that 's presented is to get the dog 's attention and then reinforce what he does right with a reward . But for my dog , it works best to use the clicker to warn of bad behavior . Maybe my dog did n't read the book ....
4 #### Whoever invented clicker training is a genius . This not only avoids over - treating ( feeding ) your dog during training and thus a healthy alternative to snacks . After initial training , your dog will quickly associate " clicks " with your affirmation - but your response must be immediate .
3 #### This is a good , quick intro to clicker training if you know nothing about it . I think I did n't learn anything new from this book that I did n't already know from about a half hour 's worth of internet surfing on clicker training - but that is n't the fault of the book given that Karen Pryor seems to be one of the eminent authorities on the subject and a lot of the info on the internet can probably be traced to her writings like this book . I have to say though that almost half of it consisted of advocacy for clicker training , which seems unnecessary ( I 'm already reading the book so why devote two whole chapters and much of the others convincing me to go with clicker training ? ) and made the book even less useful . I expected a procedural how - to , not a persuasive essay . Overall , though , I thought it was solid for a " Getting Started " type book .
4 #### I train basic obedience and generally do NOT use clicker training unless asked . When they do I give them this book . A good basic book on clicker training if that is the method you prefer .
4 #### good BASIC training for your dog . a step one book , not much after that , as the title says,"Getting Started "
5 #### This is the best starter clicker training book I have found . Of course Karen Pryor is the premier trainer when it comes to clicker training and all training . My service dog trainer recommended it and I love it .
5 #### Clicker training will supercharge the training of your dog ( and other animals ) and strengthen the communication between you . This is not the end - all , be - all book about clicker training ( and does n't purport to be ) but it will allow you to get real results and give you useful skills to build on .
5 #### I 'm new to clicker training but with the help of Karen 's book , my dog seems to be responding to it . In fact today she got off her run and if it were n't for the clicker training , I would have had difficulty getting her back . I am looking forward to working my dog more with it .
5 #### My dogs LOVE these collards . I did n't realize they came from Fab . but it does n't really matter to me either . I have two red heelers who would wear anything I put on them , but these rasta collars really pop with their coats ! The fabric is thick and durable and in the month or so that the dogs have been wearing them they have n't faded or stretched . The ring is securely sewn in , so I do n't worry about the tags coming off of them anytime soon . We even walk one of our dogs with the leash attached directly to the collar . She 's a submissive girl , but I 've never seen her try to fight this collar off during our walk . ( She 's gotten out of some other ones before . ) I like it a lot , hopefully they make a Colorado branded one soon !
5 #### This collar is beautiful ! Fits my English setter perfectly . I love that it has a thick band . Bright colors . Love it !
5 #### My dog loves it , lol . He gets a lot of compliments on it .
4 #### This collar looks awesome on our rottie . The colors really pop , and it totally reflects his calm and loving nature . The collar does nt seem very durable , but thankfully the dude 's blind so he hardly pulls when on a leash and on walks we use a harness . Rasta Rott 's for the win !
5 #### I got this for my son 's German Shepherd puppy , and now he 's two years old and he still wears it because it 's adjustable . Very pretty , really good quality !
4 #### Love this collar and matching leash . My dog is a chocolate brown labradoodle so the colors really stand out . It 's a good quality collar for everyday use . I will buy a back up for when this one gets too raggedy .
5 #### We are very happy with this free standing wood gate . It is good looking , keeps out Puggy boys out of trouble and is quite sturdy . I am glad we got it !
4 #### Keeps my big dogs out of the living room , which is what I needed it for . I just wish I could figure out a better way to anchor it . I 'm using a bungee cord and the back of a bench .
5 #### Perfect , just what I wanted for dogs to put on front porch so they ca n't go down stairs and still do n't have to fasten gate to stay up .
4 #### Works for what it 's intended . Definitely NOT as sturdy as expected , and it chips fairly easily . Priced too high for what the product is .
5 #### This product exceeded our expectations . It 's even rather handsome , is fairly sturdy as long as some angles are preserved , is heavier than anticipated , and , of course , allows for any number of configurations to fit odd openings . A very good value for the money .
2 #### After using the gate for a short time the slates came out . I have tried to glue them back in but very hard to do . I am so disappointed . It is not working for me . I spent too much money for this gate .
4 #### This is a good looking gate that works very well in spaces where a standard size would n't work . The only caveat is that our dog pretty quickly figured out how to push the end side out of the way to get past , but we just put a hook and eye at both ends and it is perfect .
3 #### While the red color is very bright and visible , there is one major flaw with this product . The material with the buckle is very soft , and will slide out and the collar will just fall off . It would n't be a problem if they the material was n't so smooth or if it had been made differently . DO NOT attach a leash to this collar . Even when my dog scratched his neck , it fell off . My solution was , I cut off the housing for the LED , and stitched it into another 1 " collar that had was actually sewn secure .
5 #### This collar looks really cool , It 's not an overwhelmingly bright but you can definitely see it across the yard on a dark night . I particularly like blue color . And it has three options , a slow blink , a little faster blink and steadily on . I like the constant on mode personally . The clip makes it really easy to put on and take off and the leash hook up ring is heavy duty and high quality . Plus it is large enough to hook up easily . I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review which I have given here . I was in no way influenced by the manufacturer or seller . All opinions and statements are mine and mine alone .
5 #### I 'm a dog groomer and I see a lot of collars and I will say this one is very well made and the lock is very easy to attach even for elderly folks who has a hard time locking collars . I received this at a discount for my 100 % honest review .
1 #### It went totally dead after few time use . Not rechargeable .
5 #### I can find my lab in the yard at night . Very lightweight and he can wear it with his regular collar .
5 #### I am constantly at the MX track at night , and this collar is amazing . The LED collar clips are great , but this is much more highly visible .
4 #### I like this collar a lot , as I end up walking my dog after dark quite often . The collar looks pretty sweet and improves our visibility a lot . My dog gets really annoyed if I put the collar on either of the flashing light settings and will pretty much give me the stink eye until I fix it . I also feel that the collar is very soft and not particularly sturdy . It feels like it could come apart and ravel easily . I do n't attach a leash to the collar , as I always walk on a harness , but I could see attaching a leash to be a problem with the collar breaking . I am satisfied with the product , I just caution others to know the limitations of the collar .
3 #### The product came quickly . The bright blue made my dog more excited to chase it than his other ball ( dogs can see yellow and blue ) . However it is n't really durable . When I took it out of the package it seemed harder than a regular tennis ball . The ball hardly survived 1 game of fetch . It completely crumpled . My dog is a pit and has a strong jaw but prior to this we had a regular cheap tennis ball and it lasted a year . I 'll give the remaining two balls to someone with smaller dogs .
2 #### I bought these balls thinking they were made in England ; but they are made in China . It says so on the package . They are also really hard . I would recommend regular tennis balls or Kong balls over these .
5 #### My dogs love these and are playing with them as we speak . well made and will order more . got for free < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Topaz - Abbie - Durable - Dog - Toys - Dog - Tennis - Balls - British - Design - Medium - Green - Blue - Non - Toxic-3 - Pack / dp/420841328X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Topaz & Abbie , Durable Dog Toys , Dog Tennis Balls , British Design , Medium , Green , Blue , Non Toxic , 3 Pack</a >
4 #### Save $ 959.66 on a 4.4 oz tube which costs $ 9.34 ? I would want this bargain even if I did not have a cat !
5 #### I agree with other reviewer about this product -- it 's very cat - specific in terms of which ones like it or not . It works . A cat either likes it from the start or does n't , and that preference persist . The ones that like it , LOVE it -- and I ca n't accidentally leave it on the counter since it will end up with puncture marks from them trying to bite into it . The ones that are n't interested were n't interested from the start . FWIW , adding some mineral oil to a cat 's wet food is welcome by all of mine , so to the extent one of the cats do n't take the petromalt , the mineral oil helps to keep the hairball situation under control . Mineral oil is odorless and tasteless , so I do n't get the fascination with it , but cats will be cats . . . .
3 #### Cat wo n't eat it unless I put it on him to lick it off . It 's hard to herd s cat .
5 #### Car licks it off my finger . It 's very fresh so has a texture easy for her to lick off my finger .
5 #### Really works & stops the hairball barfing . One cat will lick it off my fingers , the other has to be forced . Just different cats . It is NOT the products fault the cats do n't like it
5 #### Have had many kitty companions over the years . Have never had one that did n't love this stuff ! Had a problem finding it locally and they would n't touch the other brans . So glad I found this again !
5 #### My cat loves this stuff ! It 's great for her hair balls . She only likes the malt flavor and no other ! I was buying it at the big pet store for double the price ! It is much cheaper here ! Expiration date is good until 2020 ! I am very happy with my purchase .
2 #### Ca n't speak as to its effectiveness , and my cat would n't touch the stuff .
1 #### My cat rubs it all over my carpet instead of licking it off his paw or nose .
5 #### Although we were hoping our cat would lick it from the tube , its perfectly fine that we smear it on her paws to lick it off . Its nice and thick
5 #### My kittens LOVE this stuff ! Literally it is the only one that I 've tried that they do n't freak out when I try to give it to them . I do n't know why , but I 'm sold !
5 #### My kitties ca n't live without this ! No more hair balls in my house .
5 #### This really helps our bunnies when they 're shedding . Highly recommended !
5 #### This is the only one product that really works and I have tried thousands of them . Very happy with the purchase and very happy with the results .
2 #### My cats do n't like this and would n't eat it but then , they are kinda fussy .
5 #### As promised it is as firm and more like the original . Unfortunately , my last few generations of cats sure do n't like it .... I'm not sure why previous cats loved it , I assume new ways of making it ... don't know BUT , this is not like the runny stuff I 've bought in recent years , which is good . It 's easier to put on my kitty 's paw for him to lick off , and whether he likes it or not , it does keep him hairball free
5 #### Very effective ! A combination of Petromalt and a good brushing stopped daily vomiting due to hairballs . Kitty thanks you !
5 #### The original gel formula . Hard to find and cats love it .
3 #### My cat ( large main coon ) with long hair wo n't even lick it . Course he is picky ... tried others . So far the cheapest in store works same for him .
5 #### Have used this for years , it works pretty well .
5 #### I do n't have a cat , just a dog that will eat just about anything . At the advice from my veterinarian , I keep Petromalt on hand in case my not so smart , but well loved dog eats things that are really bad for him . He loves the taste too .
5 #### My cats suffered with fur balls until I bought Petromalt .
5 #### Works great for both my long hair and short hair cats . They love the taste too !
1 #### My cats are fussy They would n't even touch it
3 #### Cats did n't like at first . Now they tolerate it .
5 #### Ca n't find this locally anymore and it 's the only one my cats will eat . Great product that helps with hairballs !
5 #### This is the thick , original kind of Petromalt that does n't drip and ooze every time you try and use it . One cat eats it out of the tube as a treat , the other tolerates it , but that 's her behavior with all Petromalt type products . All in all , it 's great because it does n't make a mess of the cat , my hands , the surface the cat is sitting on when she 's dosed , etc .
5 #### Cats use this when needed for hairballs or indigestion as well .
4 #### I really like these ( I got three different colors ) but the sizing is off . A small usually fits my dogs just fine . This ran big . By the time I adjusted it the wording was obscured so that one reads " dog " one reads " nerv " and one reads " ly " ... otherwise they are fine . I got matching harnesses so I feel that the obscured wording is n't as big of a deal , but without the harness no one would know what the colors say . An extra - small size would have worked better , but small is the smallest offered . Good color and quality though .
5 #### Just perfect ! I got three different colors / words all in the small for my Jack - Russel / Rat Terrier mix and my two Rat Terriers . They fit all three perfectly . It 's bright , well made , and enough padding that they comfy in it . Unlike the other 2 I ordered , the green " friendly " one has a ring on the harness at the back and on the front too . The yellow and white only have d - rings on the back . Really worked out great for my needs . Very happy with my purchase . My dogs are all different sizes from 10 lbs to 20 and different heights , neck and girth , but the small fit all 3 beautifully . I 'm delighted with the purchase and glad I decided to splurge on these and the matching collars . Even my nervous dog who refuses to move if you try to put anything on her is comfy in her new halter and really does n't seem to mind wearing it at all !
5 #### It fit my dog perfectly . He finds it very comfortable to wear . Now I do n't have to worry about people approaching him and him reacting ! Thanks for making a great product !
4 #### This fit my dog exactly - he is at the top of the measurements for a size small and it is almost snug , but still fits . My only complaint is that the buckle is in the corner of where his leg meets his body - the armpit , if you will . I ca n't imagine that is comfortable , but he still runs and moves normally . Other than that I love it ! Very sturdy and is easier to put on him than other vests I 've tried .
3 #### This fits weird on my true to size small dog ( 8 lb rat terrier ) I had to sew this to fit her correctly and avoid slipping off her neck area . Overall high quality product would buy again ..
5 #### small . great fit for my 14 lb papillon . dogs with wider heads may have trouble fitting into the neck hole of this style as it is not adjustable . she likes it . bright . sturdy . shows well on a furry dog .
5 #### Perfect ! I went back and forth on the sizing and finally ordered a large for my 45 pound lab / border collie mix . Smaller would have been way too small . The large perfectly fits anything small lab , border collie , heeler or pitbull sized . If your dog is anything around that size make sure to get the large !
4 #### I like this harness however the metal clip of my dog 's leash comes unclipped from the top of the harness very easily . All I have to do is move slightly to the side and the metal clip slips right off which could definitely be quite dangerous for some dogs that would run off if unhooked . Luckily my dog stays with me when I unhook her so it 's not as big of a deal for me . I also prefer to leash her collar anyway . I mostly got this to ward off people who insist on petting my fearful dog despite her alarm barks .
5 #### great looking harness my dog really stands out when out on walks . my dog gets nervous and will try to run away from approaching people or kids who try to pet him without permission so I hope this harness will help . ( my dog after a swim in the lake picture with the harness )
5 #### Just perfect ! I got the green " friendly " harness in small for my Jack - Russel / Rat Terrier mix and it fits her perfectly . It 's bright , well made , and enough padding that she is comfy in it . Unlike the other 2 I ordered , this one has a ring on the harness at the back and on the front too . Really worked out great for my needs , I only wish they had one that was for seizures-- but this will let people know it 's safe to approach her to read her dog ID tag which does alert that she has seizures , is on medication , and not to feed her . Very happy with my purchase . I also got the blind dog ( white ) and nervous dog ( yellow ) . Very happy with all three . My dogs are all different sizes from 10 lbs to 20 and different heights , neck and girth , but the small fit all 3 beautifully . I 'm delighted with the purchase and glad I decided to splurge on these and the matching collars . Even my nervous dog who refuses to move if you try to put anything on her is comfy in her new halter and really does n't seem to mind wearing it at all !
5 #### I have three rescue dogs ; one of which is actually friendly ! I bought the small green friendly harness for my 15 pound Pekingese and the small red caution for my 12 pound Pekingese mix . The small is adjustable and fits My heavier dog perfectly !
5 #### Great collar . Now I do n't feel I have to explain about my Swee ' Pea every time we go out !
2 #### THE PLASTIC SNAP IS TOO LARGE - TOO BIG FOR A LITTLE DOG LIKE MY SHI TZU MAY BE OK FOR A LARGE DOG ... NOT A LITTLE ONE .
4 #### The quality , color , and so forth are fine . The collar size seems to run big though . By the time I adjusted it the word was obscured . Not a big deal for me since I got the matching harness , but if I were relying only on the collar the purpose would be lost with only the partial wording showing . Otherwise quite happy with the items . A size extra small would be a fine option . The three small collars I bought were for a Jack Russel / Rat Terrier mix ( 20 lbs ) , a Rat Terrier ( 15 lbs ) , and a Rat Terrier ( 10 lbs ) ... all different heights , sizes , weights-- still the collar was even too big for the largest of the three without obscuring the embroidered wording . I 'm happy with the quality though and only regret the way the wording worked out .
2 #### sizing is WAY off , I ca n't make it small enough for my 18 lb American Eskimo . did n't try to return it as I had already taken it out of the package and adjusted everything and had him walk in it a little bit . it sits in a bag , will probably send it to one of my favorite rescue groups to give to another foster dog .
5 #### Fantastic ! My dog was n't accustomed to walking on a leash before I adopted him . After a couple of days on the harness , Logan loves walking beside me in my power wheelchair .
5 #### I bought this because I train my dog in public places ( park and sidewalk ) and this harness really does the trick so he would not be disturbed by other people with or without dogs during his training . The shipping was fast and it came exactly as described .
4 #### it fits a little tight around her neck and there is no adjusting . But it is just as pictured and came right on time
5 #### I have purchased a couple of these as dogs have grown . It has cut down people trying to interact with them during training .
3 #### I 'm giving this harness three stars because the neck is not adjustable . It slips over the head leaving no room for growth . I bought the small for my puppy as he is in training . It fits well right now and is comfortable , but it will not work for him in another month or two as the neck is one piece without any adjustment . The material is durable and if you are buying this for a full grown dog , it will work well for you . Thank you .
5 #### I LOVE this product ! We have a newly adopted Plott Hound and she is a bit intimidating to some . She has a big bark and unique coloring and has some anxiety while approaching other dogs . With this harness people have been much more accommodating in their reactions to her behavior as we work with her in public since the harness makes the message clear that she is in the midst of a learning process . It has also deterred people from barreling right up to pet her without asking which has made it much easier on us as owners to be able to introduce her to people slowly . I do n't clip a leash to this harness so I ca n't attest to it 's performance in that area , but my dog has been able to wear this for 5 - mile walks with no chafing or overheating . Solid purchase !
5 #### no problems with item or order . works as expected .
5 #### Kept looking for a Vest that said , " Adopt me " for my foster dog and I thought that I would try this harness instead . It is well made . Soft . Thicker than expected . Easy to adjust . It did the job and she got adopted by an amazing family just a few weeks later ! I am going to buy these in every size for future pooches !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R1G38629NQK08W " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91%2Bzb - Sh8 - S.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/81qNivUCo6S.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Great quality , easy to put on , adjust & remove . Brightly colored . The " adopt me " text is easy to read . Runs small . Medium fits a large cat sized animal ( see video ) . Large fits a medium dog or largish dog with a small head , but not a typical large dog ( too small for an English Bulldog 's head , for example ) . The collar is not adjustable , but the chest belt is .
4 #### Very easy to get on a wiggly dog . A bit cheaply made . I would n't trust it on a strong puller despite the adjustable fit . Still , a great way to draw attention to foster dogs !
5 #### Super cute harness ! It seems comfortable for my foster pup . I will continue to use this for future puppies . I just bought the blue training harness for my personal dog . I think these are great ! !
5 #### I have only used this on my pup three times thus far but wow what a difference it makes when it comes to keeping my pup focused on training . It repels most people ( and their kids ! ) from approaching or making any sort of contact with my dog and this helps reduce distractions for him . This vest seems to train others ( including myself ) besides my dog in regards to keeping space between their dogmas my dog that are unknown to each other . The vest I got for my pup is small and is adjusted to its smallest fitting leaving enough space for him to grow into . He is about 15 inches in height and weights 13.5 lbs . My pup only wears this to train not to play or rough house in so I am hoping it will last a good while . It is " over the head " to get on but there is plenty of room that my pup is not freighten to put it on . There is a loop on the back and also on the chest . It is a good looking vest and has become very handy in training my rambunctious terroir pup .
4 #### Nice harness ... Wish it came in a bigger size other than medium because my puppy American Bulldog has almost grown out of it already .
4 #### too big for my chi . Product was nice though .
3 #### I foster dogs and volunteer for a rescue . This is okay if you put it on when the dog is wearing a shirt . I only use this at adoption events and dogs get very excited at events . It rubbed one of the dogs armpit and made it bleed . I use slip leads and was n't this as a harness .
5 #### Great visibility and it stood up to a half wild puppy who did NOT want to have a harness on .
3 #### It 's a very cute and eye catching product however it 's not durable . I had a Catahoula in the medium sized one and it ripped on the seam within 30 minutes of wearing it . I had to put an Easy Walk harness on as well to keep control of the dog .
5 #### This great product for the price . I have a 4 month old lab pup that is being socialized in public for service dog work . It holds up pretty well . The Rings are good size and sown well . The mess is light weight . The plastic closure is solid as well . I like having a ring on top of his back as well as on the front for tags . I will buy another one in medium for later use . Also the material does stretch and give , so for us a longer wear time .
2 #### Fell apart quickly . Halter fits loosely so it rotates on my small pup . Training connection ring in front trips my dog because she is so short . Good idea . Bad execution . Better than using her collar because she chokes less when she pulls on the leash . The mesh part ripped away from the edging .
1 #### Ordered a small but it was too small . Would have cost more to return it . I wish there was sizing information before I order .
5 #### Pretty good but runs a little big . Wish i d got an X - small for my 4 month old maltese mix
4 #### I have been using this , it is my foster puppies first harness . IT works well , the lettering " Adopt me " seems to be a little too close together . People miss read it all the time .
5 #### This worked great for a foster who could not wear a collar .
3 #### Harness was way too small . Measurement not correct on website
4 #### The bright yellow grabs attention along with the dark contrast of the letters . As far as the vest is concerned , it feels a bit weak and I do n't feel that they would last long if used extensively . I have donated a few to a shelter where I volunteer . For dogs that pull strong , I either use a stronger vest along with this one for advertising , or along with a choke chain . In either case , I do n't rely on the vests loop unless you have a very well behaved dog or one that is very small .
4 #### Good quality harness just wish they had s color selection .
4 #### Nice quality fits a number of body styles . Just wish it came on other colors .
4 #### Price Ehe . Potential adopter publicity priceless . Fit 's as expected . Cleans up well after a beach day with a mild dish soap .
5 #### Purchased for my foster dog to wear at adoption events . Great price and well made . Medium is perfect for 16 lb Pomeranian .
4 #### The neckline is a little too loose . It is elasticised , but when Buffy pulled on the leash , I thought it might come off .
5 #### I tell my blind dog to get ready to tell the world you are blind and he knows we 're going for a walk or a stroller ride ! He LOVES this on his body . The mesh material breaths well and if fits perfect ! He feels much more secure in it and when it 's on him , he knows it 's park time ! The leash it comes with keeps him close to me and it gives him a great deal of confidence ! He trusts walks MUCH more since I bought this .... And this is my second ! It 's been quite the asset in re - training him ! My only wish is MAKE IT IN MORE COLORS ! ! ! WHITE GETS DIRTY ! ! Give a blind dog owner some choices !
4 #### UPDATE 12/7/17 : Despite complaints from others that the harness starts fraying , mine has n't . Of course , being white , it needs frequent washing because the wood floors at my office are always dirty from the foot traffic in and out from our warehouse . I want to buy another one so that Harley has a spare to wear while one is being washed . ( I usually have to wait several days to pile up enough bleachable whites to make a small load . Also , he seems perfectly comfortable wearing it all day ( as my semi - retired service dog , he has had years of wearing a vest backpack ; I 'm sure that the harness is more comfortable . Runs on the small side so you need to follow the measurement guide provided . I ordered a Small for my 22 lb slender - built cattle dog mix but the collar part that goes over the head was way too small . I returned it and ordered the medium , which fits him much better . The only improvement would be to pad the nylon webbing straps to prevent rubbing . Harley goes to work with me every day and he gets around so well that people forget he 's blind . I 'm hoping this harness will help remind people that he ca n't see them .
4 #### This collar was very helpful when walking my elderly dog who became suddenly blind . It clearly alerted other dog walkers to keep their dog away , rather than make the usual social contact . It was relatively easy to put on and take off . If your dog is blind , this will help them not be frightened by contact they can not see coming .
4 #### This harness fits wonderfully . I bought a couple to give them a chance to see if the other would have held up better . I would have given it 5 stars , but they 've cut the fabric too close to the stitching line so it ends up tearing out . If this was corrected , it would rate 5 stars
5 #### My cairn terrier lost his eyes to glaucoma . I purchased this product shortly thereafter , and it has been very helpful to him and me as we make the transition to living with blindness . My dog feels secure in this harness , and I love that it so boldly advertises his condition to other dog walkers . I got a medium for my slightly plump aged cairn , and it fits perfectly . It has been very durable . I just ordered another so that I can switch them out to wash . That shows how highly I regard this product .
5 #### Well made . Recommend . Medium is like an extra large on my 8 pound chihuahua .
5 #### We bought it for our blind dog that runs on our farm so visitors will know she is blind and to watch out for her !
5 #### This harness is the sturdiest of all the harnesses I 've seen . It fits her snugly and durable . The plastic clasp is durable , easy to snap and unsnap . I would recommend this to anyone needing a way to identify a blind dog .
2 #### We ordered this and an adopt me harness . Both are well made . Fast shipping . Updating this and I meant to months ago . Within a week of buying the harness started to fray . I emailed the seller and never got s response . The harness is usable but really frayed and worn looking . It 's frayed so bad after 5 months of minimal use I went online for another and hope it is better made .
5 #### Just perfect ! I got three different colors / words all in the small for my Jack - Russel / Rat Terrier mix and my two Rat Terriers . They fit all three perfectly . It 's bright , well made , and enough padding that they comfy in it . Unlike the other 2 I ordered , the green " friendly " one has a ring on the harness at the back and on the front too . The yellow and white only have d - rings on the back . Really worked out great for my needs . Very happy with my purchase . My dogs are all different sizes from 10 lbs to 20 and different heights , neck and girth , but the small fit all 3 beautifully . I 'm delighted with the purchase and glad I decided to splurge on these and the matching collars . Even my nervous dog who refuses to move if you try to put anything on her is comfy in her new halter and really does n't seem to mind wearing it at all !
5 #### We had been using the " blind dog " leash . Decided to add the vest because many people did n't notice the leash .
5 #### Helps with people coming up and scaring her as they see in advance that she is blind .
5 #### This has worked like a charm ! No more mothers allowing their small kids to just run at my caution girl !
5 #### The Caution harness is exactly what I was looking for . My dog is very timid when people are around . Most people approach dogs without asking and this is the perfect way to let people know they should proceed with " caution " . The letters are big and noticeable , exactly what I was looking for !
5 #### I bought this harness for my 10 pound , very small mini schnauzer . She is very cute , but not friendly to strangers , and I wanted a way of warning people not to not just reach down and pet her . This harness seems to do the trick , even if they do think it is a joke . It fits her very comfortably , and does n't rub anywhere , and sometimes she just wears it around . I keep it somewhat loose because of her longer fur on the bottom , but she has n't managed to slip it , and believe me when she sees a rabbit she tries . It is easy to put on , the head slips into the opening , and one arm goes through an arm hole , then the rest of it snaps snuggly around the chest . This is great because she gets over excited and struggling with other harnesses I have had was very challenging .
3 #### Needs to be made much , MUCH bigger for dogs with long hair and then of course the words need to be made much bigger TOO ! ! No one 's going to see it from a distance , esp . from behind --and not the front either-- when dogs with short legs and long hair are walking .
5 #### I feel much more comfortable forewarning people my dog has issues . The harness is of great quality as well .
5 #### I have a 10 pound Pekingese mix - the small harness could be adjusted to fit her tiny little body . I feel an XS would be a better fit but this will do the trick . I love the caution label .... Hoping it will prevent any unwanted attention and explains that my dogs are rescues and are more scared and nervous than friendly to people and other dogs .
5 #### Feeling much better about walking my dog ! These warning harnesses are such a good idea .
2 #### i have 4 dogs and 3 currently have the Soresto collar . 2 of the dogs seem to be tick free , but still have fleas which have migrated to their rear end ( the farthest point from the collar ) . the 3rd dog has both fleas and an occasional tick . , the last tick i found was up by the ears . all 3 dogs were bathed and gone over to make sure there were no fleas or ticks on them prior to putting the collar on . the 4th dog , ( who is nursing puppies ) currently has no type of medication or flea collar and ironically is flea and tick free .....
5 #### My dog was suffering from fleas due to a stray cat ... 24 hours and this had them all gone .... no more fleas or ticks . Unlock drops or pills this is 8 months and I can remove it to end it if it made my dog sick . Ca nt undo a pill or drops , and none of them last 8 months like this . Well worth the money .
5 #### great price if you subscribe , same price as most places other wise . Make sure and leave the recommended room so the meds do n't irritate the dogs skin . Works 6 - 8 months depending on your dogs activity with water or baths
5 #### best product ever for ticks and fleas . Warning , it did make my friend 's dog quite ill , so beware . I have not had any problems with 3 of my dogs . Glad I found this on a deal , cuz the price can be high
4 #### Almost at the six month mark and no tics or fleas .
5 #### This seems to work great on my dog . No more scratching problems .
2 #### It only took a week until our lab had managed to scratch his collar off and now I have no protection for him . And I am out all that money . I guess I will go back to Frontline . I never had this problem with the other tick collar I used to use but they quit making it . Very disappointed . I followed the instructions exactly when putting it on .
5 #### It works on my thick , heavy coated , medium 50 # sized dog . Second purchase for us , because the first one worked so well . Also use the small for our 7 # dog . No sickness or problems of any kind . Grateful to have found them . We replaced the first round at 8 months . Have nt seen a flee for almost a year .
5 #### This collar is by far the best . I one time used Hartz brand flea and tick killer and my dog got so sick . This keeps the fleas and ticks away and lasts for so long . Ill never use anything else .
5 #### Do your dog a favor and purchase this collar ! ! It lasts 8 months and in the two years we 've purchased the collar our dog has bee flea and tick free ! ! No monthly application messes !
5 #### Straight forward instructions easy to place on my dogs
5 #### This seems to work well for our big dog . Apparently , it 's activated by movement . Has taken care of fleas all summer last year , so we bought another .
5 #### I use these collars every year and they are fantastic . I have two large dogs ( Weimaraners ) that love to be outside and I have never seen a single tick or flea on them since I began using these . The collars also have never irritated their skin . I do make sure they do not get very wet .
5 #### I bought this on the advice of my vet . The fleas in my area ( eastern North Carolina ) are apparently resistant to Frontline and other medications which use the same active ingredients , so even though I was treating her regularly with a topical , my dog got fleas at doggy daycare . After treating her with Capstar , a fast acting and effective but short term oral flea medication , I put this on her and we have n't seen any fleas since . I like that it lasts so long and I will definitely purchase this again .
5 #### Assuming this works as described , it feels like a winner to me . I just put them on two dogs who spend a good amount of time outside . For eight months of coverage , the price of this plus a heartworm med is very favorable over Revolution . It works very well , but I hate the chemical odor and the greasy feel of their coats , and I 'm not nuts about the price tag of Revolution .
2 #### Chose to return and go back to Trifexis and a tick puller . I did n't use it but the people at the dog park I go to say it only lasts about 5 months .
1 #### Bought this collar for my 1 yr old 65 lb Blue Heeler from a local pet store . Put it on him at noon yesterday 4/29/2018 .. by 9 am today 4/30/2018 he was sluggish and lathargic . Not playing ball or with his other fur brothers . Not himself at all .. only thing that had changed and new is this damn collar . Took it off him immediatly and 8 hours later he is back to his normal self
5 #### Held off getting one of these because we were afraid of the chemicals . After our dog contracted lyme ( we live in one of the worst states ) we realized checking her everyday and using the behind the scruff drops was not enough . This collar works fantastic , even if a tick gets on her it shrinks and dies seemingly right away If you live in a bad state ( PA for us ) , and have a long haired dog ( GSD ) this might be a must have
5 #### I buy these every year here and they have always preformed really well with our yard being a flea haven and all .
1 #### do not use , we used on our Italian Mastiff and she died 3 months later . After we put in on her , she got sick diarrhea / vomiting and severe weight loss . Only thing that was changed was we used the collar . Vet said she could n't find out what was wrong but dog had to be put down .
5 #### Wow , works wonderfully . I recently moved from a non tick area to the hills in Tennessee , and as soon as it stopped snowing the ticks came out . Even though I have my dog on vet prescribed once a month flea , tick , heartworm etc she still was coming in with TICKS . Second day after I put this collar on her .... no more ticks . I do watch her closely for any adverse effects as other posters have mentioned , but all is good . Love this collar ! ! !
5 #### These collars work very well on our Great Pyrenees dogs . I worried that fleas or ticks might be able to hide in their heavy fur , but not when they 're wearing a Seresto collar ! It 's been eight months , and no sign of anything , and our area is full of ticks ! I ordered more collars for this year !
4 #### This was our first time using Seresto with our two goldendoodles . We ve used other products such as frontline and K9 Advantix but did n't like the topical treatment and the way it leaves their coat greasy . So far we really like the collar . Although we did find a tick near my dogs eye about two weeks after we started them with the collar ! We will continue to use the collar . It was recommended by our vet as well !
3 #### Ended up not using because I read the small print that they should n't sleep in your bed with this . Finding a better way .
5 #### Have used on my dog for years and it works well .
5 #### My bulldog loves it I guess he 's not scratching anymore
5 #### I travel with my horses and dog . We go into tick and flea territory . I can honestly say since using this collar the last two years my dog has remained flea and tick free
5 #### These are the best . I was skeptical about using a collar style rather than the liquid . But I 'm on my second set of collars and find nothing on 2 very active outside farm dogs . Worth every penny .
1 #### My healthy 6 year old dog was shaking from head to toe 6 hours after applying . He was not cold , we have never seen him do this , just laying on the couch his whole body shaking . Took the collar of immediately . Issue resolved and had not returned . I 've since read that this collar can cause seizures . We want nothing to do with this product ! !
5 #### These collars work great on our pets and we have no flea problems at all .
1 #### We used this collar for our Australian Shepherd and found ticks on her constantly . One was even right underneath the collar ! Thankfully , we do n't live in an area where tick 's that carry Lyme disease are prevalent , because she 'd probably have Lyme ! These collars should be recalled .
5 #### The Commercial sums it up quite well ! Works great month 1 ! ! !
5 #### Great adjustable length for growing 5 - months old puppy . 1/3 less the price than at the vets office ... go Amazon Prime !
5 #### Works well . This is my 2nd year with these and I have not seen a flea . Topicals had stopped working for me after many years .
5 #### Really worked last year . 2 dogs 2 cats on open pasture to loafer means bad flea and a few ticks non stop . Drops on neck worked 2 weeks if lucky . The dog dose and cat ingredents are the same and same amount . So I get 2 large and cut in 1/2 used on dog and 1 cat . The other 2 cats get 1/2 each . I had given up hope on stopping fleas former Chihuahua breeder and past shower . I had gone through any medicine made for fleas . Nothing worked till Adnantage by Bayer . It worked 5 years till fleas mutated . Seresto is same maker . And it kicked flea rear . My cats go through our pasture and 2 others with woods near hunting mice . 2 are Huge Main Coon nutered . The other a 1/2 MC and persian so slower and more lazy So no suprise birds . Just a few mice a week . And THANK YOU BAYER no fleas .
1 #### We have n't even had the collar for one month and lost it . I am 100 % sure that I put it on the right way but it still fell off ( and got very lose ) a couple of times . I never attempted to take it off myself , neither did my dog . We live in an apartment and only have one dog , so he does n't have a crazy life where he is likely to lose it . I am just SUPER sad and disappointed because I heard good things about the collar and did not even get one full out of 8 months worth it . Also , it 's like losing 70 $ on the street , which hurts as a college student .
5 #### The only brand that had worked for my dog so far , poor thing is allergic to fleas and breaks out .
1 #### It did n't even last 2 days on my dog , the collar snapped and my dog chewed it up :( I did n't get a chance to even test it out .
5 #### I have been using the Seresto collar for about 4 years now on my lab . Great results . Keeps ticks away
3 #### I bought this one from Amazon in December , 2017 . At the end of January , I put on it on my dog Icee and ... so far it 's working as the label indicated which I am really HAPPY about . It 's expensive , but I feel if it last three or four months , I 'm ahead of the game , cost wise . The reason I did n't give it more then 3 stars is because ... I bought another one for my other dog Miles , same brand name but from a major pet store not to far from me . This one I 'm struggling to get thru it 's second month . Pretty pricey for two months protection ... wished I still had the receipt for it . Nice thing about buying from Amazon , is that they have records of your orders which eliminates that problem .
5 #### I have been using these collars for just about a year and a half . My one dog really really hated the drop type flea and tick . i would put it on him and he would avoid me for days . Whatever it was he really hated it . So to that end i would not always give him the drops or i would forget . He spends a lot of time out side and has had flea and tick issues in the past . BUT not in the last 2 years that i have been using these collars . He does nt mind at all and has had no adverse reactions . People were also concerned about human exposure to the chemicals in the collars .... we have had no issues . Both of my dogs sleep in the bed and they both have the exact same collar . We have had ZERO issues . My female did show a little redness on her neck when i first put the collar on her but that went away fairly quickly . Now there are no issues . These appear to work as advertised and I am satisfied with the product .
1 #### Did n't work for my dog ! I do n't know why but it made NO difference with our flea problem . A waste of money totally !
5 #### Our three labs have them on and so far so good ! One has had his on for about a month and the other two only days but it is beginning to be flea and tick season and we want them to be protected early . The one who has had his for a month does not have any flea dirt , fleas or ticks and we check him all the time . We have also looked for any skin reactions and there are none on any of them . We are very happy with this product and price wise , it 's a good deal since it will last up to 8 months
5 #### These have worked really well for my 2 dogs and I do n't think I 'd switch back to the liquid version ever . The collar is easy to put on , you do n't need to remember monthly and it lasts all the warm / flea / tick season months . I put them on early - mid spring and leave them on right into winter and they have not had a single bug since they 've worn them . They go swimming / paddle boarding with me and they get bathed usually once or twice a month with no issue .
5 #### Yes , it is pricey . But it is worth every penny . It is the most effective flea and tick product out there and lasts at least eight months as advertised .
5 #### These are amazing . We battled fleas and even with treating the yard and house each month as well as the animal we still had fleas . Tried the collar on one dog and no fleas . Now all the dogs and indoor cats have them on and after a full year of use we have not had to treat the house or yard after about the third month . Well worth the investment . No issues with senior dogs ( ages 2 years to 17 years ) and cats ( 20 and 17 years ) .
5 #### Put one on my Golden every 6 months . Keeps the bugs off him .
5 #### Love this collar for my dogs and 1 cat . They had no negative reactions . All I say is when you put it on them just take notice of any behavioural changes , like over scratching at the neck or lethargy . My other cat could n't wear one because she constantly tried to chew the collar off , so it was the liquid form for her .
5 #### We have a lot of ticks and this collar really works ! High recommend it !
5 #### i have been using these for several years . these are the best flea and tick collar i have ever seen ! ! !
5 #### one for the dog , one for the cat , no problems , no fleas almost a month now , very satisfied so far .
5 #### 2nd time I 've purchased ... Last season did n't see a single flea or tick on my dog . I will continue to buy again
5 #### My Great Pyrenees has been wearing these year round for about 5 years . I only replace the collar once a year , when Spring is around the corner and then leave it on her for 8 months , remove it or leave it on . My Pyr has incredibly sensitive skin and every year before this she got hot spots which i believe were in combination with getting fleas , even if only a few bites . She has n't had fleas since i got her on this collar . She is a total furball , and the collar sits just under her tagged collar , so its not noticable and she has never acted anything but indifferent to the whole experience .
5 #### No fleas . Maybe it works . Always did for my cats . Dog scratches less too .
5 #### this works ... although there is a concern for an allergic reaction ... as always you need to watch . i like this better than front line and advantix . this is our second year using this product
5 #### We 've used these for a few years now and they actually work great . My cats kept getting bad fleas from the outdoor dogs , and it seemed like no amount of topical treatments would work . Once the collars went on all 4 animals , no more fleas or ticks . Our vet recommended these , but said to keep them dry , because once wet their potency is drastically reduced .
5 #### This is the 3rd year I 've gone with a Seresto collar . The last 2 years they have performed flawlessly - no ticks , and around here many dogs get Lyme disease .
5 #### This collar has eliminated our flea problem after years of vacuuming and skin treatment falling short . Even stopped treating my cat for the cold season . I do worry about the chemicals , however ! I recommend this product and always washing hands after touching your furry companion .
5 #### I ve been using these collars for a few years now on my lab and coonhound , and they 're very effective , durable and long - lasting . For us , its a much better product than the back applicators ... I do n't have to worry about them rubbing themselves on the furniture or carpet to get it off .
5 #### 8 months is a good time for this collar to work ... will check it often .. actually will check the dog often ... thanks
5 #### We have three small dogs and one large dog , and this makes the third time I ve ordered a Seresto collar for them to protect them from fleas and ticks . These collars really work ! In the 2 1/2 years we ve been using these collars we have not seen the first flea or tick on ANY of our dogs . We have a grandbaby that is now crawling around our house and its even more important now than its ever been , if I did n't know for certain that these collars were great I would nt take the chance . They have no odor to them , they 're not greasy , they do n't irritate my pets skin or fur . And I can put them on and forget about them for the full eight months . And they do truly last the full eight months .. I ve replaced these exactly on the eight month anniversary each time and they 're still working great every time .. Ill be back in eight more months to buy again !
5 #### My 10 yr old " doodle " has used this for 2 years and had NO TICKS OR FLEAS .... period . Our new puppy , 4 months old is going to use this one . After clearing it with the vet . I told him of the very good results with my first dog and he said the puppy can use it as well . OK . But both MUST HAVE HEARTGUARD because it does not protect the dog from heart worm disease .
1 #### I 'm sure that for some dogs this works great . My dog had a severe allergic reaction to it . Her face swelled up . Vet bills . I removed and threw away the collar immediately , and Amazon was kind enough to refund me the full amount paid . Just thought I 'd let people know of the possibility .
1 #### Fortunately for my cat , I took this off when I saw her with very low energy level and came here to read the reviews . I purchased one for my dog and took it off after 1 week ! OMG this company is evil . Bayer also make chemicals that kill honey bees . They do n't care about your pets ; they just want to make money .
5 #### Only one the local SPCA will use for good reason .
5 #### These seem to be doing what they are intended to do , Great ! ! .
5 #### This has worked great ! I have had it on my dog since Oct and have n't seen a bug on him .
5 #### Best defense against fleas & ticks , works for a long time & well worth the money
5 #### Have used these protective collars on our two dogs with great success for the past four years . They will continue to be our preferred protection system .
5 #### The Seresto collar has worked great . I use on my dogs and no longer have fleas spreading to my indoor cats or anywhere else in my home . I think this ends up being cheaper and more effective than other topical liquid products . I put them on dogs a little looser and then remove for baths . The collars have lasted the full eight months for me with issue . I have recommended to others who also were impressed with product .
5 #### I am a repeat user of this excellent product !
5 #### So far great . No rashes . Dog is n't reacting to it . Have n't seen a single flea or tick on him thus far and I live in a high deer tick area . Definitely will buy again
5 #### My vet recommended this due to frequent ticks . So far , I know still winter and cold , its been good . I ve had it on for 1 month , fits my 55 pound bulldog just fine , not irritating , no residues , no smell , no fleas , or ticks seen . Updates as months of hot weather approach .
3 #### While it works , it works well . However , Soresto eight months goes by very quickly ... like in six months . I noticed my dog scratching and biting her butt six months into my first Soresto collar . It was definitely flea activity . I replaced it with another Soresto collar . Now , this one has lasted six months and we are seeing no flea activity , but .. IT 'S MARCH . Pretty sure I could put her out , bare - fur naked with no collar and a advertisement for a flea circus and she 'd have no fleas . Still , it does work while it works and it is one of the least expensive , safe options for flea and tick treatment .
5 #### My dogs wore these last year spring to fall and not one tick or flea found . He Little refector clips are a nice bonus .
5 #### I 've been using for 2 years now . It says it lasts 8 months but I get a year out of them . Excellent collar . Does not leave a film on the dogs neck or body . No powder , or smell . Very effective with ticks and fleas . I live in the Northeast and my backyard is loaded with ticks but they stay clear of my dogs with this collar .
5 #### This collar works brilliantly . I live in the woods where there are a lot of deer tics . My dog does n't have any on him whilst he has this collar on . No side effects . Great Price esp for one that actually lasts this long . Just take off when bathing your pup and it will last the time it states .
5 #### Love how this color works ! I order this last year and my dog who is 60lbs never got a tick on her ! I ordered it again for this year ! Thank you for an awesome product !
5 #### ever since they came out i ve brought one for my 5yr old fur baby they are wounderful she s never ever had fleas or ticks the soresto is the best thing Bayer has made for cats and dogs definatly worth it They Work ! !
5 #### I 'm not happy that the price went up $ 10 since last year , but these collars are still well worth it , and considering I only buy them once a year I ca n't complain . I live on 80 wooded acres and the ticks are horrible . I buy one of these collars for each of my dogs at the end of winter and they are tick free all year . When we first moved here we tried every brand of drops available and they did n't work . These really work . If only I could find something that worked as well for humans .
5 #### Summer of 2017 I had the worst experience with fleas . I live in Pennsylvania and I was treating my house weekly . I spent and wasted so much money on treatments , bombs , sprays , etc . Not anymore . These collars are expensive , but worth it . People have talked about their dogs getting rashes from the collars but my Australian Shepherd has no issues . His breeder uses them on her dogs too and no issues so I 'm not sure if maybe the dogs having this problem had sensitive skin or what but the collar caused no problems for my dog or cats .
3 #### I have to use two at the same time on my Great Pyrenees I add new collars every 4 months and throw away the oldest of the two . Before I started doing that , the fleas congregated on their tails ..
1 #### Worthless ! I was so disappointed and worse I let my dogs suffer for over a month on the off chance it would start to work . I am one guilty furbaby mom :( ... do n't waste your money
5 #### This is the second Seresto flee collar I ve bought for a dog with thick hair . None of the topical flee meds have worked this thick haired dog but the Seresto gives him peace from flees .
5 #### This was the only flea treatment that worked this past year , and fast . I was nervous after reading some horror stories but we had a lot of luck with it and no problems . It does n't have the gross smell of the white flea collars , which is also a bonus .
1 #### All this is a dipped plastic in chemicals . It just protects the neck area , gave my bulldog a rash .
5 #### Works great . I like that I do n't have to feed my dog a dangerous pill . My dog used to always get ticks and he has n't had one since I bought this collar . It actually repels them . It is amazing
5 #### I have a 55 lb dog with a very thick coat . We live in FL . We adopted her from our local shelter . She loves to lay in the grass . Unfortunately there are fleas in the grass . I bathed her with the Dawn vinegar and water mixture but that was just a temporary fix . This collar actually works ! This is our second collar . Very happy with the product .
3 #### This collar worked great but my bulldog developed an allergy to it and a rash formed around his neck where the collar lay on his skin and his hair fell out in a perfect circle . I loosened it hoping that would help but it did nt . I do n't recall seeing him scratch at it or showed signs of irritation . I was so bummed because they are expensive and we did n't get a chance to finish the collars effective time frame . On to something else .
1 #### I put this collar on my dog yesterday and today I found 2 ticks on her ! I am surprised at all of the positive responses . And I am shocked that I paid over $ 50 for this collar . What a waste ! If I spray my dog with tick repellant it works , but this collar is a joke . I am not happy about what I paid , I had high hopes .
5 #### SUPER expensive , but it works . Without it , I was picking 30 ticks off doggie . Now she comes home with one or two .
5 #### This is my 3Rd year . We live in tickville . My dogs were diagnosed with a tick illness ( not lyme ) it causes red blood cell problems and bleeding . Almost lost one of them . After they recovered , we bought these . Have not found any ticks on them and we test yearly for tick diseases . None have been found ! Love these . My dogs are Golden Retrievers , 5 and 11 years old .
5 #### So far I have never seen a tick or flea even at the 8 month point .
5 #### This is the only thing that works on the bizarre critters in my wooded / lawned yard . I use one on one of the pets and it seems to keep pests away from all three pets . I picked the dog to put the collar on vs one of the two kitties because she 's badly allergic to flea bites . Even though she 's got stupid sensitive skin , it does n't seem to bother her at all . I had it on for a full month and took it off easier than I thought it would come off to give her a bath . Cons : okay I 'll just say it , it 's pretty ugly . It also hangs weirdly and not near her collar , I 'll probably try to figure out a way to attach it to her actual collar . Also it needs to be removed once monthly for her grooming and bath so I have no idea if pulling it apart every time will make it weaker or what . It sort of attaches like a really weak zip tie .
2 #### This is my third time buying Seresto collars . They worked extremely well the first two times , but did n't work this time . I ended up buying Capstar
4 #### I think its impssible for anything to work 100 % but noticed less ticks on my dog with this and great price
5 #### Last summer was flea city and we tried everything to get rid of them . Bug bombs , foggers , every other flea collar known to man , flew baths , exterminator , any home pest treatment you could imagine , and the only thing that worked was putting this on my pup . Only then would they stop coming in on her . It was night and day . Unfortunately , that would be my pup 's final summer with me and I 'm glad she got to spend the majority of it rolling around in the back yard without having to spend hours itching afterward .
5 #### These work so much better than the application types . Never found a tick on my two dogs since we got these .
5 #### Works well on my German Shepherd dog , lasts 8 months . My vet recommended this product .
5 #### Very reliable tick and flea prevention . I have a small dog so I buy the extra large size and get two collars out of it . I wrap the second one well and place back in container , because these are pretty expensive . Have already done once . It did n't hurt my dog and it still worked after being stored .
1 #### I was really hoping I had found something that would finally work to kill my dogs fleas . I have tried topical with no results and decided to do rit this collar . Its been almost 3 days and my dogs still have fleas and still scratching like crazy . I had to actually take off one dog b cause she got a rash from the collar . Looks like I will have to go to the vet and get a oral prescription pill since those always worked in my the past but not easy to administer . Seems like this product works great for some people but I was not one of those lucky ones .
5 #### Great Product . After using the popular brands of drops on the back of my dog , I found ticks on my two dogs daily - it was obviously time for a change . My vet and local pet shop suggested either pills or this collar . I prefered the collar . It is a superb product . Lasts 8 months ( my Vet told me 6 to be safe ) and really works . I would highly recommend .
2 #### After a couple of months , did not repel or kill ticks .
1 #### My dogs still have fleas two weeks after getting the collars . For the price , I wish I had just got Nexgard pills .
5 #### Have NEVER had a single flea while using this !
5 #### I use this on my dog and recommend it to EVERYONE . We live in NH which is pretty much a tick palace . One weekend I found 8 ticks on my dog in a single day . We bought this collar , put it on , and did n't see another tick for months . We occasionally see a dead one every now and then .
1 #### No idea how this gets any good reviews , bought one to test out on my two boxers , put it on one and can tell absolutely no difference in the amount of fleas they have . May have worked at one time but a totally waste of money . I would say not for dogs with serious flea exposures .
5 #### I have been using the collar on my Labrador for a year . Very happy with the performance of this collar . Did not have any issues with the dogs neck and did not bother her at all .
5 #### Kept the beasts off my buddy , have bought again .
5 #### These work great ! We used to pick a few ticks off the dogs after every walk , but once we put this on , they never got any . It lasts several months . Great product !
5 #### These is a great flea collar . It works . It keeps my dogs free of fleas
3 #### i think its working . i bought this product 4 months ago and returned it , but know I 'm trying again .
1 #### not working for large dog - still find fleas !
1 #### Massive reaction on our dog 's neck required veterinary care despite thick fur . Avoid . Would prefer to assign zero stars . Toxic as $ # @ ! .
5 #### One of the best purchases I 've ever made . Can not believe I 've spent money and wasted time on any other flea / tick meds . Bite the bullet and buy this collar , you wo n't regret it . I 've seen ZERO fleas ever since the first collar I bought 2 years ago and what little ticks I do see on my beagle ( who hunts and is outside / in the woods quite a bit ) are dead . Really took the worry out of flea and tick season for good !
5 #### Works great on all my dogs ! Flea free for months !
1 #### I purchased this for our new puppy and used it for several weeks prior to writing this review . This collar was recommended by a neighbor as an alternative to the flea combating liquid chemicals but we did not see any protection of fleas . I ended up purchasing advantage which is what I use on my cat and it was much better .
1 #### Bought these highly rated collars to use on my three dogs for tick control in Southern Arizona . All three dogs still had many ticks daily . Very disappointing considering the ratings and the cost factor . Gave up on collars and using Nexgard which is working very well to completely solve this problem .
5 #### This is the only thing that combats the fleas in my area , nothing else works ! Our indoor / outdoor cat tracks them in even in winter . Not even the vet prescribed stuff works . Our pup does n't do water so it lasts about 7 months on her before I notice a few fleas here and there . As soon as we change her collar the fleas disappear .
4 #### This is very economical and works very well - it kills all fleas . I have purchased it about 6 times and I am always impressed with the performance . Having said that , I have always had Great Danes with very short hair , but I recently got a Goldendoodle with very thick , curly , fur like a sheep . I put the collar on him and it has killed MOST of the fleas . He still has 6 or 8 a day that cluster right around his groin ( which is far away from the collar ) . I BELIEVE it is because the collar is not touching his neck because his fur is so thick . Therefore 4 stars instead of 5 . I am contemplating shaving a channel in the hair on his neck so the collar will fit better , but that will look weird ...
4 #### So far so good . Almost a month on my dog and I still see a flea or two a day . Has helped tremendously though .
3 #### Okay seriously $ 50 does it really need to cost 1/2 a Benjamin to keep fleas off your dog it works but there are several other flea collors that work just as good for $ 3
5 #### It protected my 2 poodle mix dogs for 8 months and is still going strong . I will probably purchase again , but wish it was not so pricey .
5 #### Packaging written in French , but highest quality product , will never use anything else again !
5 #### I have used this for my 4 cats and one dog for the past 2 years never saw another flea and no side effects .
5 #### This is the only thing I 've tried that gets all the fleas and ticks from my dog . He stopped scratching and biting himself . From all the bad reviews I 've read , I thought this would have a bad reaction on my dog but it has n't happened .
5 #### I purchase this item for all my dogs . I would not trust anything else .
5 #### With a massive explosion of ticks this summer , I was pleased to find that none were on my dog with the use of Seresto . Last year we simply used K9 Advantix II each month and without fail , every month during those last 10 days before the next dose , we would find ticks on my dog 's face . No surprises this year- all ticks kept away from the Seresto collar . We did n't have an issue with fleas either . I 'm quite pleased ! Especially satisfied with the lack of smell that is usually associated with a recent application of topical preventative .
2 #### I ca nt even tell you how many ticks we found in my dog after a walk this summer . So many we did n't even want to take our dog hiking ( which is a hobby for us . ) We are n't due for a new collar until january and I m finding fleas . I ve made sure her collar is tight enough . It has n't been wet , but twice and very briefly ( approximately 1 - 2 mins . ) This is our 2nd or 3rd collar and this is the first one that s been horrible , but I m leary to even try it again !
3 #### I ordered this and there is a sticker in the package with the date 01/2015 . Not sure if this is when this collar was made or the expiration date . I put the collar on my dog and hopefully Ill know soon enough , as the fleas outside this time of year have been really bad . After every walk I end up finding one or two on her feet . I do like that the collar comes with reflectors you can attach for night walks . Hoping it works on the fleas though . I ve heard great things and my vet recommended it .
1 #### Product does not work , I used it as directed and my dog still got infested with fleas ...
5 #### I had looked at these before , just another flea collar . Well my Jake is a big shepherd , not easy to bathe ( I have a torn rotator cuff ) . Bathing did not seem to help the endless scratching , may have made it worse . I tried three different flea drops , no relief . Within three days of putting on the SERESTA collar , the scratching had STOPPED . We have noticed that BOTH cats have stopped scratching as well - we do not treat the cats .
2 #### Heard great things about these collars . Very disappointed . Very expensive and still found fleas on my dogs .
5 #### Have lots of dog clients . near beach / ocean there were some fleas tearing them up . neck / back flea treatments were not working / keeping up . this collar knocks them out shortly after they jump on . so yes works pretty great in flea infested locations . Retirement center standard poodle was having problems with fleas as well . internal and external applications were not able to keep up . this collar seems to be knocking them out .
2 #### I have bought these for years and this is the first year they did not work , but this is also the first year I bought them from Amazon . It makes me wonder if they were out of date or something ?
3 #### My dog reacted badly to this collar . After a few weeks , she was out - of - sorts , vomited ( she almost never does ) , fought with dogs at her daycare ( she never ever does ) and bit one of the staff ( NEVER bites humans , no matter what ) . So we took the collar off and she went back to her sweet self . Will give the collar to my daughter for her dog , who does well with it , but gets sick from Frontline , while we go back to Frontline .
1 #### I ordered 3 containers and they are mostly dust . Do not order .
3 #### My dog likes them but they really are n't worth the price .
3 #### My husky loved the treats , she has a sensitive stomach and tolerated this well with no upset tummy . Only complaint is that the tub was not even close to being full and very disappointing that there was so little amount of treats in the container . Will not repurchase due to the amount received for the price paid but no complaints on quality of treat .
5 #### My puppy loves these treats , our trainer calls it " puppy crack " ;)
5 #### I use this exclusively for training , my dog is attracted to the pleasant smell and loves the taste . Using this product I have trained our puppy to sit , lay down , stay , fetch , loose leash walking and on a treadmill in a much shorter time than I anticipated .
3 #### I ordered this thinking it was a bigger tub of treats - but it is tiny . Dogs love it , but really stinky !
2 #### I bought this to stuff into a bone puzzle . Problem is the pieces are of all different sizes . So , unless you are using this as a food extra to your dog 's regular meal , I would not bother . My dog did enjoy them .
5 #### My dog goes crazy for these ! He absolutely loves them . We are careful about what we feed him since he has had pancreatitis . He does fine on them . I cut the bigger pieces in half because he is a small dog . The crumbs I pour over his food !
5 #### The dogs say thanks for the quick delivery . I cut them up into bite size pieces to make them last longer .
4 #### This tub was ridiculously difficult to open - we felt like idiots trying to get it open . The pup liked the treats , but it made our hands stink even after washing them . On the fence about this one .
4 #### My dog ( maltese ) loves them . I do not buy them often because of price
4 #### Foxy the Pomeranian says this is one of her favorite treats A wonderful brand
4 #### This seems to be working on both my dogs teeth . I see an improvement and I 've only been using it for about 2 weeks .
2 #### and has quit a lot of plaque on her teeth . I think ingredients looks unsafe and will find something else that hopefully will give good results .
5 #### We mix this with our dog 's drinking water . It helps to soften the tartar build up so that when she chews on hard treats or bones , the tartar can easily scrape off . It also makes it easier for us to brush her teeth .
5 #### The java moss came in on time and was very green , no brown what s so ever . I love it ! ! ! ! Ca nt wait for it to grow !
5 #### My Macaw now has a perch she can sit and chew on . Will order more of these when she demolishes this one
5 #### I have 2 small perches for my Green Cheek Conure . One perch has 3 branches , the other is only a single branch . They 're the right size for her feet and look nicer than typical manufactured pole perches . She spends most of her in - cage time on one of these two perches . She likes to chew on them and rub against them after bathing in her water dish . lol
5 #### These perches are exactly what I was expecting . I got a variety of shapes . They are perfect for my finches flight cage . They would be suitable for smaller parrots too .
5 #### Great parrot ( cockatoo ) toy ! Is holding up better than I thought it would . She enjoys the corrugated cardboard wraps and the little plastic animals . Will probably buy again .
3 #### Greengo enjoys it . Notice I said enjoys not loves . He plays with it here and there but not one of his favorites . As soon as I put it in his cage he was attracted to its many colors and immediately went to investigate . This toy is larger that expected . Since Eclectus do n't have a very strong beak , I expect this to last a couple of months . If you have a heavy chewer or a large parrot like a macaw , i think it wo n't last months . Maybe the plastic animal shapes will , but the cardboard part will get chewed up pretty fast . But my Greengo is not a big chewer so he will get long use out of it .
5 #### My blue front loves this toy . When I purchase a toy for him I look for two things : how sturdy it is and are there fun things to chew . This toy is perfect . It has carboard , colorful plastic and knots to untie . This toy is actually standing up to his chewing . Some toys I have bought only lasted a week . This one has lasted several weeks and still has life in it . I would definately purchase this toy again . I think if is a good value for the money .
5 #### My Macaw blue & gold loved it . But it only lasted one week . Better to buy toys with more wood . Thick wood . She loved the cardboard part of it though .
5 #### My Baby loves these ! and so do I. I ordered 2 , one came straight , the other had one main branch with three offshoots . They attach easily and are so easy on his feet . They are strong and he loves jumping from one to another . This was a wonderful buy , and I will be back as long as you sell these on Amazon !
5 #### I love it , Jake the Yellow - naped Amazon is currently unimpressed but I suspect he 'll get over it . ( Birds , tho . lol ) It 's the perfect thickness for him , so here 's hoping he accepts this horrible - no - good - terrifying intruder soon . lol
2 #### Not as pictured , end of the branch , bunch of small braches sticking out all over , none level , hard to place in cage so they can use it . On the plus side , one of them likes to chew on it so there is that but I really wanted a perch for the smaller bird .
5 #### " Little Ricky " ( who looks just like the bird in the photo ) approves . :D
4 #### I have large macaws . These are very durable and stand up to their " abuse " . However , I am dismayed that the description is not quite accurate . The three that I just received are not even 14 " long . The description reads 14 " to 16 " . The diameter is also just 2 " at the base and less towards the ends . The description reads 2 " to 3 1/2 " . How does one get a 16 " long 3 " wide perch ?
5 #### This held up well to my Macaw . I am very happy with the quality and price . I will buy this again .
5 #### My goffin cockatoo loves this toy . It is still holding up after a few weeks of chewing . I will definitely be replacing it when he gets it all torn apart ! Great beak occupier .
5 #### I purchased this perch in medium for our new green cheek conure , not realizing quite how thick it would be . The caique they show in the picture is a bit of a larger bird with a little bigger feet , so I should have realized the size . However , I still put it in his new cage and figure that if anything , he could chew on it . He actually loves it ! He 's on it more than any other spot or perch in the cage , and while it 's too thick for his little feet to wrap around , he enjoys running around on it and picking at the wood . He actually sleeps on it most nights . If the description for this is correct , it 's made in American and made of Bottlebrush wood , which is safe for birds . The fact that it 's from Florida makes me feel much better about it . It did n't have an odd smell and was perfectly clean right out of the bag , though I did still rinse it off and let it air dry before putting it in with him . We 've only had it for about a week but it still looks great , even with him picking pieces off it constantly . For the price , which is pretty reasonable , this is a really great natural wood perch and I would recommend .
5 #### My parakeets and finches love it ! I put it in the cage and they went crazy I could see a difference right away . Recommend this product .
5 #### I loved it ! My macaw would not touch it .... we will keep trying though ! Thank you !
5 #### my bird enjoys this perch . Thanks for great service
5 #### A well made product which provides my birds a different surface to walk on and chew
5 #### I should have paid closer attention to the description because these are a lot bigger than I thought they were going to be . I was originally not going to use them because of the size , but they ended up working well as " outside the cage " perches for my canary when she has some time to fly around . She seems to like chewing on them a fair bit and the cage clamp part feels well attached and sturdy ( not that she weighs enough to cause a problem ) .
5 #### good perch my Macaw uses it often one of his fav in his cage thinking of getting another for outside his cage to stand on since he is out most of the time and all the time when I am home
5 #### Just what the bird wanted . Chews on it also . Good for the beak
4 #### The product is what s shown in the last picture but still really liked the perch . Although next time i want to know what my item actually looks like
5 #### This perch is much better than expected . I love the color , texture , and many branches .
5 #### Awesome value , nice shape and size . I will buy again once it becomes available .
5 #### My yellow - nape LOVES these perches ! Very happy with them and will buy again ! Excellent
5 #### Well made perch which attaches easily and securely to the cage . Shipment was fast and item well packaged . Liked the perch so much I ordered two more .
5 #### Bought for squirrels that love this and have not chewed it up . Made well .
5 #### This is my Green Cheek Conure 's favorite perch ever since she was a baby . It is the perfect size and texture for her to sleep on .
5 #### Our green - cheek conure used to sleep in a teepee perch , but since we added this perch he prefers this one . It 's a great size .
2 #### This dose not work with a large Macaw cage . ( Due to the spacing of the bars . )
2 #### Ordered 2 and they were like two totally different things and too long for my large cage , do n't look like the picture
5 #### Fits my green cheek conure perfect ! She loves chewing and sitting on them all day .
5 #### Gumdrop the parakeet enjoys this perch at least as much as her Booda . She really enjoys chewing little strips of wood off it . It seems softer than most perches , and so easy on the feet . Recommended .
5 #### My Sun Conure likes it . She can also chew on it as if it was a normal wooden branch without any issues . However , the textured material / coating does come off as a result but it 's no big deal .
5 #### I bought 2 of these perches , they are the right width for my cockatiel and the length is perfect also .
5 #### Very nice quality perch . It was slightly bigger in diameter than what I expected .
4 #### FIRST REVIEW ( update below ): The perch I was sent had a VERY VERY VERY sharp obvious spot where another part of it had been broken off . Will not put it in with my birds .... may see if someone can clip and file it down , although it is quite a hard wood ( might splinter ) . Not worth returning , but I feel this item was either VERY poor quality control ..... or someone " got rid of " a perch no one else would buy . UPDATE - changed rating from 1 star to 4 : Contacted company through Amazon . Was told " Amazon shipped it . " Company sent me out another . Put it in with finches and they love it . It is light , has grooves for little feet / nails and is smooth and comfy . Good product once I got a good one . Thank you to Bird 's Love . Product would be a 5 star if not for getting a really bad one first .
5 #### My cockatiel loves this perch ! She is the most avid chewer that I 've ever had in such a small package , so this perch is the ideal solution for her . She has a manzanita perch in her " condo " that just frustrates her , since the wood is so hard she can not break any of it off . This perch is very hardy , but the nifty little pieces of wood that she can break off just makes her day ( and it 's not terribly messy , so it makes mine , too ) . I do n't think that I 'll have to replace this one any time soon , and feel good about highly recommending it to other bird owners that want to keep their birds from getting bored ( note : I do n't mean to make this sound like a toy replacement , but since most birds have a relatively short attention span , they need a lot of different stimulation to avoid boredom ) . You will not be disappointed if you purchase this for your feathered pals .
5 #### my yellow nape amazon baby loves it ... great product ....
5 #### These are great because they provide safe , stable footing and your birds can actually chew on them . These are the only perches I buy . Once your bird has one of these you wo n't ever use anything else !
3 #### This is a great toy if you want to immediately engage your bird . Because it has soft wood and other chewables this toy is not going to be around very long once your grey gets going on it , but that 's the idea . The bird will lose interest if a toy is too durable , which is not going to happen with this one . Anyway , the price is right and my bird liked the toy . RJB .
4 #### I have had this in my Grey 's cage for about 4 days & Ducky has n't paid much attention to it , but I am sure he will ( he has other toys he is chewing up & playing with ) When his other toy 's are demolished , he will no doubt demolish this one as well .
5 #### My grey is kind of a scaredy - bird and does n't like new toys . She took to this one right away ! She destroyed all the cardboard in a few days and is working on all the little wood sticks now . Fun toy that is giving my Grey plenty of fun chew time .
5 #### Finally a toy that is as it appeared in the picture . A nice product . I continue to shop for Bella products based on my satisfaction with this one .
5 #### Our cockatoo , Harley , loved this toy , and it took him more then a day to destroy it too ! ! ! ! Great price too ! ! !
5 #### My Mexican Double Yellow Head hates change of any kind , unless it 's a ride in the car . A toy has to be reduced to unrecognizable before I 'll remove it from his cage . The Fiesta is perfect . He 's spent a week with his back to it ignoring it , a few more days growling at it and when I came down this morning it had chunks missing and he is stalking it . This for him means he 's loving life . The only improvement I would suggest is a bell hanging from the bottom . I attached a small copper cowbell to entice him to play .
4 #### At first my bird did n't do anything with it , but he finally started chewing on the cardboard . He 's not a voracious chewer but I am glad he 's using the toy .
5 #### This is a great toy for those frustrated and bored birds . After giving it the once over , it did not take long to show this toy who was boss and my Grey to obliterate it !
5 #### My African grey loves this toy . She goes for the wood strips first , then shreds the cardboard . It has lasted two weeks so far , which is a record for her .
5 #### I have a very picky scary cat bird but she loves this toy . Hope this helps . It 's fun and easy to hang .
5 #### This is a favorite of my CAG - he chew the cardboard first - as far as he can reach then starts on the wood - which he loves - he 's a shredder big time !
4 #### My TAG loves this , and it is nearly the perfect toy for her . Why 4 stars , then instead of 5 ? Because I have to restring it on vegetable tanned leather . It only takes her , literally , 3 seconds to snip the twine that this is strung on , thus causing the entire toy to plummet to the bottom of her cage . Really needs to be strung with leather . Other than that , great toy .
5 #### My parrot loves this toy . Great to chew on the cardboard and the wood .
4 #### My Cockatoo loved this and went through the little pieces of wood first in no time flat , but getting through the cardboard took a litt more time . It was a nice toy for him to keep him occupied for a short time for one day .
5 #### Perfect for the chewing parrot . He hangs on it or swings it to scratch his head
5 #### Only problem is my Gray ate this up in a few days . needs a stronger wood with it for continued pleasure .
4 #### I loved it -- it is exactly as described . It did n't appeal to our conure , but she is pretty picky so it might just be her .
5 #### All birds love this and it has lasted longer than most toys
5 #### My bird went after it before I even finished tieing it up . He loved it and it actually got him chewing on some of the wood , which usually does n't do . The only problem is that he chewed on the rope holding it together and he broke fairly easily . So , looped what was still together over his pearch . He went after the string again and now it is in pieces . That made me a little sad . I 'll have to use some leather to put it back together again . He does really seem to like it .
5 #### This is the second one we ordered - I got heshe a few other toys - my bird is a TOY HOAR ! ! !
5 #### But my parrots ate it up , cardboard , string , the whole damn thing ... in about a day or so . It they 're happy , I 'm happy .
5 #### Lots of chewing surfaces so it lasts longer than some toys that are easy to dismantle . My Goffin likes it quite well .
5 #### I bought it and then received it and he went right for it in his cage nice size for my Amazon as well . Good purchase experience .
3 #### This would be a waste for a big chewer - it lasted a couple days for our Grey , who is only a moderate chewer .
5 #### A great toy for the big chewers . Very sturdy and lasts well . Would buy again for sure ! As all parrot owners know we buy toys to eventually throw them out after they are destroyed but this one lasted well and our parrot has had a blast chewing it , hanging on it , fighting with it , etc ... :)
5 #### It 's not his favorite toy but only because it is durable and he does n't like that as much . Likes to feel like a killer lol . It holds up well , worth buying if your bird likes wood blocks .
5 #### Great toy , our Grey loves it . Works even better if you drill some holes in it and push some sunflower seeds in :)
5 #### Our African Grey ate all the cardboard and would not bit the wood . Maybe too big for him .
5 #### My Macaw loves this toy . It lasted longer than many , two weeks which is great for her .
5 #### All of my big birds Enjoy this product .... it will keep being a rebut if they keep making it !
5 #### Love this toy ! Lots of easily chewable wood with knots in between each piece of wood . This is wonderful because my TAG likes to untie knots ... Usually he untied a knot at the bottom of a strand and all the wood and baubles fall to the cage bottom . he loves having so many knots to untie and perfectly sized wood slats to chew up !
5 #### I bought this chew toy hoping to entice my birds to chew . Well ... It didn`t take long . My white capped pionus munches down daily on this toy . It is wonderful . I just bought another one and placed it with my Indian ringnecks . They went for it wholeheartedly . I highly recommend this chew toy for small to medium sized parrots . They love the size of each wood block and the many colors are brilliant and attractive to birds . I will definitely be back for more .
4 #### It does the job , they can chew it , and it wo n't kill them . The chunky pieces slow down my parrots Average life - 2 weeks with my Greenwing Macaw ; 3months with my Blue and Gold Macaw It 's not so bad in the winter and fall - I used the sticks when starting a fire .
5 #### I have an Umbrella Cockatoo who destroys toys very quickly . However , this one is taking her quite some time . I am very pleased !
4 #### Our BG Macaw did not destroy this right away . Big chunky wood - Edit : For some reason my BG just ended up ignoring this . He did not want anything to do with it after the first couple days and usually destroys everything right away . I do n't know if there is a smell or something about it but he left it - I tried reintroducing it whenever I would rotate toys - no dice . He wo n't chew it - everything else goes to toothpicks though . This is a mystery - but I 'm trusting his judgement - there 's something there he does n't like .
4 #### It is great to find a toy that is posted as large for large parrots and IS for " LARGE " parrots .
4 #### A lot of wood should last awhile . But just a bunch of 2 by 3s cut on a angle . Very easy to make yourself with a miter saw .
3 #### The quality of the items were good and they were in great shape for the price . Only one of the teeth I received was chipped . However , the issue that I had with this product is that although the picture and description indicate that this will contain a larger number of teeth , while the package that I received only contained 8 small teeth . This sucks , especially since other reviews state they received as many as 30 .
4 #### Lots of pieces along with the teeth but the teeth that are in the bag are nice .
5 #### I bought this for my son and he was thrilled when he saw them . You get a bag with a mix of shark teeth and pieces and out of the bag there were a more intact shark teeth than I expected - different shapes and sizes . This is really cool and I plan to make my son a necklace out of one of the larger teeth . I was hesitant initially to purchase these because of some of the reviews . I was expecting to get a bag of bits with a couple of teeth - but what I received was mostly teeth with one or two pieces . I 'd definitely buy these again .
4 #### Judging by the pic when I ordered it I was getting a lot but actually received a tiny little bag with about 30 very small teeth . It was according to the specs but I wish they had placed a dime next to the teeth to show their size .
3 #### very small and a lot of them were damaged
3 #### a collection of very small shark 's teeth < an inch in length . Most of the teeth in the bag were broken , but there were enough in the bag for the kid 's science project so it worked out .
1 #### There are more pieces of teeth most were broken and those were only an inch long . You only get approximately 20 teeth . A few that seemed to be plaster . I 'm going to a real dealer this time I do n't have the time to mess with trash teeth .
5 #### Once the glue dried and the bleeding stopped they are a nice fit ..... yeah I 'm not crazy , but these teeth are crazy awesome . I 'm teeth rich , great selection . Good variety , nice quality .
3 #### KIDS THOUGHT THESE ARE COOL , , , , SHARKS DID"NT ! ! MOST OF EM FAIRLY SMALL ..
5 #### I received a tip while standing in line at the grocery store from other grandmothers who rave about these bounce and sit balls as a sure fire way to engage the interest of a grandchlid and tire them out so they will settle down at night and go to sleep . It works . Worth every penny . Easy to inflate . Durable
4 #### Great concept for an iq toy . The inner ball has two holes one on opposite sides . So you have to cover a hole to fill the top . Then without dropping any treats if you 're skilled , you need to move the number ball so that it covers up . The outside has holes all over so not only the dog is in for a skill challenge but also the owner . Often Ill fill it , think I covered the inner holes , roll the toy and everything falls out . Seems like the inner ball should have one hole . Puppy does love it but all the goodies drop out faster than a smashed piata but if you use bigger chunks , they get stuck and need to wash you out . Bad photo . Trying to show how the holes go all the way through
5 #### This sturdy ball works well , dropping kibble/ treats unpredictably , making them work at figuring it out , but is not too difficult . I thought it was a little bit spendy , but now I say it is well worth it .
5 #### This is a very fun game and helps with hand eye coordination . I love it at the beach , park anywhere and having multiple sets is also great .
5 #### my 5 month old Golden absolutely loves this treat ball . She rolls it around and received a reward . I have purchased 2 ! great entertainment
4 #### The ball works as advertised . The little treats come out as the dog rolls the ball around . My 2.5 year - old French bulldog played with it for about three minutes and has n't touched it since . It 's good quality , though .
5 #### Love this ball . Better yet , pup packs it around a lot . Have to be careful on putting in treats , or they just drop through . Got them in and holes out of alignment , so pup would have to " work at it " . She did and figured it out quickly .
5 #### I put it on the floor and the cats went right for it ! I guess love says it all !
4 #### Ingenious game ! We use it with a tennis ball .
5 #### These are great . Very good purchase . They arrived fully charged which was a pleasure !
5 #### My grandson lives this . He is 5 and he bounces all over the house . It 's built sturdy thank goodness .
5 #### Our dog loves this toy , it 's perfect size for her mouth to chew and squeak but small enough that she does n't destroy it . Perfect size for up to medium sized dog .
5 #### I ordered this for our 6 year old granddaughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it ! It was easy to inflate with the included pump and the ball is made of a heavy duty material that seems like it should be very durable . Just ordered a second one for her so she will have one at home , too ! Would definitely recommend this !
5 #### nice and sturdy . Grandson loves it ! Easy to inflate .
5 #### This is for my granddaughter whom we call Ladybug . I have not opened it and inflated it yet so I can not comment on durability . It is cute . I will update once she tries it out .
5 #### I can take it or leave it but my cat loves this toy .
5 #### Love them .... they are all over my floors as my felines love to play with them !
5 #### These work perfectly with my Nerf Rival guns . I got two bags so we could use them in our little office at work . They are exactly the same as the nerf brand balls and a lot cheaper . Tons of fun shooting these around the office all day . Highly recommended if you need some extra or to replace ones you 've lost .
5 #### We bought on for each of our 7 grand kids they love them ...
5 #### My six year old granddaughter loves it and it fits her pretty well . I would say this is a good size for 6 year olds ! I of course do n't let her play on the ground outside on it , but inside it seems to hold up well ! ! ! !
5 #### Bought For My 5 Year Old Son And He Said It Was His Favorite Birthday Present .
5 #### Great football . Lasted all summer . The tip started to crack by Oct but , we got so much use out of it that it was worth the amount paid for it and I bought another one . Easy to throw and catch . One warning . If you plan on playing w/ this in the colder weather , be careful as it hurts to catch it bc of the material it 's made out of . And it is a little slippery so you may think you caught it but in reality , it 'll just slip / fly right through your hands . It floats so you can play w/ this in the pool or lake w/o fear of losing it . It 's a great little football , flies far and is a lot of fun . I highly recommend this toy for young and old alike .
5 #### My granddaughter thinks this is great . I had bought one that was too small and she was disappointed so I was glad to see that Amazon carries these for bigger kids .
5 #### The bouncy balls I remember as a kid and the perfect balls to get the cats to come running to play .
5 #### Got 2 of these for Christmas one for a boy 8 and one for a girl 6 . The girl does n't play with her 's much cause she can not keep her balance very well BUT the boy bounces all the time ; from his bedroom to the kitchen to the living room or just while he is watching TV . One of his favorite gifts .
5 #### My daughters cats ( 4 ) loved them . My cat , not so much , but she prefers things she steals off my desk , anyway . So I would have to say they are a hit with normal cats .
5 #### These are well made metal jacks with a bouncy rubber ball , the same as the ones I grew up with 60 years ago . I bought a set to exercise my arthritic fingers , but my grandchildren enjoyed them so much that I will be buying additional sets before they visit again . Inexpensive sets which have inferior balls and plastic jacks are not worth the money ; these definitely good value .
5 #### They 're jacks . I 'm not sure how much the quality of jacks varies by brand but these seem identical to the ones I had as a kid in the early 1980s . I used these as a stocking stuffer for my niece and nephew . Not sure if they cared but I thought they were fun . =)
5 #### My child bounces all over the house with a smile on her face
5 #### It looks great , but I ca n't really see the future .... :)
5 #### I did not buy this to toss with my kids , I bought it to throw for our dog . Our Yorkie has bundles of energy and she loves to fetch . This toy is her favorite thing ! She can follow the toy as it whistles while in the air . So , if we are playing at night and it 's getting dark she follows the sound of the toy and can usually retrieve it easily .
3 #### My 14 year - old son was happy to play with this when he first got it , but he lost interest after a day . My son was also somewhat disappointed that the " howling " sound the toy produces is fairly faint . I had incorrectly assumed that all Nerf products are relatively soft , and this toy would be appropriate for indoor play . However , it is not soft , and it really needs to be played with outdoors .
3 #### Did n't howl as much as expected . Somewhat disappointing watching the young ones playing with it and trying so hard to get a good howl .
5 #### Gave these as a gift , Mom loved the packaging and jacks .
5 #### Love these jacks brings back lovely childhood memories . Now my grandchildren can experience the same childhood memories .
5 #### A friend recommended this for baseball practice , to improve throwing mechanics . My son had never thrown a football before , and this one is nice because you can use the whistle to gauge how well you are throwing a spiral .
5 #### Granddaughter hops all over the farm she lives on !
5 #### Purchased as a gift for a beach camping trip for adults and it was a hit
5 #### It was a gift for my granddaughter . Right size for a six year old , she wanted the jumbo , I thought it would be too big for her small hands . These are perfect ! Old school(Retro ) I bought her two sets .
5 #### I can only say that my Great niece & Great Nephew loved all of the Rokenbok toys ! Since they are out in Oregon , I can only listen to my Nephew & Niece .
5 #### This was a gift . For a boy . A nerf . Shocked ? Love it . Loved it . Want one .
5 #### Just like when I was a child . Extremely happy to see my grandkids enjoy them .
5 #### I bought one of these many years ago for my infant daughter and she loved it . This one was for my grandson and it was love at first sight .
5 #### these are great i 'm using them for my craft 's , they are awesome :)
5 #### My boys LOVE Plants vs. Zombies ! These toys are the real deal and not the cheap knock - offs .
5 #### These foam balls are excellent . They are about the size of a softball . They are sculpted foam so the facial features of each turtle is done in a 3D relief . They are made to look like the turtles on the new CGI show that airs on NICK . The outside of the balls are very shiny and thick which I think really helps to keep them from getting torn up like regular foam balls . They are great for younger kids since they don"t hurt if you get whacked with one . Overall these are a great deal considering that you get four of them and they are such a nice size .
3 #### Bought this for a trip to the beach . It held up well and is very sturdy and the whistling is fun . That said , the front in is very hard plastic - very un nerd - like . I can catch it , but my kids just let it hit the ground . This diminishes the fun .
4 #### Seems like such a simple toy , but everytime kids came over to our house they loved the nerf football and wanted to takei t home with them . We finallly just purchased a few to give to these kids to have at their house , and it 's always a popular toy and they always want us to throw with them when we 're around .
5 #### Great to play with at the beach . Got lots of comments on the whistle ... I do n't know how you could miss the whistle if you have ears that work . I may have to buy a replacement . Perfect , simple gift for Christmas . Note to self ... Buy one for 6 year old nephew !
5 #### My daughter is 6 months old so she ca n't really do much with the ball yet but she loves to hold it and look at the adorable pictures . The ball is soft and I like that it 's big so she can play with it when she 's older too . My daughter also loves the " chime"-like jingle it makes when rolled . The color contrasts are pleasing to the eye as are the pictures on it and grab the attention of little ones . I highly recommend this ball .
5 #### I used to play with this type of football with my dad all the time as a kid . I loved how far it would fly and the way the whistle sounded as it went ; it was always my goal to make it whistle as much as it did when my dad threw it ! So , if you are planning on using this in a conventional way ( with humans ) , it 's great fun and I highly recommend it . I also recommend it for dogs ! My dog ( lab / corgi mix ) will give up on tennis balls after a throw or two , but she LOVES this dang football . She would chase it until she died ... it must be something about the whistle that keeps her attention ! I have purchased probably 4 of these over the past few years for use with my dog . For how often we use it , and considering I 'm using it with a dog , I would say that they 're pretty durable . My dog is very good and does not try to tear it apart , so that increases its longevity . We do not use it every day , so I would say that one of these footballs lasts me a couple of months . If you use it with a dog , you just have to be careful that if one of the whistles starts to peel , you take it off so it does not get accidentally ingested . This football is so much fun- for humans and dogs alike ! Highly recommended ! ! !
4 #### This hopper works as good as they are expected to , and I bought it at half the price of a big name brand . I also bought the Gymnic so I can offer a good comparison . This is good but just not as hard and bouncy as the Gymnic . It works though .. for little kids it is not going to matter so much .
5 #### Very effective for breaking HUGE chunks off mini pig hooves ( I get a lot of rescue with inches of overgrowth ) . Need two hands to wield and anyother person to hold the hoof in place . I recommend a shorter pair if single handed trimming is desired .
5 #### Professional Quality . Man , & Falabella horse approved ! Great Price too ! We absolutely DO recommend these ! And we hope our review is Helpful !
5 #### I got these hoof nippers and they work well .
5 #### Very quick service and nippers were exactly as discribed
5 #### I do n't see how anyone has a problem using these nippers . Unless your hand strength is weak or your horses hooves are really dry . The drier hooves are on any animal , makes it harder to nip them , no matter how sharp the nippers . I can use these nippers one handed without a problem ! Love em and plan to get plenty more soon .
5 #### This will probably be the only hoof clipper you ever need buy ! I ca n't imagine anything breaking or damaging it .
3 #### These are sharp but hard to pull open . They do n't fall open so two hands are needed to get them open around the hoof . I like the ones I got from Jeffers better , they fall open so can be closed easily with one hand . These are well made , just not easy to use as a woman
5 #### Top quality nippers at a low price . I am very pleased with these nippers .
3 #### I thought this was too heavy and unwieldy for my use on my pot bellied pig . I think it would take at least 2 people to use this , and even then I 'm not sure I could do it . I had to return it . The product itself seems quite solid though .
5 #### Used this on a couple horses to just do a little bit of trimming before snow and frozen ground came .. Works AMAZINGLY on horses and cuts nice and smoothly
3 #### This thing weighs a ton , and is very hard to squeeze shut while holding a goats hoof between the nippers . I 'm sure it would work better on a horse , but it 's not worth a darn to me .
5 #### Nice and sharp . Great balance and easy to use . But it is what is to be expected from Diamond tools .
5 #### These nippers work great . I finally gave up on my 10 year old nippers and replaced with these . I am satisfied with the price and reliability .
4 #### Tkhe fur babies eat them so I guess they are acceptable
4 #### Decent option . Had to turn down the sensitivity for the shock , as it did really scare our 15 lb Minpin . I think she learned quickly , though !
5 #### Great combinations of treats . My cat is partial to seafood , so I thought I would try these . She absolutely loves them . I have gotten her to do little tricks to get them . She will sit up and meow . She will jump up on her dresser and lay down . She will sit and say please
5 #### This has by far been the best dog bark collar yet .. We had the older model which was great . This model now features a rechargeable battery , static shock .. which i do n't use ... and a sensitive rating .. Very excited about the upgraded as i am in the business of training puppies .. well done .
5 #### Works great for runs . I love that you can make it various lengths and it has a ton of attachments . The quality is great and holds up against my puppy who loves to chew .
5 #### Excellent quality . It is awesome to walk my big dogs with . I have full control . I really like the hand grip . That is great when I need them closer . Very happy with this leash .
5 #### I love to run and have a standard poodle who runs with me . It is hard to hold the leash when I run , but now I do n't have to . This thing is perfect and I can run naturally and he can come along with me . Highly recommend !
3 #### Even though they loved them they were too expensive for a second purchase .
5 #### Love it ! Just like with parenting ... we need 2 hands sometimes while keeping our loved ones safe . I just got a puppy 5 days ago and already used it outside to get the recycling and garbage to the curb . Not for leash walking training as too tempting to bite / chew when it dangles . But eventually , that will be great as well .
5 #### This leash is really good . It has nice thick bungie type material . It has 2 handles for flexible lead distance . The belt holds the doggie bags and makes the leash handsfree . This leash is a handsfree and ment to be around your waist . It has fit up to a 42 " waist . Waking my dog is easy , it gives her room to explore but not too much room . It can stretch but my puppy is n't strong enough yet to do that . I did n't have any issues as I walked and used my phone .
5 #### I love my new hands free dog leash , I wish I would have purchased it sooner ! I run with my Jack Russel mix , and actually do n't use the belt since it makes it too long for my little guy . I just hook the leash part around my waist to the d - ring and its a perfect length . It keeps my dog close without having to worry about stepping on or having him to far away . It 's also a little springy in case he gets too far ahead , it does n't choke him . The best part is that it 's completely hands free so I can keep track of my steps too . Highly recommend !
4 #### my cat loves it jumps up and down when she sees me getting her bag of goodies .
5 #### I have two boston terrier puppies ! My bostons are 14 weeks old and have just realized they can run off quickly ! This leash is fabulous ! I can walk or jog with my dog attached to me and he has room to move around . The elastic give of this leash keeps your dog from jarring you and tugging at your waist . I like that you have several clips to attach the leash to giving you the freedom to walk your dog on the right or left side . We live on a farm so this leash quickly got a bit dusty but it was a breeze to rinse off in the sink with some dawn dish soap . I am potty training my dogs so keeping them on a leash close to me in the house is really helpful . The waist belt is very comfortable and adjustable and I like that the leash detaches from the belt as well . The included waste bags are helpful to have on hand as well . I would love to see an addition leash available to add to the waste belt so I can attach both my puppies to the same belt .
5 #### This is GREAT quality . Seriously I love this thing . My dog is n't used to it , and I do n't use it to job but I anticipate it being helpful in situations where we 're walking a lot and I need my hands free ( whenever that might be ) . I tried it out and the only thing is , I wish there were like , a way to adjust the length . My dog gets a little too far away from me , I 'll need to hold the leash to keep it from getting under her belly or her getting too far . I 'm REALLY Happy with the quality and ease of use though . VERY nice leash set . UPDATE : Unfortunately I took my dog to the beach wearing this ... and a little sand got into the leash buckle , where it attaches to her collar . Now I can not use it . Any idea how to get the sand out ? !
5 #### Works great even with my big dogs ! Waste strap can be used with any collar or harness which is great to satisfy a diversity of dogs ! I liked this product because it enabled we to jog with my pup hands free .
5 #### I have three very large golden retrievers . Their favorite word is " walk . " It is really difficult to walk all three at the same time . I can not walk with two leashes in one hand , so I thought that I would try this hands - free dog leash . This is a really nice leash and it came with an added bonus of 15 bags and bag dispenser . I like the black and blue colors of this leash and it is really well made . When it is fully extended , it is 63 . " My dogs are very large dogs and when they pull , it 's almost too much to handle . This leash is padded and helps with pulling . It is fully adjustable and very easy to adjust . It has a nice bungee for shock absorption and it claims to absorb shock for dogs up to 150 pounds . My biggest one is 100 pounds and it works very nicely with her ! She 's usually the one that I have to drag along because she 's so far behind , but my middle dog is a puller and it works for him too . This also includes reflective stitching which is perfect for late night walking . This leash is great for my three large golden retrievers . It makes walking / running with them a lot easier . I hope that this review is helpful to you ! .
5 #### I have a dog leash similar to this and use it for our hyper puppy ... it 's great for keeping him in tow without him pulling my arm off ! My niece has used ours several times and loved it ( she 's 9 and wants to be a vet when she grows up ) . I ordered this leash to give my niece for her birthday . It 's high quality and she 'll love the cute blue accents . It also comes with a doggie bag holder that already has a roll of doggie bags in it . I 'm super excited to gift this to my niece - she 's going to be THRILLED ( and I 'm excited to have such an easy gift that she 'll legitimately love ) .
5 #### I really love this leash ! I got it for my dog Lexie because , she tends to get out of her collar this a way to control her that is easier for me . The straps were easy to adjust by the length I wanted to be able to walk her . I have no complaints this is the best bang for your buck !
5 #### Huge hit with all my cats . They 're a bit smaller than other Temptation varieties .
5 #### My boys love plush toys , These have lasted several wash and dry cycles . Worth the money .
5 #### Excellent product . The material is durable and it is the perfect size for my Honda CRV ; the cover protects the passenger seats as well as the backs of the front seats . Quite pleased that it does n't shift and appears to make my Dane feel secure .
5 #### Katy The Cat loves them and that 's what counts . As soon as I open the package she comes running- well maybe more like sauntering - to get her goodies . I continually buy these because she thinks they 're great !
5 #### It works fine , plugged our TV and our speakers .
5 #### My favorite planner . This is the second year I have used this brand and as long as it is available .
1 #### It was an old calendar and the quality was Extremely poor . It is unusable .
5 #### This calendar is perfect for my needs , a family calendar with plenty of space to write on each day and take notes on the side , without all the individual day pages making it heavy . This is very easy to carry around and is very attractive . There are notes pages in the back and a small slot on the back cover to keep receipts , notes , invites or whatever .
5 #### Lovely heavy card stock . Makes a nice impression . Heavy envelopes also . CroninCards makes very nice designs . I have used their cards in the past and always receive compliments . Recommended .
4 #### I like this planner but I really liked the one I found last year better but this is the correct size I was looking for and I like the way the months are displayed .
4 #### This is heavy duty .. it worked great on cloth seats .. on leather it is very slippery , I have to put some fabric under it to keep it from slipping . I do n't use the part that connects to the front head rests . Doing so may alleviate the slipperiness . There are velcroed slots that can be used to pull a seatbelt through . All in all it is good quality and does the job .
5 #### Have been using this cord to attach my sound bar to my Tv and have n't had an issues . Works great !
5 #### I do n't know about anyone else but when you have a car and not an SUV it 's very difficult to attach the bottom to anything on the underneath of your seat unless you have an older car . The newer Vehicles have nothing to hook the basic car covers on . This is assume just hook them to your head rests and Wella all set to go . I also notice that other people state that their dogs still get in the front with this particular hammock cover . Hello it 's soft fabric I would suggest a gate that you can buy so they ca n't get into the front seat . Overall great product .
5 #### I 've got an 08 Hylander , so I was a little concerned about the size of the cover . After measuring my back seat multiple times , I concluded that the cover would fit , but it would be tight . Turns out it 's about 4 inches short , about 2 inches on each side . Not the end of the world , I can live with a couple of inches of seat uncovered . Cause my dog is n't going to hit those exposed inches on either side of the cover . My dog is 120lbs of Shepherd / Mix , that sheds like it 's his job , so I need something that will be able to handle his size and weight . This cover is sturdy and well made . I 've no concerns about it bolding up for a long while . The stitching along the straps that hold it up are reinforced . The clasps that hold the cover up , are solid and once adjusted , do not slip . The bottom that goes over the seat , has this lining that holds it in place and does n't let the cover slide all over the seat . It also has Velcro openings for the seat belts or a strap if you want to add one . First day using it we got some freezing rain , The cover absorbed all my wet and soggy pooch could give it and more .
5 #### Finally , a planner that has enough room to write in , no more tiny writing that I ca n't decipher after the fact . The best planner by far .
5 #### I buy a new one every year . Always look forward to the new designs .
5 #### very nice , pocket great , band to hold it together . Everything I needed .
4 #### It 's a bit large for my purposes - but otherwise it 's great .
5 #### Really cute and really the only monthly planner on the market .
5 #### Exactly as expected for a month to month calendar
5 #### Love it . It fits in all my bags and at home it stays right by my chair . Love , love , love it
5 #### Perfect for my needs . I only like to use monthly view calendars with squares big enough to write a few notes on the days . I always have a hard time finding a simple , no frills calendar book with just monthly views without the daily or weekly calendar included . Most are " pocketbook " size and I find them to be too small . Love the extra note pages , the elastic to band the book closed , and the little pocket in the back cover . Unlike another reviewer mentioned , the dates in my calendar are all correct . A great product !
5 #### Repeat customer on anything Blue Buffalo for the fur babies . They love these - even one of mine with a finicky stomach .
5 #### Love it , love it , love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This was exactly what I was looking for and it arrived a week sooner than expected . Will definitely buy another one next year .
3 #### My cats did n't really like this food , but they are picky eaters .
5 #### My calendars are an essential part of my life as I 've gotten older . And , they allow writing on the date and notes on other pages . It 's great for keeping my doctors appointments and other scheduled activities !
5 #### After using the Erin Condren calendar for years , I thought I would try something new . I am so glad I did ! I absolutely love this ! It 's layout , pullover cord closure , and extra pages were exactly what I needed . Perfect in every way .
5 #### Not too big , not too small , the Goldilocks of organizers !
1 #### Love the look of the calendar , but the dates are incorrect by 1 day from March 2017 - on . Useless item and waste of my money .
5 #### It fit myT3i perfectly . It was a much more secure fit than the original Canon which resulted in the loss and need for this replacement . No problems .
1 #### Not sue why but my fur baby will not eat these , she pushes it away with her nose when ever I try and give her one .
5 #### Super product . For planner people like me it 's tough to find all the aspects I want and do n't want . I want decent monthly planner . That 's all . No daily or weekly pages . Do n't need em . It 's really well made and contrary to other review not flimsy IMO . If I had to complain wish there were more color options- wish there were more note areas- wish it was a cooler format , like wider . Anyway , love it ! I had another Orange Circle product last year and loved it to but it was too big and too many pages . Then I found this option and it is Just Right . Bam .
5 #### My dog enjoys these . Sometimes I crumble a small amount on his food as a special treat .
5 #### We were using Zukes training treats , which are easier to use , but my puppy is more eager to please when Chicken Sizzlers are the reward .
4 #### I purchased this for a senior Australian Cattle Dog ( aka ACD aka blue heeler aka red heeler ) and used one container and part of a second before starting him on a better quality dry kibble that contained most of the ingredients . He was a rescue dog of unknown age , and already had considerable arthritis in his spine , so it would likely have helped him more if he 'd been getting it for a couple more years , but it certainly did n't hurt him , and I think did help some .
3 #### I truly do like the " at - a"glance " style planners , but this one just falls short of the mark for me . I 'd prefer a plastic cover instead of the coated cardstock . I also would like a bit more room to write in the spaces . While this is sufficient , it 's not high quality . The best feature to me is the band that hold it shut . They should ALL have this neat little feature !
5 #### The optical audio that came with my Astro A50s broke and I was left without audio on my Xbox One ! after a few minutes on Amazon this had been ordered and was on the way almost immediately ! This cable is cheap and works great !
5 #### My red heeler loves these treats ! I bought them originally because they 're free from corn , wheat and soy , no artificial colors and preservatives , and no by - product meal , and I 'll buy them again . They smell like bacon , look like bacon strips , but the dog 's not talking as to what they taste like . I also like that I can break up a strip into thirds then into smaller pieces instead of having her glomming down on one large strip and it 's then gone .
4 #### My pup loves these but honestly I expected these to be more like actual bacon . Instead they look and smell just like Beggin ' Strips . Ingredients are supposed to be better so I 'm hoping their claim is legitimate this time .
5 #### All my dogs love this and it is good for them .
5 #### My dog absolutely loved these treats . The second he caught a whiff of the smokey scent , he came running over and licked his lips . When he tried one , he immediately wanted more . The treats are soft and easy to break into smaller pieces . They have a rather strong smell , but this was a pro as my dog was excited about it . My dog can be a picky eater , but these are still his favorite treats .
5 #### My Miss Millie loves , loves loves this brand / flavor treat . And I love it because it is made in the USA - Free of fillers : Natural recipe is free from corn , wheat and soy , artificial colors and preservatives and chicken and poultry by - product meal . Win - Win .
5 #### My little terrier is very finicky about her kibble . I 've had her over two years and it 's been two years of her disappointment with my various ( expensive ) offerings . A complete different story with this dog food ! Every time I 'm about to fill her bowl she jumps off the ground in anticipation . Like high off the ground ! I reckon that deserves a review . She 's never been anywhere near this enthusiastic before .
5 #### The cats almost like them too much - they are begging for them constantly !
5 #### This planner is very thin , which is just what I wanted . Also , the cover is really nice material and higher quality overall than I 'd expected . I hope I can find this again next year because it 's perfect for what I need !
5 #### I just wish we could still get these ! Our dog is allergic to chicken so we ca n't change to the other varieties .
5 #### A favorite for our pups . Ca n't go wrong with blue buffalo .
5 #### I have tried several for my aged dog- this seems to work the best !
5 #### This Peacock is beautifully made and absolutely stunning . I bought it for a child , but I was tempted to keep it for myself !
5 #### Great colors and the little one we bought it for loves it she is crazy about peacocks and loves this one to .
5 #### I got these the other day for our dog . We have a pittie/ boxer mix , about 45 pounds . He loves his treats . I love that fact that the ingredients in these treats offer a pretty small list of items , and are better items than most treats out there . Pitties hav e alot of skin problems from allergies apparently , so when we get generic or cheap treats with bad items in them , he breaks out in rashes . I 'm happy to say that these pass the test and he 's just as happy today as yesterday and had no reaction . The fact that this is an add on item and came fairly cheap is that much better . When I opened the bag , I was happy with what I saw . These treats look great ( they look like little pieces of bacon ) for the dog , heck , even for a human , ha ha . Of course when he heard the bag , my dog came running . My dog does n't really drool at all , but after having him do a few tricks for me , he actually had a drop of saliva drop on my hand as he was waiting ever so patiently . In fact , he actually wanted it so bad that he stole a second treat from me before I could get him to do anything else . He loves these treats , and I love seeing my dog happy . I 'd highly recommend these , especially for the price ..
3 #### I buy Blue Buffalo dry dog food and training treats for my two dogs regularly and I was satisfied with this product . These treats smelled just like the cheaper brands , but are much healthier . I wish I could say they tasted the same , but I would have to leave that to my dogs : they ate them up . My littlest one would go nuts when I grabbed the bag off of the shelf . My only disappointment : there were n't that many strips inside .
3 #### I was looking for a different flavor than party mix . I figured the cats needed a change . However , not all of my cats like these flavors . So , back to party mix I go .
5 #### My chi just loves these . She prefers that I break them up into smaller pieces as she ca n't quite manage to eat them whole . Great treats and she is very picky . Very .
5 #### These new year 's cards are adorable . originally I thought the glue did n't hold , but the yellow strip on top has to be removed and then they hold tight . The company was kind enough to respond after I mentioned that in my first review . in fact , their products are all high quality .
4 #### My daughter " needed " a stuffed peacock for Xmas . How could I say no ? Had no idea I 'd actually be able to find one , nonetheless find one as nice and appealing as this one . She loves it
5 #### Great calendar with lots of space for appointments or notes . Each Month has a Tab so you can easily navigate to your month of choice . It also has an Elastic Separator ( for lack of better term ) that you can use for the current month so when you open it up it opens to the current month right away .
5 #### This product surpassed my expectations quite abit , I would highly recommend this item to all enthusiasts and tell them this is a VERY good dollar value and was delivered on time in the CHRISTmas season . Wow ! What a wonderful retail experience .
5 #### Give it several days and your cuticles WILL get better . I had some cuticles on my thumbs that were rough and uncomfortable . This product after about 5 days made them look and feel much better .
5 #### I LOVE this Gund Peacock ! It 's beautiful and very well - made . I ordered more than one , but the others arrived with spots of blue dye on the beak , so I sent them back and alerted the Seller(s ) . Examine yours very carefully for this defect when it arrives .
5 #### My 10 month old loves this dragon . It 's soft , squishy , and does n't shed . He 's a happy baby !
5 #### This is a nice 12 month planner from At - A - Glance which gives you monthly appointment reminders . I have always liked to be able to see the entire month instead of just a week at a time . My electronic calendar holds more information so I just use this as a easy reminder to carry with me . Most of us have smart phones that also track our appointments . If you like portable hard copy calendars , this is one of the best !
4 #### This is a pretty nice planner , however I wish it were more durable . If you are hard on a planner , this may be a bit too flimsy for you . I do like the feel of the front and back cover . It is a matte black with a soft texture that feel sort of leathery or rubbery . It looks modern and clean ( it 's looks are it 's best attribute for me ) . The months are tabbed and easy to turn to . It has a flat bungee cord closure . I think it 's " OK " , and three stars correspond to that .
4 #### First , The cover of this planner almost feels leather - like which I really like . It measures approximately 8 " by 11 " . There are index tabs for each month and plenty of room to jot down your appointments , birthdays , and anything else you may need to jot down . There 's an extra place that is like graft paper for side notes or whatever you 'd like to use it for . This planner is large but thin . If you wanted to , you could probably punch holes in it and stick it in a binder . I will probably end up putting this in a binder just because I think it would easily get bent up if it is n't in some type of protective case . It 's thinner than my monthly wall calendar . It would do well if you tend to carry a briefcase . Other than that , I do n't see this planner as one that can be carried around in your purse or backpack . .
5 #### This planner is perfect for us to keep track of when our bills are due and what dates payments have been scheduled for . Plenty of room in each box to actually write .
5 #### Cat pushes himself into bowl with treats before I even have them in the dish .
5 #### I just LOVE At - a - glance planners ! They 're so well made and durable , and the design is always so pretty , especially this one . It has a very chic , simple and elegant look . The cover is very nice , and it 's durable , and it feels like it 'll hold up extremely well through the coming year . The inside has everything you need , from your calendar , to notes and contacts and other basic information . It 's so easy to utilize and fashionably functional , I think if you 're looking for a good planner , you ca n't go wrong with this one , or any of the at - a - glance planner . I 've had several in the past , and I 'm ALWAYS happy with them . Plus , I think these make excellent gifts for the coming year ! Overall , I 'd highly recommend this product . I just love it , and I plan to purchase at - a - glance planners in the future for gifts and for myself . No complaints , and I 'm very happy with it !
3 #### This is n't a bad planner . It 's a good size , it has everything you need in a calendar and monthly planner . The problem is the cover . It 's made of some kind of rubber and when I took it out of the packaging , the smell was really strong . I admit that I 'm more sensitive to smells than most and that most people might not find the smell of it offensive . I also did n't love the feel of the outside . I do n't like the rubbery feel of it .
4 #### This is a great slim planner for 2016 . Unlike many other planners , this one is thin but still has the perfect layout to include everything you need . The monthly " at - a - glace " pages give you a great way to view your schedule over the short term to really avoid conflicts . And also included are standard time zone maps and holiday pages . The cover is thin black cardboard , but it is coated in something to make it slightly more durable and spill resistant . And it 's got a really functional band to both keep it closed or to use as a place holder . CONCLUSION I have tried several 2016 planners and this one is my favorite so far , even more so than several with fancy bindings . This one is the most compact and functional for a full page planner . So this product is definitely worthy of consideration .
5 #### This is a fantastic basic , streamlined month - at - a - time planner . We received this free to try from the Amazon Vine program and we use this for our family calendar . The boxes are perfectly sized to fit all the kids activities ( and ours ) in . The format is clean and crisp and makes it easy to focus on what the most important events for the month are . I have no complaints . This is a great product .
5 #### I like the healthy stuff in it , as far as taste , I do n't know , lol , ca n't go by my dog , he will eat anything if I add a little people food !
5 #### This is just what I need to get reorganized . I used to have a smaller , but thicker At A Glance Weekly Planner years ago and was much more organized , but since the digital calenders came on , I just have not done well with them ( not to mention that my iCal decides to erase my events completely ) ! I love how slim the planner is , but has lots of pages for contacts , notes , etc .
5 #### The At - A - Glance 2016 Weekly and Monthly Planner was just the thing I needed to keep track of doctor 's appointments , social dates and meetings of my local civics group . The planner has a full monthly calendar for each month spread over two pages , followed by spacious entry pages week by week ( with room for notes ) . The generous writing space is so large , the planner can double as a journal , or be used just for that purpose . The back of the book has space for contacts and events , plus a list of holidays and even a time zone map of the US . Altogether well planned and executed , I ordered more for friends whose lives are as busy as mine . Highly recommended .
4 #### Slim , light and to the point . It has a 2016 calendar with the ability to take notes daily as well as notes in the corner and in the back . Writing space is pretty large . It is decent and good for someone that needs to have access to a minimal amount of daily notes . If you need something more you will probably need a bigger notebook . It is less then 1/4 inch deep or 1/2 cm . My only issue was how it was mailed . It came rolled up .
4 #### Sometimes I feel like the only person who still uses a planner rather than some app on my phone to keep track of appointments , activities , and events . I work at home and use a planner to keep track of the tasks I need to do for each client on a daily basis . This planner works well for me . Each month is spread across two pages with enough room on each individual date to add more than one notation . The advantage to this is being able to see the entire month at once , a feature that helps me prioritize my work . The size of the spaces allows me to write in personal appointments , kids ' practices and game , and other reminders . Tabs along the side let you quickly turn to a specific month as needed . Additional features such as a 3 year reference , future planning pages , space to list contacts , room for notes , space to list events by month , and a list of dates when holidays fall through 2019 . The planner is quite thin in spite of these additions to the calendar . An elastic band holds the planner closed . The cover has a nice feel to it , very smooth and a little soft . While it does n't have the sturdiest construction , it does seem able to hold up to one year of use just fine .
3 #### This planner is as basic as it gets . The binding is kind of thin and I doubt it makes it through the year . The paper that contains the calender is not of the highest quality and I would expect " bleed through " if you are using a felt tip pen . At a glance is a perfect name for this for you will not be taking any heavy notes as the format of this planner really only holds enough room on each date for a few words . In a word , Meh .
3 #### The cover is nice and soft but the bungee cord that is used to keep the calendar closed also causes the pages to slightly curve :( Inside is a page with a 3 yr reference of montly calendars ( the past , present and future year ) . Each tabbed month has nice size daily squares on which to write appointments . There are a few too many holidays listed for me ( includes not only American holidays but also Canadian and Mexican ) . I do so wish the daily squares had lines . There are superfluous pages at the end ( future planning , contacts and notes ) as well as a list of holidays for the current year and the next three .
5 #### This is an excellent , no - nonsense planner for those who need to keep track of important occasions and dates ( some of them on the same day ) , with room to spare . It also includes important dates and holidays , eight pages for notes , and several for planning and other events . What I like best about this planner is that there is enough room to write several important occasions and/or appointments in each box due to one month taking up two pages , and each page is a generous 8.5 " X 11 " . The tabs and bungee cord make it easy to pick up where you left off , or go where you want to be . ACCO hits a home run with this informative , no - frills " At - A - Glance " 2016 monthly planner , for those who need lots of room to write . Last , but not least , is that the simple black " leatherette " look ( and feel ) , is always in style .
4 #### This is a nice , bound AT A GLANCE calendar . Unlike the more traditional brand calendars , this is far thinner and does n't use the wire bound binding . Thus , this is a softbound version , and is much thinner . As to planning , this is really meant for cursory appointments and the like . It is not meant for an extensive appointment calendar for each day from morning to night . Knowing that , for planning for cursory appointment details you could do far worse . This has the expected dates through Feb 2017 , and some planning areas and note taking areas . If this is something you use to jot down dates in a briefcase or similar , I would n't expect the binding to last and remain pristine , it is black , but I could see by the end of the year , it could get dog - eared and scuffed . If you understand the cursory nature , the nice - looking appearance and the ease of being able to take this anywhere , this is by all means really nice calendar that can become used and you wo n't care too much by the end of the year .
3 #### This At - a - Glance 2016 Monthly Planner is OK , but not great . The planner cover is a thin coated cardstock , and bends very easily . Will such a flimsy cover used on a daily basis , will the Planner make it through a year ? I 'm not so sure . Each month is done in an open 2 page format , and allows for a fair amount of space for each day , but these pages are also of a lesser quality paper , and if you bear down with an ink pen or write with a Sharpie , the writing is going to be seen on the next month 's page . The " Contact " area is very no - frills - simple lined boxes to write names and addresses . Overall , I 'm just not that impressed with this product . It 's not terrible , but it 's definitely not a high quality product .
4 #### This is pretty much your average month - at - a - glance planner , but it has the added benefit of a sleek , slim , and sturdy matte covering . I 'm also digging the closure band . A three - year calendar and holiday list are handy , as are the month thumb - tabs , and there are plenty of pages for notes and contacts . I 'm pleased with it .
4 #### This is handy if you need something that is light and can slip in the pocket of your laptop case . It 's a little thinner than I expected . It 's just a month - at - a - glance calendar with a few extras . Those extras include a place for notes in the back and also room for contacts . There is a small section called future planning which leaves room for a paragraph for each month . I do like the layout of the calendar pages . The boxes are nice and roomy and there is graph paper in the margins for writing some notes . I like the elastic that wraps around to keep it closed in my tote bag . The black matte cover does show smudges a lot . It 's a yardstick that feels like suede a little . I do wish that it would have been shipped in a cardboard mailer . It was in a padded manilla envelope and it got bent in shipping . This left the pages a little rippled , and being a perfectionist , I do n't like it . Of course , this is n't really the product 's fault , but the flimsiness of the covers lends itself to damage in shipping .
5 #### I buy this monthly planner annually for my elderly mom that likes to write her appointments down rather than put them on a computer or phone . The bungee cord has a good amount of tension that keeps the planner closed . The boxes for each of the 30/31 days are approximately 2x2 inches - which is a nice size for writing while giving the user the whole month to view on a centerfold ( two pages ) . All in all , very pleased with this planner .
5 #### These are better painted and a bit larger than I was expecting , which works greatly in their favor ! I ca n't wait to use these in my vacation photos in Hawaii ! ! =D
5 #### Great product . Fast shipping . Great value . My dog is not crazy about this new formula . Do n't know if it is the taste or smell . Wish they would go back to the old formula . Still works great . Thank you .
5 #### My cats love it and the company decided not to make it any more so was happy to find this
5 #### too bad it 's no longer available at a decent price .... I paid $ 50 and some change for the last bag ..... my dog really loves
4 #### I have an older dog and I was please to review the ingredients were just what I would put together to feed him .
5 #### I got this for my nephew . He adores the purple zombie and it is a " carry everywhere " toy . Shipping took awhile but that was to be expected .
4 #### Reading reviews , I 'm sure this functions fine . I purchased after reading on other sites , that this would be a good replacement for the Fluval Spec V pump , but it does n't fit in the pump 's slot , soooo .... I wound up replacing with a Fluval Spec pump , and just holding onto this as an emergency backup .
5 #### I love Jellycat stuffed animals . They 're all very well made and a great size for little arms . The material is super soft and the designs are awesome , I really love dragons so this one was a no - brainer ( for my daughter ) . His horn and spike tail are also very soft !
4 #### My dogs have been eating this mixed with their regular food for 3 weeks . They like it as much as any dry food I have offered and it is grain free . As these dogs are seniors I am cautious about what I feed their sensitive tummies . The high protein content has not been a problem . The food does have a funky smell that I find disagreeable ( -1 * ) but my daughter says it does not bother her .
3 #### For containing such high quality ingredients - I was disappointed that this lamb food also includes chicken . Often clients come to us with itchy dogs and we suggest that they try a different protein in the pet 's diet . Usually the pet is on either a beef or chicken diet and we suggest changing to something else . If a client made the attempt to switch to lamb and purchased this food , clearly it would not work since the proteins are mixed . Now if you have no allergy issues and for some reason need your dog on a high protein diet , then this would work . Neither of my dogs requires a high protein diet , and neither of them really enjoyed this food . I wo n't be purchasing this food for them unless for some reason we suddenly need a high protein diet , and there is n't a better alternative . I do think that at it 's current price point , you are spending a bit much for a lamb / chicken food .
5 #### I lost my original eyecup because the clip broke and it fell off the camera without me realizing it . Then I found this in Amazon and was surpised that the price was very reasonable ( except with shipping ) . It fits perfectly like the original and now I sometime forget that this one is a replacement .
5 #### High - protein and grain - free dog food that does n't contain artificial , chemical , or otherwise controversial ingredients . It 's a super high quality dog food . My dog went for it with gusto , though I know there are dog owners out there whose pets are a bit picky about food they 're unfamiliar with . My dog has literally never been hesitant to dive right into any food presented to her , and this was no exception . But I felt confident that she was getting a healthy meal here - we almost always serve grain - free as a rule ( and absolutely always corn- , soy- , and wheat - free foods ) . The only thing that was a personal hang up for me is the use of lamb . I do n't understand why anyone would choose lamb for their animal as a protein source over beef , chicken , or a fish protein source . Maybe if it was mutton I would n't feel bad about it , but I do n't use lamb ( or veal , for that matter ) in my own personal life and I do n't generally use it for my pet . But that 's not a knock on Nutro , I would just get a different flavor if I was getting their product again ( which I would n't hesitate to do ) . Yes , it 's pricey - but so is all high quality , grain - free dog food . Nutro is priced in line with competitors .
2 #### My parrot destroyed the original eyepiece that came with the camera ( at least she left the camera body and lens alone ! ) This eyepiece fits very loosely , and fell off twice while wearing my camera around my neck ( at least I noticed ) . Would definately not buy again .
4 #### Our dog had absolutely no issue digging right into this food . To be fair , she also eats out of the bathroom garbage pail , but I feel like she really liked this food . We 've had a few issues in the past with itchy skin or stomach issues when we 've used " cheap " brands from the supermarket . This bag was gone quickly and only it 's price may keep this from being the go - to choice . Our current compromise is a good quality item like this blended with a " medium priced " brand to have a good value / nutrition solution . She seems happy and has no ill - effects , so we 're all good !
4 #### This is a terrific dog food . My Shih Tzu loves it ! I like the fact that it is grain free and has plenty of protein . She must go for the Lamb flavor because this food is gone as soon as it hits the bowl . Nutro is a good company . I have used some of their other products . I think you can trust their products to be high quality . My little dog is very picky , so if she hates it , I end up throwing it out . She loves this brand . If you spoil your dog , this is a good brand for you . Our dog is like family , so I am extremely particular about what I feed her . I would highly recommend this dog food .
5 #### Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniels really enjoyed this dog food . This is quality dog food made with high quality ingredients . Recommended .
5 #### A good , healthy dry dog food . I like Nutro 's products and feel good about feeding them to our dog , their treats are also good . Our dog is fussy , but he likes anything Nutro I 've given him so far . I recommend it .
3 #### The second ingredient is chicken meal . Which would be ok they were more honest about that on packaging . This looks like it would be lamb without chicken , a must for some sensitive dogs . You only realize there is chicken in it if you look at the ingredients . And , since it is the second ingredient , one must deduce that there must be a significant amount of chicken meal .
5 #### The dogs favorite treat . When we have lunch he is ready for this treat .
5 #### Our dog loved this . To be honest , she is not a picky eater , so it is unusual when she does n't just dive in and eat . I like that the product is grain free and has more protein . She likes it because it tastes good . Win , win .
4 #### My dog is a picky eater and she seems to like this dog food . It has a milder smell and more pleasant to me that is not as pungent as her regular grain - free food from Natural Balance . The circular kibbles are small and of a nice size for my small dog to eat . The first two listed ingredients are lamb and chicken meal , followed by chickpeas and split peas , which appear to be the good source of the 32 % high protein content . Furthermore , I like that it has no grain , corn or wheat fillers , which do n't fill her up are just gon na make her poop more . I transitioned her into her new food over a couple of days by slowly and increasingly replacing her old kibbles with the new ones . She does n't seem to have a digestive problem with the new food . So far so good . This food claims to have a lower glycemic content but I have n't noticed anything different in my dog . So I 'm not sure how it works out benefit wise . All in all , this dog food seems like a quality product . I like that it 's grain free , wheat free and corn free , and contains a high protein content from meat and peas . It also smells good to me , and apparently to my dog too considering the way she gobbles it up . I would n't hesitate to buy it again .
4 #### The first ingredient in this dog food is lamb . ( Real lamb according to the package . ) This is not one of the limited ingredient foods . There are a lot of ingredients . The second ingredient is chicken meal and then chickpeas . Most of the ingredients are recognizable like alfalfa , potatoes , and sunflower oil . It has a lot of vitamins and that probably accounts for a lot of the ingredients . These are a kind of a small kibble . My dogs all weigh about 80 pounds , so it was slightly small for them but they did n't mind . Only one of the bowls was eaten right away , by our german shepherd . The other two were left for morning . Both of our border collies did not eat at their usual time . I did n't take this as a food protest though ; they probably just were n't hungry .
5 #### We love the Nutro High Protein and Grain Free dog food as we do not feed our girl anything that uses corn as well as trying to avoid wheat as much as possible . We do use dog foods with rice some of the time , but the recipe for this food uses chickpeas , which is a great alternative ! Isabelle loved the taste and had no issues with the food digestively as well . Nutro 's pet foods are a bit more expensive than many of the healthy alternatives , but we believe it is well worth the price .
5 #### My dog loved it and that 's a huge endorsement since he likes only homemade food .
4 #### Our very persnickety dog likes this food and ate it without prompting . Did not notice any other changes in her behavior , coat , etc . Am giving this four stars because the cost is very prohibitive , especially when I 'm unemployed . :(
3 #### Chewy seemed indifferent to this brand . He would sniff the bowl and then sort of pick at it but not really eat until he was really hungry , which of course meant instead of eating his food he would beg at the table for what we were eating instead . Nothing inherently wrong with the dog food insofar as ingredients . I like the fact that it is grain free and the rest of the ingredients are for the most part " normal " food items and not just strings of chemical compounds . He just did n't seem to be real interested in eating it . Maybe it just did n't smell tasty to him .
4 #### I am very pleased with this high protein dog food - and the dog likes it too ! Seriously , there are quite a few dog foods on the market now that have picked up on the fact that people are tired of feeding their dogs chicken feathers while the companies that make it pass those chicken feathers off as " protein " . Nutro has consistently been a reliable and trustworthy company . Way back in the 1980 's I worked part - time in a pet supply store and Nutro was the premiere dog food because they had a better product . While other dog food companies could truthfully boast that they were not putting " trash " in the dry dog food , Nutro was really making a difference . With the High Protein Grain Free Lamb dry food they 've apparently managed to hit the high mark as far as my dog is concerned . I 've been buying Nutro for years , but this food gets gobbled up quickly . I 'm sure part of it is that it is new - that always helps - but dogs are carnivores ( and omnivores more recently ) , so they really like meaty dog food . The price is quite reasonable for this food and I will be buying it for my dog .
5 #### Wow , I 'm glad this stuff worked out . I tried the other Nutro salmon stuff on my friend 's dog and he went into full - on Gandhi mode not even eating for days on end . When I put this stuff down , however , the little fluff ball ate it up like there was no tomorrow . Maybe it was the all protein , no grain aspect . Maybe it was the smaller kibble size , which is more appropriate for the smaller dog . Or maybe it was that it does n't taste like old fish . I do n't know and I 'm back in the dog 's good graces with this stuff .
4 #### My aged Yorkie eats Nutro 's Grain Free Lamb without problem . Since experiencing severe skin issues last year , I 've switched him to grain free products and his skin has cleared up . Nutro 's version does n't smell or look as appetizing to me as the product I 've been buying at PetSmart , but I 'm not the one eating it ! Since trying this product , there 's been no occurrance of skin issues , though my dog 's weight has crept up a bit and I 've had to cut back a bit on the amount . The ingredients seem to be sound nutirion . Nutro 's products are expensive , but if your dog has skin allergies , you may want to go grain free . It 's less expensive than vet bills !
5 #### Our dog suffers really bad allergies and while the source is not readily identifiable , we 've been doing our utmost in trying to give him some relief . One source has been a tea tree oil shampoo ( made for dogs ) which drastically has reduced his itching every time we give him a bath . We thought that perhaps his dog food might be another culprit . I was drawn to the fact that this was a grain free dog food and figured " what the heck . " He seems to like it just fine and although he still itches , I can report that it 's not as bad as it used to be ... he no longer itches to the point of breaking skin . Whether this is directly attributable to the dog food or not , I ca n't say with 100 % certainty , but I wo n't be returning to the regular dog food anytime soon as long as this keeps up .
4 #### My dogs had no problems with this food and appear to like it . I like that it is grain free and low glycemic . I also like that it has 32 % protein . I also like that the bag is easy to pour and resealable . Nutro dry dog foods tend to average 4 to 5 stars with Dog Food Advisor and I am impressed by that . What I am not so impressed with is the price . The current listed price for the 4 pound bag is $ 18.98 , which makes this dog food about $ 4.75 per pound . That is just too expensive for me with multiple dogs .
5 #### I got this food for my English Springer Spaniel . He always provides a litmus test for dog foods . He has severe food allergies and gets bad reactions to ( almost ) any food that is not grain - free . Even some grain - free choices have caused rashes and itching . So far he has done very well on this food . He also likes the taste and shows other signs of good health ( although it 's admittedly hard to tell much difference after one small bag ) . I always stop on over to DogFoodAdvisor and see what they have to say . This food scores pretty high , a rare 4.5 stars out of 5 , putting it up there with the most expensive grain - free foods ( obviously where it belongs ! ) . The main ingredient is lamb , followed by other high - protein ingredients . There are very few " bad " ingredients . The only real downside to this dog food is that it costs a lot . $ 67 for a mere 24 pounds puts it among the most expensive dog food I have ever fed to my dogs . But , if you have a small pooch to feed , if your dog has special health demands , or if for any other reason this food suits your dog best , it 's worth the price . This is high quality stuff .
5 #### According to the dogs who gobbled this down , it tastes mighty good . I am happy that it is also good for them . The price seems a little high . You have to decide if your dog is worth it .
5 #### My dog does n't get just dry kibble in her diet , so she did n't gobble this down the first time she was presented with it . However , she does eat it and she has n't turned away from it . She is a healthy little 11 pound terrier mix with lots of energy and no tummy issues , but I still want to feed her the best food I can possibly afford . I liked that I could pronounce the ingredients on the label , though it did seem a lot of the ingredients were plant - based instead of meat . It did n't seem to both my little girl , though . And she is known to eat her fair share of carrots and green beans with relish , so she seems to enjoy a somewhat varied diet . The Nutro line of pet food products seems to have a good reputation , and the product is made here in the United States . The only thing that would concern me about recommending this product to some one else is the price point . There are other products on the market that I feel are equal to this at half the price - even here at Amazon ! I would suggest pet owners weigh everything and make a decision that is right for them and their fur buddy .
5 #### My dog loves this food and it is so good for him . DOesn't have that bad of a smell . I have been putting a little of a couple other dog foods i m his bowl with this one and he always eats this one and leaves the other . He is a picky eater :}
4 #### A high protein , low glycemic food has a lot to offer a dog . This food is indeed high in protein , and offers some high quality protein sources . However , rather than grain , it has potatoes . It also has chickpeas and split peas , which they do point out . If you read the ingredients , you will see dried potatoes . I do n't like that they fail to mention this in the heading when they mention the peas . Grain free is great ; but there are much better options than regular potatoes . Sweet potato would be much better . Dr. Dodds new book Canine Nutrigenomics : The New Science of Feeding Your Dog for Optimum Health , offers great info on this topic , especially about the benefits of a low glycemic food . So , nutrition - wise , I think this food is good but not great . Two of my three dogs eat this readily . One is less impressed and will sometimes pass this food up .
5 #### Love these calendars ! Missed the boat this year purchasing it at Costco or Sam 's Club ( teach me to get sick at the end of a year ) ; so , I was very happy to see I could find it on Amazon . I hated paying more than I 'm used to , but it 's better than having my whole 2015 year with a calendar that has no function ( pockets , lines , stickers , etc ) and just pictures of cars , horses , cats , country singers , etc .
4 #### My husband teaches pre - school children with severe disabilities and needed something to carry his IPad and other miscellaneous items that he seems to lose on a daily basis in his current " man purse . " I purchased this backpack in hopes that it would take care of this dilemma . It is very well constructed , but he still needs to learn how to use the compartments more effectively . Hopefully , that will happen over a short period of time .
5 #### I have 3 cats . This is the only food that they will ALL eat without getting upset stomachs .
4 #### I like the packaging , scent , product works wonders . I recommend this product . It 's affordable . Smooth transaction , arrived on time .
4 #### I would like Boise papers better if their colors were not quite so bold ; it is a bit difficult to read print on some of them . The colors tend to be darker than what is shown on Amazon . But the paper is good enough quality and the price is right .
3 #### My dogs eat them off and on but they are very fussy so I have to give them other treats most of the time . I think for a dog that has not been spoiled , they would do well
4 #### Our sensitive stomached Lab mix has done well on these . I like the fact they are bone shaped , so I can shove in toys , yet soft enough that I can break them to only give him half as a treat .
5 #### When you order a plush toy from the Jellycat brand , you ALWAYS get what you pay for , so no price is unfair . I started collecting the bunnies a couple years ago when I came across them in the store . I thought they were the cutest things I 've seen in a while and it 's been a wrap ever since . Dylan is downright adorable . His " fur " is not the usual smooth fur but a mixed direction to create texture ( of scales , I imagine ) . It 's still the same amount of softness you 'd expect . His wings seem to be brushed cotton . The red is vibrant and actually very close to the picture . I want to say I 'm surprised but honestly , I 'm not . I only buy this brand of plush animals for a reason . No , I do n't know how a child would react because I purchase them for myself . :)
5 #### Perfect calendar for holding birthday cards and bills . Never miss an important date .
5 #### I have been buying the Avalanche " Note Nook " pocket calendar for myself and each member of my family for 4 - 5 Christmases now . We all love the pockets in the front of each month , for storing play tickets , birthday cards for months down the road , or as I use it , for keeping shipping records for my Ebay purchases and sales . There are so many different design themes that will appeal to anyone . I just wish Avalanche would bring back the zen Asian motif though .
5 #### Great for filleting large fish . That is what we bought it for .
3 #### cats did not like these , as promised in advertising ! Wasted money so I gave them to the local shelter !
5 #### I buy one of these each year for my elderly parents . It is easy to read , room to write appointments , and they love the pockets . The only problem is that there too many pretty calendars to choose from !
5 #### The product was exactly like it was advertised . I have used the calendars with envelopes ever since I can remember , and this is one of the prettiest , sturdiest calendars I 've ever had . What 's more , the shipping came immediately ! It was here for January 1 , although I ordered it late ! Good service for a good product ! The attached envelopes at the bottom of each month are handy for keeping notes to myself , doctor 's appointment cards , addresses or phone numbers -- whatever you need to keep handy and be more efficient .
5 #### Touchable softness , loveable features , and quality construction make the 13 inch Jellycat Dylan Dragon a charmer . This raspberry - red darling the color shown in the description is quite accurate gives Grandma one more reason to continue purchasing Jellycat stuffed animals for her little darlings to cuddle as their lovies . Jellycat Dylan Dragon has the ultra - soft fur that is a hallmark of Jellycat stuffed toys . It feels wonderful to the touch and makes these animals very cuddly . Jellycat Dylan Dragon features velvety , felt - like wings , spines and a tail - tip ; although these features are not actually velvet , they are not felt . His little black eyes peek out from underneath his fur . Jellycat is my favorite brand of stuffed toys . Each creature is carefully made , soft and cuddly , and very , very loveable . Jellycat Dylan Dragon is no exception 5 - stars from Grandma and her grandson !
5 #### my sister in law loved it . keep having more .
5 #### My husband has been making delicious donuts using these cutters . Like that they are stainless steel .
4 #### Pretty good , but the plastic window suckers do break if you pull too hard .
5 #### I make my own envelopes , and this is great to use to ship my products that I make and sell from my etsy store at http://www.etsy.com/shop/Aim4Beauty . I sell handmade belly rings , and steampunk Necklaces . I also even ship vintage watch parts and pocket watches in these envelopes I make from this nice heavy duty paper and I sell these stuff at http://www.etsy.com/shop/Aim4Goodies . Great to print on a normal printer too !
5 #### I love these calendars . I get one every year . And they are pretty too . Helps me stay organized .
5 #### I have to give my dog treats with no corn or wheat and treats without these ingredients can sometimes be hard to find . These soft treats are his absolute favorite and they are a good value on Amazon .
5 #### These are the BEST Calendars by far , The calendar is made from Top quality paper , the dual pockets are great for bills , school papers , medical appointment paperwork . I have used them for at least 5 years now . My favorite it the Butterfly Calendar
5 #### Product arrived timely and in good shape . Very good quality material . Would buy this maker 's items again .
5 #### My youngest wnated to ge ther sister a stuffed peacock ... I have no idea why . It 's cute , colorful and soft .
5 #### Excellent backpack . Never had one that was made this well .
5 #### I have a small dachshund who developed an allergy to chicken . This is one of the few treats I 've been able to find without any kind of poultry meal , poultry by - product etc . I used to be able to buy it locally , but now no one carries it . Was really glad to find it on amazon .
3 #### My dogs do not like these at all . They wo n't even try them . Never had that response before . So now I do n't know what to do with them !
5 #### Works well , makes the cuticles really soft and you only need very little . Will buy again !
5 #### Since starting this product 3 weeks ago , my extremely arthritic german shepherd / collie mutt has been able to resume her favorite pastimes of counter surfing and knocking the trashcan off the table so that she may snuffle around for snacks at her leisure . Also , the other day she jumped over a foot high fence around the garden - that has been able to keep her out because I 've never seen her jump in 5 years . Both of these activities are a foot above her head and require the use of her " bad " back legs . It 's been a year of trying to find a supplement her stomach can handle , with no incidences . Well , it 's back to padlocks and impenetrable safe boxes . Thanks Halo for helping my pound dog be herself again .
5 #### I use this brand often for work and love it .
5 #### Soooo cute & squishable ! Need one for home & one at sitter 's !
4 #### My cat is not all that excited about this , but she eats it sometimes , and it seems to be good for her .
4 #### The product I received is the black jar that is pictured . One reviewer mentioned she got a white jar instead . According to Halo 's website they have changed the formula and it is in a white jar . The ingredients on this page listed under , " important information " lists the ingredients of the new formula only . To read the ingredients of the black jar blow up those pictures . The only side effect I have noticed is my Maltese dog 's long moustache and beard turn yellow after eating this supplement sprinkled on his food . But everything else is all positive . My dog is 8 years old and it was getting more difficult to jump up on the sofa , he would get stiff a lot and have to stretch before moving and he did n't run as much and could n't walk very fast either . Well , that has all changed . He is not only jumps on the sofa , he can jump in the car again . And he is running fast again and his stiffness has disappeared . All of these improvements happened in just 3 weeks . I hope the new formula is just as good because this one is good as gold . Very cost effective since I only had to use 1/2 tsp / day !
5 #### I have purchased these four times . My puppy loves them and it keeps him from chewing on everything else in the house .
5 #### Works great . I 've used several versions of this same model motor for a fountain , but the cats drink out of it . After a while , the motor would get clogged up . This version has clear directions that tell you how to take it apart to clean it out .
5 #### I am a 42 - year old woman and yes ... I bought this for myself . I cuddle him sometimes while I sleep . If that 's wrong , I do n't wanna be right . I have named him Ben and he is awesome . He is VERY soft . And I love that he 's floppy -- the beanie things are all in his hands and feet and bottom . So he sits just like this picture . He is also very well made and has sturdy construction , for those of you thinking of purchasing him for a child .
5 #### My boys are 13 and 12 yrs old so this stuff is like a miracle worker . They run and play like young pups without the pain they would normally have with out the expensive vet meds .
5 #### This is my labs favorite treat . She is a stronger chewer , but these last surprisingly for a long time . I highly recommend these treats ...
5 #### Wonderful donut cutters . Very well made and they work beautifully .
5 #### What else can you say . The item arrived on time and as advertised . The dogs love them !
5 #### I like the no mess and the dogs love it , even my cat eats them . Like that it 's all natural too .
5 #### My poodles like them . I have ordered these several times so they are a hit in this house .
5 #### I 've purchased this pump several times for my outdoor fountains and they give you good height for bring a small pump . Will keep buying as needed .
5 #### My 3 - year old dog has been eating these since she was a puppy . She likes to unroll them , eat the meat first , then chew on the rawhide . These treats calm her right down when she starts acting crazy .... I have them on automatic re - order because we ca n't live without them !
5 #### My dog loves them and even though they 're made in China , appear to be of good quality or at least I 've never had a problem with them . But here again they are made in China , which always makes me a little nervous .
2 #### I was sent two cutters for doughnuts with holes . Both identical with same item number . Decided to keep .
5 #### The only food my Ragdolls will eat ...... at 10 years old their coats are gorgeous and silky smooth . My cats are healthy and happy . I can no longer find Eukanuba locally so thank goodness I can order it from Amazon .
5 #### It came within two days of ordering , very fast ! Was packaged well , looks exactly like the picture ! it 's soft , tail has a posable wire in it but also has an extremely soft material making up the tail . It sits up on it 's own and is perfect ! I had no ordering issues and would absolutely buy from this seller again . Thanks for sending me what i was hoping it would be , a perfect stuffed peacock . :)
5 #### My dogs love these treats . I have bought them many times and the quality is always consistent . I like the fact that Nylabone makes these as it is a trusted brand . I will continue to order these .
4 #### My dogs liked them , but I am looking for a chew that lasts longer . They were gone within 5 - 10 minutes
5 #### The flooring is hard on the dogs so when they changed the supplement I was giving them , I tried this and it is easy to use , and they are having no trouble with their feet and legs . The 7 lb poodle had luxateing patelals and had an operation on both back legs and is able to run again . Thanks for a good product .
5 #### What do I really need to say . We plugged it in and it worked . Guess that is all there is .
5 #### Both my dogs love these things . Whenever I give them these I 'm tempted to take a bite . they have that chewy cookie look . The packages are dated and the product is made in the US .
5 #### My Ragdolls seem to like it and it keeps their hairballs to a minimum , so I am happy . I will continue to purchase this product , perhaps in different flavors , but in this type and brand . My breeder recommends it , my veterinarian recommends it and so do I ! ! ! !
5 #### Adorable red dragon . Looks a little purple online but more of a deep red color . My 4 year old was super excited to receive this from the Easter Bunny .
5 #### My dogs love these biscuits . Ca n't get enough of them . Keeps their breath nice n teeth cleaner than even my brushing them . Great buy .
1 #### Made in CHINA CHINA CHINA . My dog threw up . This stuff is from China . You do n't want it for your dog long term health .
5 #### For such a hefty item to be shipped , amazon has an excellent price compared to local retail . This is a higher end product and my cat loves it . he has been eating it since a baby though so he does n't really know better . Love having it shipped to my doorstep .
5 #### This paper is great ! It is a good weight and the color is SUPER bright ! I will be ordering again .
5 #### I traveled with my 16 lb Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . She fit very well under the seat in front of me . She was asleep before we left the gate , and remained comfortable throughout the flight . The case is very easy to carry on shoulder or with handles looped over rolling bag ( travel partner 's carry - on ) . Very sturdy construction , I expect it to last for many happy trips !
5 #### The zipper works well . My kitty fits well in it . He is a big kitty . He is comfortable in the bag . When I am carrying the bag , it is comfortable .
5 #### I have a few of the Jellycat stuffed animals and continue to get them just because of how much my daughter loves them . They are soft , well made , and although on the bit expensive side complete worth it because they get a lot of use from the kiddo at bedtime , tea parties , and as " friends " during the day . I also have the elephant and sloth and she loves them all .
5 #### This is the 3rd Fujifilm memory card that I 've purchased from Amazon . They all work fine and have not had any problems . I expect this card to be trouble free also . Good price and free shipping if you want it .
5 #### Perfect for the Fluvla Spec V. With very few easily done modifications it fit perfectly in the overflow box . The flow is so much better and left more than enough room for my heater . There is of course some hum but wrapping the unit in foam deafens this considerably . No louder than a moderate sized skimmer for those concerned .
5 #### Used this for biscuits and cuts wonderful . Now I do n't have to use a glass . Biscuits came out of mold with no problems so doughnuts should do the same .
3 #### I bough five beef treats and five chicken treats . I was disappointed that all the beef treats had an expiration date("best by " ) of only 3 months away . The chicken treats had a " best by " date of eight months away . Amazon replaced the beef treats ... but unfortunately with the exact same " best by " date treats ; subsequently they credited me . My dog seemed to really like the chicken treats ... he was a little fickle with the beef treats . Admittedly my puppy ( 14 year old Lhaso ) is rather spoiled . I would probably buy the chicken treats if they were nice and fresh with a LONG expiration date . I am giving this purchase a middle of the road rating .
5 #### Miss Bluebird knows that sometimes you just ca n't make it when sending Christmas cards out and she says these are wonderful to have .
5 #### I took off the front and back covers with a little bit of trim work to fit inside my fluval spec V tank . Twice the flow as what came with the fluval . Love it !
5 #### Bought these for my dad . He made us all donuts . They seem to be good and sturdy . The donuts came out great .
5 #### I love this product . I keep it in my purchase and use it after every manicure and I rarely get hangnails . If I do n't use it after a manicure , I always get hangnails . Not sure if that 's because of the product , but I would have to think it is .
5 #### He loves them . Not much else to say , he 's thoroughly satisfied and so I am as well . My cat chewed into the bag though , I guess she smelled the chicken .
5 #### Very high quality at a very reasonable price . Heavy duty material with a very well thought out barrel protector for the muzzle . Good protection for mounted optics , heavy zippers and generous pocket .
5 #### I 'm a professional chef so I 'm a little choosy and snobbish about my knives . This knife is well balanced , has a good cimeter curve , stays sharp , is easy to sharpen , and has the lifetime warranty from Kershaw . I live in Portland , OR , and free sharpening from Kershaw is the reason why many of my cooking knives and my pocket knives are Kershaw , KAI , or Shun . The blade guard that comes with it is great too and fits the curve perfectly . This knife does a nice job when you are breaking down a big piece of meat . Its also good for chasing your mis - behaving employees around the kitchen with . ( Just kidding , I use my serrated knife for that ) .
5 #### This was a gift for my 5 - year old grandson . He has carried it with him for weeks . It 's very soft .
5 #### This is the only food I 've found that my cats will readily eat without becoming sick . All other brands I 've tried they either ignore or they vomit out shortly after eating . Unfortunately , neither Petsmart or Petco carry this brand of catfood , so I have to order it here .
5 #### My son loves this one . We read a book about Dragons before bed . He likes telling us about his Dragon . He likes the wings , his tail , the color . We like that it 's well made and soft . Good buy !
5 #### My cockapoo loves this beef treat ! It is healthy and is soft . I add half of one to his breakfast and dinner . He loves it ! Highly recommend . One word of advice .... I order the 5 pack of both the beef flavor and the chicken flavor . The expiration on the 5 packs of beef is in April . While I have until October regarding the Chicken flavor . So make sure before ordering in bulk that you will be able to use it up before expiration date .
5 #### I 've been looking for a chew / treat that will last my Welsh Terrier longer than 5 minutes and I came across these . I like that these are n't all rawhide and that there is a soft chicken flavored center , which my dog loves . These take him about 15 - 20 minutes to eat and he 's always very excited when I take 1 out of the bag .
5 #### Our dog lives these treats and is very happy with these since she is allergic to chicken . We love the treats
5 #### used this for my dog to travel on airplane . my dog loves it and sometimes just sleeps in it ( my biggest fear is that he would be scared of it and never go in it ) . fit perfectly under plane seat in United airplane .
4 #### I gave 4 stars because my dogs love these treats but they are made in China . I should have paid closer attention to the package and the missing American flag . But the dogs love them !
4 #### Even though this product is NOT the traditional rawhide chew and therefore does n't last long , I buy it because it contains prebiotics which eliminates the need for yogurt ( or other medications)mixed in dog food or treats ( per vet instructions)due to my dog being on frequent antibiotics for UTI 's . Great price with free shipping . This product sells for 24.95 at Petsmart when you can find it . The only problem I have with this product is the package seal - doesn't seal properly once this package is opened . Would like to see this product sell as save and subscribe to prevent monthly ordering .
5 #### My dog loves them - and that makes me happy . What else could a person ask for in a dog treat ?
5 #### Our dogs love these treats , and we do too as they have healthy ingredients . We purchase them as soon as the supply goes down .
5 #### My boy LOVES these ! I like to give him one as a before bedtime treat when we run through a few learning exercises . He is very focused , as he knows he will be getting one of these at the end our our lesson . This is one of the few treats I 've found that have this consistent enjoyment on his part . The price is very good , too , as these are considerably higher at Petsmart or Petco . Unfortunately the bacon flavored ones are $ 10 higher at the moment . I 'm hoping these stay the same low price !
5 #### Works just fine and the holes do come out . We had no problems using it . This has said it all .
5 #### great soft treat for my pup ... I do this as a save and subscribe , it works out great for me and my sweet pup !
5 #### Milkbone please keep making these treats , I can no longer find them in stores in our town . These are are one of the only treats I can feed my two yorkies that do n't contain Chicken products . Since we removed chicken from their diet completely they no longer have allergies , ear infections , and most importantly , no more vomiting in our carpet . Our vet said that after he recommended removing chicken from most of his patients diets , he 's actually lost revenue because so many of our pets are no longer sick as often .
5 #### excellent quality very good product and far less expensive than Staples and the quality is as good if not better than Staples
5 #### My standard poodle loves these and when I could no longer purchase them at my local Petsmart or in any other store in our area I turned to Amazon . I really do n't know what I will do when I can no longer find them- these are great because my dog can enjoy them without getting stomach problems . She loves them and we give her one whenever we go out to keep her busy and happy
5 #### My dog begs for these at night after she has her dinner ... they are hard to buy in the store so found them online
4 #### We like Eukanuba . We feed this brand to our dog and two cats . I normally buy the Sensitive Stomach instead of this bag but decided to try it because it was cheaper . My cat ended up barfing up hair balls so back to the Sensitive Stomach . Otherwise they ate this and never complained .
5 #### This was a great product and a great value . I would recommend these , as a dog lover . they were gobbled up
3 #### I recently purchased the " Allen Dakota Gear Fit Scoped Rifle Case 48 - inch Green Black " here on Amazon for $ 36 and this Plano 400 series for $ 35 . They are both comparable in quality . Pro 's of this Plano case include : - This Plano 400 has a rubber muzzle protector sewn on , that is very good . - The pockets are all sewn into the the case in a more logical manner . - The material is reinforced on the bottom . Short - coming : - The zipper does not seem as sturdy as the Allen rifle case . Both cases have average padding to protect protect your rifle . I returned both cases and ordered two others in the $ 50-$55 range . I 'm looking for better protection and quality without going to a hard case .
5 #### Got this to raise the flow level in my Fluval Spec 5 and it definitely does that ! The flow is fantastic !
5 #### My husband got me the one with the straw as a surprise one day to help me drink more water . It worked . I used it so much the paint wore off the outside . This will keep water cold all day even in a hot car . I could n't find anymore at Target , thank you Amazon ! !
5 #### Great little pump ! This is my third one but for other uses ... only had one quit and that was after 12 years !
4 #### great but this gets stuck in my pocket so often that s and its not really worth it four more words
5 #### Arrived on time and in good condition . Looks to be a good quality knife at a fraction of the cost of a forschner . I plan to use it for filleting salmon . I havn't gotten a chance to use it yet , so time will tell how well it holds up , but innitially I 'm impressed with the finish and quality .
5 #### I love these and in fact bought this waterbottle for the second time after my daughter dropped it so awkwardly that the top was broken . It is very pretty , however I with I could put this in the dishwasher without the beautiful design coming off after several washes , however , pretty much all thermoses do that . I would buy this again .
5 #### My little fat maltese did n't fit into his old carrier anymore , and we went to PETCO to shop around and being the dramatic dog he has always been , he went ballistic and hopped into this one at the store and would n't get out and he is very obedient to me . So since he was whining I as his loving pack leader ordered it for him for half the price from here , thank you so much . I love this bag , I can choose to keep him covered or if it 's cold I can block out the elements with ease and no one has a clue I 'm carrying a dog , perfect !
5 #### My cats have been on this food for 14 + years they love it and I do n't have to buy too expensive or too cheap . This is just right and keeps them healthy .
5 #### Purchasing meat in bulk and cutting it down requires a very sharp knife . This Kershaw cimeter knife does is perfectly . Slices through with ease . Nice safe blade cover as well .
4 #### It 's sturdy and comfortable for my little 16 lb . dog . He 's a size such that a smaller one seems to be too cramped for him , so this is very roomy for the guy . It 's not heavy , so I can easily carry him in there . I do have decent upper body strength , though . The material is sturdy , but that makes it bulky . I sometimes wish I would have purchased some more standard bag instead of the ultimate , but who knows .
5 #### I love this leash ! I have a 120 lb . rottie / shepard mix . He s a big , strong boy and he likes to explore while on our walks , so the length is really great . I feel very secure using this heavy duty leash . I have just ordered a new one , as the one i have is about 2 years old and the spring inside which rolls the tape back up has kind of loosened up and the first foot or so of tape dosent retract anymore . But i can not complain at all after using this for almost 2 years , almost daily . So its a great product , and i hear they are going to discontinue them . I hope not . This is the best leash i ve ever owned ! ! ! !
5 #### Great quality , thick padding . Fits a CZ 455 LUX with a large scope and rings permanently attached . Side pockets are large enough to hold magazines , paperwork , etc . Glad I decided to go with this over the 300 series . CZ 455 LUX has a 20.6 " barrel and 39 " overall length . This fits perfectly !
5 #### This is the second one of these I have bought . I take them to work with me . I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse and it will keep my drink cold for much of those 12 hours .
5 #### We took our cat on his first flight . He was n't too thrilled , even with his calming kitty treats . However , this carrier was perfect . It fit a little tight under the middle seat on a Southwest flight , had to squish the top and sides a little . However , this was n't too bad because the rest of the time my cat had a little extra room to stretch . The outside pocket was very practical , and the foldable flaps meant we could make sure he had enough ventilation . The strap is comfortable to carry , we did n't try the shoulder strap because of his comfort . Finally , having the option of dropping him in or through the side flap was great , specially for putting him back inside after security check .
5 #### I have been buying this treat for my two 10 yr old Westies . They just love them . When given to them , it takes them a long time to finish it .
4 #### My Siberian Husky is a VERY picky eater , but enjoys the Milk Bone Healthy Favorites Chewy Treats whether Beef or Chicken . I wish there were more in each package ! !
5 #### Usually Milk Bone products I do n't buy but these were on sale and I thought I would try these out . My two dogs just love these treats . For them , these are just as good or better than higher priced items . Because they are soft , I interchange them with harder treats so their teeth stay clean . This is a treat I would definitely buy for them again next time I catch a sale .
5 #### My dogs tend to spit out pills , so I just sprinkle this on top of their food . I have several " oldies " , but they 're still going strong . Have been feeding this product for years now .
5 #### Our kitty is 9yrs old , 11lbs and about 19 inches long from nape to base of tail . She , of course , knew this was a carrier , and of course was skeptical of it . We left it out a bit for to become accustomed to it and sniff it as much as she wanted . Yesterday when we took her to the vet , she of course did n't want to get into the bag , we had been trying to get her in with treats , which worked during the week when we were trying to get her accustomed . In the end we got her in ( not w/o a bit a crying from our MamiCat ) and started on our journey to the vet . it was raining lightly and the bag is really good for warmth , we could see her and she could see us with the " window Shades " and i believe she would have been comfortable if she was n't so nervous . We got this deal really great ( $ 50 ! ) and could n't believe the value . I would have paid almost 3x that much if I would have bought this at a brick and mortar store . Great buy
5 #### After being so satisfied with my green medium carrier , I purchased my 2nd Sherpa carrier in a large since one of my pup has grown so much . The red one that has flaps that can be kept down for privacy and to block the cold air on the airplane floor . If the pup wants or needs extra ventilation and visibility , the flaps can be rolled up and hooked to a ring on the handles . It comes with a large side pocket for carrying collapsable bowls , treats and toys . The material is of excellent quality . When I had both carriers , the green and red , on the floor last night my pups jumped from one to the other . They love them both , and I do , too .
3 #### This product states for dogs , although some people report that they safely give it to their cats in small doses . I should have done the research before ordering , but the questionable ingredient is alfalfa , apparently . If you google this , there is some concern about cats ingesting this , although may be just in large quantities . Probably safe , but I just do n't want to risk it with my older cat . So I 'll use this up on my dog , but not the most cost effective product for glucosamine / chondroitin for dogs . I 'll order cosequin for cats , which my vet recommended in the 1st place , but I had thought the powder form would be easier than opening the capsules ....
4 #### Heavy materials used throughout . Nice that all flaps can be opened for viewing in or out . I would buy again .
4 #### The Flexi Brand Leashes are nice looking , comfortable to hold and easy to control . Our dog can smoothly move in front of and around us and the leash extends and retracts smoothly . My hands are a little weak from injuries , and I found the Flexi Giant Leash ( 26 foot ) to be so heavy I could not comfortably use it . I use the Flexi Comfort 3 Leash ( Large , not XL ) which is shorter but considerably lighter . However , the large may not meet the needs of a very large dog or one that needs " distance " on the leash . This line of leashes ca n't be beaten ! Just be sure when you purchase the XL that you are aware it is very heavy and large .
5 #### ever since eukanuba has been making cat food it 's all i have fed to my kitties . from the kitten food on up i have had excellent results in terms of acceptance of the food to overall health of my cats . they utilize more of the food thus there is less waste , which is very noticable when you have 4 cats . their coats have a healthy shine and there is never a problem with dry skin . it 's a bit pricier than most cat foods but , to me , it 's well worth the extra money . i do mix it half and half with the hairball formula since three of the cats are strictly indoor cats .
5 #### i m so obsessed with this carrier . its so sturdy and has a one year warranty ! it fits my 18 pound dachshund and he absolutely loves it , along with my 7 pound dachshund . this carrier is high quality and i will be buying from the company again . more than happy with this product !
5 #### My big Maine Coon cat Sean Coonery loves this food ! If you want a healthy and happy cat , I highly recommend this food . My cat also made a video review and the video review can be found here [ ... ] . I order this food exclusively from Amazon because of the free shipping !
4 #### This is the second Sherpa bag I purchased , but the first Ultimate bag . My Cavalier King Charles Spaniel outgrew my first Classic carrier ( medium ) . My only complaint with this bag is that the retaining strap used by the seat belt is on the wrong side of the bag . When placed in the car with the strap to the rear , the air panel faces the back of the rear seat , not the front of the vehicle . In order to use this successfully in the car , the seat belt now has to strap over the front of the bag , so my dog can have visibility and better air flow . Sherpa products are great , but this one needs a moment of thought for a simple redesign .
4 #### This is a well - made , fairly easy to use flexi - leash . What I do n't like about all flexi - leashes is that it teaches the dog to pull ; therefore I wo n't be using it . However , for those of you who like flexi - leashes , this is a well - made , one - button leash for large dogs . The unit is kinda heavy , but has to be if you 're walking a 100 lb . dog . I never really got used to the button for stopping and holding the leash because I used it 3 times before putting it away . I have trained my dogs to walk without pulling and by the third time on the flexi - leash they were all starting to pull -- not good . I will go back to carrying a 20 ft . training lead for when they want to off - road ; it 's not nearly as heavy and I have an easier time on recall . The 4 stars rating is because it is well - made , retracts quickly but is heavy .
5 #### this was a great investment . i have two dachshunds and they sleep in this bag in my room . they love it . they have both learned how to get in it on their own and they run to my room every night and crawl in . i actually bought a second one to replace this one if it wears out . the bottom is also a leak proof nylon so if they have an accident it wo n't damage the carpet .
4 #### 4.5 stars if i could give half stars . I was looking for a large enough bag , with as much privacy possible . This bag has 2 side panels that you can roll up to allow more visibility , or keep down to allow minimal visibility . It 's roomy inside enough for my 17 - lb french bulldog puppy . The one complaint that i have about this bag is that the shoulder strap is not cushioned , and the rubber part should stay in the middle of the strap to provide minimal cushioning , but it slides off to the end and the strap easily slides , which creates a longer strap than i can handle ( ( I 'm only 5'2 " ) . after a few seconds , the lack of cushioning on the shoulder strap really creates a burn in my shoulder when I have to lug my puppy around .
5 #### ... but the product is tough and effective for dogboarding . I can only hope that over time it stays strong , not like our others ( cheapies ) that we retired from use , not only b / c of breaking , but the potential danger of breaking and injury that very well could result from such an accident .
5 #### These are great leashes for taking my big dogs for walks . Gives them plenty of room to explore . This is my second set . The first ones still worked , but one was starting to show signs of difficulty on retracting . I had the original leashes for about 5 years and used them almost every day for an hour or more each day .
5 #### We have a 100 pound Akita , and love the Flexi Gian Leash . This is the 3rd one we have purchased . The price was the best yet , and it arrived quickly . I would highly recommend this leash to anyone with a big or strong dog .
5 #### I have a lab / sheppard puppy who is not even a year old and all muscle . I bought this leash because it was recommended to me and you ca n't buy a heavy duty leash like this at your local pet store . I love it and it works great . I would recommend this leash to anyone with a large dog .
5 #### I had my aging cat on this for years . She had arthritis in her legs and I KNOW it worked because once , I ran out and she stiffened up immediately . As soon as I put her back on the product she was fine . They say this product is for dogs only but it is fine for cats too , they only had to make this labeling distinction recently , I do n't remember why . Make sure you do nt ' give them a dog - size dosage though ! just a little sprinkle a day .
5 #### I 've had this saw a month or so now and I am impressed with it . It cuts great and the blade they send with it is very good . I 'm remodeling our house doing pretty heavy construction and this saw has taken all I 've thrown at it . I wish the front grip had some rubber on it for better hand hold but I 'm adjusting .
5 #### This is a great and smooth cutting saw . I love it and probably wo n't ever need to buy another one . The LED light is useless as others have mentioned , but I did n't expect it to be anything special . Highly recommended over other similar priced saws .
5 #### I used to use American tools like Sears Craftsman and Skill Saws for 20 years . The problem is that the motors are not well made . They last well , but they start up with a jerk which is not a great thing , you have to wait a second and let them calm down to use them . If you are in the middle of a board or piece of plywood then you have to try to hold them so they do n't jerk a knoch out of the board . Also they are loud and noisy . I use a head set so the noise does not effect my thinking - consentration about what I am doing . This Makita has better winding on the motor and better brushes so is purrs to life and you do n't have to worry about it jerking in your hand . It is also quite . It feels balanced and is simple to cut with , of course the blade you use is everything . The aluminum housing is great too , it is a snap to line up a cut and keep it lined up through the board . But this saw or the Bosche would be my pick . I am a contractor in Florida .
5 #### The&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Aukey - USB - Car - Charger - Power - Adapter-36W-7 - 2A-3Ports / dp / B00OZ5BQ36 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Aukey USB Car Charger Power Adapter ( 36W/7.2A 3Ports)</a>&nbsp;is a powerful tool to stay charged in the car and here is why . When traveling , I 'm always in need of charging something while I 'm out and about or on the road for business . I have my tablet for work , my tablet for personal use , my phone , it 's a lot to keep charged . The Aukey charger makes all that recharging simple . The Aukey charger features 3 total USB charging ports , all three rather universal and offering maximum charging up to 2.4A Each ! Impressive . With the Aukey charger , I am able to use all 3 ports at the same time with maximum amperage , and I have n't had a compatibility issue yet across Apple , Android or other devices . Overall , this charger from Aukey is a truly powerful charger available at a budget charger price . It 's great for anyone that needs to keep a spare in your bag for any random occasion . Just two days ago , I found the charger extremely useful in a rental car I had that did not have any USB charging ports . That made this product a true life saver . I love that it has universal ports and offers up 2.4A on each port . [ Review Sample Provided For Evaluation And Review ]
5 #### I 've used this in my Toyota Camry Hybrid and charged my iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung S2 at the same time . I never encountered any errors and my phones were all charging like normal . I like that it has a blue led when you plug it in to show that it is on . The 3 outlet design is convenient because I can charge my phone and my wife 's , plus a passenger if need be . The charger works as advertised and fits in my car socket perfectly . I recommend it . Complimentary sample provided for review .
5 #### Something most chargers were lacking is enough ports and enough power . This solves it all . I can have 3 ports charging at one time , and all at 2 + amps . That 's a faster charge for every device . I always walk around with at least a work phone and a personal phone .. So my passengers never can charge since i was using a dual port . But now with a trio of ports , that solves the problem . The device is great and allows me to use my power port in the car efficiently and effectively . Of course , you can also charge tablets with the device since it has enough power to do so at a reasonable rate .
5 #### a must have in your car , its a secure and firm slide in , does not wiggle loose or require pushing it back in . other brands i 've tried seem to slip out eventually but not these and have 3 ports comes in handy . this is a second time I 've bought these , one for front passengers and other goes in back for rear buddies .
5 #### For the longest time , I 've had the same dual - port charger since the old Motorola Razr days , that was provided to me from Verizon . Now , I know over a decade since that phone was released , but I still had the same charger . Having gone through multiple phones over the years , I finally got to the point where that old charger did n't charge fast enough to any of the devices my household had ( iPads , iPhones , Samsung Galaxy phones , etc ) . Plus because of low 0.5 amp charging capability , it did n't charge at all when I had more than 1 device connected to the charger . Looking to Amazon , I found this charger and holy cow , it 's a day & night difference . Device charge FAST , regardless of how many I have connected . I 've tested this with an iPhone 6 , Galaxy S6 Edge+ , and full - size iPads . I 'm VERY pleased with this charger because nowadays , whether you 're taking a long trip or a short one requires multiple devices to be charged at the same time !
5 #### I got this charger at a great price . It is for three cords and works really well . No need to spend a lot for a charger . Very pleased .
5 #### I bought this to replace my old port ; it charges relatively fast . It charges my phone up to 25 % during my 15 - minute commute to work . I think that 's pretty good . It 's clean , sleek looking . I like the blue light that indicates that it 's on while charging . I would totally buy it again if it ever stops working .
5 #### real power rating ! No intermittent " Not Charging " note from iPad
5 #### The review sample of this charger has quickly become my favorite . I have been using it for over six weeks thus far and aside from the technical specs the reason why I love it is the fit . My other car chargers - some of which are as powerful as this one - all have oval shaped barrels . All jiggle in my lighter socket and sometimes a slight tug on a cable will unseat them . This one fits tightly and stays put . Of course , the charging rate on this one is as fast as a wall charger for my Galaxy Note 3 phone . The rate does not diminish when I plug in two tablets . To be honest I have never bothered to benchmark the charging rates of the tablets , but the Note 3 and its 3300mAh battery charges at 1 % per 2.5 minutes , which is the maximum charging rate for that device . Another thing I like is this runs very cool even when all ports are populated . That is not the case with many high speed chargers that I have owned or tested . Bottom line : there are chargers that are as technically as sophisticated and powerful as this one , but few come close to the stable , precise fit this one has on my lighter socket .
5 #### If you want the best , select Droll Yankee . My feeders and seed catches are beautiful . The seed catch is nice and big and does the best job . When I was filling my feeders the other day , I accidently bumped one of my feeders and knocked it off of it 's high perch and on to the ground . Oh , oh , I thought I surely would have broken the seed catch , but not a scratch was found on it . That 's some tough plastic . Thanks Droll Yankee .
5 #### The Droll Omni Seed Tray easily screws into the bottom of the Droll Yankee tube - style feeders , and collects the spilled seed . It 's great for a new feeder , too , since you can sprinkle a bit of seed in the tray to attract birds to your feeder . Cardinals prefer the added perch that the tray gives them , so I was pleased about that , too . I found that ordering the seed tray from Amazon 's sellers - even with shipping - turned out to be a better deal than my local specialty bird shop . For my second Droll Yankee feeder , tree arm , and seed tray , I did purchase the complete set from the local store as they provide a good deal of guidance for the backyard birder , as well as full repairs .
5 #### Birds , especially doves , love this . Unfortunately the squirrels do too . If you can keep the squirrels away - get one !
5 #### Seed tray fit perfectly on the tube bird feeder .
3 #### Actually the bird feeder looks like it would work fine IF your bird feeder has a screw bottom . Unfortunately , I did n't read the product description very well so received it . I just tried to return it but it says IT HAS A NO RETURN POLICY . It may be that if your order is defective you can return - but I bought incorrectly and lose out . Not a policy that works for me - so you 'll have to be your own judge .
3 #### This size is right and it 's well constructed , but the tray has come off twice now . It does n't break and I can always screw it back on , but I fear that one day the screw plug will not be found . I may replace it with something metal and use a little Loctite . I 'm sure it 's the squirrels hopping on it that has pulled it out . Fortunately the habanero seeds should keep them away now .
4 #### I purchased with a Droll finch feeder and it 's high quality . It gets a 4 star instead of 5 because it 's kind of small and does not catch as many seeds as it could if a little larger .
5 #### Works to keep most of the seeds from falling on the lawn under the pine tree where I have it hanging .
1 #### Wo n't fit any of my Droll Yankees feeders . I threw them into the trash can .
5 #### I got this to go with the new generation sunflower tube feeder . It 's really easy to install . I now have more birds and larger birds hanging out at my feeding station .
3 #### I rated this only 3 stars because it did not fit any of my tube feeders , some which are Droll Yankees and some that are another brand . As it turns out , the problem with the Omni seed tray , for me at least , is that it is totally flat in the center , and a standard threaded plug ( one comes with it ) is not long enough to reach the threads inside the base of any of my tube feeders . For the eight Omni seed trays I had bought , I had to invest another $ 25 ( $ 3 + each ) for longer threaded plugs , which were very difficult to find ! So , unless you have a feeder that has internal threads that come all the way down to the base edge of the feeder , this is not a tray I would suggest you buy . Instead , I would suggest any clear seed tray from Wild Birds Unlimited , which are not available on Amazon and are just a little higher priced than the Omni tray . Before you buy a clear seed tray , I would definitely suggest you make sure it 's one that will fit properly on the model of feeder you own . The only solution
2 #### Seems like a good idea at first .... but then the rain gets to it ... seeds harden . Has to be taken down almost every week that has any rain and cleaned . Although some birds go to the tray to get the thistle .... no many .... so there is much seed that lays there and just gets hardened with any moisture at all . Will not use next year .
5 #### This tray is larger than I expected , but now that I 'm using it , I 'm glad it 's this big . I 'm using it on the 20 port Thistle feeder and it catches all the seed the birds seem to knock out , and they are using it to eat up the spilled seeds .
5 #### Droll Yankee make exceptionally good products and the really do replace broken feeders
5 #### If you love feeding birds this is a must have for every feeder . Saves on seed .
2 #### It 's as well made as all the Droll Yankee products are , but this just provided a seat for the squirrels in our yard .
5 #### I actually inverted this so that the lip faces down . It still catches the seed and allows small birds to perch without becoming clogged .
5 #### Am I glad I got this tray . It holds as many as a dozen finches , if there 's a big enough crowd on the feed tube . Always happy to accommodate the overflow .
4 #### The house finches are constant wasteful eaters of safflower seed which is expensive . there is a huge mess below the tube feeder . I got two of these and it catches the seed and then the birds sit on the tray and eat it so some improvement . bad news , doves can sit on it and join in wasteful feeding
5 #### Nice addition to the feeder . Cardinals and doves seem to like the tray . The seed waste is reduced and no squirrels .
5 #### Had to replace some broken trays . The older trays broke in a wind storm so we order a new tray . Help to keep the seed up off the ground .
5 #### Using the larger trays helps keep dropped feed off the ground and the birds eat more food without wasting it ( falling on the ground ) . It saves effort and time , because you do n't need to weed under the feeder .
5 #### The Omni tray can be attached to the bottom of the Droll Yankees feeder with a pastic threaded plug ( furnished ) or a wing nut ( not furnished ) . It is a simple task to complete and no tools are needed . The tray has a a number of holes around the outer perimeter of the feeder to let water drain . Having a tray means not only preventing seed from falling to the ground but also attracting birds that are too big to use the perches . The few seeds that do fall on the ground are soon consumed by doves , if they can get to them before the squirrels arrive . This tray is made in the USA and is a quality product from Droll Yankees . It will attract far more birds then just the feeder alone .
2 #### the privacy tent is a very clever item . well made , out of good materials , but highly impractical . the privacy issue with your cat is much less an issue than being able to keep the electronic cat box clean and working properly . this tent makes it virtually impossible to see what 's happened in the box , and to smooth the litter around now and then . this is something you 'll need to be able to do . i bought it , but wound up lining the bottom with a blanket , and a few toys . my cats sleep and play in it .
1 #### Missing parts . Unusable . Not worth the money due to having high enough sides of the litter box .
2 #### This is poor quality . The zipper does n't zip and I really should have sent it back but by the time my husband put it together it was too late . Do not recommend this product .
3 #### I ordered this for the littermate but the only bad part is it with cheaply made and it is at her broke
1 #### The frame does not fit the tent - Had to cut the tubes down to make it fit . Then it was an ordeal to get the blasted zipper to work . This is definitely NOT worth the money they charge for it . A call to ' customer service " was a joke -- the woman who answered , after hearing the problem , transferred me to the person " Who handles that product , " which ended up being voice mail - so I hung up and called back , only to have the phone answered and then hung up . LitterMaid was a great product when it first came out . Unfortunately , Applica has cut corners until it is a barely usable item . When this new one breaks , as I 'm pretty much guaranteed it will , within the year , we 'll save up and go to PetSmart and buy the competitor 's version of the LitterMaid , which I heard is halfway decent .
3 #### The tent functions as advertised - it hides the cat box . Yes , it 's flimsy . And yes , initial construction was difficult . I even broke a pole in the process of putting it together . But a little duct tape secured the brake and it was then hidden under the canopy and out of sight . My main complaint is that it is difficult to remove the box from the tent for cleaning and is not very well ventilated ( leading concentrated cat box smell ) . I 'd rather give this a 2.5 rating , but I rounded up .
5 #### The canvas material is easy to keep clean . A large cat box for mutliple cats fits in here nicely . I have had a few cat litter box furniture pieces - but the moisture always seeps into the wood and it gets warped and stinky . This solves that problem !
4 #### My husband has a knack for putting things together but we had a heck with this item . We could barely fit the tent over the posts and zipping the top part to the bottom . The posts are plastic so if we tried to bend them a little to fit the tent they would 've snapped in half . When we finally got it together I put our classic littermaid in it . The opening is not very big so the litter box does n't come in and out of the tent easily when I 'm emptying the receptacle . We have a 2 yr old cat and 2 newly adopted kittens so the littermaid gets a lot of use and so far it 's done a decent job keeping litter from going everywhere ..
2 #### I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review . The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover . The PVC frame that came with it did n't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing . It does n't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it . I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning . Not a fan
5 #### My cats love it and so do I. I no longer have cat litter flying out all over the floor as any litter they fling out stays in the tent . I have 3 of these and do n't think I could do without them . I believe my cats like the privacy as well .
2 #### We purchased one of these tents a number of years ago and it is still going strong . This one arrived with cracked support rods ( different material than original ) and the plastic is stiff and brittle . Contacted seller about rods and they promised to send replacement . After waiting quite some time , seller advised that their supplier was out of these and issued a credit . Nothing wrong with the seller other than slow on the follow up - the product is just not the quality of the original models .
1 #### My personal opinion is that the plastic frame tubing is horribly cheep and fragile . I am a big DIY and have a lot of finesse putting things together and 2 of the plastic pipes spit in assembly with almost no force from me . The plastic tubing does nt hold together at all . When you try to take the plastic / vinyl cover off to change the litter half of the frame pulls off with it . You basically have to reassemble the whole thing every time you change your litter . If you 're not careful you ll break more of the frame trying to zip the plastic cover over it . I have found that it is NOT worth the fight to try to zip it up at all . After 2 weeks and reassembling the thing every time I took it apart , along with more pipes breaking , I found that it works best if you throw away most of the frame and only use the bottom frame with a few upright frame pipes and gently lay the top over that . It looks like garbage but it still keeps the initial smell down after the cat does her duty . I would not recommend this to anyone . A big cardboard box would look better and be much more functional then this thing .
2 #### We finally ( between my husband , my son and me ) finally got this thing stretched over the plastic frame , but it tore on the seam at one of the corners . You have to lift up the heaving litterbox to put inside of it -- it wo n't slide in or out over the connecting rods in the bottom . Soooooo , you can imagine how easy to clean it is -- NOT ! A two piece design with the top that would fit over the box with a bottom sheet that snapped onto the top piece would be a better design .
1 #### One of my cats absolutely refused to enter it , and did his " business " next to the litterbox instead . The big guy flattened it , and a couple of others hated it so much they made a point of spraying it and trying to wipe their butts on it . Needless to say , it ended up in the garbage . It 's not that these cats wo n't use a covered box -- they will and do -- they just really , really hated this tent .
5 #### I had three kittens and they mad one hell of a mess , litter always kickied all ove rt he floor . useing this helped a lot to keep the litter where it beliongs . I still had a little out the front but only the first 6 inches or so . where before litter was in all directions . I will buy ans I would rcomend to anyone to buy this product .
4 #### I 'd owned a tent before years ago but had to discard it due to too many connectors breaking . It was a hideous grey / green like in the picture . The new tent is a light tan which is much more pleasing . It 's tough to put together , which has n't changed , because the tent is so tight on the rods . My only real problem is that the fabric is definately thinner ( read cheaper ) than it used to be . I stuck my hand in the hole for the cord and barely put any pressure on the edge and it started a rip . I just hope my cats do n't notice it and make it worse .
1 #### I 've had LitterMaids since they first came out , and had the very first LitterMaid privacy ( and litter containing ) tent . That tent has finally bit the dust - the fabric had been washed so many times that it was getting holes in the fabric . So I bought a new one . What an enormous mistake . The new ones do not fit the frame in any way , shape or form . I tapped all the connections with a hammer so that they were all tight , and then tried to put the tent on the frame - there is a 1 inch gap between the top and the bottom and they ca n't be zippered together ! ! ! So I tried to massage it on - moved more fabric to the front , got the zipper started - and the zipper separated . Okay , put the zipper back together and try again - the slider became deformed and would no longer fit onto the zipper pin . The metal slider itself started to come apart . What a horrible piece of unmitigated JUNK . Do n't waste your money unless LitterMaid announces a major redesign of their litter tents . It 's sad , the first one was flimsy but worked great and fit properly . Someone , somewhere , cut a few too many corners on this product . The whole kit and caboodle is now residing in the trash .

It 's sad , the first one was flimsy but worked great and fit properly . Someone , somewhere , cut a few too many corners on this product . The hole kit and caboodle is now residing in the trash .
1 #### I 've had LitterMaids since they first came out , and had the very first LitterMaid privacy ( and litter containing ) tent . That tent has finally bit the dust - the fabric had been washed so many times that it was getting holes in the fabric . So I bought a new one . What an enormous mistake . The new ones do not fit the frame in any way , shape or form . I tapped all the connections with a hammer so that they were all tight , and then tried to put the tent on the frame - there is a 1 inch gap between the top and the bottom and they ca n't be zippered together ! ! ! So I tried to massage it on - moved more fabric to the front , got the zipper started - and the zipper separated .

2 #### The privacy tent does keep litter " contained " , my siamese has a habit of " slinging " cat litter . The frame is plastic and one of the plastic ' tees ' broke easily . had to return the first one due to zipper " malfunction " . The zipper is difficult to zip , very tight . I had to reset the auto cat box and that entails unzipping .. after which I do n't attempt to re - zip , the top just sits on top of frame .
1 #### I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w / the stand . The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo . Also , the velcro already attached ( not nearly enough to do anything ) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand . Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading , which this does not do . there are only four 1 - inch patches of velcro , the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit . Do n't waste your $ $ on this accessory .
3 #### Pros : Keeps litter better contained . It falls inside the tent or right in front of the entrance , instead of all over the room . Gives the cats privacy . Keeps the smell down a bit . Cons : It 's difficult to get the zipper closed . The litterbox does n't fit out the entrance easily ( and unzipping it is out of the question ) . It 's difficult to reach inside and scoop out clumps that the littermaid rake missed ( and it misses lots of clumps , so I have to deal with this problem 3 - 4 times a day ) .
4 #### This is the 2nd Littermaid Tent I have owned ... my cats love it , I love it and I 'll definate buy again if needed .
4 #### I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega . Pros : provides coverage , privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control . Does not retain odor . Cons : Fits too tight , which causes the zipper to break and fail . Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily . COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive . Overall , I have owned several of these . Eventually , they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail . That 's really all I can say about it .
2 #### Yes , in time the posts will break . This is usually because a naturally curious cat will jump on top of the tent , and the posts are n't designed to support this kind of weight . To fix this , build a replacement frame later using low cost PVC pipe and connectors that you can get at your local hardware store . After that , the tent will work great . As another reviewer mentioned , you do n't have to check the litter really , just measure out a cup or so per week and sprinkle it in there . You also do n't really have to unzip the tent or pull the litter box out . There 's enough room to flip the lid on the littermaid and replace the container if the box is shoved all the way back ( which it should be for the curtain flaps to help prevent litter kickback into the room ) . You will probably also want to vacuum underneath the litter box in the tent from time to time with a vaccum attachment or hand vac ( again , no need to remove the box or unzip it really ) . The tent is also made of a plastic / vinyl material that stands up to the washing machine on gentle cycle if you ever need to rinse it out for some reason . If the posts were stronger , this would 've been a perfect partner to the littermaid .
5 #### The Privacy Tent is a must have IMHO . I just ordered my fifth one . The cats are very comfortable using them , they keep the litter mass off the floor , the litter box out of sight , and are easy to clean . I had absolutely no difficulty putting them together - a simple matter of inserting the support poles in FIRMLY and the tent fits just fine . My cats get on top of them sometimes , but none are broken . I just wish they were available in colors !
5 #### I 've used the tent for 2 years now without any issues .
4 #### The tent was rather cumbersome to put together , and now that it 's in place , I 've found it relatively difficult to get to the litter box for maintenance ( e.g. , to clear a jam or add more litter ) . But it does work ! It covers the litter box completely and the cats can get into and out of it , but the dog no longer can .
4 #### The plastic is light - weight , but it does work . We are happy with our LitterMaid litter box . It is about 99 % perfect . It still takes a responsible pet owner to oversee any occasional malfunctions . We love ours and would buy it again .
5 #### I loved the automatic cat box when I had space for it . Now I 'm in a smaller space but I 've got this in storage for when I can spread out again . :-)
5 #### What can one say ? Cat is happy . Husband is happy . No smell in the house . I 'm happy . Everyone with a kitty , or cat , should have this product . It is a time saver , money saver ... and just plain marvelous .
4 #### This is not a bad product , it is not the best product , but it is pretty good compared to most of them out on the market . You still wind up having to scoop and clean off the rake , but it 's better than the traditional kitty litter box . We have learned to use small plastic grocery bags as liners . I recommend this product .
3 #### The older version o this litter maid wore out , and this newly designed version is not as satisfactory as the old version .
5 #### This is my second one . I will always use the self cleaning litter box . It is healthier for your cat(s ) , easier on me and keeps your home cleaner . I live in an apartment and my manager complemented me on how " well I care for my cats " . My vet says my 14 year old cat looks 7 and I firmly believe this litter maid has something to do with it . He has had the litter main most of his life . My " skid - dish " cat , he uses all the time but waits to see it move , kind of funny . All I know is when this one goes , I will buy a new one again . These are worth every penny I spend to have another day with my cats .
4 #### We had the smaller version of this box for approximately 15 years before it gave out and broke . I loved it so much that I wanted to get another one . Due to the large size of one of our cats we decided to get the Mega one . These machines eliminate order in the house and keeps our dogs away from the box . Some clumping litters can have the tendency to jam the machine , but the few times to un jam it are still worth having it . Make sure not to over fill it with litter , we rarely have a problem .
4 #### Over the years we have owned a couple of these and this model by far has been the best . Yes , it does get a little gummed up in the corners beside the rake , but in my experience owning 4 cats , this sure beats emptying litter boxes daily . I would recommend this to any cat owner that is tired of daily litter box duty .
5 #### I like that I can get so many in a pack and easy to use .
2 #### I have 4 cats and have gone through two Littermaids . After both of them broke I have given up . Cons - very noisy , wakes you up at night - gets stuck a lot . When it does , it does n't intelligently back up or stop , it keeps trying to move forward making a loud clicking sound - it can only handle a very small amount of litter otherwise it gets overloaded - the whole thing feels cheaply made . The motor is week and the plastic is flimsy I love the concept of an automatic litter cleaner like this , unfortunately it just does n't perform .
1 #### It did not fit the receptacle as indicated it would . Litter went everywhere .
1 #### I previously had a Mega which worked a couple years . This one was a Total Disaster . Never could get rake to work , Littermaid customer service ( once you finally get to is ) was of little help and Orange Onion ( do n't buy anything from them ) sucked . They could n't care less , at least Littermaid apologized ( on one of my three calls ) . Keep in mind , if you buy it and return it , do it through Littermaid . You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire . To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid ! ) , unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire , do n't let it go ! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment . I wasted hours and hours on this . If only they had a good competitor . They 're sending me the only thing available , the latest model that most people here seem to hate . sigh .. if it does n't work , I 'm giving up totally on Littermaid . I have two cats , so it had its uses .
3 #### I love these because I love the litterbox itself , I wish they would just make a reusable one that comes with the box in the first place . I try to reuse these by using a plastic bag , but they are not strong enough to use for the lifetime of the box .
5 #### Fast shipping , exactly as described . Very nice quality . Happy with purchase .
5 #### They are thin but work great . They fit just like the manufacturer ones that came with the littermaid automatic litter box .
1 #### Unfortunately again .... Another disappointment . I thought that by purchasing Littermaid Brand they would be made properly , What a disappointment ... Let me explain , Buying a Littermaid Comes with Waste receptacles , These Waste containers have an extended Lip that slids in front that keeps waste from being pushed in between waste container and onto the floor . I 'm not sure if this was an effort to save a Penny ... Or just Very POOR Quality control . My hope is Littermaid will notice this flaw from there original design and correct it . At the moment it looks as if I am off to the Pet store to ask them to open a box .
5 #### I love not having to scoop the cat litter . Favorite invention ever .
4 #### Sometimes feel flimsy when emptying - but it is used by two cats . At least I 'm not scooping .
1 #### I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years . NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid . This model died Monday after 2 - 1/2 years , but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off . The cord finally snapped on Monday . Not only the short lifespan considering the price , but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan . No matter what litter brand I tried , it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan , would stick to the rake , and eventually cause the machine to cut off . Just purchased an Omega Paws , which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed . Good idea , very poor longterm performance .
3 #### Very cheaply built , I know it 's for cat doo doo , but they are way too flexible and thin . Have to buy them cause that 's all that fits the unit !
1 #### The plastic rake is spaced in a way that it wo n't work with my , and my cat 's , favorite litter . Yes it 's a clumping litter . Also the tongs on the rake are very wide . This litterbox scoops a lot of clean litter into the bin ( even with the smallest clumping litter I could find ) . It wastes a LOT of litter , pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it 's path into the bin ... more of a shovel , than a rake IMO . In order to not waste more litter than is used , I would have to dump out the bin and scoop that in order to save the wasted clean litter .... far more of a hassle than useful . I would not repurchase this item , nor would I recommend it to a friend .... an enemy .... maybe .
2 #### Works just fine but no longer in use . It Crapped out after about six months .
5 #### They worked extremely well , this is the only part of the automatic litter box that did not fail . That was an unfortunate fact . I would like to return these but have not had the chance yet I have been very very very busy running a group home and fighting with my own health problems . Thank you , good day
5 #### Five cats = Littermaid Mega . I actually have two Megas because there is always an after breakfast and after dinner rush to use the Littermaid and the unit does have difficulty scooping two large litter clumps at the same time , it can be too heavy and sometimes will take several attempts to succesfully scoop the two large litter clumps . Also , when you have two cats jockeying to use the Littermaid at the same time , well I just had to get another to keep everyone happy ! As other users state , do not overfill the pan . Also , line the plastic litter hoppers with grocery store bags and you can reuse , reuse , reuse , reuse them many , many times . When the plastic litter hoppers crack , I reinforce them with clear packing tape and further extend the use of each one . My cats all love their Littermaid Megas and we could n't do without them . With five cats , I usually find myself emptying the hoppers every other day and doing periodic maintenance on the litterpan to keep it free of flat clumps that stick to the bottom of the pan . Great invention , would n't do without it ! !
3 #### I have used this and the Elite , and they worked fine until my 12 - year old cat developed renal insufficiency . Now she drinks a lot and pees a LOT . The clumps of pee got so large that the motor was n't strong enough to move them any more . Conventional cat boxes were difficult to clean , and it HAD to be done daily . So I tried the Omega Paw rolling litter box , and it has done well . Yes , the plastic connectors do break easily , and litter leaked out from the edges until I bought some wing nuts at home depot ( 2 on the side with the tray did it ) and that solved that problem . Now I roll the box and dump the tray every 2 days , although I do have to bang on the bottom with my fist to get some of the larger clumps to detach . Still , it beats the alternatives . The noise of this box was also very annoying , esp . when you have a sleeping baby .
5 #### Good product , i line mine with plastic bags and use for several months .
5 #### I love my littermaid and these are designed to work perfectly with it .
3 #### These are really flimsy and tear easily . I will keep buying them though , because they are the only ones I can find that fit the Littermaid box . I do use them with a bag , which makes them more cost effective because you can use them more than once . Overall , they 're fine for what they are .
2 #### I paid way too much to find out that the motor makes a lot of noise when cleaning the box . My cat was scared of it even though the timing was set to delay the cleaning . The box takes up a lot of room and has to be plugged in so placement is limited . I also did not like that the soiled litter would stick to the bottom , break into small pieces that the comb would not catch , and often missed the receptacle . I ended up having to clean it out manually to fix the mess left behind . I would rather just scoop it the first time myself and save the hassle .... and money . I gave mine to a friend and she eventually had the same complaints about the cleanliness . Her cats used it just fine without fear .
5 #### This is my third littermaid in the past 10 years , works fine and great price .
5 #### I have four of these and they are a great help . Some of my cats a are a little finicky about their litterboxes and will stop using them if they 're not perfectly clean . Since I work all day and the cats are on their own , I can count on these self - cleaning litter boxes to keep the box up to my cats ' high standards . My only complaint is LitterMaid 's quality control can be a little inconsistent . Over the years I 've had defective units right out of the box a little more often than I 'd like . I do n't think it 's unique to LitterMaid , I 've seen similar QC problems with just about anything made in China . If LitterMaid has a choice , they really should reconsider where they 're doing business . It 's at the point that if I have a choice between products either made in China or elsewhere , I choose the product NOT made in China just because I 've been burned too many times by shoddy workmanship , even from supposedly name brand products .
5 #### Not much to say about these . They work well with the Littermaid litter box and makes cleaning a lot easier .
5 #### I HAD THE SMALLER VERSION WHICH WAS GOOD BUT MY CAT GOT BIGGER AND WOULD NOT FIT ANYMORE . SO I HAD TO GET A BIGGER ONE . THIS IS GREAT NO MORE SCRAPING THE TINES OR SIDES . VERY QUIET . THE RAMP DOES MAKE IT HARD TO EMPTY THE WASTE CONTAINER . I USE THE CONTAINER OVER AND OVER UNTIL IT GETS SOILED .
4 #### There are definitely tricks and techniques listed in other reviews that will maximize the effectiveness of the litter maid , such as : - keep the litter level within the correct range . - use a marker & draw the fill level guides around the entire tray : makes filling to the correct level easier . - use only fine ground premium clumping litter for best results . - mixing with 1/3 of flushable litter will make the substrate lighter and easier for the machine to handle . - deal with any clogs or blockages that build up on the rake right away . - every couple of months , scrape the rake tines clean with an old butter knife to keep from building up residue . - a bit of baking soda or cat box deodorizer in the catching tray will further reduce odor . - ideally , you should have 1 box for every cat in the house . ( We have 6 cats so ; 4 regular and 2 LM900s ) - do n't toss the catch boxes , just dump them out in the trash and you can reuse them multiple times . ( saves money ) The littermaid boxes wo n't solve all your cat box issues but it will scoop more frequently , minimize smell , save time , extend the life of the litter and keep things a lot cleaner and easier in general . The unit is a bit noisy , takes up a bit more space than a regular box and requires a power outlet to be close by .
1 #### This machine never worked the way it was advertised to . It can not handle urine , the urine clumps and scooper gets caught on it . This stresses the motor out to were it resets itself , thus not scooping anything . Or if it does break through it , the clump crumbles to small enough pieces where it slips through the scooper and quickly starts to stink . I tried five different types of litter , nothing improved the machines performance . I ended up keeping a hand scooper and plastic bags available as I had to scoop and clean it myself . The plastic mounts on the scooper ended up snapping of after two months of use . The box is just messy and useless and hard to wash as you have to disassemble it . You might as well buy litter tray for $ 5 , it will function 100 times better . I use a plastic concrete mixing tray you can get at home depot for $ 6 . It looks just like a litter tray except it is about 2 ' x 3 ' . If you got the room this is the way to go . If you decide to buy this auto - box save the receipt . You will need it If you want a good auto - box , get the one that uses the disposable trays with the blue crystals . That is a good auto - box .
2 #### Does n't fit all that great . They seem to be taller then the originals that come with the litter box
1 #### Box was opened and retaped when I got them , but I am not sure what 's wrong with these liners . NONE of them fit either one of my Littermaid boxes . I do n't know if some others were switched in the box or what , but the entire 12 pack , every single one of them , the trays are about a 1/2 " too narrow and they sort of look different . They do n't look like the ones I 've been buying for my smaller littermaid box , or my largest littermaid in over a year .
2 #### I like it - but it does freak out the cat . That 's ok because my cat is neurotic anyway . The ramp does n't help much as the cat leaps over it leaving cat litter everywhere . Why does n't someone invent cat litter that does n't track ! ! ! ! Update ... bloody thing broke after 3 months !
5 #### They work well and can be reused if emptied frequently and line them with baking soda and a Costco cleaning towel ripped in half .
5 #### These work so wonderfully with the receptacles and just saves so much money .
4 #### I like the whole concept of the automatic scooper & the disposable receptacles . I wish they had a tighter fit to prevent litter from leaking between the fittings .
5 #### These are great for my cat 's litter maid auto matic litter cleaning poopy box ! !
5 #### I am very happy with how long this product lasted . Mine is a little over 8 years old , and it just broke the other day . While i will admit the bins are kind of expensive and it is noisy ... It lasted for 8 years without any user error related issues ! 7 of those years it was used by 2 cats , now just one . I am very happy with the product , and have every intention of replacing it !
5 #### This device is overall a great product . The litterbox smell is virtually gone , just dump all the " kitty prizes " when the compartment gets full and you 're good to go . I 've had great luck with fresh step litter . Every once in awhile it will get a jam in it and you have to use the tool to clear it . But even with that infrequent problem this thing has made my laundry room 100x more bearable .
5 #### As a foster furmomma for a cat rescue and a cat slave to my own cats , this prodcut is a dream come true and has been saving my life for 10 years now ! Worth every penny you pay ( if you avoid the high retail ) and worth the time it saves . Yes , they do break down , what does n't ? But with a little care and obvious common sense these work for YEARS ! You do have to break them down a few times a year for a good cleaning and keep the track the rake rides in halfway clean , but otherwise still the best thing . I will never be without them or without a spare in the closet just in case ! One suggestion is that the manufacturer scale back the side panels of the receptacle lid so that these can function in a smaller space when the rake hit it , such as in a closet without hitting the doors . I have 4 of these units in a closet , two on the floor and two on a shelf a little higher and have them side by side . I broke one when the lid sides pushed against the back inside of the closet door when raking to the receptacle because someone had shut the closet dorr partially . So making those " flaps " shorter would greatly reduce the actual amount of space the units need to take up functionally .
3 #### I thought I would have to purchase a new littermaid for my beloved cat Sushi . Suddenly , the rake stopped working even though the power supply seemed to be working . Yes , I was having all the problems that others mentionned like the rake 's inability to deposit clumps into the receptacle and jamming . ( I will have to give the spray coating with Pam a try . ) This time the unit simply would not move and there was nothing on the littermaid website that even came close to addressing the problem . But ... after contacting customer service , I learned that there seem to be two sensors / buttons that can be pushed in at both ends of the rake track . They are pretty small so look hard . In my case a small piece of litter caught by the button caused the malfunction . We got the piece of litter out and the box is working again . I still can not give Littermaid a high rating because no matter how good the clumping litter , or how carefully I fill it , we still have problems with it being unable at times to effectively get rid of used litter .
3 #### This is the 2nd Littermaid I 've had , and the original was definitely better . It lasted 9 years and cleaned very well . This new one cleans well about half the time , the other times is does n't pick up all the deposits . The tines do n't reach all the way to the bottom , so you still have to scrape wet litter off the bottom occasionally . But , all in all , it 's better than cleaning the box 8 times a day ( my cats are picky ) , just an occasional check and quick scoop , otherwise I have a lot more free time ! BTW , I use Worlds Best Litter , it 's made from corn , all natural , no toxic clay dust or additives . It makes the box fairly odorless , and clumps OK . I think a better clumper might work better in the Littermaid , but I 'm not trading the all natural benefit for my cats just for convenience for me .
4 #### I love this litter box . I do not use the lids , and keep using the same receptacle until it tears or cracks . ( Usually 3 - 4 months ) . I just dump it out a couple times a week . Makes these things last forever
5 #### These are n't always at every store so it 's very handy Amazon carries these at a decent price . Getting it on prime is always a bonus .
3 #### The plastic is to thin and cracks easily . I try to re - use a few times finally bought an insert you can use to put bags inside receptacles to last longer .
4 #### I 've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out , although I 've never had one fail . The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean , but there 's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more . Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags . Try both to see which suits you best . Then simply put the bag in the receptacle , fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine . When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle , remove the bag with its contents , tie the top in a knot to contain the odor , and put it in the trash . The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart . This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process .
4 #### Having 3 female cats and not home all the time , I am a big believer in the LitterMaid LM 900 . I have purchased many LiterMaids over the years and find the LM900 works the best ; in fact I am getting ready to purchase my 3rd . I have bought the newer LiterMaid models , but they just do n't work that well . My last LM900 has lasted about 3 years . Recently , it just does not have the power to get over the hump to get the waste into the receptacle , or it catches and " things " go flying everywhere . Overall it is worth the cost of having to replace the LM900 every so many years , especially if you have fussy girls like mine that like a clean box .
5 #### These are the exact same ones that come with the littermaid . My original set came with carbon filters but this set did not . I can usually reuse them for several weeks . I 'll just dump it out for a week or so then hose it out if things start sticking to it . If your gentle enough this pack could last you a year .
5 #### Littermaid is a pretty good cat box and I needed to buy more of these so went to my Amazon account got them in two days
1 #### This item works fine until it gets crudded up with dried on poop and litter . It 's a nightmare to clean , and my box went dead after 6 months . I wrote to the company TWICE and got no response at all ! I would advise against buying this product . It takes less time to rake out a litter box 1 - 2 times a day , than to clean the mess that this box creates ! And yes , I did use the recommended litter -- it made no difference ! !
5 #### What a great product ! I bought one 7 years ago and it got tons of use ( 5 cats ) . The new one works great , I have 3 litter boxes and now at least one is always clean . I like the new scooper that cleans between the rake . Cat 's have no problem using it and were never afraid of the motor- they actually are curious and think it is interesting . I Highly recommend this one for every cat owner ! ! !
5 #### Do you have a pile of used litter at the very front of the pan ? Most likely if you are having problems with this product you 've put too much litter in the pan . If you do n't think that is the case your little kitty has piled all the litter in the front . My little darling was doing this to the pan for weeks before I figured out that I needed to use less than the recommended amount of litter . The motor is n't strong to prevent injury to the kitty if for some reason they are in it when it starts . It does have a motion sensor so it should n't be an issue . Also if you have more than one cat get more than one of these . I have 3 cats and three of these . The stinkers sometimes jam it up but it is still better than the every day cleaning . We clean ours twice a week on trash days so we can dump straight into the garbage that is going out to the curb that morning . We use rubber gloves ( the hospital kind ) to pull out the boxes of used litter . We dump those and put the receptacles back . We only replace when the are really bad or tear when they are pulled out .
2 #### I bought 2 when I just got my kittens , they did work well for a couple of weeks maybe a month without a big issue Very noisy , a mess to change the containers , litter gets stuck all over the parts and the engine runs back and forth for hours ! ! Better than Purrforma
2 #### When functioning properly , this is a great product , however and unfortunately , the Litter Maids have mechanical / electrical flaws . Over the past 4 to 5 years , I have bought several Litter Maids ( have several Kitties ) and five of the units have failed . Of the last two I purchased ( within the last 4 weeks ) one of these has already failed . The rake will not go into park ... will not stop . Thus the unit is of no use . These units have been on the market for several years . Surely they could have made the necessary quality improvements by now . Don Johnson
5 #### Working fine . We have lost our cats recently and will no longer use it . Will attempt to give to a deserving cat owner .
1 #### These would have been great if I had n't returned the litterbox . Did not need them , so they were returned for refund .
2 #### Cheap ' n ' cheezy , just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are . Sure wish they would bring back the older , sturdier ones . Really makes you feel like a captive market , since you do n't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid . I line them with bags , but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3 - 4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid , so have to be replaced despite being lined .
5 #### Owning a cat just does n't get any easier . If I forget to clean the box for a day , no problem ; it has been raked into a receptacle for me . I just add litter every so often and empty the receptacle twice a week . I do dismantle and wash the base monthly . This litterbox frees me to leave for several days without guilt . If the caretaker misses a day , no problem . I highly recommend this for any household with a litterbox .
1 #### The theory behind this litterbox is genius , but it does n't work as advertised . My cat urinates in the back corner , and the rake never could get it . It would scrape off part of the clump , which would get stuck to the rake , but it would leave the majority of it in the corner . The clumps would stick the bottom of the pan , and it was a real pain to clean them off . I had to scoop this litterbox and clean the rake off 4 times in the two days I used it , which is twice as much as I scoop my regular litterbox in a whole week ! Do n't waste your money .
2 #### The receptacles I got with my first Littermaid ( for multiple cats ) were very flimsy . The replacement box of 12 ( as shown ) I got afterward were also flimsy . This did not stop us from reusing the trays over and over . It does n't make sense not to , but eventually they get pretty brutalised from removal and reinsertion . Oddly enough , when we got our second LitterMaid ( regular sized ) the receptacles that came with it were sturdier and more durable . Why they are n't all manufactured at this thickness is beyond me . Actually , I 'm sure it 's a case of trying to get more money out of us at cheaper manufacturing cost , but it 's a little ridiculous when they are that flimsy .
1 #### Current version of littermaid does not work well at all . The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it . The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original . The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died . I found the old version ( on Amazon ) . It worked for six days and then died . It was replaced at no charge . The second one worked for six weeks and then died . I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase . So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually . DO NOT buy this product . This system forced me to give this product at least one star , I would give it -5 if I could .
5 #### I prefer this automatic litter box over the others . I ca nt tell you how easy it to have and the upkeep cost is very low . You can also obtain a hard shell insert instead of using the disposable ones . I owned this product and ended up going back to this product !
1 #### We had a Litter Maid cat box several years ago and we loved it . They have " improved " their product and ruined it in my opinion . The rake gets clogged and litter sticks all over the place and in the tracks no matter what level of litter you use . We tried every type of litter available , including the ridiculously expensive litter that Litter Maid sells . We spent more time cleaning this worthless litter box than we would have in scooping out regular litter . We contacted the manufacturer , but they wo n't stand behind their product and we could not return it to the store because we did not have the original box , although we did have the receipt . After a couple of months we threw it out in the garbage . I wo n't waste my money on any other product Liter Maid sells . Save yourself this frustration and find another brand . I would not have given this item even one star , but one star is the lowest rating .
5 #### My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit ( it 's used by 2 cats daily ) . After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models , I decided to stay with the LM500 and I do n't regret it . The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box , but it works great ( my cats each weigh about 7 - 3/4 lbs , they 're small cats , so the size difference was n't a major problem ) . I have no regrets getting this model again . Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates , but I had to do that with the old box too . When you change and clean the litter box section , wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter , it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily .
2 #### When I received the Littermate it did not work . I called Littermate customer service . Tech support tried to reconcile the problem , but could not . So , they did replace it , for $ 10 more and I had to send them a bunch of proof of purchase stuff . At any rate , they did send me a new one , but it is very finicky , it sometimes works , even with premium clumping litter , it works sporadically , For such a costly product , it is disappointing .
1 #### I actually won this litter box in a drawing . I was planning on buying one any way . Glad I did n't , it started having problems after five weeks . Of course if I had purchased it , I would take it back and get a new one . But I 'm having the same problems others have had , it has a hard time moving a clump of litter sometimes and starts clicking , it wastes litter and now it goes through 5 cycles EVERY time it sweeps even if there is only a small amount and it scoops it the first time . It 's under warranty but the company wants $ 10 to ship new parts . I 'm not paying 10 cents for their mistake ( made in China by the way ) . When it quits completely , I 'll go back to the good old plain litter box .
2 #### If you own a littermaid self cleaning litter box you have no choice but to buy these receptacles . I agree they are flimsy and not worth the cost but the company apparently does n't pay any attention to customer feedback . If I wanted to spend quality time with my cat litter wrapping bags around the box , I would have an $ 8.00 litterbox and scoop it myself . I agree the manufacturer should be ashamed of this product .
3 #### I find that the Littermaid works very well for what it is designed to do . The only truly unpleasant task is changing these waste receptacles . The difficulty I seem to experience is inserting a new receptacle . It is difficult to get the thin retaining lip on the tray itself securely under the plastic flanges attached to the litter box which retain the tray . Once it is in place , it works like a champ , but in a future redesign , I hope that the good folks that design this fine line of electric self - cleaning cat boxes will develop a more secure retaining method that facilitates easier receptacle changeout .
3 #### The receptacles have been reduced in thickness . They bend and break easier now . A sturdier , reusable receptacle would be better .
5 #### Very pleased . I have ownd a Littermaid for the past 8 years and have found this product to be a great time saver . My cat never has a dirty litter box and I use a great deal less litter . This is my second littermaid in 8 years . the first one was no longer auto cleaning and required a manual reset to get the cleaner to run . I beleive the sensor was bad . I was tired of having to remember to reset it so I bought another one . Definately worth the money !
4 #### We have two of the Littermaid Mega LM900 litter boxes , and would buy another one . They work reasonably well , and save a lot of scooping time & effort . As other reviewers have noted , it works OK , but not perfect . Help is needed at times , but it 's still a big benefit to have . The rakes need to be cleaned periodically , since the clumps are not fully dried after 10 minutes . And the litter needs to be redistributed away from the collection box several times each week as a result of the rakes getting filled with wet clumps . Our cats used it almost immediately after it was set up , and still seem to enjoy watching it operate . We have had one unit for about 18 months , and added a second recently . Both work equally well . We use plastic grocery bags in the collection box , which is easier than using the plastic boxes . You may wish to add a timer to turn it off over - night , so it does n't wake you .
4 #### I have multiple cats and have tried many different litter boxes . With the exception of one unit , this has been my favorite of them all . As long as you have good clumping litter , it works beautifully . The only drawbacks are that it can be a little messy disposing of the waste and the litter goes around the unit , but it is easy to clean .
4 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/LitterMaid - LM900 - Self - Cleaning - Litter - Box / dp / B00005MF9U / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">LitterMaid LM900 Self - Cleaning Litter Box</a > Well it 's ok . Still have to clean it out because it does not pick up all the waste . When my cat goes in the corner the waste is not picked up at all . It also takes a lot of litter out when it cleans so litter has to be added often . However , it is better than cleaning a regular litter box every day . All in all I like it better than a regular litter box .
5 #### I have three cats and decided to try this automatic litter box . I have one young cat and two older ones . The younger one watched me put it together and set it up . She was quite intrigued by the raking motion . She immediately used it upon final set up . Then laid there and waited for the raking to begin . When the raking finished she jumped in again and then jumped out . Then she laid there to wait for the raking to begin again . I also bought one for the upstairs and have had no problems with that one either . I am looking forward to less mess and smell . I can see and smell the difference already .
1 #### Great in concept , awful execution . Disgusting to clean when the rake clogs up . There are MUCH better products- Litter Robot- well worth the additional cash .
4 #### This works very good without all the back breaking scoping . The only downside I see is with 2 cats you need to change the container more often .
1 #### Received item , did not work properly . Called LitterMaid and they told me to return to seller . For the benefit of the doubt I had them send me another one . Dealing with Amazon was very helpful and they were nice to me . I received the replacement , and it would not shut off .. back it went for a full refund . I have owned a Littermaid in the past and it worked OK so I thought I would try again ..... BAD EXPERIENCE .
1 #### We bought this item 2 months ago and it quit working after one month . We used the premium litter but the " cat material " clumped up and the rake could n't move it . It created a real mess . Also , it sounded like a loud , dying chainsaw whenever it was doing it 's thing . It was just struggling to move even the tiniest amount of stuff .
1 #### I got more flicked in my face in 1 month then in 15 years in the veterinary business . Emptying the poop containers flicks sand and poop in you face and mouth . Also , litter rake would clump and youhad to clean it by hand . The plastic must have been poop bonding material because you could never get it clean . After 2 weeks , it started throwing poop clumps acrosss the floor . Somehow the rake got stuck and preassure woud build and thwack ! Poop and urine would fly . do n't waste your money
3 #### My model 900 was great until last night . This was my 3rd littermaid . The last two did n't last too long . This one was less than 2 years old . Stops for unknown reason . But , with a multiple cat household , it is so much more convenient that scooping all day long , and it is definitely much better on odor . However , for the price , it should not die so young . I did go out in a panic and bought no . 4 , cheaper version ( though still expensive ) the elite 5000 because it was the only one I could find , but I think I am going to regret it . I 'll see how it does , but I hate to have to keep spending money like this , and I predict it wo n't last that long anyway . Most of these machines can probably be fixed , a ex- littermaid repair person told me , but unless I can do it myself ( he sent me a manual but I ca n't find it now , ) it just does n't pay to keep sending them back , and of course they did n't break until after the warranty ended .
5 #### I love Littermaid products . I have 2 large male Meezers , so I bought a reconditioned LM900 Mega box about 3 years ago . I 've never had a day 's trouble with it over the 3 years , even though both cats use the same box . One cat is very timid and I was afraid he would n't use it because of the cleaning mechanism , which is a bit noisy , but he loves the box and so does his brother . Since there is always clean , fresh litter for them , they use it without reservation and I know they are healthier for it . Sure , there 's still a little maintenance to perform -- I have to scoop out some of the smaller pieces that fall back into the box after the rake , and sometimes my guys will fill up a corner -- but I do n't have to clean the entire box several times a day and empty the litter every other day or so like I would have to with a conventional box . There 's virtually no litter dust or odor , since the box cleans itself and covers the debris every time it 's used . I highly recommend Littermaid products to anyone who loves their cats .
3 #### I admit it , I am not the best cat - mom there is . I have been known to not clean my cats ' litter box for a week . My husband and I are lucky in that neither of our two cats are very picky and they tolerate my laziness . The littermate was a gift to us from my parents . Great , I thought - I wo n't ever have to change it . Wrong . There is now no room for laziness . If I do n't empty the tray it will simply overflow and make a huge mess . So if I walk past the litterbox now , there is no way to ignore it . Never mind what people tell you about two cats and the motor and whatnot , I have two cats , and this box works ok BUT I have to change it MORE often now than when I just had a big regular box . I suppose my cats are worth it . Changing the tray is a big pain ... I 've learned to keep my mouth closed and my eyes shut . Yes , folks , there is nothing like litter in the eye or the mouth from the tray popping out . The number one convenience to this box is that if you do n't scoop every day , you know the cats are n't suffering for it .
4 #### I love this litter box ! I bought mine about 2 years ago and it has been excellent ! ! The only complaint I have is that the sensor somehow broke , so we just turn the switch off and back on each day so that it will scoop . Warning - do not buy the new model of the electric litter box ! My parents bought one , for multiple cats , and the scooping mechanism gets stuck and flings the cat 's " stuff " out of the box .
2 #### If you have a picky cat that will do his business elsewhere if you do n't get to the litterbox immediately after it 's used , this is the product for you . However , if you think this is going to save you any work , think again . Little crusties do indeed stick to the bottom of the pan because the automatic rake does n't touch the bottom . It has to be continually scraped to clean it . Worse is the rake itself , which gets clogged with poop and cat litter . Really look at the picture and think how you would like to clean poop from between all those tines on the rake . The rake also pushes the sand everywhere into all those open nooks and crannies . It also falls down the thin line between receptacle and the unit . For this reason I myself would recommend the tent ( unless you build one yourself ) even though it is overpriced . Now that my unit has stopped working after 2 years , I am thankfully going back to the simplicity of a regular cat box that does n't take me 30 + minutes to clean .
3 #### I bought one of these for my 2 cat household because I hated cleaning the box . I also traveled quite a bit for work and liked the idea of the box cleaning itself while I was gone . The overall idea is good , and the cats used it with no adjustment . It seemed to work well when the tracks stayed clean , but ... my male cat insisted on peeing in corners of the end where the motor and rake are . Then he kicked the damp litter up behind the rake mechanism and into the tracks the rake uses . The litter would clog the tracks so the rake would get stuck , and the litter behind the rake unit prevented it from returning all the way back . Cleaning it out seemed to only encourage him to do it again ! They need to come up with a way to shield the rake and tracks from the litter or at least clean the tracks as it cleans the litter . If your cat(s ) go in the middle of the box like they are " supposed " to this is a good product , albeit a bit expensive to use . But if your cats insist on on peeing on the moving parts , as mine did , it just becomes a big smelly paper weight .
1 #### Our 16 year old cat has had a wonderful LitterMaid Self - Cleaning Litter box for 10 years . Then one day it died . So not wanting to upset the opld girl I bought her a new one . All it did was rake rake rake . It would not stop . I called the company & we tried the reset procedure . No luck . I returned it & got a new one - - same problem . I reset & it just kept raking . I returned the second one as well . They were both defective unfortunately . So I ordered a smaller one from LitterMaid , the LM700 I believe ( or something like that ) it works beautifully . I do n't expect it to last 10 years like our first - - but it would be nice . I will continue to use this brand as the very first one did run for 10 years .
4 #### This is our third LitterMaid litter box . The last two both stopped working after 2 - 3 years . I ca n't say anything about the long - term reliability of this one , but it 's quieter than the others and the motor sounds stronger . Our kitty has some really big , sticky output that the last one would get stuck in and either just sit in stripping out its gears or reverse and run back and forth . This one does n't even sound like it 's straining and just powers through . All the other design defects are still here - primarily that the litter does n't all land in the waste tub , and if there 's a big clump it can land so that the door stands wide open . But a little more power in the motor makes this a much better product . I did have a problem with the specific package we received - it was missing 11 of the 12 waste tubs , the carbon filters , and the little brush . But after a couple back - and - forth emails with Amazon ( who offered to accept a return , but kitty had already inaugurated the new one ) and Fox International , who makes the litterbox , two packages showed up with all the missing parts , shipped by Fox . Thank You Fox !
5 #### My downstairs neighbor bought one of these for her cat , Zipper , about eight months ago . My tortoise shell , Lotta , who stays downstairs daytimes while I 'm gone , fell in love with it , so I bought one for her birthday four months ago . I 've read through the reviews and the unhappy experiences several people have had with it , but neighbor Shirley and myself have had no trouble at all with our units . The cleaning is n't at all that difficult ( does help to follow printed instructions ... taking the thing apart as one person apparantly did is n't necessary ) . The waste receptacles should n't need replacement more often than once every month or so . And while the unit does make some noise , neither of us have found it excessive or particularly annoying . As noted , the above is based upon my experience with my littermaid as well as neighbor Shirley 's experience with hers . Each of us agree that it sure beats the heck out of scooping the litter out every day . Also , we have noticed that less litter is required ... probably because the unit operates about 10 minutes after use , before the urine soaks up a lot of the litter .
5 #### I have been a Littermaid automated catbox user for years . This is the 5th one I have purchased and I would not ever be without it . Littermaid had some problems in the begining and have done great improvements to their designs and operations . This particular model is their absolute BEST . It has a quieter motor , a larger , longer box ( which is great for larger cats ) and works great . I have been through 4 different models , and when the last one finally wore out ( it got ALOT of use with my 3 cats ) I went back to this model , even though Littermaid has a newer model out . Trust me ... this Littermaid is the best , you will absolutely LOVE it .
5 #### I originally had one of these , then bought the newer fancier one ( LME9000 ) and found that the LM900 is MUCH BETTER , so I bought this one again . The litter area on LM900 is great for larger cats and add on the Privacy tent and my cats are happy campers ! !
4 #### with so many different automated litterboxes on the market , i just chose this one based on the fact it 's one of the newer ones , and littermaid is a more recognized brand . i have 3 cats that go A LOT . so it 's important for me to get a litterbox that 's minimal maintanence . 1 ) the set - up is really easy . i for one do n't read directions , and it was simple enough . 2 ) it was pretty much what it claims to do , rake up clumped litter . 3 ) the biggest problem i have so far is that it does n't clean as well as i 'd like it to . little pieces of poop gets pass the rake , so i have to hand - scoop those . 4 ) minor problem is that the capacity does n't allow for you to use lotsa litter , since the rake can get stuck . so if you have cats that pees a lot ( like mine ) the litter can get used up really quick and you would have to refill almost daily . also the removable receptacle is really flimsy . so it 's kinda hard to reuse without breaking . forces you to buy refills . 5 ) all in all , it does save me a little bit of time , and it is much cleaner and smells less than a conventional litterbox . i would recommend it if you have do n't mind spending 100 bucks . my cats seem to like it and find it amusing .
1 #### My original LitterMaid lasted 9 years with little maintenance , only an occasional hosing out and some rake cleaning . It did a decent job with the only problems coming from occasionally putting too much litter in the box . The new model cost much more and the rake does n't even reach the bottom of the box . It skims the top of the litter and leaves most of the clumps , which have adhered to the box bottom and require manual scraping . Please can I buy the original model that had a much stronger motor and worked so reliably ? The cats played in it before it was used , had no qualms about using it afterward , and it moved a lot of poo ! The new one moves little more than aggravation .
5 #### I have two huge cats and have 1 Mega Advanced Deluxe littermaid and one of the smaller models . I am finally free of being Queen Litter Scooper . I also save money by cleaning / washing out the dirty receptacles and then reusing them . I dump the waste in two small garbage bags - seal them up and toss in the garbage pail - no smell . These litter " minders " are not supposed to take away the job of cleaning after your cats - you still have to monitor the waste that gets through the rake people - so you do n't have to scoop every day - you can miss a day or two , but that 's it -and for us who have more than one cat it really is a blessing . I would highly recommend them . Also , if your littermaid stops working ( light on but not moving to clean up ) - call them up - they can be rebooted - YES YOU HEARD ME CORRECTLY . This happened to mine - I thought I had to toss it out . If you call them they 'll tell you where the buttons are to reboot them .
4 #### This was a replacement of a previous one that had broken . Only complaint is this is our third one in 4 years . They are grwat when they work .
5 #### This thing is a hoot . Granted , with 3 large cats the rake sometimes becomes clogged and needs a little help , but watching all 3 cats run to watch it work , look under the raising panel , swat at the rake is hysterically funny . Just make sure you use the recommended litter . I found the corn product made my house smell like corn and the cats would not use it . The arm and hammer baking soda super scoop is better , and I use less of it than I did with the cheaper brands in catboxes . The cats appreciate the ability to always step into a clean box . A plastic 99 - cent paint scraper scrapes the bottom and sides clean with no damage to the box . I have recommended this to all my friends , and will probably start to make it a gift this year .
2 #### I should have read the reviews before purchasing . This is incredibly finicky about precise fill level . I must have overfilled by 1/4 " or so , because it stopped working properly after the first day . The scooper still scooped but the thing seldom opened the lid of the receptacle . With such shallow litter , my cats had trouble digging and covering . The fact that a scoop is included in the package is informative . I gave it two stars instead of one because the charcoal filter does a good job of odor control . And another clock in the house is always handy .
3 #### I really like the idea of not having to scoop the litter box ! This product works well but here are a few things you should know about . First of all , if your cat has soft stool , the rake will just make a mess of it . You 'll end up having to clean the rake and scoop the litter . Secondly , if you are planning to power the box with batteries instead of plugging it into the wall , be prepare to go through 8 DD cell batteries about every three weeks . This is with only have one cat . And the last thing is , purchase the tent because the litter box itself is not that deep so the litter tends to fly out of the box easily . Other then those three things , it works great !
4 #### Agree with other reviews , this product requires daily maintenance to assure smooth operation . My elderly cat likes it , so it 's worth it .
1 #### I 'm giving this 1 star only because there is no option for fewer . Maybe this litter box works for cats who always go in the center of the box , but for those that go more towards the side , this is a real waste of money and I have spent more time cleaning it than I would have to spend on a regular litter box . Also , if your cat has large pees , the chances are that the waste receptacle wo n't close as the clump will get stuck and the lid wo n't come down - not pleasant for us or the cats . The rake and the sides are extremely difficult to clean properly . Besides which - this is so noisy that , if you have the litter box anywhere near a sleeping area , you 'll want to switch it off at night .
1 #### First off , it seems that someone is spamming the reviews . Each of these glowing reviewers has never reviewed anything else on Amazon . And when a bad review is posted you 'll see several days worth of great reviews to push off the bad ones . [ edit : Note the new " Amazon verified purchase " label ! Beware of the glowing review from people who have not purchased this item . ] Let me say , this is the biggest pile of junk you 'll ever waste you 're money on . Even with high quality clumping litter it did not work . The rake would get clogged . The receptacle would n't close . Litter stuck all over the place and in the tracks even though we were well below the " fill line . " We spent more time cleaning this piece of junk than a regular litter box . In less than a month we threw it out in the garbage . Do not waste your time and money on this product . Stick with the regular litter , you 'll be glad you did .
1 #### My wife and I bought one of these infernal machines and next to nails on a chalkboard and Ashley Simpson , the shrieking that comes from the slow - dying motor is absolutely one of the worst noises I can think of . I have been woken from a dead sleep many nights to the tune of " clogged feces . " If you have n't heard this tune , let me describe it for you . Combine a five year old playing the electric violin for the first time with Fran Drescher and add in a few seconds of dead silence in two or three 15 second intervals . So basically , it 's your choice . If you 're a fan of Fran Drescher and grammar school concerts , go for it . Otherwise , invest your $ 100 in something else .
1 #### I had a littermaid a couple of years ago that lasted me for a year and did great . I am not sure what is wrong with this type we had it for a whole week then it stopped working . Do yourself a favor and do NOT get this .
5 #### This is a great invention ... no more scooping daily , much less smell , much less mess . We have one cat & empty the recepticle weekly . Yeah , the poop stinks when the recepticle is in the trash , but duh , it 's cat poop ! Take the trash out . The litter does stick to the rake but not enough to stink or really accumulate . We did have the cat tent also , but it did n't really improve smell & did n't seem to ever fit right . Only complaint : it broke after about 18 months , motor died . But it might have been due to a second cat we used to have , which had issues & pooped about 6 pounds a week .
1 #### Great idea , horrible execution . Disgusting to clean , rake gets clogged . There are much better options . Litter Robot is well worth the extra cost .
4 #### I owned one of these for two years and loved it . It was noisy , yes , but well worth it to save myself the daily scooping ( and to provide a cleaner environment for my two cats ) . Two years to the day after I purchased my first Littermaid the motor died . I re - ordered immediately . My second Littermaid was defective ; the motor stopped working for no reason after only a few days of use . I got a replacement from Amazon , but its motor died after a few weeks . Amazon wo n't send any more replacements , so I either have to order from elsewhere or try a different box . Bummer !
4 #### I 've had mine for three years with two cats , and it still works just fine . I probably take it out and give it a thorough cleaning once a year . To save on receptacles , I line mine with two plastic grocery bags . When it 's full , I just pull up the bags , tie them off , and take it away . Line with new bags , and it 's good to go .
4 #### I left a review regarding Petmate Purrforma jumbo , it was a smelly , horrible mess . Well , I got lucky . My PetSmart told me to bring the Purrforma back and they would credit all toward a new Littermaid and supplys for it . There was even enough credit left for 2 30 # bags of the Nutro dog food I use . The Puurforma is so overpriced as well as poorly designed . I had the receipt for the Puurforma from the month before . I now have my 3rd multicat Littermaid and am very happy again . While not perfect , as litter cleaning will never be perfect , these do work well for me . I have one in the laundry room , one downstairs and the other at my farm . I have yet to find a cat that will not use this box . My cats at home are all over 10 years old . At the farm they are 2 years and younger . Hope this helps .
4 #### I 'm on my third littermaid in about 12 months . We have 3 cats and it does get a workout . My only complaint is that the replacement machines have been used , or at least open package items- thus they have lasted for far less time than the original littermaid LM900 . Nonetheless , they 've all done a fairly good job at eliminating the chore and odors !
4 #### I really do love our littermaid . We bought our first a couple of years ago and bought the mega sized . It finally wore out and this time we accidentaly bought the smaller version , but we think it actually works better . Maybe because the motor does n't have to power the rake to travel as far ? The best tip I have is do n't waste all the money on the receptacles . Buy one box of them and then use plastic grocery bags to " line " each before placing the receptacle in the litterbox . There is plenty of room under the receptacle for the excess bag . Clean up is even easier when all you have to do is pop the receptacle out , find the handles on the bag and pull it out , tie it , and dump it in the OUTSIDE garbage ( it 's pretty stinky ) . One receptacle can last for ages that way ... and no having to wash them out by hand .
3 #### Ok , I do n't own this , but have thought about it . After discovering arm and hammer cat box deodorizer ... I can live without the littemaid . I buy cheap litter because I 've heard that clumping litter can be bad for kitties because they lick their paws and it can cause intestinal blockage . I keep the box , garbage bags , the litter and the deodorizer in the closet - every 3rd day or so I just dump the whole box and add new litter and the deodorizer . I do smell it right after the kitties go - but not shortly thereafter . Try this , if you are leary of buying the litter maid . I rated it a 3 since I have no experience and it seems a lot of people hate this thing !
4 #### I bought my first littermaid about 4 years ago , have never regretted it . It 's much better than having to change a cat box and I do n't have the cat box smell . It is a little work to change the receptacles sometimes if they get too full , but I just dump the whole thing in a plastic grocery bag and take it out to th e trash . I would recommend keeping your receipt and box in case you have problems . They have a 1 year guarantee on them and I had to send mine back once because it quit working and they sent me a new one no problem . One of the best investments I have made
2 #### I want to like this device , I really do . When it works , it 's a dream come true for those ( like me ) who hate to clean litter boxes . Within my experience , however , " when it works " is a serious issue . All three of the LitterMaid boxes I 've owned ( one regular , two Mega ) have broken down beyond any hope of field repair within a couple of months after the warranty expired . Customer service is next to useless for any significant problem ; expect a lecture on selecting the proper litter no matter what you 're calling about . Also , nobody I 've talked to had any idea of how to order parts beyond a replacement comb . The bottom line is that these things are just too expensive to factory - repair or replace every 12 - 14 months , and I 'm not going to do so a third time . If they extend the warranty to three years or so , I 'll reconsider .
4 #### I 've tried the lift - out sifter , which I abandoned after a day . I tried that one that you roll for which you have to buy the crystal litter which is $ $ $ and starts smelling immediately . The rolly thing was a nightmare . Compared to these , I LOVE the Littermaid . That being said I 've found a few things are necessary to do to make it work at its best : 1 ) Use Littermaid litter . Is more expensive but I do n't have to constantly throw all of it out so I think I break even . It clumps perfectly and I get very few leavings . 2 ) Empty the recepticals when they are half full . This will help avoid the vile spatter and spilling . Alternatively , seal the top down before taking out the bottom section and then pull the whole thing out , empty it and then put the old set back ( I definitely reuse them ) . 3 ) Do n't bother with the tent . It 's huge , the opening is n't wide enough to fully open the litter cover when you go to empty it and if your cat is as vigorous as mine at covering the litter , it will get in between the box and tent and is hard to clean . I find the height of the littermaid is enough that he does n't fling litter out the back or sides , just occasionally over the litter recepticle when it 's getting too full .
1 #### I bought this product for $ 66 at Meijers . The cats loved it and so did I , for the first 6 hours . The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake , caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours . I was so bummed . It would have made life so much easier . Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked . This is true ! C'm on you engineers . This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on . Great idea but a real mess to clean up . It is getting returned tomorrow . :(
1 #### I saw this item advertised for a few years and always wondered if such a device could work . I have one 12 year old cat who has begun to urinate more often . I really never had a problem with her litter box until I hurt my back . I decided to bite the bullet and shell out $ ( ... ) for what looked like a solution to both her more frequent pees and my aching back . Unfortunately , the product did not work . It would rake the premium clumpable litter but could not get the ball of pee into the receptacle before getting jammed and backing off and attempting once again only to fail and return to its original position with the error light blinking . I contacted manufacturer by email only to be offered the feeble suggestion to try several other litter . I went out and purchased three different premium clumpable litters and none faired better . PS . Tent is not any better . I also purchased a tent that is made to surround the litter box only to find several pieces for assembly so flimsy they broke . I contacted manufacturer who asked me to email the part numbers and quantity needed . I did and they sent me the WRONG parts . BSN
1 #### Worked great for a week . What a waste of $ 200 ( I got the " Mega " ) . * * * * update * * * * * After my disaster with the Mega I broke down and bought the " LitterRobot " for $ 400 ( I travel and an automated litterbox is a must , not an option ) . Extremely well built but the cats wo n't get near it . The kitten loves it but is n't heavy enough to " trip " it so I have to initiate the cycle myself ( not handy when I 'm gone ) . I saw the " Plus " version of the LitterMaid at Walmart for $ 88 and decided to give it a try . What a little dynamo . It 's smaller than the Mega but it almost seems like the motor size was the same . Everything the Mega did was a struggle but in this smaller version it 's doing great ! ! ! ! This has been a godsend . The " Plus model " can plow through anything . Takes up much less room ( note to the LitterMaid designers- bigger may have sounded like a better sell but my cats only get in it one at a time ) . And if it goes out , at least it was n't $ 200 . This version gets FIVE STARS from me !
5 #### This cat box is a lifesaver . My vet recommended trying this when a Persian of mine started having issues of straying from the box . The vet said that some cats are just extra fastidious and no matter how many times a day a person scoops the box as long as there is anything at all in the box they will refuse to use it . I was hesitant at first to get this , fearing that the cat would be frightened of the motor and would become even more traumatized by the litter box . With great trepidation , I set the LitterMaid up , and from that moment on , there has never been a single instance of the cat straying from the box to do his business . Some people say that a motorized cat box is a waste of money , but it is well worth trying if you face a similar dilemma : it can save your sanity and your carpet , and may let some cats stay in loving homes instead of being abandoned or even euthanized . I am absolutely delighted with the LitterMaid , and have had no problems with it , and at this point mine is over two years old . I highly endorse the LitterMaid system .
5 #### I love Littermaid products . I have 2 large male Meezers , so I bought a reconditioned LM900 Mega box about 3 years ago . I 've never had a day 's trouble with it over the 3 years , even though both cats use the same box . One cat is very timid and I was afraid he would n't use it because of the cleaning mechanism , which is a bit noisy , but he loves the box and so does his brother . Since there is always clean , fresh litter for them , they use it without reservation and I know they are healthier for it . Sure , there 's still a little maintenance to perform -- I have to scoop out some of the smaller pieces that fall back into the box after the rake , and sometimes my guys will fill up a corner -- but I do n't have to clean the entire box several times a day and empty the litter every other day or so like I would have to with a conventional box . There 's virtually no litter dust or odor , since the box cleans itself and covers the debris every time it 's used . I highly recommend Littermaid products to anyone who loves their cats .
1 #### Bought a factory refurbished one despite the legendary dubious quality on these things . It was the BIG model and I have one little cat . It worked fine for 5 months , then it started missing 50 % of the cat 's visits . I took it apart and cleaned it thoroughly , again it worked fine for a month . Then it just stopped raking at all . I called customer service , who tried to tell me that the amount of time you left the device unplugged from power made a difference in the " level of reset " it goes through . For example , unplugging it for 2 - 3 minutes made it do something different than unplugging it for 10 + minutes . Whatever . I left it unplugged for a week , it never worked again . The customer service rep told me " your best option is to just go buy a new one ! " I can see how the company makes their money now . THIS IS A GREAT IDEA , BUT A LOW - QUALITY PRODUCT OLDER MODELS REPORTEDLY WORK SEVERAL YEARS NEW MODELS WORK A FEW MONTHS - THEN DIE BEWARE REFURB MODELS - You will see dealers selling * HUNDREDS * of these as refurbished items . That should be your first warning . These things do n't last . You can save your money and just use the Crystals litter with your cat , or buy one of the $ 9.99 toilet training kits at any pet store and avoid litter altogether . DO NOT get suckered in by these junky items !
1 #### One star is to many for this product . I could n't wait to get one of these . I had one indoor only cat when I finally got one . This is more work than a regular litter box . Litter gets stuck in the grate , to the bottom of the box , ect.(and I did use " premium litter " ) . I would line the box that the litter scooped in with plastic bags to try to make it easier to dump . That did n't work . No matter what I tried it usually threw some dirty litter in my face ! Half the time it would just scoop over the litter and do no more than just break it up or stick in the grate . The other half it would n't get the dirty litter at all it would just rack over it . It some how managed to get a lot of litter ( dirty and clean ) in the floor . It is very bulky to try to handle and clean . After I would clean it best I could ( I use bleach cleaner and alcohol ) it would still stink to high heaven ! After about 2 months , it just up and quit ! I went back to a normal litter box . I also got another cat and the regular litter box smells much better and is much easier to clean with two cats than the Litter Maid was with one .
1 #### I have two cats , I bought this to help keep things clean and tidy , well it was a disaster and here is why . There is a MAJOR design flaw in this litter box , it has no solid scoop only a rake - like feature to pick up the cat waste . Well that is lovely if the waste is n't in any way still damp but if it is watch out ! With the rake - like feature it dug through the waste and stuck in the scooper all the time . Then it would reverse and push the unscooped waste into the mechanisim and it was just gross ! I was useing premium clumping litter so it was n't the litter . I spent more time cleaning this litter box than I did the old fashion kind . I finally threw this thing away after about 6 - 12 months of trying to deal with it . I went out and bought an old fashioned covered box , it is cleaner , smells better and does n't constantly jam the way my Littermaid did . Maybe if you have one cat of small to average size or even two small cats this thing will work fine but if you have a large cat or multiple large cats this thing is a disaster !
1 #### I spend more time cleaning this automatic litter box than I used to scooping litters from the regular litter box . It 's messy and creats more work . I wish I did n't get it . I 'm throwing it away .
5 #### I tried many different vitamins before finding one my dog would eat every time . She 's not one that will eat anything put in front of her . But this one , she likes .
5 #### Dogs love them and I will be ordering another bottle next week .
5 #### My dogs love these and think they 're treats . One of my dogs has cancer , so I purchased these for her , in the hope that I could get some more nutritious supplements into her body ( she 's always been picky and this horrible disease has made that much worse ) . Overall , great product & I highly recommend .
4 #### Dogs love .. glad they do n't have calcium in them ..
5 #### Nu Pet seems to be a great product at a great price .
1 #### I have 3 dogs , a Healer , Cockapoo , and a CockerSpaniel . These wafers are way too thick for the two smaller dogs . I 've been splitting them up but still .. ,
5 #### Nice product . Our senior hound takes these with no problem . She is very picky when it comes to meds and we 've had no problem with these . We 're hoping that they help with her nutrition .
5 #### My dog loves them and takes them with no problems .
5 #### My 14yr old fur baby has surprisingly more energy and can do a 2 mile run again . Amazing . I got this product to help with itching and old age bumps . It has decreased the itching and bumps significantly although not completely . I am amazed at the puppy like energy and will continue to use this product .
1 #### I 've been giving these to my dog for a month and there has been no changes .
5 #### Our puppy LOVES these ! She has surpassed her siblings in growth & how healthy she is ! So happy we chose these !
3 #### I have n't noticed any difference in my dogs after giving them these . I was hoping the lipomas on my dog might shrink , but there was n't any change in them .
5 #### I have been giving those Wafers to my senior puppy for several months now and they have improved her energy level . She likes the taste and loves them as a treat . Wish they would be a bit softer to chew , especially for a senior dog .
5 #### These wafers are so good for my two dogs . One , a blind and diabetic 11year - old chihuahua , has gotten so energetic . She acts like a puppy . The other , a three year old Pomeranian - mix is already full of energy but this is an extra boost for her . Both love the taste and their coats and eyes are so shiny and sparkling . I 've used another product in the past but this one has much better ingredients and have produced excellent results .
5 #### I had no trouble getting my dog to take these . We will see how she acts now that she is on them . She has had a few seizures lately , and that is why I ordered these . I heard they were good for seizures .
4 #### My dogs just go crazy over the sound this toy makes ! Excellent exercise for them . I really , really wish it were a bit more durable as my dogs are able to destroy / chew them -- I have to take them away long before the sound mechanism gives out due to them makes holes in the ' skin ' . Please Wiggly Giggly . . . can you make them stronger somehow ? Then they would be perfect ! :-)
5 #### The thing makes noises as it rolls around and drives our dog CRAZY - barking and growling and high centering take place everytime our dog plays with this ! It 's a bit large for a puppy ( hence the high centering ) but once they get some size , it 's perfect !
1 #### Pros : It 's nice that it does n't need batteries and is made of tough plastic . Cons : Both of my large dogs , a lab and St Bernard were scared to death of the sound created by this ball . We have a dog / cat toy exchange program with friends at work of toys that our pets did n't like . Two other people tried this ball and their dogs were afraid of it too . I think it would be better as a baby toy .
5 #### My setter just loves this ball . Unfortunately she was able to tear into it and now it 's lost one of it 's " voices " . But she still plays with it .
5 #### My Jack Russell gets a crazed look on her face as soon as she hears the noise emitted by this toy . Keeps her busy for hours . But , it can be chewed , and she has destroyed a number of them . Considering that , I like the internal construction . The gigglers are inside very hard tubes , so although she managed to get inside the rubber exterior , she had a much harder time with the insides and it was easy to take the tubes away from her once she had exposed them . She still likes the ball and carries it around like a prize .
5 #### Thse are a splurge but pretty compareable in price to other / commercial freeze dried meat and fish treats ( such as Halo ) . Plus , they have much less questionable filler and junk in them , and the kitties love them ! Both of them stop whatever they 're doing and come running if there 's any hint of a treat ! They go really fast around here but , if your kitty is a pickier eater and take longer than a month to finish , I would definately recommend placing " left overs " into an airtight container and then placing them in the fridge . They 're freeze dried so they can pull moisture out of the air and can start to spoil and go rancid .
5 #### I have 4 cats .. one is finicky and will not eat treats or canned food . BUT , these Salmon cat treats .. he goes absolutely nuts over . He LOVES LOVES LOVES this treat . I just wish they sold them in a much bigger size . Oh , the other 3 love these too .
5 #### My cats know when this treat comes in the mail ; they recognize the box instantly and start crowding around it hoping for handouts . I even have to keep the box locked up and out of sight , because one time I came home to find that my cat had gotten on the counter , knocked the box down , slashed the side , and stolen every treat left inside the bag . The treats resemble light croutons , and the box holds an ounce . It 's great for diabetic cats and other cats on restricted diets because it contains no fillers , but it 's a great treat for any cat .
5 #### It is working GREAT ! It 's clean and you do n't have to clean the waste yourselve . My cat also having fun watching it !
4 #### We needed something that could make a clean spot for our furry friends more often than we could as they were not happy with our once - a - day cleanout . This works great . The only bad thing is the design of the receptable cover . Bending back the " bumps " does n't always work too well and the filters never , I mean never stick . However , the rest works just great and we are happy with it .
5 #### The litter box arrived very quickly and was exactly what I was looking for . This particular model from Litter Maid works very well and I highly endorse it .
1 #### This thing constantly got stuck where intervention was need to ' unstuck ' it from the cat mess . That kinda defeats the purpose of ' automatic ' . One day it got stuck while I was a work . The poor thing was grinding for who knows how many hours . Stripped the gears and it was the moved to the trash .
4 #### I had this box for a couple of years and it was getting kinda yucky . So I decided to replace it with the newer model ( not sure of the number , but it was the more rounded one with metal rake ) . I hated that one and after about 3 months went serching for this one again . The 700 is just the right size . I like how it rolls up at the end of the cycle before tipping back down to dump the " load " . The plastic rake works just fine . It is used by one cat , but the bin still fills up pretty fast ( about a week ) . I have read others mention dumping and reusing the bins ( I guess this would be fine , but I do n't ) , so there is a continuing cost for the bins . Over all my cat ( Emma ) and I love it . By the way , it is not totally maintenance free , you ca n't just ignore it for a week ! I use the scoop daily to stir the litter and remove any little particals that may be left behind and to make sure the bottom is scrapped clean , but this process takes about a minute / day . My cat uses the same spot in the box everytime , so sometimes the bin gets filled up on one side , again , just use the scoop and even it out . I highly recommend the LitterMaid 700 .
1 #### I have a friend who has a Littermaid , and has had no problems with it , but mine broke within a couple days . However , I did buy mine used from a yard sale , so that could be part of it . It worked fine at first . One of my cats likes to use the litter box right on the edge of the box , and the Littermaid does n't clean that area very well . My other cat digs A LOT in the litterbox . Whenever he went , he would pile up all the litter in one big pile . I think that 's what killed the motor . He also was used to more litter than what you 're required to use for the Littermaid . He likes to dig deep . I have a CatGenie now , and I absolutely LOVE it . I know it 's much more expensive than the Littermaid , but it 's worth it for me . At least consider the CatGenie before buying a Littermaid .
1 #### I bought this for my older cat and now have gone back to a regular plastic box . It is just too small for turn - around room , thus he urinated several times on top of the box and ramp , with urine leaking in between the space where the ramp connects . It is difficult to clean although I used premium litter . I wish I 'd paid more attention to the negative reviewers and saved my money .
5 #### For what it 's intended to do , this machine is a terrific value for the price . It DOES require attention on a daily basis , do n't let the idea of a self - cleaning box carry you away . I was a little aggravated by having to monitor it at first , then I realized one of my cats who refuses to use a litter box ( she does her business in the courtyard of my house instead ) now insists on using this litterbox . LitterMaid could have found no better way to impress me than that ! One improvement I could suggest would be an adjustable ( or just longer ) timer . This one waits ten minutes , then scoops . That 's fine for solid waste but not quite long enough for urine clumps so it tends to stick to the tines and often gets dragged back into the box . However , next raking disposes of that ball nicely . It is fairly odor free except for the cats kicking up litter dust as they scratch around the box . Bottom line is , I would buy it again .
1 #### I had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely . The rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter , even with daily cleaning . Sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night , very noisily , until I put a timer on it to turn off at night . It was very diffult to clean , even with daily inspection . Go the old fashioned way , with a tray and a liner !
1 #### Great idea , horrible execution . Disgusting to clean , rake gets clogged . There are much better options . Litter Robot is well worth the extra cost .
1 #### At first it looked like it was going to work great ( when the litter was clean ) . After a day or so , it was n't cleaning very well . I got better litter and it started working better , but still not great . Litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake . After about two weeks of use , the rake stopped moving backwards . I tried to fix it , but it just wo n't go in reverse . Overall , this was a big waste of time and money . I 'm not even going to try to get another one . A good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean . It 's too bad as it had a promising beginning . DO NOT BUY .
5 #### I was amazed to see some negative comments about littermate . My has been working fine for five years . No mechanical problems at all . The instructions say to empty the container once a week . My cat fills it in five days . So I schedule myself to empty it twice a week . Is it Monday or Thurs ? Time to clean the litter box . It does take expensive litter , but you use less . I find that emptying all the litter and starting over needs to be done about one a month . I do check the box on a daily basis . That is easy for me as it not located in an out of the way place . Yes , it does make noise . But , that just tells me the cat has been there . I only change the container when I empty the box . Works find to simply empty it and replace . I use baby oil in the bottom to help keep it from sticking . One funny story is that the first time my cat heard it she ran out of the room . Now she puts her head over the top and watches the rake . It is quite humorous to watch .
4 #### This is a nice extra to have if you have cats , but not all cats will use this item . My mother - in - law actually purchased it for her 2 cats and had it for a couple of weeks and her cats just did not like it at all . She passed it along to us , our 2 cats at the time used it without any problems . We have since gotten a kitten and she uses it as well . I recommend getting the cover that you can put over it , makes it not look quite so ugly . It is NOISY ! If you put it somewhere in your home that is far enough from bedrooms at night it 's not so much an issue , but beware that if you are a lighter sleeper and have it nearby you will hear it in the middle of the night . It waits about 10 minutes after the cats use it to turn on and scoop their mess . It also wo n't go on if the cat is back in it at the time . The little containers that the mess is scooped into are pricey , we reuse them several times instead of changing them each time we empty ( which is daily ) . This saves quite a bit of money .
1 #### For the first week , I loved it . Then the rake assembly began to have multiple problems . It has spontaneously fallen off at least 4 times . Now , no matter how perfect the litter is , it ca n't seem to rake the box at all , even after one use . I have 4 cats using it , so that may have contributed to it 's problems . However , I can not recommend this item at all . I feel like I completely wasted my money on it .
5 #### I have to admit the thought of dropping [ $ $ ] on a LITTER BOX was a scary prospect ! But , as I am sharing my one - bedroom apartment with two kitties , I was desperate for a solution to the inevitable odor problem . As I work full - time outside the home , it seems the box is never as fresh as I 'd like , and there is no place to " hide " it - like a lot of homeowners who keep the litter box in the basement , or some such out - of - the - way location . One day after setting up our new LitterMaid , I was completely sold ! All embarrassing odors were gone ! I am happy to use my little hand - vac to clean up the kicked - out litter every few days in exchange for an apartment that no longer smells like a litter box . Also , some reviewers have brought up the issue of cat litter : buy the best - quality clumping litter you can . The system uses so little of it compared to traditional boxes that it 's a wise investment towards a smooth - running system . All - in - all , it 's my opinion that the legitimate drawbacks ( litter mess , noise , container cost , sticky clumps , etc . ) are a small price to pay for a house that is n't stinky !
4 #### I have owned the Littermaid for now about 2 years and really appreciate how well it works . I often forget that I need to empty it out and the little liner is usually packed full . I have found that the plastic liners are a bit fragile , so I took some 2 inch packing tape and wrapped it around the fringe of a new plastic liner . Since then it fits better and does nt warp or crack when replacing . I also can give it a little spray of cooking oil so I can wash it out and reuse it during the next empty . Using this technique I have only used about 4 liners in 2 years . I have had pretty good success with the Arm and Hammer brand of clumping litter , and DO NOT buy the little " balls " of the new litter , plays havoc on the machine and they end up clogging and popping around all the time increasing the noise and I m sure the wear on the machine . This is definately a ONE CAT machine , my cat is so facinated with the device she 's in and out about 2 times an hour , so with more cats I can see how the machine would drive me insane . I think I am used to the noise , though I stash the device in the laundry room so its not too bad .
5 #### I have used this ear wash on my , highly sensitive and allergic to everything , Weimeraner for a couple of years now . We have even been able to avoid prescription medications if I catch the ear soon enough ! Has a pleasant smell and Aloe Vera along with some other extracts for a soother , calming and refreshing product for your pet . I add tea tree oil to the bottle for an antiseptic , antibiotic and antifungal effect . Good luck !
5 #### Works great to keep their ears clean daily and smells like cinnamon ! Works REALLY well for cocker spaniel ears to keep away yeast infections also .
5 #### My dogs ears are extremely sensitive ( the skin in particular ) and this works great for him . Other products , including name brands , actually contributed to giving him ear infections as well . Have used this product for the last three years and have no problems when I stick to this . Cost a couple of dollars more but it is a whole lot cheaper than a trip to the vet . Worth every penny !
5 #### Works great for my dog . She always has itchy ears and this helps every time . She does n't mind me using it either , she just sits there and lets me put it in .
5 #### I finally found a great product that is easy to apply and does a great job on my dog 's ears
5 #### My dogs will be shaking there heads nonstop with itchy ears and this immediately stops their itching .
4 #### The wiggly giggly ball is cute and makes cute noises - I originally bought one at a baby store for my then-2 year old son , but my basset hound quickly took ownership of it ( she enjoyed it more anyway ) . One word of caution is that it is not a chewy ball - if the dog has a desire to chew on it then it will be history in no time . We are on our third wiggly ball for that reason - but still love them !
4 #### Good product . I did not observe any sensitivity on my Havanese 's part , other than the general dislike of fluid running everywhere . Concur with other reviewers the bottle is terrible and much was wasted . This was a stop gap until we could get to the groomers and have the ears plucked . If we were using it regularly would recommend putting the fund in another container .
5 #### I just love this product ! It was recommended to me by my groomer . It has saved my poor poodles ears from infections . I also love their " eyes so bright " product which has saved my cocker spaniel from eye problems . Use a cotton ball for easier application . I highly recommend this product !
1 #### UPDATE : ark naturals never did reply to my letter and call re the safety of this product . I would be leery of them in general for ignoring my report . I have the Eyes Bright lotion too and am tossing it just because they made it . Right numpties ! ( original review ) My aussie mix acted like I was hurting her no matter how gentle I was applying this stuff for general cleaning of her healthy ears . Noticing cinnamon leaf oil in the ingedients , I wondered if that might not be an uncomfortable thing to squirt on tender membranes . I tried a little on a q - tip in my own ear and YOW ! ! ! ! ! It took copious rinsing with saline solution to stop the burn , which indeed felt just like I 'd stuck one of those kid - treat cinnamon oil toothpicks in my ear . I felt terrible for having inflicted it on my dog , and especially on the ears of my recently - deceased 21 year old cat , who did n't seem to enjoy the experience either . I wrote a detailed letter to Ark Naturals immediately , worried that this formula is out there being put in other animals ' ears . It has been over a month with no response whatsoever . No matter what their response is , I think this is disgraceful and suspect . The ingredients claim to be human - quality -- I recommend testing it on yourself to see if you may be inadvertently hurting your pet . Mine is Lot # 61180 , FYI .
4 #### This stuff works great and it 's all natural .. But - I spilled it everywhere trying to get it in my poor dogs ear . If she was n't so obedient she would 've been all over the place as soon as I started spilling . Fix the bottle please , at the rate it 's going I 'm not going to have any left and I just bought it .. Plus I feel like I might be getting a bit too much in her ears , not that it does anything , its just wasteful . Otherwise , great scent , nice and gentle , my dog even seems more cheerful .
5 #### This product is by far the best ear cleanser ; better than the prescription one as well . Max has chronic ear problems secondary to having atopic dermatitis . Ark cleanser is gentle yet very effective ; I use a bit of vinegar diluted with water regularly as well but then use the ark cleanser ; it soothes his ear immediately and leaves a scent of cinnamon . Poor Max his ears get so inflamed that it even takes the prescription meds 3 days to get the swelling to go down ; so this ark cleanser working on day one has totally amazed me . It must make Max feel the difference as well because no more struggling with him to be still he actually leans towards me when I use this product . Super thank you please do n't stop making Ark ear cleanser . and its all natural ; just does n't get any better than that .
5 #### I do n't know what it is about this ball , but my dog goes absolutely crazy over it . We call it the crack ball because my dog is definitely addicted !
3 #### I bought this ball for my blind dog . Unfortunately the sound is only sporadic so she still was n't able to find it . Bummer
2 #### and he tore through this toy in no time . I give it a 2 because he really liked it before he broke it and maybe I could have taken the ball away from him when he was gnawing on it . But , he 's a little dog ; a dog toy should be able to tolerate the jaws of a little westie .
4 #### I would not give this to a chewer . One of my dogs loved this and played with it but the other ... destructo girl got a hold of it and destroyed within mins . Soft plastic . Otherwise , great amusing product for dogs .
5 #### I love the Wiggly Giggly , even though it lost it 's giggle pretty quickly due to high playing usage , my dogs loved it and still take it out of the toy box !
2 #### My dogs favorite toy is the large wigggly giggle ball , but it 's cracked with holes in it . I thought the small one would be a better size , buy it does n't make much noise . Unless it does n't work correctly .
5 #### The ball makes this cute funny noise when its in motion . I play soccer with him with this ball and he loves to play with it . Great toy ... I recommend it to all new puppy owners .

I gave him the giggle ball when I gave him the babble ball . He still has one that he plays with ( when we 're willing to put up with it ) , its not the giggle ball . The giggle ball was fun as long as it could n't fit in his mouth . Once it did it went from giggling when you shook it to sounding like broken pieces . So here is a video from the past , in memory of Sherlocke 's giggle ball , may it rest in peace where ever it ended up .
2 #### Very difficult to manipulate it to make noises unless I shook it - my dog had very little success with it .
1 #### It takes a lot of work to find the exact roll that will cause one very brief squeacK. The dog will seldom if ever find it . My dog is n't at all interested . It 's a total loss as far as I can see . If a person ca n't even make it work ......... I only gave it one star because there 's no way to give NO STARS .
3 #### I was hoping for something a little more responsive , to help my nearly blind Dachshund locate the ball when we play . This one squeeks and chirps , so I was hopeful . When we played with it though , it took quite a bit of force to get it to make a noise . I did n't expect to have to kick it like a football to get it to make noises . Maybe a larger dog would get more from it , but it did n't work for us .
1 #### Having had a larger Wiggly Giggly ball in the past I was happy to order this smaller version for my new doggy pals . What arrived did not meet expectations . Absolute dud . Did not roll and make the sounds as the larger one I had in the past did . I am suspecting that this may be an imitation of the original .
4 #### My pup has larger ball that makes much more noise . I threw it and it would make small noise . dog love the larger broken one better .
4 #### Great toy , but toy will not last long with a pet that likes to chew . A tougher material on the exterior would make this a must buy .
4 #### My puppy loves this thing . She wo n't play with it for a long time but when she does it is all out fun . She barks at it and chases it around the room . She is only 5lbs and I thought this would be too big for her but she plays with it just fine .
3 #### Cute ball with silly noises , but not made for a medium to large size dog unless they are very gentle with their toys . Our dog had this destroyed in 2 laps around the yard . Yes , he was unsupervised , but it would n't have helped to supervise him as quickly as he had a hole in it ! Probably great for a smaller dog that would push it around to activate the sounds but not so much for a dog that can get it in his mouth and bite it . I had thought the ball was more rigid than it was when it arrived . Next time I will read the FULL description , not just the top one that says it is durable . Had I read the second description , I would have seen that it was polyvinyl and not bothered with it .
3 #### It does n't make the giggling noises very easily , I have to shake it hard to make it work . So when my dog is playing with it it is just another ball .... it 's just okay .
5 #### I have a 7 lb . toy schnauzer who totally LOVES this ball . Its big for her but there are holes in the ball and she puts her teeth in there and can carry it all around . She will even at times lay down with it still in her mouth . She does n't want to give it up . She will play for hours with it . She has tons of toys and this is her second favorite out of all her toys . Her top favorite is the babble ball .
2 #### My dog loved this toy and he got a lot of use out of it . The only problem is the he shredded it the whole time . It was a disaster within hours . The rubber is like a cheap dollar store sqeek toy . He still wanted to play with it , but almost choked on a loose piece , so we had to throw it away . Not worth the money .
5 #### First , the noise level is low . Nothing that 's going to drive humans crazy . Second , the Wiggly Giggly Ball is everything it promises to be . Tough , makes low - level noise , and requires no batteries . Love that . Though my current dog did n't go bonkers over this ball , I 've had dogs who loved batting them about . My dog is into noisy toys but not balls so much . But I 'd still recommend the Wiggly Giggly Ball for its quality and durability .
1 #### This is not a toy for dogs ... be careful your dog may chew it into pieces and swallow it and the surgery is very expensive ! ! ! ! It does n't ' wiggle ! WTF
5 #### Great interactive toy for your pet . My English Bulldog loves to chase and play with this ball that is visually and auditorily stimulating .
5 #### I have a little 6 lb dog , this ball is too big . I gave it to a friend who has a 20 lb dog who destroys everything , the dog also destroyed this ball . the dog loved the ball till she destroyed it . A great toy for the right dog .
5 #### Great toy for my Yellow Lab , he loves it .. Would have preferred the larger one but have n't been able to find them for some time now ..
3 #### We had a Silky Terrier for 17 years . We got him a Giggle Ball a few years ago . He loved that thing . Bought this item for our 8 month old Yorkiepoo . She just looks at it . Item is great but does n't excite all dogs .
5 #### Initially this was purchased for our kids but they never got into it . While cleaning the basement , I decided to try it out with our Pit Bull puppy . At first , he was scared but it was n't 5 minutes later he was batting it all over the house . It has lasted us about a month BUT we do not just give it to him . We use it as a training / reward tool . Even then , the little noise makers have been destroyed . I do think if we left it out for him , it would have been destroyed with in a 24 hour span . But , Kongs do not even last in our house . Although it is deteriorating , I love this toy / tool and so does our pup :)
1 #### When I received this Ball , I was surprised how big it was , considering it was a ' small ' dog toy . My 9 month old puppy ( Pug & Jack Russel Terrier Mix ) chewed it apart in 30 min . It was a waste of my money .
2 #### This " wiggly giggly " ball was very disappointing . I ordered the first one that seemed to be defective , which of course amazon was quick to replace . The second one came and was no better than the first one . It would only make those cute little noises if I shook it like a crazy person , but as soon as I would roll it for my little dog , it went mute . He lost interest in it pretty fast after that so it went back . I would have kept it for just a regular ball for him but at almost $ 12 , I thought that was a little pricey for a do nothing ball .
5 #### My dog loves these balls . He has two sizes the large and small ball . They tend to lose the giggly parts so you have to remove them when they become loose , but these are his favorite tools .
1 #### This was bigger than expected ( my bad , the size is listed ) so it was too big for my dogs .
4 #### My blind dog loves this product , but unless it 's couched inside a large ' ferret ball , ' his teeth destroy it within just a few minutes . Make Wiggly Giggly a more hard and less ' squeezable ' product and it will deserve a 5 - star rating !
5 #### This ball gets lots of interactive play at our house . We try to keep at least one available at all times for retrieving . Our Westie absolutley loves this ball . It is definitley made to be an interactive toy . Dogs have a tendancy to chew this toy into pieces , so be careful about leaving the ball out unless playing with your pet .
4 #### Tkhe fur babies eat them so I guess they are acceptable
5 #### Great combinations of treats . My cat is partial to seafood , so I thought I would try these . She absolutely loves them . I have gotten her to do little tricks to get them . She will sit up and meow . She will jump up on her dresser and lay down . She will sit and say please
5 #### This has by far been the best dog bark collar yet .. We had the older model which was great . This model now features a rechargeable battery , static shock .. which i do n't use ... and a sensitive rating .. Very excited about the upgraded as i am in the business of training puppies .. well done .
5 #### Works great for runs . I love that you can make it various lengths and it has a ton of attachments . The quality is great and holds up against my puppy who loves to chew .
5 #### Excellent quality . It is awesome to walk my big dogs with . I have full control . I really like the hand grip . That is great when I need them closer . Very happy with this leash .
5 #### I love to run and have a standard poodle who runs with me . It is hard to hold the leash when I run , but now I do n't have to . This thing is perfect and I can run naturally and he can come along with me . Highly recommend !
3 #### Even though they loved them they were too expensive for a second purchase .
5 #### Love it ! Just like with parenting ... we need 2 hands sometimes while keeping our loved ones safe . I just got a puppy 5 days ago and already used it outside to get the recycling and garbage to the curb . Not for leash walking training as too tempting to bite / chew when it dangles . But eventually , that will be great as well .
5 #### This leash is really good . It has nice thick bungie type material . It has 2 handles for flexible lead distance . The belt holds the doggie bags and makes the leash handsfree . This leash is a handsfree and ment to be around your waist . It has fit up to a 42 " waist . Waking my dog is easy , it gives her room to explore but not too much room . It can stretch but my puppy is n't strong enough yet to do that . I did n't have any issues as I walked and used my phone .
5 #### I love my new hands free dog leash , I wish I would have purchased it sooner ! I run with my Jack Russel mix , and actually do n't use the belt since it makes it too long for my little guy . I just hook the leash part around my waist to the d - ring and its a perfect length . It keeps my dog close without having to worry about stepping on or having him to far away . It 's also a little springy in case he gets too far ahead , it does n't choke him . The best part is that it 's completely hands free so I can keep track of my steps too . Highly recommend !
4 #### my cat loves it jumps up and down when she sees me getting her bag of goodies .
5 #### I have two boston terrier puppies ! My bostons are 14 weeks old and have just realized they can run off quickly ! This leash is fabulous ! I can walk or jog with my dog attached to me and he has room to move around . The elastic give of this leash keeps your dog from jarring you and tugging at your waist . I like that you have several clips to attach the leash to giving you the freedom to walk your dog on the right or left side . We live on a farm so this leash quickly got a bit dusty but it was a breeze to rinse off in the sink with some dawn dish soap . I am potty training my dogs so keeping them on a leash close to me in the house is really helpful . The waist belt is very comfortable and adjustable and I like that the leash detaches from the belt as well . The included waste bags are helpful to have on hand as well . I would love to see an addition leash available to add to the waste belt so I can attach both my puppies to the same belt .
5 #### This is GREAT quality . Seriously I love this thing . My dog is n't used to it , and I do n't use it to job but I anticipate it being helpful in situations where we 're walking a lot and I need my hands free ( whenever that might be ) . I tried it out and the only thing is , I wish there were like , a way to adjust the length . My dog gets a little too far away from me , I 'll need to hold the leash to keep it from getting under her belly or her getting too far . I 'm REALLY Happy with the quality and ease of use though . VERY nice leash set . UPDATE : Unfortunately I took my dog to the beach wearing this ... and a little sand got into the leash buckle , where it attaches to her collar . Now I can not use it . Any idea how to get the sand out ? !
5 #### Works great even with my big dogs ! Waste strap can be used with any collar or harness which is great to satisfy a diversity of dogs ! I liked this product because it enabled we to jog with my pup hands free .
5 #### I have a dog leash similar to this and use it for our hyper puppy ... it 's great for keeping him in tow without him pulling my arm off ! My niece has used ours several times and loved it ( she 's 9 and wants to be a vet when she grows up ) . I ordered this leash to give my niece for her birthday . It 's high quality and she 'll love the cute blue accents . It also comes with a doggie bag holder that already has a roll of doggie bags in it . I 'm super excited to gift this to my niece - she 's going to be THRILLED ( and I 'm excited to have such an easy gift that she 'll legitimately love ) .
5 #### I really love this leash ! I got it for my dog Lexie because , she tends to get out of her collar this a way to control her that is easier for me . The straps were easy to adjust by the length I wanted to be able to walk her . I have no complaints this is the best bang for your buck !
5 #### Huge hit with all my cats . They 're a bit smaller than other Temptation varieties .
5 #### My boys love plush toys , These have lasted several wash and dry cycles . Worth the money .
5 #### Excellent product . The material is durable and it is the perfect size for my Honda CRV ; the cover protects the passenger seats as well as the backs of the front seats . Quite pleased that it does n't shift and appears to make my Dane feel secure .
5 #### Katy The Cat loves them and that 's what counts . As soon as I open the package she comes running- well maybe more like sauntering - to get her goodies . I continually buy these because she thinks they 're great !
5 #### It works fine , plugged our TV and our speakers .
5 #### My favorite planner . This is the second year I have used this brand and as long as it is available .
1 #### It was an old calendar and the quality was Extremely poor . It is unusable .
5 #### This calendar is perfect for my needs , a family calendar with plenty of space to write on each day and take notes on the side , without all the individual day pages making it heavy . This is very easy to carry around and is very attractive . There are notes pages in the back and a small slot on the back cover to keep receipts , notes , invites or whatever .
5 #### Lovely heavy card stock . Makes a nice impression . Heavy envelopes also . CroninCards makes very nice designs . I have used their cards in the past and always receive compliments . Recommended .
4 #### I like this planner but I really liked the one I found last year better but this is the correct size I was looking for and I like the way the months are displayed .
4 #### This is heavy duty .. it worked great on cloth seats .. on leather it is very slippery , I have to put some fabric under it to keep it from slipping . I do n't use the part that connects to the front head rests . Doing so may alleviate the slipperiness . There are velcroed slots that can be used to pull a seatbelt through . All in all it is good quality and does the job .
5 #### Have been using this cord to attach my sound bar to my Tv and have n't had an issues . Works great !
5 #### I do n't know about anyone else but when you have a car and not an SUV it 's very difficult to attach the bottom to anything on the underneath of your seat unless you have an older car . The newer Vehicles have nothing to hook the basic car covers on . This is assume just hook them to your head rests and Wella all set to go . I also notice that other people state that their dogs still get in the front with this particular hammock cover . Hello it 's soft fabric I would suggest a gate that you can buy so they ca n't get into the front seat . Overall great product .
5 #### I 've got an 08 Hylander , so I was a little concerned about the size of the cover . After measuring my back seat multiple times , I concluded that the cover would fit , but it would be tight . Turns out it 's about 4 inches short , about 2 inches on each side . Not the end of the world , I can live with a couple of inches of seat uncovered . Cause my dog is n't going to hit those exposed inches on either side of the cover . My dog is 120lbs of Shepherd / Mix , that sheds like it 's his job , so I need something that will be able to handle his size and weight . This cover is sturdy and well made . I 've no concerns about it bolding up for a long while . The stitching along the straps that hold it up are reinforced . The clasps that hold the cover up , are solid and once adjusted , do not slip . The bottom that goes over the seat , has this lining that holds it in place and does n't let the cover slide all over the seat . It also has Velcro openings for the seat belts or a strap if you want to add one . First day using it we got some freezing rain , The cover absorbed all my wet and soggy pooch could give it and more .
5 #### Finally , a planner that has enough room to write in , no more tiny writing that I ca n't decipher after the fact . The best planner by far .
5 #### I buy a new one every year . Always look forward to the new designs .
5 #### very nice , pocket great , band to hold it together . Everything I needed .
4 #### It 's a bit large for my purposes - but otherwise it 's great .
5 #### Really cute and really the only monthly planner on the market .
5 #### Exactly as expected for a month to month calendar
5 #### Love it . It fits in all my bags and at home it stays right by my chair . Love , love , love it
5 #### Perfect for my needs . I only like to use monthly view calendars with squares big enough to write a few notes on the days . I always have a hard time finding a simple , no frills calendar book with just monthly views without the daily or weekly calendar included . Most are " pocketbook " size and I find them to be too small . Love the extra note pages , the elastic to band the book closed , and the little pocket in the back cover . Unlike another reviewer mentioned , the dates in my calendar are all correct . A great product !
5 #### Repeat customer on anything Blue Buffalo for the fur babies . They love these - even one of mine with a finicky stomach .
5 #### Love it , love it , love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This was exactly what I was looking for and it arrived a week sooner than expected . Will definitely buy another one next year .
3 #### My cats did n't really like this food , but they are picky eaters .
5 #### My calendars are an essential part of my life as I 've gotten older . And , they allow writing on the date and notes on other pages . It 's great for keeping my doctors appointments and other scheduled activities !
5 #### After using the Erin Condren calendar for years , I thought I would try something new . I am so glad I did ! I absolutely love this ! It 's layout , pullover cord closure , and extra pages were exactly what I needed . Perfect in every way .
5 #### Not too big , not too small , the Goldilocks of organizers !
1 #### Love the look of the calendar , but the dates are incorrect by 1 day from March 2017 - on . Useless item and waste of my money .
5 #### It fit myT3i perfectly . It was a much more secure fit than the original Canon which resulted in the loss and need for this replacement . No problems .
1 #### Not sue why but my fur baby will not eat these , she pushes it away with her nose when ever I try and give her one .
5 #### Super product . For planner people like me it 's tough to find all the aspects I want and do n't want . I want decent monthly planner . That 's all . No daily or weekly pages . Do n't need em . It 's really well made and contrary to other review not flimsy IMO . If I had to complain wish there were more color options- wish there were more note areas- wish it was a cooler format , like wider . Anyway , love it ! I had another Orange Circle product last year and loved it to but it was too big and too many pages . Then I found this option and it is Just Right . Bam .
5 #### My dog enjoys these . Sometimes I crumble a small amount on his food as a special treat .
5 #### We were using Zukes training treats , which are easier to use , but my puppy is more eager to please when Chicken Sizzlers are the reward .
4 #### I purchased this for a senior Australian Cattle Dog ( aka ACD aka blue heeler aka red heeler ) and used one container and part of a second before starting him on a better quality dry kibble that contained most of the ingredients . He was a rescue dog of unknown age , and already had considerable arthritis in his spine , so it would likely have helped him more if he 'd been getting it for a couple more years , but it certainly did n't hurt him , and I think did help some .
3 #### I truly do like the " at - a"glance " style planners , but this one just falls short of the mark for me . I 'd prefer a plastic cover instead of the coated cardstock . I also would like a bit more room to write in the spaces . While this is sufficient , it 's not high quality . The best feature to me is the band that hold it shut . They should ALL have this neat little feature !
5 #### The optical audio that came with my Astro A50s broke and I was left without audio on my Xbox One ! after a few minutes on Amazon this had been ordered and was on the way almost immediately ! This cable is cheap and works great !
5 #### My red heeler loves these treats ! I bought them originally because they 're free from corn , wheat and soy , no artificial colors and preservatives , and no by - product meal , and I 'll buy them again . They smell like bacon , look like bacon strips , but the dog 's not talking as to what they taste like . I also like that I can break up a strip into thirds then into smaller pieces instead of having her glomming down on one large strip and it 's then gone .
4 #### My pup loves these but honestly I expected these to be more like actual bacon . Instead they look and smell just like Beggin ' Strips . Ingredients are supposed to be better so I 'm hoping their claim is legitimate this time .
5 #### All my dogs love this and it is good for them .
5 #### My dog absolutely loved these treats . The second he caught a whiff of the smokey scent , he came running over and licked his lips . When he tried one , he immediately wanted more . The treats are soft and easy to break into smaller pieces . They have a rather strong smell , but this was a pro as my dog was excited about it . My dog can be a picky eater , but these are still his favorite treats .
5 #### My Miss Millie loves , loves loves this brand / flavor treat . And I love it because it is made in the USA - Free of fillers : Natural recipe is free from corn , wheat and soy , artificial colors and preservatives and chicken and poultry by - product meal . Win - Win .
5 #### My little terrier is very finicky about her kibble . I 've had her over two years and it 's been two years of her disappointment with my various ( expensive ) offerings . A complete different story with this dog food ! Every time I 'm about to fill her bowl she jumps off the ground in anticipation . Like high off the ground ! I reckon that deserves a review . She 's never been anywhere near this enthusiastic before .
5 #### The cats almost like them too much - they are begging for them constantly !
5 #### This planner is very thin , which is just what I wanted . Also , the cover is really nice material and higher quality overall than I 'd expected . I hope I can find this again next year because it 's perfect for what I need !
5 #### I just wish we could still get these ! Our dog is allergic to chicken so we ca n't change to the other varieties .
5 #### A favorite for our pups . Ca n't go wrong with blue buffalo .
5 #### I have tried several for my aged dog- this seems to work the best !
5 #### This Peacock is beautifully made and absolutely stunning . I bought it for a child , but I was tempted to keep it for myself !
5 #### Great colors and the little one we bought it for loves it she is crazy about peacocks and loves this one to .
5 #### I got these the other day for our dog . We have a pittie/ boxer mix , about 45 pounds . He loves his treats . I love that fact that the ingredients in these treats offer a pretty small list of items , and are better items than most treats out there . Pitties hav e alot of skin problems from allergies apparently , so when we get generic or cheap treats with bad items in them , he breaks out in rashes . I 'm happy to say that these pass the test and he 's just as happy today as yesterday and had no reaction . The fact that this is an add on item and came fairly cheap is that much better . When I opened the bag , I was happy with what I saw . These treats look great ( they look like little pieces of bacon ) for the dog , heck , even for a human , ha ha . Of course when he heard the bag , my dog came running . My dog does n't really drool at all , but after having him do a few tricks for me , he actually had a drop of saliva drop on my hand as he was waiting ever so patiently . In fact , he actually wanted it so bad that he stole a second treat from me before I could get him to do anything else . He loves these treats , and I love seeing my dog happy . I 'd highly recommend these , especially for the price ..
3 #### I buy Blue Buffalo dry dog food and training treats for my two dogs regularly and I was satisfied with this product . These treats smelled just like the cheaper brands , but are much healthier . I wish I could say they tasted the same , but I would have to leave that to my dogs : they ate them up . My littlest one would go nuts when I grabbed the bag off of the shelf . My only disappointment : there were n't that many strips inside .
3 #### I was looking for a different flavor than party mix . I figured the cats needed a change . However , not all of my cats like these flavors . So , back to party mix I go .
5 #### My chi just loves these . She prefers that I break them up into smaller pieces as she ca n't quite manage to eat them whole . Great treats and she is very picky . Very .
5 #### These new year 's cards are adorable . originally I thought the glue did n't hold , but the yellow strip on top has to be removed and then they hold tight . The company was kind enough to respond after I mentioned that in my first review . in fact , their products are all high quality .
4 #### My daughter " needed " a stuffed peacock for Xmas . How could I say no ? Had no idea I 'd actually be able to find one , nonetheless find one as nice and appealing as this one . She loves it
5 #### Great calendar with lots of space for appointments or notes . Each Month has a Tab so you can easily navigate to your month of choice . It also has an Elastic Separator ( for lack of better term ) that you can use for the current month so when you open it up it opens to the current month right away .
5 #### This product surpassed my expectations quite abit , I would highly recommend this item to all enthusiasts and tell them this is a VERY good dollar value and was delivered on time in the CHRISTmas season . Wow ! What a wonderful retail experience .
5 #### Give it several days and your cuticles WILL get better . I had some cuticles on my thumbs that were rough and uncomfortable . This product after about 5 days made them look and feel much better .
5 #### I LOVE this Gund Peacock ! It 's beautiful and very well - made . I ordered more than one , but the others arrived with spots of blue dye on the beak , so I sent them back and alerted the Seller(s ) . Examine yours very carefully for this defect when it arrives .
5 #### My 10 month old loves this dragon . It 's soft , squishy , and does n't shed . He 's a happy baby !
5 #### This is a nice 12 month planner from At - A - Glance which gives you monthly appointment reminders . I have always liked to be able to see the entire month instead of just a week at a time . My electronic calendar holds more information so I just use this as a easy reminder to carry with me . Most of us have smart phones that also track our appointments . If you like portable hard copy calendars , this is one of the best !
4 #### This is a pretty nice planner , however I wish it were more durable . If you are hard on a planner , this may be a bit too flimsy for you . I do like the feel of the front and back cover . It is a matte black with a soft texture that feel sort of leathery or rubbery . It looks modern and clean ( it 's looks are it 's best attribute for me ) . The months are tabbed and easy to turn to . It has a flat bungee cord closure . I think it 's " OK " , and three stars correspond to that .
4 #### First , The cover of this planner almost feels leather - like which I really like . It measures approximately 8 " by 11 " . There are index tabs for each month and plenty of room to jot down your appointments , birthdays , and anything else you may need to jot down . There 's an extra place that is like graft paper for side notes or whatever you 'd like to use it for . This planner is large but thin . If you wanted to , you could probably punch holes in it and stick it in a binder . I will probably end up putting this in a binder just because I think it would easily get bent up if it is n't in some type of protective case . It 's thinner than my monthly wall calendar . It would do well if you tend to carry a briefcase . Other than that , I do n't see this planner as one that can be carried around in your purse or backpack . .
5 #### This planner is perfect for us to keep track of when our bills are due and what dates payments have been scheduled for . Plenty of room in each box to actually write .
5 #### Cat pushes himself into bowl with treats before I even have them in the dish .
5 #### I just LOVE At - a - glance planners ! They 're so well made and durable , and the design is always so pretty , especially this one . It has a very chic , simple and elegant look . The cover is very nice , and it 's durable , and it feels like it 'll hold up extremely well through the coming year . The inside has everything you need , from your calendar , to notes and contacts and other basic information . It 's so easy to utilize and fashionably functional , I think if you 're looking for a good planner , you ca n't go wrong with this one , or any of the at - a - glance planner . I 've had several in the past , and I 'm ALWAYS happy with them . Plus , I think these make excellent gifts for the coming year ! Overall , I 'd highly recommend this product . I just love it , and I plan to purchase at - a - glance planners in the future for gifts and for myself . No complaints , and I 'm very happy with it !
3 #### This is n't a bad planner . It 's a good size , it has everything you need in a calendar and monthly planner . The problem is the cover . It 's made of some kind of rubber and when I took it out of the packaging , the smell was really strong . I admit that I 'm more sensitive to smells than most and that most people might not find the smell of it offensive . I also did n't love the feel of the outside . I do n't like the rubbery feel of it .
4 #### This is a great slim planner for 2016 . Unlike many other planners , this one is thin but still has the perfect layout to include everything you need . The monthly " at - a - glace " pages give you a great way to view your schedule over the short term to really avoid conflicts . And also included are standard time zone maps and holiday pages . The cover is thin black cardboard , but it is coated in something to make it slightly more durable and spill resistant . And it 's got a really functional band to both keep it closed or to use as a place holder . CONCLUSION I have tried several 2016 planners and this one is my favorite so far , even more so than several with fancy bindings . This one is the most compact and functional for a full page planner . So this product is definitely worthy of consideration .
5 #### This is a fantastic basic , streamlined month - at - a - time planner . We received this free to try from the Amazon Vine program and we use this for our family calendar . The boxes are perfectly sized to fit all the kids activities ( and ours ) in . The format is clean and crisp and makes it easy to focus on what the most important events for the month are . I have no complaints . This is a great product .
5 #### I like the healthy stuff in it , as far as taste , I do n't know , lol , ca n't go by my dog , he will eat anything if I add a little people food !
5 #### This is just what I need to get reorganized . I used to have a smaller , but thicker At A Glance Weekly Planner years ago and was much more organized , but since the digital calenders came on , I just have not done well with them ( not to mention that my iCal decides to erase my events completely ) ! I love how slim the planner is , but has lots of pages for contacts , notes , etc .
5 #### The At - A - Glance 2016 Weekly and Monthly Planner was just the thing I needed to keep track of doctor 's appointments , social dates and meetings of my local civics group . The planner has a full monthly calendar for each month spread over two pages , followed by spacious entry pages week by week ( with room for notes ) . The generous writing space is so large , the planner can double as a journal , or be used just for that purpose . The back of the book has space for contacts and events , plus a list of holidays and even a time zone map of the US . Altogether well planned and executed , I ordered more for friends whose lives are as busy as mine . Highly recommended .
4 #### Slim , light and to the point . It has a 2016 calendar with the ability to take notes daily as well as notes in the corner and in the back . Writing space is pretty large . It is decent and good for someone that needs to have access to a minimal amount of daily notes . If you need something more you will probably need a bigger notebook . It is less then 1/4 inch deep or 1/2 cm . My only issue was how it was mailed . It came rolled up .
4 #### Sometimes I feel like the only person who still uses a planner rather than some app on my phone to keep track of appointments , activities , and events . I work at home and use a planner to keep track of the tasks I need to do for each client on a daily basis . This planner works well for me . Each month is spread across two pages with enough room on each individual date to add more than one notation . The advantage to this is being able to see the entire month at once , a feature that helps me prioritize my work . The size of the spaces allows me to write in personal appointments , kids ' practices and game , and other reminders . Tabs along the side let you quickly turn to a specific month as needed . Additional features such as a 3 year reference , future planning pages , space to list contacts , room for notes , space to list events by month , and a list of dates when holidays fall through 2019 . The planner is quite thin in spite of these additions to the calendar . An elastic band holds the planner closed . The cover has a nice feel to it , very smooth and a little soft . While it does n't have the sturdiest construction , it does seem able to hold up to one year of use just fine .
3 #### This planner is as basic as it gets . The binding is kind of thin and I doubt it makes it through the year . The paper that contains the calender is not of the highest quality and I would expect " bleed through " if you are using a felt tip pen . At a glance is a perfect name for this for you will not be taking any heavy notes as the format of this planner really only holds enough room on each date for a few words . In a word , Meh .
3 #### The cover is nice and soft but the bungee cord that is used to keep the calendar closed also causes the pages to slightly curve :( Inside is a page with a 3 yr reference of montly calendars ( the past , present and future year ) . Each tabbed month has nice size daily squares on which to write appointments . There are a few too many holidays listed for me ( includes not only American holidays but also Canadian and Mexican ) . I do so wish the daily squares had lines . There are superfluous pages at the end ( future planning , contacts and notes ) as well as a list of holidays for the current year and the next three .
5 #### This is an excellent , no - nonsense planner for those who need to keep track of important occasions and dates ( some of them on the same day ) , with room to spare . It also includes important dates and holidays , eight pages for notes , and several for planning and other events . What I like best about this planner is that there is enough room to write several important occasions and/or appointments in each box due to one month taking up two pages , and each page is a generous 8.5 " X 11 " . The tabs and bungee cord make it easy to pick up where you left off , or go where you want to be . ACCO hits a home run with this informative , no - frills " At - A - Glance " 2016 monthly planner , for those who need lots of room to write . Last , but not least , is that the simple black " leatherette " look ( and feel ) , is always in style .
4 #### This is a nice , bound AT A GLANCE calendar . Unlike the more traditional brand calendars , this is far thinner and does n't use the wire bound binding . Thus , this is a softbound version , and is much thinner . As to planning , this is really meant for cursory appointments and the like . It is not meant for an extensive appointment calendar for each day from morning to night . Knowing that , for planning for cursory appointment details you could do far worse . This has the expected dates through Feb 2017 , and some planning areas and note taking areas . If this is something you use to jot down dates in a briefcase or similar , I would n't expect the binding to last and remain pristine , it is black , but I could see by the end of the year , it could get dog - eared and scuffed . If you understand the cursory nature , the nice - looking appearance and the ease of being able to take this anywhere , this is by all means really nice calendar that can become used and you wo n't care too much by the end of the year .
3 #### This At - a - Glance 2016 Monthly Planner is OK , but not great . The planner cover is a thin coated cardstock , and bends very easily . Will such a flimsy cover used on a daily basis , will the Planner make it through a year ? I 'm not so sure . Each month is done in an open 2 page format , and allows for a fair amount of space for each day , but these pages are also of a lesser quality paper , and if you bear down with an ink pen or write with a Sharpie , the writing is going to be seen on the next month 's page . The " Contact " area is very no - frills - simple lined boxes to write names and addresses . Overall , I 'm just not that impressed with this product . It 's not terrible , but it 's definitely not a high quality product .
4 #### This is pretty much your average month - at - a - glance planner , but it has the added benefit of a sleek , slim , and sturdy matte covering . I 'm also digging the closure band . A three - year calendar and holiday list are handy , as are the month thumb - tabs , and there are plenty of pages for notes and contacts . I 'm pleased with it .
4 #### This is handy if you need something that is light and can slip in the pocket of your laptop case . It 's a little thinner than I expected . It 's just a month - at - a - glance calendar with a few extras . Those extras include a place for notes in the back and also room for contacts . There is a small section called future planning which leaves room for a paragraph for each month . I do like the layout of the calendar pages . The boxes are nice and roomy and there is graph paper in the margins for writing some notes . I like the elastic that wraps around to keep it closed in my tote bag . The black matte cover does show smudges a lot . It 's a yardstick that feels like suede a little . I do wish that it would have been shipped in a cardboard mailer . It was in a padded manilla envelope and it got bent in shipping . This left the pages a little rippled , and being a perfectionist , I do n't like it . Of course , this is n't really the product 's fault , but the flimsiness of the covers lends itself to damage in shipping .
5 #### I buy this monthly planner annually for my elderly mom that likes to write her appointments down rather than put them on a computer or phone . The bungee cord has a good amount of tension that keeps the planner closed . The boxes for each of the 30/31 days are approximately 2x2 inches - which is a nice size for writing while giving the user the whole month to view on a centerfold ( two pages ) . All in all , very pleased with this planner .
5 #### These are better painted and a bit larger than I was expecting , which works greatly in their favor ! I ca n't wait to use these in my vacation photos in Hawaii ! ! =D
5 #### Great product . Fast shipping . Great value . My dog is not crazy about this new formula . Do n't know if it is the taste or smell . Wish they would go back to the old formula . Still works great . Thank you .
5 #### My cats love it and the company decided not to make it any more so was happy to find this
5 #### too bad it 's no longer available at a decent price .... I paid $ 50 and some change for the last bag ..... my dog really loves
4 #### I have an older dog and I was please to review the ingredients were just what I would put together to feed him .
5 #### I got this for my nephew . He adores the purple zombie and it is a " carry everywhere " toy . Shipping took awhile but that was to be expected .
4 #### Reading reviews , I 'm sure this functions fine . I purchased after reading on other sites , that this would be a good replacement for the Fluval Spec V pump , but it does n't fit in the pump 's slot , soooo .... I wound up replacing with a Fluval Spec pump , and just holding onto this as an emergency backup .
5 #### I love Jellycat stuffed animals . They 're all very well made and a great size for little arms . The material is super soft and the designs are awesome , I really love dragons so this one was a no - brainer ( for my daughter ) . His horn and spike tail are also very soft !
4 #### My dogs have been eating this mixed with their regular food for 3 weeks . They like it as much as any dry food I have offered and it is grain free . As these dogs are seniors I am cautious about what I feed their sensitive tummies . The high protein content has not been a problem . The food does have a funky smell that I find disagreeable ( -1 * ) but my daughter says it does not bother her .
3 #### For containing such high quality ingredients - I was disappointed that this lamb food also includes chicken . Often clients come to us with itchy dogs and we suggest that they try a different protein in the pet 's diet . Usually the pet is on either a beef or chicken diet and we suggest changing to something else . If a client made the attempt to switch to lamb and purchased this food , clearly it would not work since the proteins are mixed . Now if you have no allergy issues and for some reason need your dog on a high protein diet , then this would work . Neither of my dogs requires a high protein diet , and neither of them really enjoyed this food . I wo n't be purchasing this food for them unless for some reason we suddenly need a high protein diet , and there is n't a better alternative . I do think that at it 's current price point , you are spending a bit much for a lamb / chicken food .
5 #### I lost my original eyecup because the clip broke and it fell off the camera without me realizing it . Then I found this in Amazon and was surpised that the price was very reasonable ( except with shipping ) . It fits perfectly like the original and now I sometime forget that this one is a replacement .
5 #### High - protein and grain - free dog food that does n't contain artificial , chemical , or otherwise controversial ingredients . It 's a super high quality dog food . My dog went for it with gusto , though I know there are dog owners out there whose pets are a bit picky about food they 're unfamiliar with . My dog has literally never been hesitant to dive right into any food presented to her , and this was no exception . But I felt confident that she was getting a healthy meal here - we almost always serve grain - free as a rule ( and absolutely always corn- , soy- , and wheat - free foods ) . The only thing that was a personal hang up for me is the use of lamb . I do n't understand why anyone would choose lamb for their animal as a protein source over beef , chicken , or a fish protein source . Maybe if it was mutton I would n't feel bad about it , but I do n't use lamb ( or veal , for that matter ) in my own personal life and I do n't generally use it for my pet . But that 's not a knock on Nutro , I would just get a different flavor if I was getting their product again ( which I would n't hesitate to do ) . Yes , it 's pricey - but so is all high quality , grain - free dog food . Nutro is priced in line with competitors .
2 #### My parrot destroyed the original eyepiece that came with the camera ( at least she left the camera body and lens alone ! ) This eyepiece fits very loosely , and fell off twice while wearing my camera around my neck ( at least I noticed ) . Would definately not buy again .
4 #### Our dog had absolutely no issue digging right into this food . To be fair , she also eats out of the bathroom garbage pail , but I feel like she really liked this food . We 've had a few issues in the past with itchy skin or stomach issues when we 've used " cheap " brands from the supermarket . This bag was gone quickly and only it 's price may keep this from being the go - to choice . Our current compromise is a good quality item like this blended with a " medium priced " brand to have a good value / nutrition solution . She seems happy and has no ill - effects , so we 're all good !
4 #### This is a terrific dog food . My Shih Tzu loves it ! I like the fact that it is grain free and has plenty of protein . She must go for the Lamb flavor because this food is gone as soon as it hits the bowl . Nutro is a good company . I have used some of their other products . I think you can trust their products to be high quality . My little dog is very picky , so if she hates it , I end up throwing it out . She loves this brand . If you spoil your dog , this is a good brand for you . Our dog is like family , so I am extremely particular about what I feed her . I would highly recommend this dog food .
5 #### Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniels really enjoyed this dog food . This is quality dog food made with high quality ingredients . Recommended .
5 #### A good , healthy dry dog food . I like Nutro 's products and feel good about feeding them to our dog , their treats are also good . Our dog is fussy , but he likes anything Nutro I 've given him so far . I recommend it .
3 #### The second ingredient is chicken meal . Which would be ok they were more honest about that on packaging . This looks like it would be lamb without chicken , a must for some sensitive dogs . You only realize there is chicken in it if you look at the ingredients . And , since it is the second ingredient , one must deduce that there must be a significant amount of chicken meal .
5 #### The dogs favorite treat . When we have lunch he is ready for this treat .
5 #### Our dog loved this . To be honest , she is not a picky eater , so it is unusual when she does n't just dive in and eat . I like that the product is grain free and has more protein . She likes it because it tastes good . Win , win .
4 #### My dog is a picky eater and she seems to like this dog food . It has a milder smell and more pleasant to me that is not as pungent as her regular grain - free food from Natural Balance . The circular kibbles are small and of a nice size for my small dog to eat . The first two listed ingredients are lamb and chicken meal , followed by chickpeas and split peas , which appear to be the good source of the 32 % high protein content . Furthermore , I like that it has no grain , corn or wheat fillers , which do n't fill her up are just gon na make her poop more . I transitioned her into her new food over a couple of days by slowly and increasingly replacing her old kibbles with the new ones . She does n't seem to have a digestive problem with the new food . So far so good . This food claims to have a lower glycemic content but I have n't noticed anything different in my dog . So I 'm not sure how it works out benefit wise . All in all , this dog food seems like a quality product . I like that it 's grain free , wheat free and corn free , and contains a high protein content from meat and peas . It also smells good to me , and apparently to my dog too considering the way she gobbles it up . I would n't hesitate to buy it again .
4 #### The first ingredient in this dog food is lamb . ( Real lamb according to the package . ) This is not one of the limited ingredient foods . There are a lot of ingredients . The second ingredient is chicken meal and then chickpeas . Most of the ingredients are recognizable like alfalfa , potatoes , and sunflower oil . It has a lot of vitamins and that probably accounts for a lot of the ingredients . These are a kind of a small kibble . My dogs all weigh about 80 pounds , so it was slightly small for them but they did n't mind . Only one of the bowls was eaten right away , by our german shepherd . The other two were left for morning . Both of our border collies did not eat at their usual time . I did n't take this as a food protest though ; they probably just were n't hungry .
5 #### We love the Nutro High Protein and Grain Free dog food as we do not feed our girl anything that uses corn as well as trying to avoid wheat as much as possible . We do use dog foods with rice some of the time , but the recipe for this food uses chickpeas , which is a great alternative ! Isabelle loved the taste and had no issues with the food digestively as well . Nutro 's pet foods are a bit more expensive than many of the healthy alternatives , but we believe it is well worth the price .
5 #### My dog loved it and that 's a huge endorsement since he likes only homemade food .
4 #### Our very persnickety dog likes this food and ate it without prompting . Did not notice any other changes in her behavior , coat , etc . Am giving this four stars because the cost is very prohibitive , especially when I 'm unemployed . :(
3 #### Chewy seemed indifferent to this brand . He would sniff the bowl and then sort of pick at it but not really eat until he was really hungry , which of course meant instead of eating his food he would beg at the table for what we were eating instead . Nothing inherently wrong with the dog food insofar as ingredients . I like the fact that it is grain free and the rest of the ingredients are for the most part " normal " food items and not just strings of chemical compounds . He just did n't seem to be real interested in eating it . Maybe it just did n't smell tasty to him .
4 #### I am very pleased with this high protein dog food - and the dog likes it too ! Seriously , there are quite a few dog foods on the market now that have picked up on the fact that people are tired of feeding their dogs chicken feathers while the companies that make it pass those chicken feathers off as " protein " . Nutro has consistently been a reliable and trustworthy company . Way back in the 1980 's I worked part - time in a pet supply store and Nutro was the premiere dog food because they had a better product . While other dog food companies could truthfully boast that they were not putting " trash " in the dry dog food , Nutro was really making a difference . With the High Protein Grain Free Lamb dry food they 've apparently managed to hit the high mark as far as my dog is concerned . I 've been buying Nutro for years , but this food gets gobbled up quickly . I 'm sure part of it is that it is new - that always helps - but dogs are carnivores ( and omnivores more recently ) , so they really like meaty dog food . The price is quite reasonable for this food and I will be buying it for my dog .
5 #### Wow , I 'm glad this stuff worked out . I tried the other Nutro salmon stuff on my friend 's dog and he went into full - on Gandhi mode not even eating for days on end . When I put this stuff down , however , the little fluff ball ate it up like there was no tomorrow . Maybe it was the all protein , no grain aspect . Maybe it was the smaller kibble size , which is more appropriate for the smaller dog . Or maybe it was that it does n't taste like old fish . I do n't know and I 'm back in the dog 's good graces with this stuff .
4 #### My aged Yorkie eats Nutro 's Grain Free Lamb without problem . Since experiencing severe skin issues last year , I 've switched him to grain free products and his skin has cleared up . Nutro 's version does n't smell or look as appetizing to me as the product I 've been buying at PetSmart , but I 'm not the one eating it ! Since trying this product , there 's been no occurrance of skin issues , though my dog 's weight has crept up a bit and I 've had to cut back a bit on the amount . The ingredients seem to be sound nutirion . Nutro 's products are expensive , but if your dog has skin allergies , you may want to go grain free . It 's less expensive than vet bills !
5 #### Our dog suffers really bad allergies and while the source is not readily identifiable , we 've been doing our utmost in trying to give him some relief . One source has been a tea tree oil shampoo ( made for dogs ) which drastically has reduced his itching every time we give him a bath . We thought that perhaps his dog food might be another culprit . I was drawn to the fact that this was a grain free dog food and figured " what the heck . " He seems to like it just fine and although he still itches , I can report that it 's not as bad as it used to be ... he no longer itches to the point of breaking skin . Whether this is directly attributable to the dog food or not , I ca n't say with 100 % certainty , but I wo n't be returning to the regular dog food anytime soon as long as this keeps up .
4 #### My dogs had no problems with this food and appear to like it . I like that it is grain free and low glycemic . I also like that it has 32 % protein . I also like that the bag is easy to pour and resealable . Nutro dry dog foods tend to average 4 to 5 stars with Dog Food Advisor and I am impressed by that . What I am not so impressed with is the price . The current listed price for the 4 pound bag is $ 18.98 , which makes this dog food about $ 4.75 per pound . That is just too expensive for me with multiple dogs .
5 #### I got this food for my English Springer Spaniel . He always provides a litmus test for dog foods . He has severe food allergies and gets bad reactions to ( almost ) any food that is not grain - free . Even some grain - free choices have caused rashes and itching . So far he has done very well on this food . He also likes the taste and shows other signs of good health ( although it 's admittedly hard to tell much difference after one small bag ) . I always stop on over to DogFoodAdvisor and see what they have to say . This food scores pretty high , a rare 4.5 stars out of 5 , putting it up there with the most expensive grain - free foods ( obviously where it belongs ! ) . The main ingredient is lamb , followed by other high - protein ingredients . There are very few " bad " ingredients . The only real downside to this dog food is that it costs a lot . $ 67 for a mere 24 pounds puts it among the most expensive dog food I have ever fed to my dogs . But , if you have a small pooch to feed , if your dog has special health demands , or if for any other reason this food suits your dog best , it 's worth the price . This is high quality stuff .
5 #### According to the dogs who gobbled this down , it tastes mighty good . I am happy that it is also good for them . The price seems a little high . You have to decide if your dog is worth it .
5 #### My dog does n't get just dry kibble in her diet , so she did n't gobble this down the first time she was presented with it . However , she does eat it and she has n't turned away from it . She is a healthy little 11 pound terrier mix with lots of energy and no tummy issues , but I still want to feed her the best food I can possibly afford . I liked that I could pronounce the ingredients on the label , though it did seem a lot of the ingredients were plant - based instead of meat . It did n't seem to both my little girl , though . And she is known to eat her fair share of carrots and green beans with relish , so she seems to enjoy a somewhat varied diet . The Nutro line of pet food products seems to have a good reputation , and the product is made here in the United States . The only thing that would concern me about recommending this product to some one else is the price point . There are other products on the market that I feel are equal to this at half the price - even here at Amazon ! I would suggest pet owners weigh everything and make a decision that is right for them and their fur buddy .
5 #### My dog loves this food and it is so good for him . DOesn't have that bad of a smell . I have been putting a little of a couple other dog foods i m his bowl with this one and he always eats this one and leaves the other . He is a picky eater :}
4 #### A high protein , low glycemic food has a lot to offer a dog . This food is indeed high in protein , and offers some high quality protein sources . However , rather than grain , it has potatoes . It also has chickpeas and split peas , which they do point out . If you read the ingredients , you will see dried potatoes . I do n't like that they fail to mention this in the heading when they mention the peas . Grain free is great ; but there are much better options than regular potatoes . Sweet potato would be much better . Dr. Dodds new book Canine Nutrigenomics : The New Science of Feeding Your Dog for Optimum Health , offers great info on this topic , especially about the benefits of a low glycemic food . So , nutrition - wise , I think this food is good but not great . Two of my three dogs eat this readily . One is less impressed and will sometimes pass this food up .
5 #### Love these calendars ! Missed the boat this year purchasing it at Costco or Sam 's Club ( teach me to get sick at the end of a year ) ; so , I was very happy to see I could find it on Amazon . I hated paying more than I 'm used to , but it 's better than having my whole 2015 year with a calendar that has no function ( pockets , lines , stickers , etc ) and just pictures of cars , horses , cats , country singers , etc .
4 #### My husband teaches pre - school children with severe disabilities and needed something to carry his IPad and other miscellaneous items that he seems to lose on a daily basis in his current " man purse . " I purchased this backpack in hopes that it would take care of this dilemma . It is very well constructed , but he still needs to learn how to use the compartments more effectively . Hopefully , that will happen over a short period of time .
5 #### I have 3 cats . This is the only food that they will ALL eat without getting upset stomachs .
4 #### I like the packaging , scent , product works wonders . I recommend this product . It 's affordable . Smooth transaction , arrived on time .
4 #### I would like Boise papers better if their colors were not quite so bold ; it is a bit difficult to read print on some of them . The colors tend to be darker than what is shown on Amazon . But the paper is good enough quality and the price is right .
3 #### My dogs eat them off and on but they are very fussy so I have to give them other treats most of the time . I think for a dog that has not been spoiled , they would do well
4 #### Our sensitive stomached Lab mix has done well on these . I like the fact they are bone shaped , so I can shove in toys , yet soft enough that I can break them to only give him half as a treat .
5 #### When you order a plush toy from the Jellycat brand , you ALWAYS get what you pay for , so no price is unfair . I started collecting the bunnies a couple years ago when I came across them in the store . I thought they were the cutest things I 've seen in a while and it 's been a wrap ever since . Dylan is downright adorable . His " fur " is not the usual smooth fur but a mixed direction to create texture ( of scales , I imagine ) . It 's still the same amount of softness you 'd expect . His wings seem to be brushed cotton . The red is vibrant and actually very close to the picture . I want to say I 'm surprised but honestly , I 'm not . I only buy this brand of plush animals for a reason . No , I do n't know how a child would react because I purchase them for myself . :)
5 #### Perfect calendar for holding birthday cards and bills . Never miss an important date .
5 #### I have been buying the Avalanche " Note Nook " pocket calendar for myself and each member of my family for 4 - 5 Christmases now . We all love the pockets in the front of each month , for storing play tickets , birthday cards for months down the road , or as I use it , for keeping shipping records for my Ebay purchases and sales . There are so many different design themes that will appeal to anyone . I just wish Avalanche would bring back the zen Asian motif though .
5 #### Great for filleting large fish . That is what we bought it for .
3 #### cats did not like these , as promised in advertising ! Wasted money so I gave them to the local shelter !
5 #### I buy one of these each year for my elderly parents . It is easy to read , room to write appointments , and they love the pockets . The only problem is that there too many pretty calendars to choose from !
5 #### The product was exactly like it was advertised . I have used the calendars with envelopes ever since I can remember , and this is one of the prettiest , sturdiest calendars I 've ever had . What 's more , the shipping came immediately ! It was here for January 1 , although I ordered it late ! Good service for a good product ! The attached envelopes at the bottom of each month are handy for keeping notes to myself , doctor 's appointment cards , addresses or phone numbers -- whatever you need to keep handy and be more efficient .
5 #### Touchable softness , loveable features , and quality construction make the 13 inch Jellycat Dylan Dragon a charmer . This raspberry - red darling the color shown in the description is quite accurate gives Grandma one more reason to continue purchasing Jellycat stuffed animals for her little darlings to cuddle as their lovies . Jellycat Dylan Dragon has the ultra - soft fur that is a hallmark of Jellycat stuffed toys . It feels wonderful to the touch and makes these animals very cuddly . Jellycat Dylan Dragon features velvety , felt - like wings , spines and a tail - tip ; although these features are not actually velvet , they are not felt . His little black eyes peek out from underneath his fur . Jellycat is my favorite brand of stuffed toys . Each creature is carefully made , soft and cuddly , and very , very loveable . Jellycat Dylan Dragon is no exception 5 - stars from Grandma and her grandson !
5 #### my sister in law loved it . keep having more .
5 #### My husband has been making delicious donuts using these cutters . Like that they are stainless steel .
4 #### Pretty good , but the plastic window suckers do break if you pull too hard .
5 #### I make my own envelopes , and this is great to use to ship my products that I make and sell from my etsy store at http://www.etsy.com/shop/Aim4Beauty . I sell handmade belly rings , and steampunk Necklaces . I also even ship vintage watch parts and pocket watches in these envelopes I make from this nice heavy duty paper and I sell these stuff at http://www.etsy.com/shop/Aim4Goodies . Great to print on a normal printer too !
5 #### I love these calendars . I get one every year . And they are pretty too . Helps me stay organized .
5 #### I have to give my dog treats with no corn or wheat and treats without these ingredients can sometimes be hard to find . These soft treats are his absolute favorite and they are a good value on Amazon .
5 #### These are the BEST Calendars by far , The calendar is made from Top quality paper , the dual pockets are great for bills , school papers , medical appointment paperwork . I have used them for at least 5 years now . My favorite it the Butterfly Calendar
5 #### Product arrived timely and in good shape . Very good quality material . Would buy this maker 's items again .
5 #### My youngest wnated to ge ther sister a stuffed peacock ... I have no idea why . It 's cute , colorful and soft .
5 #### Excellent backpack . Never had one that was made this well .
5 #### I have a small dachshund who developed an allergy to chicken . This is one of the few treats I 've been able to find without any kind of poultry meal , poultry by - product etc . I used to be able to buy it locally , but now no one carries it . Was really glad to find it on amazon .
3 #### My dogs do not like these at all . They wo n't even try them . Never had that response before . So now I do n't know what to do with them !
5 #### Works well , makes the cuticles really soft and you only need very little . Will buy again !
5 #### Since starting this product 3 weeks ago , my extremely arthritic german shepherd / collie mutt has been able to resume her favorite pastimes of counter surfing and knocking the trashcan off the table so that she may snuffle around for snacks at her leisure . Also , the other day she jumped over a foot high fence around the garden - that has been able to keep her out because I 've never seen her jump in 5 years . Both of these activities are a foot above her head and require the use of her " bad " back legs . It 's been a year of trying to find a supplement her stomach can handle , with no incidences . Well , it 's back to padlocks and impenetrable safe boxes . Thanks Halo for helping my pound dog be herself again .
5 #### I use this brand often for work and love it .
5 #### Soooo cute & squishable ! Need one for home & one at sitter 's !
4 #### My cat is not all that excited about this , but she eats it sometimes , and it seems to be good for her .
4 #### The product I received is the black jar that is pictured . One reviewer mentioned she got a white jar instead . According to Halo 's website they have changed the formula and it is in a white jar . The ingredients on this page listed under , " important information " lists the ingredients of the new formula only . To read the ingredients of the black jar blow up those pictures . The only side effect I have noticed is my Maltese dog 's long moustache and beard turn yellow after eating this supplement sprinkled on his food . But everything else is all positive . My dog is 8 years old and it was getting more difficult to jump up on the sofa , he would get stiff a lot and have to stretch before moving and he did n't run as much and could n't walk very fast either . Well , that has all changed . He is not only jumps on the sofa , he can jump in the car again . And he is running fast again and his stiffness has disappeared . All of these improvements happened in just 3 weeks . I hope the new formula is just as good because this one is good as gold . Very cost effective since I only had to use 1/2 tsp / day !
5 #### I have purchased these four times . My puppy loves them and it keeps him from chewing on everything else in the house .
5 #### Works great . I 've used several versions of this same model motor for a fountain , but the cats drink out of it . After a while , the motor would get clogged up . This version has clear directions that tell you how to take it apart to clean it out .
5 #### I am a 42 - year old woman and yes ... I bought this for myself . I cuddle him sometimes while I sleep . If that 's wrong , I do n't wanna be right . I have named him Ben and he is awesome . He is VERY soft . And I love that he 's floppy -- the beanie things are all in his hands and feet and bottom . So he sits just like this picture . He is also very well made and has sturdy construction , for those of you thinking of purchasing him for a child .
5 #### My boys are 13 and 12 yrs old so this stuff is like a miracle worker . They run and play like young pups without the pain they would normally have with out the expensive vet meds .
5 #### This is my labs favorite treat . She is a stronger chewer , but these last surprisingly for a long time . I highly recommend these treats ...
5 #### Wonderful donut cutters . Very well made and they work beautifully .
5 #### What else can you say . The item arrived on time and as advertised . The dogs love them !
5 #### I like the no mess and the dogs love it , even my cat eats them . Like that it 's all natural too .
5 #### My poodles like them . I have ordered these several times so they are a hit in this house .
5 #### I 've purchased this pump several times for my outdoor fountains and they give you good height for bring a small pump . Will keep buying as needed .
5 #### My 3 - year old dog has been eating these since she was a puppy . She likes to unroll them , eat the meat first , then chew on the rawhide . These treats calm her right down when she starts acting crazy .... I have them on automatic re - order because we ca n't live without them !
5 #### My dog loves them and even though they 're made in China , appear to be of good quality or at least I 've never had a problem with them . But here again they are made in China , which always makes me a little nervous .
2 #### I was sent two cutters for doughnuts with holes . Both identical with same item number . Decided to keep .
5 #### The only food my Ragdolls will eat ...... at 10 years old their coats are gorgeous and silky smooth . My cats are healthy and happy . I can no longer find Eukanuba locally so thank goodness I can order it from Amazon .
5 #### It came within two days of ordering , very fast ! Was packaged well , looks exactly like the picture ! it 's soft , tail has a posable wire in it but also has an extremely soft material making up the tail . It sits up on it 's own and is perfect ! I had no ordering issues and would absolutely buy from this seller again . Thanks for sending me what i was hoping it would be , a perfect stuffed peacock . :)
5 #### My dogs love these treats . I have bought them many times and the quality is always consistent . I like the fact that Nylabone makes these as it is a trusted brand . I will continue to order these .
4 #### My dogs liked them , but I am looking for a chew that lasts longer . They were gone within 5 - 10 minutes
5 #### The flooring is hard on the dogs so when they changed the supplement I was giving them , I tried this and it is easy to use , and they are having no trouble with their feet and legs . The 7 lb poodle had luxateing patelals and had an operation on both back legs and is able to run again . Thanks for a good product .
5 #### What do I really need to say . We plugged it in and it worked . Guess that is all there is .
5 #### Both my dogs love these things . Whenever I give them these I 'm tempted to take a bite . they have that chewy cookie look . The packages are dated and the product is made in the US .
5 #### My Ragdolls seem to like it and it keeps their hairballs to a minimum , so I am happy . I will continue to purchase this product , perhaps in different flavors , but in this type and brand . My breeder recommends it , my veterinarian recommends it and so do I ! ! ! !
5 #### Adorable red dragon . Looks a little purple online but more of a deep red color . My 4 year old was super excited to receive this from the Easter Bunny .
5 #### My dogs love these biscuits . Ca n't get enough of them . Keeps their breath nice n teeth cleaner than even my brushing them . Great buy .
1 #### Made in CHINA CHINA CHINA . My dog threw up . This stuff is from China . You do n't want it for your dog long term health .
5 #### For such a hefty item to be shipped , amazon has an excellent price compared to local retail . This is a higher end product and my cat loves it . he has been eating it since a baby though so he does n't really know better . Love having it shipped to my doorstep .
5 #### This paper is great ! It is a good weight and the color is SUPER bright ! I will be ordering again .
5 #### I traveled with my 16 lb Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . She fit very well under the seat in front of me . She was asleep before we left the gate , and remained comfortable throughout the flight . The case is very easy to carry on shoulder or with handles looped over rolling bag ( travel partner 's carry - on ) . Very sturdy construction , I expect it to last for many happy trips !
5 #### The zipper works well . My kitty fits well in it . He is a big kitty . He is comfortable in the bag . When I am carrying the bag , it is comfortable .
5 #### I have a few of the Jellycat stuffed animals and continue to get them just because of how much my daughter loves them . They are soft , well made , and although on the bit expensive side complete worth it because they get a lot of use from the kiddo at bedtime , tea parties , and as " friends " during the day . I also have the elephant and sloth and she loves them all .
5 #### This is the 3rd Fujifilm memory card that I 've purchased from Amazon . They all work fine and have not had any problems . I expect this card to be trouble free also . Good price and free shipping if you want it .
5 #### Perfect for the Fluvla Spec V. With very few easily done modifications it fit perfectly in the overflow box . The flow is so much better and left more than enough room for my heater . There is of course some hum but wrapping the unit in foam deafens this considerably . No louder than a moderate sized skimmer for those concerned .
5 #### Used this for biscuits and cuts wonderful . Now I do n't have to use a glass . Biscuits came out of mold with no problems so doughnuts should do the same .
3 #### I bough five beef treats and five chicken treats . I was disappointed that all the beef treats had an expiration date("best by " ) of only 3 months away . The chicken treats had a " best by " date of eight months away . Amazon replaced the beef treats ... but unfortunately with the exact same " best by " date treats ; subsequently they credited me . My dog seemed to really like the chicken treats ... he was a little fickle with the beef treats . Admittedly my puppy ( 14 year old Lhaso ) is rather spoiled . I would probably buy the chicken treats if they were nice and fresh with a LONG expiration date . I am giving this purchase a middle of the road rating .
5 #### Miss Bluebird knows that sometimes you just ca n't make it when sending Christmas cards out and she says these are wonderful to have .
5 #### I took off the front and back covers with a little bit of trim work to fit inside my fluval spec V tank . Twice the flow as what came with the fluval . Love it !
5 #### Bought these for my dad . He made us all donuts . They seem to be good and sturdy . The donuts came out great .
5 #### I love this product . I keep it in my purchase and use it after every manicure and I rarely get hangnails . If I do n't use it after a manicure , I always get hangnails . Not sure if that 's because of the product , but I would have to think it is .
5 #### He loves them . Not much else to say , he 's thoroughly satisfied and so I am as well . My cat chewed into the bag though , I guess she smelled the chicken .
5 #### Very high quality at a very reasonable price . Heavy duty material with a very well thought out barrel protector for the muzzle . Good protection for mounted optics , heavy zippers and generous pocket .
5 #### I 'm a professional chef so I 'm a little choosy and snobbish about my knives . This knife is well balanced , has a good cimeter curve , stays sharp , is easy to sharpen , and has the lifetime warranty from Kershaw . I live in Portland , OR , and free sharpening from Kershaw is the reason why many of my cooking knives and my pocket knives are Kershaw , KAI , or Shun . The blade guard that comes with it is great too and fits the curve perfectly . This knife does a nice job when you are breaking down a big piece of meat . Its also good for chasing your mis - behaving employees around the kitchen with . ( Just kidding , I use my serrated knife for that ) .
5 #### This was a gift for my 5 - year old grandson . He has carried it with him for weeks . It 's very soft .
5 #### This is the only food I 've found that my cats will readily eat without becoming sick . All other brands I 've tried they either ignore or they vomit out shortly after eating . Unfortunately , neither Petsmart or Petco carry this brand of catfood , so I have to order it here .
5 #### My son loves this one . We read a book about Dragons before bed . He likes telling us about his Dragon . He likes the wings , his tail , the color . We like that it 's well made and soft . Good buy !
5 #### My cockapoo loves this beef treat ! It is healthy and is soft . I add half of one to his breakfast and dinner . He loves it ! Highly recommend . One word of advice .... I order the 5 pack of both the beef flavor and the chicken flavor . The expiration on the 5 packs of beef is in April . While I have until October regarding the Chicken flavor . So make sure before ordering in bulk that you will be able to use it up before expiration date .
5 #### I 've been looking for a chew / treat that will last my Welsh Terrier longer than 5 minutes and I came across these . I like that these are n't all rawhide and that there is a soft chicken flavored center , which my dog loves . These take him about 15 - 20 minutes to eat and he 's always very excited when I take 1 out of the bag .
5 #### Our dog lives these treats and is very happy with these since she is allergic to chicken . We love the treats
5 #### used this for my dog to travel on airplane . my dog loves it and sometimes just sleeps in it ( my biggest fear is that he would be scared of it and never go in it ) . fit perfectly under plane seat in United airplane .
4 #### I gave 4 stars because my dogs love these treats but they are made in China . I should have paid closer attention to the package and the missing American flag . But the dogs love them !
4 #### Even though this product is NOT the traditional rawhide chew and therefore does n't last long , I buy it because it contains prebiotics which eliminates the need for yogurt ( or other medications)mixed in dog food or treats ( per vet instructions)due to my dog being on frequent antibiotics for UTI 's . Great price with free shipping . This product sells for 24.95 at Petsmart when you can find it . The only problem I have with this product is the package seal - doesn't seal properly once this package is opened . Would like to see this product sell as save and subscribe to prevent monthly ordering .
5 #### My dog loves them - and that makes me happy . What else could a person ask for in a dog treat ?
5 #### Our dogs love these treats , and we do too as they have healthy ingredients . We purchase them as soon as the supply goes down .
5 #### My boy LOVES these ! I like to give him one as a before bedtime treat when we run through a few learning exercises . He is very focused , as he knows he will be getting one of these at the end our our lesson . This is one of the few treats I 've found that have this consistent enjoyment on his part . The price is very good , too , as these are considerably higher at Petsmart or Petco . Unfortunately the bacon flavored ones are $ 10 higher at the moment . I 'm hoping these stay the same low price !
5 #### Works just fine and the holes do come out . We had no problems using it . This has said it all .
5 #### great soft treat for my pup ... I do this as a save and subscribe , it works out great for me and my sweet pup !
5 #### Milkbone please keep making these treats , I can no longer find them in stores in our town . These are are one of the only treats I can feed my two yorkies that do n't contain Chicken products . Since we removed chicken from their diet completely they no longer have allergies , ear infections , and most importantly , no more vomiting in our carpet . Our vet said that after he recommended removing chicken from most of his patients diets , he 's actually lost revenue because so many of our pets are no longer sick as often .
5 #### excellent quality very good product and far less expensive than Staples and the quality is as good if not better than Staples
5 #### My standard poodle loves these and when I could no longer purchase them at my local Petsmart or in any other store in our area I turned to Amazon . I really do n't know what I will do when I can no longer find them- these are great because my dog can enjoy them without getting stomach problems . She loves them and we give her one whenever we go out to keep her busy and happy
5 #### My dog begs for these at night after she has her dinner ... they are hard to buy in the store so found them online
4 #### We like Eukanuba . We feed this brand to our dog and two cats . I normally buy the Sensitive Stomach instead of this bag but decided to try it because it was cheaper . My cat ended up barfing up hair balls so back to the Sensitive Stomach . Otherwise they ate this and never complained .
5 #### This was a great product and a great value . I would recommend these , as a dog lover . they were gobbled up
3 #### I recently purchased the " Allen Dakota Gear Fit Scoped Rifle Case 48 - inch Green Black " here on Amazon for $ 36 and this Plano 400 series for $ 35 . They are both comparable in quality . Pro 's of this Plano case include : - This Plano 400 has a rubber muzzle protector sewn on , that is very good . - The pockets are all sewn into the the case in a more logical manner . - The material is reinforced on the bottom . Short - coming : - The zipper does not seem as sturdy as the Allen rifle case . Both cases have average padding to protect protect your rifle . I returned both cases and ordered two others in the $ 50-$55 range . I 'm looking for better protection and quality without going to a hard case .
5 #### Got this to raise the flow level in my Fluval Spec 5 and it definitely does that ! The flow is fantastic !
5 #### My husband got me the one with the straw as a surprise one day to help me drink more water . It worked . I used it so much the paint wore off the outside . This will keep water cold all day even in a hot car . I could n't find anymore at Target , thank you Amazon ! !
5 #### Great little pump ! This is my third one but for other uses ... only had one quit and that was after 12 years !
4 #### great but this gets stuck in my pocket so often that s and its not really worth it four more words
5 #### Arrived on time and in good condition . Looks to be a good quality knife at a fraction of the cost of a forschner . I plan to use it for filleting salmon . I havn't gotten a chance to use it yet , so time will tell how well it holds up , but innitially I 'm impressed with the finish and quality .
5 #### I love these and in fact bought this waterbottle for the second time after my daughter dropped it so awkwardly that the top was broken . It is very pretty , however I with I could put this in the dishwasher without the beautiful design coming off after several washes , however , pretty much all thermoses do that . I would buy this again .
5 #### My little fat maltese did n't fit into his old carrier anymore , and we went to PETCO to shop around and being the dramatic dog he has always been , he went ballistic and hopped into this one at the store and would n't get out and he is very obedient to me . So since he was whining I as his loving pack leader ordered it for him for half the price from here , thank you so much . I love this bag , I can choose to keep him covered or if it 's cold I can block out the elements with ease and no one has a clue I 'm carrying a dog , perfect !
5 #### My cats have been on this food for 14 + years they love it and I do n't have to buy too expensive or too cheap . This is just right and keeps them healthy .
5 #### Purchasing meat in bulk and cutting it down requires a very sharp knife . This Kershaw cimeter knife does is perfectly . Slices through with ease . Nice safe blade cover as well .
4 #### It 's sturdy and comfortable for my little 16 lb . dog . He 's a size such that a smaller one seems to be too cramped for him , so this is very roomy for the guy . It 's not heavy , so I can easily carry him in there . I do have decent upper body strength , though . The material is sturdy , but that makes it bulky . I sometimes wish I would have purchased some more standard bag instead of the ultimate , but who knows .
5 #### I love this leash ! I have a 120 lb . rottie / shepard mix . He s a big , strong boy and he likes to explore while on our walks , so the length is really great . I feel very secure using this heavy duty leash . I have just ordered a new one , as the one i have is about 2 years old and the spring inside which rolls the tape back up has kind of loosened up and the first foot or so of tape dosent retract anymore . But i can not complain at all after using this for almost 2 years , almost daily . So its a great product , and i hear they are going to discontinue them . I hope not . This is the best leash i ve ever owned ! ! ! !
5 #### Great quality , thick padding . Fits a CZ 455 LUX with a large scope and rings permanently attached . Side pockets are large enough to hold magazines , paperwork , etc . Glad I decided to go with this over the 300 series . CZ 455 LUX has a 20.6 " barrel and 39 " overall length . This fits perfectly !
5 #### This is the second one of these I have bought . I take them to work with me . I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse and it will keep my drink cold for much of those 12 hours .
5 #### We took our cat on his first flight . He was n't too thrilled , even with his calming kitty treats . However , this carrier was perfect . It fit a little tight under the middle seat on a Southwest flight , had to squish the top and sides a little . However , this was n't too bad because the rest of the time my cat had a little extra room to stretch . The outside pocket was very practical , and the foldable flaps meant we could make sure he had enough ventilation . The strap is comfortable to carry , we did n't try the shoulder strap because of his comfort . Finally , having the option of dropping him in or through the side flap was great , specially for putting him back inside after security check .
5 #### I have been buying this treat for my two 10 yr old Westies . They just love them . When given to them , it takes them a long time to finish it .
4 #### My Siberian Husky is a VERY picky eater , but enjoys the Milk Bone Healthy Favorites Chewy Treats whether Beef or Chicken . I wish there were more in each package ! !
5 #### Usually Milk Bone products I do n't buy but these were on sale and I thought I would try these out . My two dogs just love these treats . For them , these are just as good or better than higher priced items . Because they are soft , I interchange them with harder treats so their teeth stay clean . This is a treat I would definitely buy for them again next time I catch a sale .
5 #### My dogs tend to spit out pills , so I just sprinkle this on top of their food . I have several " oldies " , but they 're still going strong . Have been feeding this product for years now .
5 #### Our kitty is 9yrs old , 11lbs and about 19 inches long from nape to base of tail . She , of course , knew this was a carrier , and of course was skeptical of it . We left it out a bit for to become accustomed to it and sniff it as much as she wanted . Yesterday when we took her to the vet , she of course did n't want to get into the bag , we had been trying to get her in with treats , which worked during the week when we were trying to get her accustomed . In the end we got her in ( not w/o a bit a crying from our MamiCat ) and started on our journey to the vet . it was raining lightly and the bag is really good for warmth , we could see her and she could see us with the " window Shades " and i believe she would have been comfortable if she was n't so nervous . We got this deal really great ( $ 50 ! ) and could n't believe the value . I would have paid almost 3x that much if I would have bought this at a brick and mortar store . Great buy
5 #### After being so satisfied with my green medium carrier , I purchased my 2nd Sherpa carrier in a large since one of my pup has grown so much . The red one that has flaps that can be kept down for privacy and to block the cold air on the airplane floor . If the pup wants or needs extra ventilation and visibility , the flaps can be rolled up and hooked to a ring on the handles . It comes with a large side pocket for carrying collapsable bowls , treats and toys . The material is of excellent quality . When I had both carriers , the green and red , on the floor last night my pups jumped from one to the other . They love them both , and I do , too .
3 #### This product states for dogs , although some people report that they safely give it to their cats in small doses . I should have done the research before ordering , but the questionable ingredient is alfalfa , apparently . If you google this , there is some concern about cats ingesting this , although may be just in large quantities . Probably safe , but I just do n't want to risk it with my older cat . So I 'll use this up on my dog , but not the most cost effective product for glucosamine / chondroitin for dogs . I 'll order cosequin for cats , which my vet recommended in the 1st place , but I had thought the powder form would be easier than opening the capsules ....
4 #### Heavy materials used throughout . Nice that all flaps can be opened for viewing in or out . I would buy again .
4 #### The Flexi Brand Leashes are nice looking , comfortable to hold and easy to control . Our dog can smoothly move in front of and around us and the leash extends and retracts smoothly . My hands are a little weak from injuries , and I found the Flexi Giant Leash ( 26 foot ) to be so heavy I could not comfortably use it . I use the Flexi Comfort 3 Leash ( Large , not XL ) which is shorter but considerably lighter . However , the large may not meet the needs of a very large dog or one that needs " distance " on the leash . This line of leashes ca n't be beaten ! Just be sure when you purchase the XL that you are aware it is very heavy and large .
5 #### ever since eukanuba has been making cat food it 's all i have fed to my kitties . from the kitten food on up i have had excellent results in terms of acceptance of the food to overall health of my cats . they utilize more of the food thus there is less waste , which is very noticable when you have 4 cats . their coats have a healthy shine and there is never a problem with dry skin . it 's a bit pricier than most cat foods but , to me , it 's well worth the extra money . i do mix it half and half with the hairball formula since three of the cats are strictly indoor cats .
5 #### i m so obsessed with this carrier . its so sturdy and has a one year warranty ! it fits my 18 pound dachshund and he absolutely loves it , along with my 7 pound dachshund . this carrier is high quality and i will be buying from the company again . more than happy with this product !
5 #### My big Maine Coon cat Sean Coonery loves this food ! If you want a healthy and happy cat , I highly recommend this food . My cat also made a video review and the video review can be found here [ ... ] . I order this food exclusively from Amazon because of the free shipping !
4 #### This is the second Sherpa bag I purchased , but the first Ultimate bag . My Cavalier King Charles Spaniel outgrew my first Classic carrier ( medium ) . My only complaint with this bag is that the retaining strap used by the seat belt is on the wrong side of the bag . When placed in the car with the strap to the rear , the air panel faces the back of the rear seat , not the front of the vehicle . In order to use this successfully in the car , the seat belt now has to strap over the front of the bag , so my dog can have visibility and better air flow . Sherpa products are great , but this one needs a moment of thought for a simple redesign .
4 #### This is a well - made , fairly easy to use flexi - leash . What I do n't like about all flexi - leashes is that it teaches the dog to pull ; therefore I wo n't be using it . However , for those of you who like flexi - leashes , this is a well - made , one - button leash for large dogs . The unit is kinda heavy , but has to be if you 're walking a 100 lb . dog . I never really got used to the button for stopping and holding the leash because I used it 3 times before putting it away . I have trained my dogs to walk without pulling and by the third time on the flexi - leash they were all starting to pull -- not good . I will go back to carrying a 20 ft . training lead for when they want to off - road ; it 's not nearly as heavy and I have an easier time on recall . The 4 stars rating is because it is well - made , retracts quickly but is heavy .
5 #### this was a great investment . i have two dachshunds and they sleep in this bag in my room . they love it . they have both learned how to get in it on their own and they run to my room every night and crawl in . i actually bought a second one to replace this one if it wears out . the bottom is also a leak proof nylon so if they have an accident it wo n't damage the carpet .
4 #### 4.5 stars if i could give half stars . I was looking for a large enough bag , with as much privacy possible . This bag has 2 side panels that you can roll up to allow more visibility , or keep down to allow minimal visibility . It 's roomy inside enough for my 17 - lb french bulldog puppy . The one complaint that i have about this bag is that the shoulder strap is not cushioned , and the rubber part should stay in the middle of the strap to provide minimal cushioning , but it slides off to the end and the strap easily slides , which creates a longer strap than i can handle ( ( I 'm only 5'2 " ) . after a few seconds , the lack of cushioning on the shoulder strap really creates a burn in my shoulder when I have to lug my puppy around .
5 #### ... but the product is tough and effective for dogboarding . I can only hope that over time it stays strong , not like our others ( cheapies ) that we retired from use , not only b / c of breaking , but the potential danger of breaking and injury that very well could result from such an accident .
5 #### These are great leashes for taking my big dogs for walks . Gives them plenty of room to explore . This is my second set . The first ones still worked , but one was starting to show signs of difficulty on retracting . I had the original leashes for about 5 years and used them almost every day for an hour or more each day .
5 #### We have a 100 pound Akita , and love the Flexi Gian Leash . This is the 3rd one we have purchased . The price was the best yet , and it arrived quickly . I would highly recommend this leash to anyone with a big or strong dog .
5 #### I have a lab / sheppard puppy who is not even a year old and all muscle . I bought this leash because it was recommended to me and you ca n't buy a heavy duty leash like this at your local pet store . I love it and it works great . I would recommend this leash to anyone with a large dog .
5 #### I had my aging cat on this for years . She had arthritis in her legs and I KNOW it worked because once , I ran out and she stiffened up immediately . As soon as I put her back on the product she was fine . They say this product is for dogs only but it is fine for cats too , they only had to make this labeling distinction recently , I do n't remember why . Make sure you do nt ' give them a dog - size dosage though ! just a little sprinkle a day .
5 #### I 've had this saw a month or so now and I am impressed with it . It cuts great and the blade they send with it is very good . I 'm remodeling our house doing pretty heavy construction and this saw has taken all I 've thrown at it . I wish the front grip had some rubber on it for better hand hold but I 'm adjusting .
5 #### This is a great and smooth cutting saw . I love it and probably wo n't ever need to buy another one . The LED light is useless as others have mentioned , but I did n't expect it to be anything special . Highly recommended over other similar priced saws .
5 #### I used to use American tools like Sears Craftsman and Skill Saws for 20 years . The problem is that the motors are not well made . They last well , but they start up with a jerk which is not a great thing , you have to wait a second and let them calm down to use them . If you are in the middle of a board or piece of plywood then you have to try to hold them so they do n't jerk a knoch out of the board . Also they are loud and noisy . I use a head set so the noise does not effect my thinking - consentration about what I am doing . This Makita has better winding on the motor and better brushes so is purrs to life and you do n't have to worry about it jerking in your hand . It is also quite . It feels balanced and is simple to cut with , of course the blade you use is everything . The aluminum housing is great too , it is a snap to line up a cut and keep it lined up through the board . But this saw or the Bosche would be my pick . I am a contractor in Florida .
4 #### One of the only toys that my giant - toothed Giant Schnauzer ca n't destroy in a week . Expensive but hey , if the dog 's happy ... UPdate 9/2012 Still have this thing . The rope disappeared but the ball is indestructible and the Schnauz still plays with it . 5 star , at least .
5 #### This is by far the best dog toy I have ever had . It is basically indestructible . i use it in the ocean . it rides high so the dogs can see it when it is wavy out . the rope eventually either gets chewed off or wears out and is broken in a tog of war , but it is easily replaced . My Flat coats and my aussie love it . I have recently bought a small one iwth a rope for my maltese ,
2 #### Purchased the Planet Dog Medium Orbee - Tuff Orbee with Rope , Blue / Green on August 21 , 2010 Rope came out of one side after 4 uses . No way to easily re - insert it . Ended up having to knot the rope in several places to continue using it . Would not recommend it .
4 #### This blue / green ball is not easily found once lost . I find the orange / white ball is much more easily spied in the grass or water . It also has the advantage that it glows in the dark which is important as we have shortening days & then lose daylight savings time . There is no compelling reason to prefer the blue / green coloring . The orbee ball is super ! ! The dogs love the squishy , chewy quality . The rope lets me throw it farther , however I do n't like the tied rope . I find any loops to be dangerous for active excited dogs . When I 1st get the orbee ball I get the knot outside the ball , undo it , put a metal washer on the rope . I then knot the end of the rope & push the knot in 1st , followed then by the washer . Now I cut the rope to the length I want & put a knot at the end so that I can play tug with my dog . There are admittedly better tugging balls - specifically the rope wing - a - ding ball by Booda .
2 #### Our lab puppy is a medium chewer ; compared to his puppy friends it takes him a relatively long time to finish bones and bully sticks . So I was surprised when minutes after being presented with the Planet Dog Orbee he was able to rip two continents off with little effort . Fortunately I was watching him and able to immediately fish these little green land masses out of his mouth ( the first to go was the small island ) . The toy is really cute , but just beware that for teething dogs ( or dogs who like to take things apart with their teeth ) it presents a very serious swallowing hazard .
4 #### Bought this for my large American Bulldog - she did n't like it at first and I was a bit disappointed because of the expense , but now its one of her favorite toys . She brings it to me when she wants to play fetch , loves to shake it like crazy with the rope and the irregular bouncing keeps her interest . We 've had it nearly a year and it has held up - she does n't chew her toys other than the rough play . I only rated it a four because it 's a bit expensive - but it has lasted longer than her other balls .... so worth it .
1 #### I was betrayed by a dog " expert " that swears by these that they 're the greatest thing ever . I suspect Planet Dog has in fact betrayed them by letting their quality control slip . The green parts are glued on , but not very well . I do n't leave any toys with my dog unsupervised but my puppy ripped Australia off and swallowed it in only a minute of play . Several of the other continents are peeling off and hanging my a thread . I felt like returning the ball with the green piece , poop and all .
4 #### Like other Planet Dog toys , this ball is good , but not the best . The knot in the rope comes undone quickly , so you will have to tie it again . Also , if you have a constant chewer / mouther on balls ( and do n't just use it for fetching ) , the outer shell of the ball can come apart off of the inner shell that has the continents on it . But that is usually after lots and lots of chewing . Other than that , my dogs LOVE these balls . They love the softness and the chewability .
5 #### when i pull out this toy .. my dog goes bonkers .. great for building drive .. or just for fun
5 #### I bought this for my pup , but it was to nice so I took it to work . My coworker and I use it for a dam it doll .
5 #### This stinking toy ! My dog loves this thing . This is the second one I have bought for her . She walked around making the first one go off so many times that it wore out and would make a sound anymore . She still loves both of her Mr. Bills ! I highly recommend this for someone who is n't a chewer and de - stuffer .
5 #### The dog loves her " BILL " , has not chewed & pulled it apart
5 #### Toy seems good , do not how long it will last
5 #### My dog loves this damn thing . He carries it everywhere . So A++ in my book .
1 #### I bought two one for my small dog Shiba Inu , and one for my big dog Labrador ; unfortunately , both of toys did n't last for more than 30 minutes ... Thus , I am not happy with the purchase . I like the design of this toy , it is cute but it is not for dogs .
2 #### I generally do n't expect toys to last very long with my girl . She s around 50 lbs and loves to pull and tug . This toy ripped the very first time we played . She has since emptied all of the stuffing out . It does have squeakers in each leg which was nice .
1 #### My pup loves her lamb chops but the quality is really poor . It broke in less than 2 minutes of her gently playing with it .
5 #### My goldens favorite . They carry them all the time .
5 #### My puppy loves these . There s squeakers in all the feet too .
5 #### My dog is in love with it , She beats him up , then cuddles him and grooms him . I expected it was going to be really small but it is n't although she is small dog the toy is so light weight and easy to bite she can carry it all over easily . A high quality swell made toy , so soft and cushy and he squeaks , This is an excellent deal .
5 #### If you watched Mr. Bill as a kid you have to get this for your dogs . We have three boxers and they still have not torn this toy apart . I had to laugh because in the movie Mr. Bill always comes back alive , so even as a toy he never dies . LOL
5 #### My Maltipoo is addicted to this toy . It 's almost a security thing . My pups have more toys than my kids did , yet he only cares about his Choppy ! Inexpensive , soft and cuddly . Problem is the other two know it and are out to destroy ! I buy them all of the time .
5 #### My furbaby loves his Easter Lambchop ! ! ! It 's great quality & has squeeker- in each paw & a big squeeker in it 's belly ! He is older & does n't use the squeeker- but loves to snuggle with it & guards it from his sister doggy who wants it so bad because of all of the sqeekers ! ! LOL ! ! I think I 'm going to have to buy her one of her own , LOL ! ! ! This would make a great gift for a child , or furbaby alike ! ! 5 Stars ! !
5 #### Do nt know why but this is our dogs absolute favorite toy . We are on our third one just because he plays with it so much . Love this brand as well - holds up when others do nt
5 #### Great for little puppies , but 9 month old lab destroys it now :(
5 #### not for pups that want to eat every ear or tongue , but it 's so sweet !
5 #### The title can br a pro or a con depending on what you want . this thing has like squeakies in every paw and in the body and just everywhere . i love it because its hilarious and my dog loves the sound . i also love it as a revenge toy for friends dogs , so that they can hear squeaks all day and night . like buying your friends kid a drum set for christmas
5 #### My pug absolutely loves Lambchop ! I had to buy a half - dozen of these because he will rip one apart in just a few months . This is not an indication of the construction but the fact my dog is hard on his toys . Comes with five squeakers so there is always one that continues to work . A nice remembrance of Shari Lewis , too .
5 #### We have had Lambchop for a year now , and she is still alive ! ! Usually Scoutie rips up his victims into empty soul less pelts . He , however- loves this Lambchop and has spared her soul . It is as big as he is , yet he manages to drag her upstairs every night for bed .
4 #### Fun toy , but for my large Weimie , the toy has a life expectancy of about 2 days !
5 #### Oh my gosh how cute ! We have had the best time with the dog - she LOVES it !
5 #### Bought this to go with Gumby . My chihuahuas love it and take almost a disturbing amount of pleasure in making him say , Oh no ! I accidentally stepped on it and broke the noise box so I will be ordering again . Too good .
5 #### Easily destroyed , got ta monitor while playing . But he loves it !
1 #### I found this toy at another store but I wanted to leave a review on Amazon . I actually bought three ( for my dog and two grand dogs)of these because I thought they were so cute . I loved watching SNL in the early years . All was well until my dog destroyed it last night ! I only found 3 batteries , which I m glad other reviewers confirmed that is all of them . However , it did also have some plastic coated copper wire and a rather large magnet inside . Hopefully my dog did n't swallow anything that may hurt him . If you have this toy or another one with a recorded sound , and your dog is able to bite through the plastic box inside of it .... please go ahead and cut it out now . The picture shows what I have found so far . If the internal box was indestructible , I would have given this guy 5 stars .
5 #### This toy is the best - for my cat . He is a very lively 7 month old kitten and out of all the plush toys I have gotten , this one is his favorite . The size is great for him to drag around by the neck like he is a lion with a fresh kill . He will groom it all lovingly , then roll around biting and kicking it with his back legs . He really seems to like the texture of the fur . He has managed to get one ear off , but it is standing up well otherwise . If he starts biting us with rough play , we just redirect him to this toy , and it is training him not to chew on us . TIP : get a blue one , ( available at that big box store that starts with a W ) it is the color cats and dogs can see best . Every other color looks very similar to each other to them . We got a regular white one , but I thought that was interesting .
1 #### This item was not seamed properly at the leg and it was not out of the package 10 min before the seam let out . I bought this same item from my local store around the corner when they first came out and they lasted my boys through their puppy stage about 8 months .... this " new " one ... has n't even be dog split on an it is falling apart I know as I took the two toy out and sat with the boys to watch them enjoy the new item . Disappointing .
5 #### My completely toothless dog LOVES this toy so much we bought one for him to keep at my daughters house . Despite him having no teeth he can really hang on to this toy . He has been using it daily for about three months now . Not sure how it would hold up if he had teeth but it meets his needs and has keep intact with squeakers working . It makes noise even when he shakes it . Plan on buying more in the future .
4 #### Of all the toys I 've got for my mutt over the last few years , she loves these the most . The build quality is average , my dog has tore them up in a few hours , or lasted months before she finally tears them up .
5 #### Bought several of these . Hands down , my dog 's favorite toy . It 's very soft and has 5 squeakers in it . The face and back feet are made of yarn , and the rest is fleecy . Be careful to supervise your dog so he or she does not eat the yarn .
5 #### MultiPet Lamb Chop Plush Dog Toy : I bought these as backup for one that was a gift and is getting pretty grubby and torn . My whippet mix loves the squeaky feet and torso and throws it around , chews on it and asks me to play tug of war with it ( not recommended , but ... ) . It comforted her through a move , and she still enjoys it . I wish it was washable and may try washing the original one , which I 've already mended a few times . It lasted five months and probably would go longer , having lost only ONE squeaky . That 's really good for a squeaky toy .
3 #### My dog is small , but hard on toys . He chewed right through this right away ,
3 #### I have an australian shepherd and she can chew through anything . i had moderate hopes for this toy , but she chewed the face off within about 20 minutes on Christmas morning ... Its more her fault than the seller , but this is a moderate chewer 's toy . Definitely in the retriever / soft mouth realm , and not exploratory chewers .
5 #### My dog absolutely LOVES this toy ! ! ! I 'll have to get another when this one wears out .
5 #### I 've bought these several times over the years because my dogs just love them
5 #### We have 3 of these , the dogs love it , tug a war , toss , sleeps with it . Easily washed and ready to go again . The squeaky inside lasts along time and is a favorite of both of our dogs . High quality seams and is carried around by our pit bull all day .
5 #### Dogs love this toy . It lasts a surprisingly long time in our house . This is one of my dog 's favorite toys . Mr Bill is too cute .
5 #### Is there anything cuter than a Mr. Bill plush toy ? We gave this as a gift , allegedly for the recipient 's kitty , but we know he 'll keep it for himself . It 's just adorable , wonderful for anyone who has a Mr. Bill affection .
5 #### This is the second Lambchop toy I 've bought for my Maltese . She destroyed her first one . ( Not that it is flimsy ; she just played with it so much that she killed it . ) Gave her this for Christmas and she was running around with it before the paper was all the way off . I do n't know what it is about this thing that she likes so much ... Its feet have little squeakers and there 's one in its main body as well . The squeak is n't obnoxiously loud , as some toys are . ( I think the really loud squeaky toys scare her . ) It 's almost as big as she is ... maybe she sees it as another puppy . Who knows . It 's very soft and squishy , which I also think she prefers over some more " durable " ( like Kong brand ) toys .
4 #### I have a 3 year old Maltipoo . After 2 hours he had chewed off the belt buckle , the red circle " mouth " , and the right hand . I was hoping this toy was more durable .
5 #### My German Shepherd adores this toy , which we call " Lamby " . It is humorous to see my huge dog snuggle with this fluffy toy animal .
5 #### The puppers love these soft , cuddly squeaky toys . Will definitely buy again .
5 #### Have had this toy for over a year and my dog still loves it . Its her favorite snuggle toy and she s not an aggressive chewer so it is still in great shape ! One of the eyelashes is sewn on crooked but my dog did n't seem to notice ;)
5 #### I got Mr. Bill for my dogs for Christmas because he was cheap and I just like giving my dogs presents to open on Christmas because they love it so much . To my surprise both my black labs like Mr. Bill more than the two other expensive quality toys I got them . Mr. Bill was torn fairly quickly but I still let them play with him when I m watching them and even though the quality is n't that good I d much buy them a cheap toy that they play with and tear up than an expensive durable toy that never gets touched so I gave 5 stars based solely on how much my dogs liked him .
4 #### My extreme chewer loves this toy . he could easily destroy it if I did n't watch closely .
1 #### Not a dog toy . He chewed it up in minutes .
5 #### I do n't know why my dog loves this so much ... but he does ! Nothing cuter than a 70 # hound snugglung with his Lambchop !
5 #### Oh , no , Mr. Bill ! My dog loves trying to eat his face off . :-)
5 #### Christmas present for the dogs . Great size and looks like lots of fun for them
5 #### This toy is hilarious , and my dog loves him . It 's durable and constructed well too . We could be in another room and hearing " Oohhh Noooo ! " randomly has us cracking up :D Would definitely re - buy and gift this !
5 #### My pups favorite toy ! She loves her little lamb . Have purchased many , but the price is worth it .
5 #### So happy I bought Mr Bill he s so cute and nicely made , he says Oh Noooooo ! ! ! I loved Mr Bill back n the day , I know its for my Doggie but I do n't think I want to give him up lol but I will and I 'll have fun playing with him
1 #### I gave this toy very low stars because this has a plastic box inside with springs and batteries that my dog destroyed . Good thing she spits everything out but she could 've gotten hurt or cut with the hard plastic inside this toy . I did n't realize this until I saw a bunch of broken plastic pieces and metal springs and multiple " watch like " batteries all over my floor . This could be potentially dangerous if you have an aggressive chewer like my Pitty . Please , if you have a super aggressive chewer that likes to destroy stuffed toys , PLEASE do not get this toy ! I buy almost all my dog toys on Amazon and this one I was very disappointed with .
1 #### Was a big order but this item was not included
3 #### I would only get this for a dog that is n't an aggressive chewer . My dog had the voice box and batteries out within 10 minutes of playing with it . Too bad , because it is really cute and the " ooooh , nooo " was really funny . I 'll have to sew up Mr. Bill , so maybe I can insert a squeaker in him instead of the battery operated voice device .
5 #### Our boxer is obsessed with this toy . He carried it around and chews on its feet . It is holding up nicely and does n't have any holes . A super win !
4 #### These large Lambchop 's are ADORABLE ! ! The quality is so so at best . The price is right on for the lack of quality .
5 #### My dog loves this toy . It is his favorite and we repeat buy it since he likes to tear up his toys . It is soft and has different textures along with two squeakers . If you are looking for an indestructible toy , do n't get this . It is strong , but fairly easy to destroy . However , my dog can hang on to one for several months before it needs to be thrown away . For $ 4 , that 's a bargain toy .
5 #### My two dogs love this sheep dall . Poodle mix and shiztu .
3 #### Definitely not the best quality Lambchop . I have purchased many , because they are my pups favorite toy , but she demolished this one in a matter of hours .
5 #### This thing has a squeaker in each foot and a bigger one in its belly ! For $ 4.09 ! Such a good deal ! I ordered an extra one just in case anything happens to it and they stop selling this little lamb ! My vizsla l o v e s him .
5 #### Purchased for gifts and glad I got one for my own dog ! High quality .
2 #### I was so excited upon receiving Mr. Bill due to the reviews I read , but the Mr. Bill I received does not have a nose :( Did they not see it before they mailed it to me ?
5 #### Multipet meaning more than one dog or dogs and cats ... I know my little dog loves it and would n't share . It 's larger than his old one because I did n't read the description well enough but he still loves it and carries it around , squeaking it .
4 #### Bought this for my dog , too much stuffing but my sister took it for herself ! She loved it .
4 #### My dog loves the toy . Wish it were better made , I have to sew it up quite often
5 #### Great lambchop dog toy . Several speakers . My dog 's favorite toy . Loves to chase it and shake it . Squeaks it himself . Great quality ! Thank you !
5 #### A good snuggly toy for a non aggressive chewer
5 #### I love it ! My dog loves it ! Highly recommend . " Oh , no ..... "
5 #### My Chihuahua and pit / lab love it . The lambs paws also squeak . Great toy for breeda big and small . On strong and sturdy it 's in the middle
5 #### This is going to date me but here goes anyway . This little guy reminds me back in the day of a show that had this little guy on it and his name was Lamb Chop . My dog loves him and so do I.
5 #### Out of nearly 50 toys my dog has this is her favorite . We call her " Lamby " . She knows her name and will run to get her on command . Every day after she eats and goes outside for her morning duty she runs into the house and grabs " Lamby " for an hour of fun and squeaking noise . We have to replace " Lamby " about every 3 months or so as eventually this toy gets tears and the innards are removed . Our next door neighbors Yorkipoo loves to come over and this is the first toy she pulls out of the toy box as well . Hope Multipet Lambchops is always around !
3 #### I love the original Mr. Bill from Saturday night live . This item is spot on . My lab / blue tick hound destroyed it in 3 hours . May be good for a small dog , but that 's about it . Oh Noooooooo ! ! ! ! ! ! !
2 #### I have a mixed review about this product . My dog LOVED it , I ve never seen him get this excited about a toy . Sadly , the toy did n't last more then 5 mins . We gave it to him and within 5 minutes the top of the lamb ( where the squeaker is ) was already ripped open and he got stuffing out . Even though he loved it the whole 5 mins he had it , I will not be repurching because of the stuffing issue .
5 #### This was the first gift I gave to my dog at his birthday party to open . He was so enthralled by this Lamb Chops plush toy that he did n't even want to open his treats . While I admit that the birthday party was partially to indulge myself ( he was wearing a shirt and bow tie , I made him a homemade cake of his favorite food items , and wrapped all his presents to see him tear into them ... Im so embarrassed writing that ) , the Lamb Chops toy was absolutely for me . As a child I loved Lamb Chops and I thought my pup would like her too . Since opening Lamb Chops , he sleeps on top of her , walks around with her , and genuinely likes her ( maybe a little too much , since he s been found in questionable situations with her ) . He s not the type of dog to become clingy with any toy , he could really care less about any toy he has , but I think I found the one . As I type this he is grooming Lamb Chops in such a loving way that his eyes are closed as he licks her fur .... he is weird
5 #### My dog loves Lambchop so much that I had to order another one .
3 #### Very cute but the paws and head are an easy target for a rambunctious puppy , 7 months at the time ) . My Mia LOVES it . However , within the first 24 hours of giving her each one ( 2 pack ) , we had to take out all the stuffing and squeakers ) . Poor Lambchop :( Mia just drags around her remains ;) lol Ill probably buy it again once Mia is two or three years old and wo n't destroy it . It really is that cute . I may even get the larger one . Mia is a large Toy Poodle ( 8.5 lbs ) . To Manufacture : The chenille like fabric is too thin for any kind of bite . Maybe a tough felt or something would allow for puppy use .
5 #### This is my dogs favorite toy ... He 's a Staffordshire Terrier and he just has to have this toy in his mouth if he 's away or he 'll drop it by my pillow to sleep with before bed ... He does n't destroy them , he just loves them . It 's actually time to order more !
4 #### I have been ordering these for my Cane Corso since he was a baby . He 's almost 6 now and has never once destroyed a Mr Bill . He carries , cuddles and loves them like a best friend . They do wear out from his slobber though . He also uses them to talk as well . If my husband and I kiss or hug he always grabs his Mr Bill and squeezes it to say OH NO ! ! ! It 's the funniest thing . Sadly though , the last 2 we 've opened for him have been duds . No talking . He still loves his bud Bill but gets upset when he wo n't talk . I will continue to order and hope that whoever fills orders does check to make sure they works
5 #### This is adorable and well made - although I have only had it for a day . Definitely a bargain and my dog loves it !
5 #### This is one of our Rottie pups fav toys ! He 's gentle on his " babies " . Not recommended for strong chewers . Cute toy !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R1NCQ87Y511WDD " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / C1omw6uV8eS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1FvNvTBHeS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Perfect size for a little dog . Lambchop arrived quickly ( thanks to Amazon of course ) . Good quality product . Recommended .
5 #### Delightful design and a great value . I just keep buying them and buying them for my squeaker - seeking , de - fluffing pup . There are multiple squeakers : body and feet .
5 #### My pomapoo puppy loves it , so I love it !
1 #### Not what I expected . I bought all 3 . Mr Bill does n't work . Lambchop is barely ok and the sock monkey is horrendous . It does n't look right at all .
5 #### My dog eats multi pets in hours . Loves them too much . But Mr bill is awesome . Over a month of being carried around and chewed
5 #### I gave these to my family and friends for Xmas .. They were overwhelmed with joy and refused to stop chewing on these cuties , even at dinner . Wonderful tid - bits and not fattening .
4 #### I first bought the tiny Lambchop in advance of getting a Maltese puppy . My two older Maltese were enchanted by it so I bought them each the larger Lambchops . When I got my 1.5 pound , 12 week old puppy , she proceeded to disembowel the small Lambchop . I was able to restuff it and sew it up with stronger thread . I found that the puppy preferred the larger Lambchop which was bigger than she was . She dragged it around , slept with it and treated it as a littermate . The one thing that all three Maltese had in common is that they loved this toy . However , I have to wonder who designed this . The face with the bushy eyebrows may be cute for a childs toy but for a dog , it is an invitation to chew . Eventually , that chewing leads to a major hole in the face :( I decided that since they love Lambchop so much , I would try to give it a face transplant . I sewed a piece of chamois cloth over the face and used permanent markers for the facial features . It may not be as cute , but it does nt tempt the dogs to rearrange the features either . I m giving the toy 4 stars strictly because my girls love it so much but be aware that it has a fragile face which is a tempting chewing target .
3 #### Dog loves to rip these apart . Not well made , but that 's all the fun for my little guy .
5 #### My dogo loved her wammy . Wammy was short lived as dogo tore her stuffing out . Please do n't let dog use unsupervised as this toy contains stuffing .
5 #### My dog loves this toy ! He manages to tear it up fast which is fine . I actually stock up and give him one in place of a treat sometimes .
2 #### I did n't realize I was getting the big lambchop . Was afraid it was too big for my 38 lb terrier mix as she loves and is used to the small ones . It is big for her to carry around but not so big that she chewed off the eyelash , getting it wrapped around a tooth within the first 10 minutes . We were able to cut most of it off but not all . First five minutes the squeaker would n't work ( there are four)The pictures show after 15 minutes . Found the small piece in her mouth . Could have swallowed and choked on it . Will give it to her only when someone is with her . Still , she loves it ! Wo n't buy it again though .
5 #### I 've bought a couple of these now . They are cheap enough that when the dog destroys them it is n't a huge deal
5 #### This is my second time purchasing this toy but the first time online . It was just like the previous toy no difference . My dog loves this toy and it cracks me up every time . Does n't sound like it 's saying " Oh noooo " but your dog will get a kick out of it .
3 #### My 4 month old puppy destroyed this within two days of having it . Granted they never claimed it to be in - destructive , so no biggie . It was cute while we had it !
2 #### My 15 pound dog loved this toy .... but , within minutes the face and rear feet were running and picked being caught on her teeth or toenails . The sock material is extremely thin . I repaired it multiple times but finally gave up . A replacement was sent but I had the same results . My dogs toys usually last years as she is not rough on them . It would be great if the face and rear feet were the same material as the front feet or even a heavy sock material . I used soft material and covered the rear feet . I have n't done face yet .
2 #### I have a power chewer puppy and he destroyed this toy within 2 minutes of having it . That 's very disappointing . I realize he 's more rough than most pups but toys that are this delicate should not be marketed as dog toys . It 's unsafe for the puppy . Very disappointed , returned .
5 #### I love this toy because my last dog did . It screams the classic " Oh nooooooo " . I buy it as a gift now .
1 #### I wish I could give this zero stars . The sock monkey was so adorable but the worst quality I 've ever seen . It literally fell apart right out of the package . So sad about this
2 #### Bummer ...... He is not saying " oh noooo" .......... something wrong with it . Makes a little noise but definitely not saying anything that resembles " oh nooo " . Sometimes it wo n't say anything at all . Obviouslly defective .
1 #### My 10 month old puppy had a " Lambsy " since we got him and he loved it to death . It survived thru teething and constant shaking . That was his favorite toy until it got lost . He actually mourned the toys loss . We Saw this and thought it would be of the same quality . So I ordered the large and the small version . I was wrong . NOT bad quality ... HAS NO QUALITY ! The large did n't even last 5 minutes . The small lasted 2 days . My dog does n't tear them up . He licks , squeaks and shakes the toy . The large " blew up"with 4 shakes . The small lasted 2 days . TERRIBLE toy and a complete waste of money .
5 #### These are my Corgi 's favorite stuffed pet ! She has chewed a few holes in them , but they are easy to sew and easily machine washable ( air dry ) . I have one for each floor and an extra for when one of those has just been worn within an inch of its life .
5 #### I bought this Mr. Bill as a ' side ' Father 's Day present for my 67 - year - old Dad this year , in honor of the many years we laughed at Mr. Bill on SNL when I was growing up . ( He loved it . ) It seemed to be really well - made , and while it was n't entirely easy to trigger , his voice sounded fairly accurate . That said , we quickly learned that trying to amuse my 1 - year - old niece by having Mr. Bill dance and yell out " oh noooooo ! ! ! " caused her to run away screaming in terror ... which was itself bizarrely funny .
5 #### I am a pet sitter and my dogs love to play with Lambchop ! I like that is was a fair price , too .
4 #### My pup looooves her Lambchop . It is in her top three toys . That said , as with most dog toys , I anticipate a limited life . I deducted one star as , after two weeks , one of the squeakers is already broken ( which , to be frank , I think is fine from my perspective but my pup probably would disagree ) . She 's a little girl ( 7lbs ) so it usually takes longer for a toy to breakdown as she 's pretty easy on them . But she still loves it , it was a good value and I 'm fine with one less squeaky thing around the house .
5 #### My pitbull loves Lambchop ... it never lasts long . She loves the multiple squeakers . Does n't last long but it 's a fave !
3 #### I wish my 9 month old miniature poodle had not loved this as much as he did . He had chewed one foot off within five minutes and stuffing was beginning the journey down his gullet . We all loved the Oh Noooooo voice but if your dog is still a destroyer , go with one of the stuffing - less toys .
5 #### I have several lamb chops because my old dog will only play them . My younger dog has plenty of other toys but for games I have to grab a lamb chop or Piper wo n't play keep away .
5 #### My dog is a chewer . She chews and chews and chews . Normally , she destroys plushies , so we tell people NOT to buy them . My mother decided to anyway . It was a huge surprise to see that she refuses to destroy her lamby . She likes to hold it in the middle and squeak it while we squeak the four feet . A huge squeaking match always ensues . She will not destroy this thing and brings it to bed with her every single night . I guess mom knows best !
4 #### my dogs love Lambchop but they have found it 's weakness . The seam along the back breaks easily and they love to pull the stuffing out . I have repaired several and I keep buying them because the dogs will play tug of war and fetch with Lambchop .
1 #### Although this toy is adorable and soft as can be , my Weimaraner mix destroyed it within 10 minutes after i received it from amazon . I wish the stitching was a little better because it has the potential to be a great toy .
3 #### If you have an active cheese they will pull at face making holes then gets to the stuffing . I wish face was made differently
5 #### Fun dog toy . At first our terrier / poodle / beagle mix Toto was afraid of Mr Bill when it spoke " Oh No ! " but after about a week he 's become his favorite toy :) So far no damage , so we 're quite pleased ! Highly recommend :)
2 #### My border collie had for about 5 minutes before she chewed through 2 of the feet that had a wool like covering and started to pull out the stuffing .
1 #### Our 7 month old Dane had it shredded within minutes !
1 #### This is a very large toy but priced like the smaller version in stores . It tore apart badly unlike the small one as well .
5 #### I brought lambchop for Mia to sleep with and not for her to tear apart . Normally any plushie is torn to bits . I 'm happy to announce that lambchop is safe
5 #### We 've had Curly , underdog , and mr bill , mr bill is holding up well . After 3 months , still expressing " oooh noooo "
5 #### I gave in and got another Lambie . This one for " Little Bit " I am using this to go under my neck to support with head on pillow . Of all the weird shaped things I got this works best . Only one problem my dog keeps stealing it to play with ! . Very soft !
5 #### He lasted 5 minutes and has had some stitching . I hate to sew
5 #### My dog is hard on toys , so poor Mr. Bill was a quadruple amputee within minutes , but we both love this toy so I got another . Hilarious voice box , takes me back to staying up late to watch SNL in my youth . A less destructive dog than mine should love this for a long time . I want to add that you should of course supervise your dog with this toy . The voice box has batteries inside which could really cause problems if your dog consumes any or all of the innards . I recommend supervision with any toy that your dog can potentially dismantle .
2 #### It is cute looking but the knit face is very fragile . My 4 pound dog managed to tear open the toy within 30 minutes . I did mend it but it will not last more than today .
2 #### My dog liked it , but it lasted around 12 hours before total destruction .
5 #### My lab 's favorite toy and best add niggle friend .
5 #### My dogs love this toy and play with it constantly .
5 #### My dogs Love Mr bill they could smell him in my back back still in the pkg and were looking my back pack with there nose I could not figure out what the problem was till I open my backpack and there was mr . Bill the dogs were so excited they love mr . Bill they shaking they play with him they bury him they unbury him and start all over again they do n't hurt him but sure do play with him see the sled dog play soccer too on you tube . " Soccer with a sled dog named Mooose "
5 #### My Shepherd - Hound - Lab mix loves this toy , he unstuffs it and I restuff it ( much to his annoyance ) over and over for a couple months of fun before it needs replacement .
5 #### My dog loves Lambchop . She carries her everywhere . We actually have 2 as it is her favorite toy and I wanted to make sure nothing happened to it . Lambchop is still in one piece . It seems to hold up well . There are 5 squeakers one in each foot and one in the body . My dog is a husky but she is careful with her toys . Will probably get her another one for Christmas as they get really dirty looking . I 'm tempted to throw it in the washer and see if it survives .
5 #### I do n't know what it is about this toy , all my dogs go nuts over it . Even my families dogs . It never seems to last too long before the squeaker and stuffing is out and all over your living room , but its inexpensive enough so I keep buying it !
3 #### This is not the sock monkey I remember . The arms , legs , and tail appear to be hand sewn and are " bunchy " with gaps between the stitches and pulled too tight in other spots . One leg is longer than the other but the same length as the tail . The body is over - stuffed and lumpy . I realize it 's just a dog toy but come on , this is shoddy construction .
1 #### The body of this lamb really soft and luxurious -- would be ideal for human babies ; however the face and feet are made of a thin gauze - type material that my dog ripped through in about 20 seconds . Seriously -- within seconds there were holes all over this thing .. I sewed them back together as best I could , only to have her rip through it again the moment she 'd get it back . It became more of a hassle than it was worth -- either sewing large portions back together , and/or picking up fuzz scattered all over the house . Should be marketed for older or sick dogs .
2 #### My 6 yr old Mini Schnauzer played with this toy maybe 10 times since May 15 and the toy stopped talking , dog stopped playing with the toy . I have toys that are 6 yrs old and have not any problems with them making noise or speaking Poor product and do not recommend .
5 #### Our golden just seems to love it . Good quality for such a simple toy .
5 #### My little Chihuahua loves it . Its a cute little thing and people that see it think so too
5 #### My Chihuahua chewed the back legs off his original Lambchop . This one is not made as well and the face was destroyed within minutes of him having it . Good for a dog that does n't chew or tug .
5 #### My pup loves Lambchop ! They hold up pretty well even though my Maggie is a chewer . I have performed " surgery " on them in the past . Now I just get her a new one !
1 #### Mr. Bill is my dog 's favorite toy , hands down . In that regard I would have rated him highly . HOWEVER today we had a major incident . My dog finally decided to rip him apart . He was playing with it , it was making its signature " Oh no ! " noise ... and then it was n't . I heard a crunch , looked down , and my dog had the noise box in his mouth . The door was completely off the battery compartment and 2 of the noted 3 button / watch batteries were on the floor next to him . So here we are at the emergency vet inducing vomiting to save him . It looks like there should have been a screw on the door to the battery compartment . I was n't able to find that either so I do n't know if he ate that too or if it was n't there . It certainly should n't have come off that easily . Please , if you have this toy , be very cautious . Remove it from your pet immediately if it becomes damaged . Maybe even open it to check for a screw on the battery compartment door . Batteries can kill pets .
5 #### Ca n't believe how my dog walks around with this , sleeps with it , NEEDS it by her constantly . It 's like her nubby . She needs it always . Her blanky . Her best friend .
5 #### Our dog loves these lamb chop squeak toys . They have a squeak in each paw , and in the center .
5 #### I think this toy is so cute.my only thing is the white color it gets dirty easy . It has held up good though . I put I. The washing machine on delicate and in the dryer on air dry . Lamp chops is holding up nicely so far .
4 #### My dog likes it . But bigger than I thought esp . 4 a toy fox terrier . It was an easter gift haha
5 #### Let me begin by saying that my 4 dogs have a lot of toys . This Lambchop is the medium size toy -- it is my second purchase and their favorite toy . I also bought the small ones but , for some reason all the dogs love this size best . Even my 6 lb . Maltese drags this one around . My one bichon is obsessed with licking and chewing them . They have held up well but , have worn out first in the face area . I wash them in a lingerie bag and put them in the dryer for a short time . They are n't strong enough for destructive dogs .
5 #### O M G. this is too funny . says " OH NOOOOOOOO " . dogs loving it too . Big guy carries this and woody woodpecker around now . house is quiet -- then you hear " OH NOOOOO " . yeah , got ta ge this one ! UPDATE : 09/28/17 . one 2nd Mr. Bill . This one got chewed apart pretty good -- the only caution . Inside is a small plastic box with the mechanics , actually a really small circuit board , and a battery . Myb big guy , Herc , 100 + lbs , cracked the case -- and lots of little plastic shards . Obviously took it away ( already had another new one as backup ) ; Just watch and take away if Mr. Bill gets too shredded . Still love OH NOOOOOOO ...... and so do all 4 dogs ...
2 #### Dogs love it but its cheaply made . Do n't expect this to last . You pay for what you get for .
3 #### Dog likes it , but destroyed it in a couple hours . Stuffing was all over the place , poor lambs brains were spread everywhere ... And he does n't destroy many toys .
5 #### Dog loves it , great sound , and gets a laugh when the dog makes Mr. Bill talk .
5 #### This tiny Lambchop toy is great to go home with new puppies in the toy group . It gives the new puppies a sense of stability in their new surroundings while they are in the adjustment stages . It also helps the new puppies to fall asleep without crying , so everyone gets their sleep . I highly recommend this toy to go in the puppy bag to its new home with a toy size puppy . It works great as the puppy grows and adjusts .
5 #### I bought a MR . BILL official talking toy for my Chion ( Chihuahua / Papillon ) about 5 years ago & he LOVED IT- he still has it though the vocalization finally stopped . I was so happy to see this one pop up on my " add ons " menu for under $ 6 - so of course I got it . My dogs LOVE IT ! It sounds identical to the one I bought years ago though it is shorter than the old model ( which is better for my smaller dogs ) . They throw it and run with it through the house as it says " Ooohh Nooo ! " - It 's sturdy enough for my boys who weigh 15 and 25 pounds . If your dog likes vocal toys this is great- it 's not too loud and the body is soft enough that it does n't break anything if it gets whipped a lil wildly while they play with it . Definitely a good buy .
5 #### Dogs love to destroy their favorite toys , so it 's important for the toys to have enough integrity for some chance of survival . Mr. Bill remains in good condition after three weeks of torture . It 's true that my dog ripped the oh no right out of him , but Mr. B. still has the majority of his stuffing and all his limbs , which is an impressive feat around here .
5 #### Still alive , though no longer talking , after several months of rough play .
5 #### This is my dog 's favorite toy . He brings this toy to bed with him every night and brings it to me when he wants to play fetch . Perfect size for a 15 - pound terrier . My dog loves the 5 - point squeaker and the feel of the fur .
5 #### My dog likes the squeak . I love how soft it is ! My dog tore it up very quickly .
4 #### Cute and playful . Not for big dogs . Or chewers . Pups destroyed before long .
2 #### My dogs had this destroyed in just a couple minutes flat .
5 #### Something about lamb chop , my dog has a couple of these in each size . Idk if it 's how soft it is or how it 's easy for her to fit in her mouth and cart around but she has about 8 of these around the house and lives them all .
5 #### My dog and every dog i 've ever given this too adores it , the absolute best dog toy ever .
1 #### My pug tore the stuffing out in 2 minutes . What a waste of money
5 #### i bought 2 for my dogs and 2 for my daughter 's new dog . they all love him and most of all i love him . i have posted on fb and many of my friends bought him too ! ooohhhhh noooooooo lol
5 #### FUN and FANTASTIC ! ! ! ! My Black Lab puppy LOVES this , and this is the second one I am ordering . The first one is still around , and held up pretty well , but Mr. Bill is losing his legs and arms . Guess he 's used to that though . :)
4 #### One of my mini schnauzers love this toy ! He enjoys the squeaking sound a lot ! He always steals it from his older brother ! Plus , its a pretty strong toy ! So far it 's still intact !
5 #### Poor Lambchop is missing some limbs , but the puppy still loves it .
5 #### My dog absolutely adores this toy and sleeps with it every night
1 #### Not good for any dog ... will last maybe one hour , if lucky ...
5 #### I 've purchased this before . My dog loves lambchop . But they do n't last long . He tears them to shreds . I also reborn dolls . I use it as a toy for the dolls . It is a great toy . I 'm giving one to my new great grandson . I gave my son ( Downs Syndrome ) one of these because he 's crazy about lambchop . So they are small , just right for a baby to handle . They love the squeek . No parts to come off and hurt them .
2 #### It is really cute , but not very well made . The parts , tail , arms , ears and tail are not stitched very well . I would not buy it again , nor would I recommend it to my family and friends .
5 #### This is by far my dog 's favorite toy ever . He takes it everywhere with him and always wants to play . It 's the equivalent to a teddy bear to a child .
3 #### Super cute . Dogs are a little afraid of it though .
5 #### Okay , it 's a little annoying to hear " Oh , Noooooo ! " all day , but our little ones love this toy !
3 #### Fun toy but if your dog likes to shred soft toys as does mine , do n't leave unattended as the voice box is hard plastic & could hurt your dog if chewed . It was funny to hear " OH nOOooOOOooo " as my dog ran with it through the house ... the first 6 times .
5 #### We love Lambchop . This size works well for my smallish terrier .... It took us a while to discover that there is a squeaker in each little foot .
5 #### My dog loves lamby . This is the second one I ve gotten her , since she loves it so much . It last her a week , before she dismantles it .
1 #### Granted my dog loved this toy , he also destroyed it within minutes . I rather spend twice the price on a toy that would last longer than 5 minutes . Also , there 's a lot of stuffing so it becomes a huge mess once your dog rips it apart . Not fan and will not buy again .
3 #### Great toy until I gave it to my 6 month old female weimaraner . In less than a minute she had already ripped open the stomach and pulled the stuffing out . Had to throw it away .
1 #### I have spent more time sewing this toy up and fixing it due to busted and loose seems , ears and arms that fall off . My dog uses these toys to play fetch and to carry around , she does not pull at them to cause the stitching to fail . Very very poorly crafted toys . Certainly not worth the money .
2 #### Pug chewed his mouth off within a day and broke his voicebox within 5 days . Wish he had lasted longer .
4 #### The dogs play with it and that is all I require .
5 #### My dog and I love Mr. Bill .... however , she chewed him up very quickly . I salvaged the voice box and it still works . Oh Nooooooo !
5 #### Very cute toy for my dog ! The voice stopped real quick tho .
3 #### At first I was a little sad cause it 's much larger than I imagined and that was my fault . Reading the dimensions would tell you what size it is . It was for a tiny little Pomeranian and I was afraid it would be waaay too big for her . Despite the size she loved it and carried it around with her everywhere she went . Unfortunately after a few days it was torn to shreds . She 's a dainty little Pom . I doubt it would last a fraction of the time with a bigger doggo .
3 #### Cute stuffed toy . Unfortunaturally , my dog is an aggressive , shredder chewer and it did n't last 2 days before she tore the head off and pulled out the stuffing . ai give it an okay because my dog liked carrying it around and I 'm sure it would be a great toy for a normal medium to large dog .
5 #### One of the most durable toys , shih tzu loves it sleeps with it , golden has n't destroyed it , good product
2 #### cute but was ripped to shreds in no time by my little chi - pin , which is not much bigger than the toy
5 #### Our dog has about 40 various toys that we have to stack up everyday . When the wife gets home he gets all excited and roots through his stash of goodies . This is one of his favorites , with all the squeakers . He shakes and bites this thing , growls and then flings it into the air . We have had it about two months and I did have to hand sew the seam in the back once , but it has held up well . A definite buy for any pet 's discerning collection .
5 #### They ca n't get enough of this toy and it still looks almost new .
5 #### Love this Mr. Bill " Oh No " toy . My dog 's almost 2 yrs old now but he went nuts when he saw one of his very first toys , he loved as a pup . Press the belly & it says : " OH NO " for those who are old enough to remember Sat . Night Live 's Mr. Bill . The 1st one we bought lasted a good 3 months which is pretty good for these soft toys . Even if they do n't hold up forever , it 's got arms & legs for those dogs who like to TUG on toys with their people . Love our new Mr. Bill
5 #### My dogs love their Lambchops . Although I originally bought them because I remember watching Sherry & Lambchop on Tv when I was young . They are a good size for both my dogs . An 11 lb Yorkie and a 15 lb Dachshund .
4 #### Dog loves this toy . After a few months she started to get the stuffing out . I put it back in and sewed off the opening and it 's still going strong . She is not too hard on her soft toys so this has been a good purchase . I do n't try washing these toys .
5 #### Actually I do n't really love Mr. Bill , but our Goldendoodle certainly does .
4 #### Got this for a relative named Bill ( for his dog ) . It is really cute !
2 #### once again made stating getting holes at least 2 lg.came apart & 2 small no need no intense chewing just up to a reasonable good dog toy ! !
5 #### This is the cutest toy and he sounds just like mr Biil when the pups squeeze on him ,
5 #### Our dog loves his " Lambchop " toy . Plays with it everyday . Made well and very cute .
5 #### French bulldog loves this plush toy more than his other plush toys .
5 #### My mini schnauzer pup loves this toy almost as much as his lamb chop toy . Both are perfect for pups to play with ... Dogs love the sounds .
5 #### Here is what my dog said about this toy " woof oorf woow wooooof gruff " Google translate did n't have a clue but a rough translation would be : " Thank you for the toy daddy , I am going to chew it then shove it in your mouth while you sleep " he loves it . It is quite tough and brings back memories of the show " lamb chop " whenever I see it .
4 #### lambchop still squeaks even though she led a hard life
5 #### I gave a Mr. Bill to my daughter - in - law 's dog about 2 - 3 years ago .. Fido normally de - guts her chew toys but she did not do that to Mr. Bill . She carried him around constantly but he finally fell apart from being loved . I had this one waiting for Fido and as soon as she came in it was love all over again . I would not recommend Mr Bill for more aggressive dogs who normally " de - guts " their toys since he contains a voice box , though without very close supervision .
5 #### My dogs favorite toy and the best price I 've found .
5 #### OMG ! I must have missed the size of this pup ! It 's so big , in comparison to the little one they sell at the pet stores . I 've added it to my puppy 's Christmas Stocking , and he filled the whole top of the sock . I 've seen my kid already eye - balling it lol As you can tell , it 's a great buy , and with Prime arrived right away . We 're in love already ! And he 's soooo soft .
5 #### This toy is so cute & it is my dog Zoey 's favorite toy . I have to continue to buy them because she loves it so much and destroys them over time . The best place to buy it is here , the quality is great and the prices are the best ! LAMBCHOP is my pup 's BFF ! ! ! ! Get this for your dog , they will love it !
4 #### Brings back old times . Love the toy but the dogs chewed it up rather quickly . They tend to do that with toys that speak rather than squeak .
5 #### Mr. Bill is a gas ! He 's also very well made , of high quality fabric . The " OHHH NOOO ! " is too funny . Our puppy loves it .
4 #### The large one so cheap is so sweet but it did tear across the back seam fast . Nothing a that ca n't be hand repaired but that is why only four stars .
5 #### Love it , great quality and price . my dog gon na love this too
1 #### In less than 24 hours my Yorkie mix had managed to tear a massive hole in it and spread the entirety of its stuffing throughout my apartment .
5 #### Got this for my pup for christmas , she 's already trying to unwrap her gift ! ! Good quality , loud sqeeker !
3 #### This was a sweet looking toy but my Chihuahua had it shredded pretty quickly .
2 #### I really wanted to love this plush , since I grew up watching Lambchop , but sadly my frenchie busted the little guy open on the first day . One thing I do love about it is the big squeaker is easy for my dog to squeak and it 's loud so he loves it ! I 'll probably take the squeaker out now that it 's opened and sew it into a different toy .
5 #### Two little Lambchops are better than one 24 " one . Poor pup could n't wrap his mouth around the 24 " body to make it squeak . The little Lambchop has a plethora of squeakers . What joy !
1 #### Mr. Bill is made in China , so only God knows ... also there is a component inside so the doll says " Oh No ! ! " repeatedly . It took 10 minutes for my Cane Corso to break the component and tears it 's face off ! Buyer Be Ware ! Also , it 's not even a 1 star rating !
5 #### this toy is awesome , did n't last long with my jack Russell but was super hilarious when he kept saying " Oh No " as my dog ripped him to shreads lol
5 #### These are bigger than the one in the stores . It 's just a regular squeak toy but for some reason they love it . I buy a new one every month after the old squeaker is dead and the lamb gets beat up .
5 #### Durable yet adorable . Our pup loves this . Has a sqeaker too .
5 #### These are very high quality pet toys but they wo nt ' last very long if you do n't keep an eye on your dog .. those ears are so chewable :) the body has a large squeeker and all four paws have their own squeekers too I 've been through many of these as my dogs love them .
2 #### This was my puppies first toy when we got her , unfortunately she 's been through 3 already . She rips the face off and spills its fluff everywhere in minutes . Ca n't recommend this toy sadly .
5 #### I bought two of these for my furry babies .... for Christmas . They have n't seen them yet . But , I have to tell you they are beautiful ! Very soft and cuddly ( wish they would stay that way ) . My pups will loved them to shreds . The quality and size really pleasantly surprised me . I would definitely buy these again . In fact , they are so nice I was tempted to buy some for my grand - babies too :D Fast delivery too ! Thank you so much for the fast delivery too !
5 #### This is one of the first toys we bought our puppy several months ago and this is her favorite toy . She will destroy almost all of her other soft toys but seems to be a little more gentle with this one because she does n't want it thrown away . We bought her a second one and now she has two ! Good fun for her and the squeaking is n't too unbearable for us .
5 #### We have two dogs . One treats her toys gently but carries them from room to room or outside and sleeps with it . The other dog is rough on his toys , flipping them around , shaking them , chewing them . This toy suits them both . It lasts a long time and even after several months , the squeaker still works . I like this toy so much , I bought them each one for Christmas this year .
5 #### My dog 's favorite lovey . She 's so cute , when she comes to lay down for a nap , she always has her LambChop in her mouth .
5 #### My dog loved it . Destroyed in 2 minutes flat !
5 #### This is my moms dog 's favorite toy . Poor lamb chop has taken a beating for months . It bigger than most of the other stuffed animals , perfect for him to hump on . Lol soon he will be nuetered . Almost 8mths old now . Maltechon
5 #### This is a great dog toy . It 's super soft and well made . My dog loves playing with it .
5 #### These are n't the most durable toys , but my puppy is obsessed with his lambchops ! I think he likes that they are really soft . He sleeps with it in his cage ever single night . We 've bought him a few now .
5 #### She 's a 6 - lb chihuahua puppy , it 's almost as long as she is , and she just loves it . She always picks it first from her toy box when I sit down to play with her .
5 #### I 'm rather impartial . The dog on the other hand thinks its fabulous .
5 #### My dog loves his Lambchop . It currently does not have stuffing in its face but it is still going strong . My dog ( a beagle ) also has a Mr. Bill that he loves but not as much as Lambchop . I do n't know if it 's because of how soft it is but I 'll continue buying Lambchop until he 's sick of it .
5 #### This is the best toy ever . I am on the 2nd one for my dog . The first one lasted a month before he killed it .
4 #### My dog loved this toy so much that she promptly dismembered it . Oh , well . We restuffed the fluff and sewed her back up ... good as new !
5 #### This toy has one squeaker in the body , and one in each foot . That 's FIVE squeakers . Most toys only have one . I have a four - month old lab puppy that ca n't get enough of this toy .
2 #### Very week material that my dog chewed through within minutes . It has five squeakers and 4 have came out . Dogs who are aggressive chewers DO NOT need this toy . The squeakers in side are a choking hazard .
5 #### My Chihuahua already loves its plushness and it squeaks easily . It 's the size as her too so after playing with it , she sleeps on it .
5 #### My greyhound absolutely loves this toy ! She 's not huge into toys , so it 's nice to see when she finds one she really likes . The squeaker is LOUD and she 'll really go for it for a while . I like that the squeaker in this one is easy for them to find too . Some toys have them in awkward spots or the material is too hard for them to comfortably chew on , but this one is very plush and soft . Edit : a few months into having this toy the squeaker is still going strong . The squeaker has lasted longer than the ones in some other toys that were 2 - 3x the price . Definitely worth the price .
5 #### I grew up with Shari Lewis and Lambchop . This toy is just too cute for words ! ! ! The squeaker is great , the toy is medium- large size , and the soft cuddly faux fur is well - selected and does not shed . The squeaker is easy to activate in mid - body and the toy is very well made . I definitely recommend this for dogs that do not destroy plush toys .
4 #### My dog 's absolute favorite toy ! If he could , he 'd play with it all day everyday ! If your dog loves squeaky toys and chews a lot , be aware that the squeakers will stop working quickly . We have gone through 4 of them for our dog in 5 months because he over uses the toy . I am hoping they make more of a durable squeaker in the future for big chewers .
4 #### Dog loves it but be warned the squeaker is obnoxious
2 #### Not good for strong chewers . My 8 month old puppy destroyed the lamb within a day .
4 #### Really Nice Toy , But our dog was able to tear it open in course of an hour . It was pretty , and soft , but unfortunately it did not hold up to our 40 lb boxer/ border collie / Dalmatian mix . Other than the lack of durability I would reccomend this toy . If your Dog is an aggressive chewer , you may want to look for another type of toy .
5 #### These are cute and well made but definitely easy to shred . My dogs loved them but they certainly did n't last long - not that we bought them anticipating them to be durable . Definitely worth the money if your pooch loves plush toys . Would also be cute for a kid 's gift !
5 #### This toy is great and my pup loves sleeping with it a night in his crate . Has held up well
5 #### My dog LOVES this toy . She does not rip it to pieces like she does with the others , especially the moose ; she hates the moose . Duckworth has lived for quite a few months as well . This toy still has all of it 's limbs intact ! I She carries this toy around all the time . Its a decent size for my 75 lb Pitt / Rotty
5 #### For those of you who remember ' Lamb Chop ' ... This is my golden retriever 's favorite toy . It 's for dogs with soft mouths . Washable . Squeaker seems to be indestructible ( good news / bad news ) .
5 #### My dogs love Lampchop and she has lots of squeakies !
5 #### There is only one problem with this purchase . I should have purchased 10 of them . Lamb Chop has brought together the love of an unlikely couple . A Rottweiler names Stella and A Maltipoo named Jerry . Lamb Chop is they 're child . I have switched 2 out already . They never noticed . I highly recommend this toy .
1 #### So cute but it took less than an hour for my 20 - lb maltipoo to tear open this toy and pull out all of the stuffing ! ! !
5 #### Pepper loves this toy , we have gone through 6 of them . Plays with them every day !
5 #### Great toy that my dogs love ( even my nutty dog who chewed one 's face off ! )
5 #### New puppies love this toy . I should of gotten two of them .
5 #### We love these toys for our dogs . Amusing to us and them !
4 #### My 60 pound baby lab loves carrying his baby around . Ca n't go anywhere without it . Nothe sure it can withstand some of the playing he does with it seeing as how it already has a tear I. It 's face after 2 days . He does love it though so like I always do , I guess I will buy more for when he needs it .
5 #### My dogs love Mr. Bill . I crack up every time they step on him or pick him up and Mr. Bill says " ohhhhhnooooo " . Only a certain generation will understand this toy . LOL
5 #### My dog 's all time favorite toy . She worships this one . Dumped all of her other stuffed friends and takes this one everywhere , constantly loving on it and bathing it ! It 's adorable . She lost the first one so I ordered another one right away because she was heartbroken . I 'll be ordering a third just in case !
5 #### This toy is a huge hit ... The dogs go crazy over it !
5 #### So cute ! ! Just so much fun for my pup ... she loves it ..
5 #### All 3 of my dogs love this to death . I have bought a few so far and they are all in various destroyed stages . But even when there is barely a carcass left , the dogs love this and will fight over it . It even seems the more destroyed they are , the more they want to play with them . Lol
5 #### Our dog loves this toy but as she got bigger chewed it to pieces , goodbye lampchop
3 #### Cute toy and our 3 month old puppy ( about 10 lb terrier / chihuahua mix per rescue where we got him ) loved it but within 48 hours he had torn an arm off from shaking it so we had to take it away from him . Wish it had lasted longer .
5 #### Firstly , we 're on about our fourth ' Lamby ' . No fault of our sweet terrier mix - The minute Lamby is brought ' Back To Life ' , i.e. , bought again , we play keep away from the Lab . With three dogs , the third being a Pit Rescue who thankfully is only interested in hard toys , it can get ' Interesting ' when it 's New Toy Day . Lamby has been , hands down , the favorite and most loved by our middle child . She never eats him , only squeaks him all day . And even she has been known to Kill a toy every now and then . Not Lamby . Never . She protects him like a child , going so far as to jump into Daddy 's protective arms whenever Lamby is threatened . Lamby is her baby , and we all know what we will do to protect our children And thank goodness for good Daddy 's who will help save Lamby at all costs . Just want to add since canines + eating soft things can equal disaster , make sure to cut all tags , loops , etc . , on dog toys . LambChop has a neck loop we always cut off , as well as those annoying ' White Tags ' on everything you buy . We lost a sweet girl to an intestinal blockage years ago . Pretty much freaks about what our kids swallow now , obviously . And with any type of toy , especially soft , there 's that much more reason to worry / supervise . Do n't want anyone to ever have to go through the heartache and guilt we did
3 #### It 's such a cute toy just wish it had lasted longer .
2 #### This toy was great and the dogs loved it , it was one of their favorite toys . What we did not know was that it contained plastic , small pieces and small batteries in which the dogs can easily tear apart and break . They broke the plastic into small tiny sharp pieces and luckily we got to them before they were able to continue to play with the doll . Dog toys should never contain anything that can be this harmful to a dog or be easily swallowed ! We are just so lucky they did n't eat any of the batteries , let alone small sharp pieces .
3 #### Only problem with this toy is the mouth comes apart very easily and then you have to get rid of due to exposed stuffing . Other than that my dog has had three of them and he 's only six months . Yes he is spoiled but loves his lamb chop .
4 #### Very cute but much bigger than I had expected
5 #### My pups favorite has squeakers in all paws and belly
5 #### Excellent toy , very squeaky so my puppy loves it . It 's also pretty good size so not small which I like and its overall very cute
5 #### Our Beagle enjoys using this as a pillow in her crate . Not what we bought it for but she seems to like it :)
3 #### Not very indestructible . lasted 2 hours with my bulldog .
5 #### This is by far my dog 's favorite toy . All other plush toys she chews apart , but not this one for whatever reason ...
4 #### Puppy Loves it . I had hoped for this to be a little larger in size though . For a large 45 lbs golden retriever , would be nice if it came in a larger size . the noise is very annoying in my ears by the way , but my puppy loves it and the more noise it makes , puppy gets more playful .
5 #### I do n't know what it is , but my dog is OBSESSED with lambchops- I 've gotten her these dolls since she was a few months old , and it 's always the first toy she grabs from her box . If your dog is a chewer , this toy is n't going to last long though . Love it , and the price !
5 #### This is our puppy 's favorite toy . I bought an extra one in case he rips the first one . It is soft and has a lot of squeakers ( body and each hand / foot ) , which my puppy loves .
5 #### I got this toy for my friend 's little poodle . The dog absolutely loves it and actually pulls this toy out over all her others from her toy basket . Spoiled I know ; P. I 'm actually thinking of buying another one in case the first one gets ruined . The toy itself is extremely soft and it looks exactly like the picture !
5 #### My monster loves this toy ... (a little too much if u know what I mean )
5 #### I got lambchop as one of the first toys for my new puppy . All four dogs like it but eventually it was a chosen one to be destroyed ! I kept her until i was tired of the stuffing falling out all over the carpet . That puppy would eat the stuffing if you did n't pick it up quickly . The picture is of a new lamb chop and a 10 week old Tootsie , a blue Sharpei
5 #### German Shepherd approved ! My dog * loves * this toy and it is surprisingly durable . I 've bought him several of these , but not because he 's ripped them . First he kills the squeaker in the body , then he keeps biting it until he kills the squeakers in the feet . But this can take a few weeks . Even though he loves to bite Lambchop , he has yet to actually rip open one of them . I just replace them when all of the squeakers are dead and it 's dirty from being carried all over the house . He loves his Lambchops !
5 #### Good quality and even my cat is interested in it . The puppy arrives next week .
5 #### This is one of his favorite toys . I 'm on my second one .
5 #### The dog loves it . It is a little large , but my tiny dog can carry it and easily makes it talk .
5 #### This is the second lambchop I 'm purchasing ... not because the first one was destroyed , but because it 's BOTH of my dog 's FAVORITE toy . ( Two basset hounds ) They are constantly fighting over this toy ! And even with hours of chewing , pulling and tugging it back and forth for a month , Lambchop is still in one piece . She 's one tough sheep !
3 #### This is the 4th one I 've bought and while it lasts a long time before our dog can mutilate it , this time the sound stopped after 5 minutes : /. At this time , we are still unsure whether this is actually a blessing in disguise !
1 #### 7 months German Shepherd puppy destroys it in 30 min it ' 's not a good idea to let your puppy play with broken toy ..... with all those toy fillings out
3 #### Lambchop lost his squeak in about three seconds . But he 's still cute , and the puppy still tries to shake him until his neck breaks .
5 #### ohhhhh noooooo ! Do n't give to dog . I use in my soul sucking cubical to entertain the other peons .
3 #### I have a 50 lb hound / boxer mix that loves to chew . This toy was destroyed in less than 2 hours .
3 #### My dogs favorite toy . Worth the buy . Very cute !
5 #### Just received this today . I think it 's saying , " Oh No " . Our dog loves it . Time will tell if it is sturdy . She 's not ruff on her toys , but some toys tend to loose pieces .
5 #### My puppy loves this toy ! She is constantly making it squeak and she gets a great amount of enjoyment out of it . We have had it for 2 months or so , and she has n't torn it up !
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Multipet - Plush - Dog - Toy - Lambchop / dp / B003XVYKVI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Multipet Plush Dog Toy , Lambchop</a>&nbsp;Adorable and the pup loves it so much , made his day . he carried all day long would n't share with any of his brothers or sisters . Give it A+ ! ! !
5 #### This toy is our 90 - pound dog 's favorite toy -- ever ! Surprisingly , it has held up much better than his other toys . He seems to enjoy this plush toy much better than the plastic , rope or rubber toys we 've gotten him in the past -- who knew ? This toy is a winner ! Will keep your dog happy for hours and hours .
5 #### My dog loves it ! So cute and the price is much better than other places I have seen the same toy
5 #### If you have a dog that loves stuffed animals ( sometimes loves to eat them too ) , then this little plush toy is a great deal . My dog sleeps with her little lamb and , yes , it looks just like Lamb Chop ( for those of you old enough to remember ) . It is a little too cute sometimes for Zoey , who has eaten the face off of the last three we purchased . That said , a little needle and thread and all is well again .
5 #### Cute toy for a smaller dog or even a cat . Has a louder squeeker in the middle and then little squeekers in each of his paws . My puppy looks so cute playing with it . It is super soft too so it is great if your pup likes a snuggly
5 #### I can not express how much I love lamb chop ! While I have gone through many a number , they are very cheap , and my dog absolutely loves them . This is her favorite toy . She loves chewing the string and after months manages to remove a squeaker and stuffing , and then I order another one . Normally I keep a back up one on hand for my Cavalier . I recommend this to all dog owners . While they may eventually get destroyed , they are every dog 's favorite toy I 've met . If you are skeptical , at least buy one and give it a try . Having them now as add on items they are even cheaper . Sometimes though they are on backorder because so many people are ordering them - especially around the holidays and Christmas . I 've tried multiple dog toys more expensive and from PetSmart , and she always goes for this one . The only toy that compares is a Christmas gift for her from 2015 that was a mouse . Every time we play she must play with both of them before she is finished . While I have bought her numerous toys , this is her absolute favorite , and I recommend it for any dog . They also come in various sizes .
1 #### I totally regret buying this ! My dog , who is small , was able to immediately remove one of the ears and promptly swallow it . Thankfully she urped it up 2 days later . Needs much better stitching to protect our fur babies !
5 #### My 12 year old dog ca n't get enough of this one !
5 #### When we say " oh , no " Bob - the - dog runs and gets Mr Bill . Such a smart pup !
1 #### This is a single DVD - not 2 . Description is incorrect .
5 #### Bought this as my sister 's dog loves hers and it lasted a long time . My pup got this when she was the same size as the doll and it is still going strong . Very durable , but my pup has n't really destroyed many toys yet .
3 #### This toy is super cute . It did n't take very long to get decapitated by my dogs , but they love it and are still playing with the body because there are squeakers in each foot .
4 #### It 's not durable by any means , but my dog could n't have been happier with it . It was ripped open and the insides pulled out within a few days . I am happy that the squeaker is attached by additional netting , as you can see in the attached picture .
5 #### One of my dogs absolutely love " Lamy " . He is having his second one now , the first one got chewed up quite a bit ! And I have one more for reserve when number two will fall apart . But even the first one lasted for a long time , especially because my dog was still a puppy then with a greta desire to chew everything . Great for dogs since it has no plastic parts that otherwise could be swallowed .
5 #### great plush , also good for cats , my gf cat plays with it more than my dog stella
5 #### Ziva loves her Lambchop - she takes her wherever she goes ! this is her second Lambchop - she destroyed the first when we had to leave her for a week . she 's much gentler with her Lambcho now that we 're home . keep up the good work ! colleen
5 #### Our boston terrier loves Lambchop , it 's her favorite toy ! Squeaks in the hands , feet , and tummy .
5 #### Our goldendoodle puppy loves her little lamb . It has a nice squeak sound that 's not as annoying as most dog toys .
4 #### i 'd give Lambchop a 5 , but since he only lasted a few minutes with me , my mom said he 's a 3 , but she 's not looking so I gave him a 4 . If you have a non chewer , who just likes to look at and cuddle his toys , go for it . But if you 've got big jaws like me , you need something a lot more durable .
5 #### Purchased for my 5 year old Irish Water Spaniel to replace her older lamb that finally gave up its stuffing . she is a notorious chewer of balls , but for some reason wo n't chew these . Packs this around like it is her best friend .
5 #### haha super funny toy , my dog goes crazy for mr bill
2 #### I wanted so much to give this 5 stars but my dogs had it in shreds in 30 seconds . Ears went first then the head and all the stuffing . Not for dogs who chew , it is delicately built . Should have kept it as a decoration , it is really cute - was , I mean .
4 #### Not the most durable monkey but does the job . My cat has ripped one of his arms off and drowned him in the water bowl a few times ... glad it was the monkey and not me .
2 #### Overpriced rag . 30 minutes after the arrival , the squeaky part was silent ..... I have a 4 month old yorkie . It 's not JAWS . I would return it , but she chewed off the eyes . Waste of money .
5 #### One of my dogs favorite toys ; he has Lambchop in 3 different sizes and loves them all :) He 's not a stuffed toy destroyer but does play tug and this has held up well .
5 #### This is the only stuffed toy my 14 lb mixed breed likes so I keep getting her new ones as she finishes pulling the stuffing out of the head . I think she likes the soft feel of the fur .
5 #### Looks just like Lamb Chop , and my lab loves it .
5 #### Adorable Lambchop dog toy for all 4 of our dogs . It is very well made and stuffed nicely . No plastic pieces to be chewed on . It 's a favorite of our Miniature Schnauzer and our Yorkie !
5 #### So cute . Lots have this so i bought it for my dog.so soft
5 #### My 10 pound puppy loves this toy ! Have had it for a week or 2 and it 's still entact :)
4 #### My dog likes so well I bought a backup !
5 #### Great dog toy ! ! ! Squeakers in the feet and center of the toy .
4 #### Puppy loves it , other dog owners say the same , but it lasts one day ...
5 #### MY DOG LOVES PLAYING WITH MR.BILL AND SO WILL YOURS
4 #### I love Lambchop ! I used to love the show as a kid so I had to get this for my new puppy . It was a bit bigger that I expected and it is stuffed pretty tight so it was n't really floppy like I thought it would be . It is still really cute and it has a bunch of squeakers , which my puppy loves . Though he does seem to get tired of it pretty quick . It might just be to big for him right now . He likes floppy toys he can shake around . I did already have to hand wash this because puppy got some of his mess on it . After a thorough hand washing in the sink all the squeakers still work . The " fur " does n't really look as nice though . For the price I think its a really nice toy that our puppy will grow into .
5 #### My bichon puppy LOVES this toy . I had to wait until she was sleeping to wash it . A great way to get the pup riled up ... Squeakers in every paw , a big squeaker in the belly , so much fun . Within ten minutes of having " lamby " one ear was removed . After four months of daily hard play one squeaker is a dud . It 's great for fetch , for " killing " , for cuddling at night , and as she nears adolescence ... well ... The pooch says " five stars . " Update : lampchop just had surgery . All her squeakers except for the belly were fixable . I 'm still looking for a large replacement squeaker but in the meantime replaced it with a 2 " .
5 #### I was surprised how bi this was for the price . My little Sadie LOVES her Lamb Chop so much .
5 #### Made very well . Our dog has not been able to shred , pull apart or pluck out the fur . Quality squeakers , our dog has not been able to bite holes and damage squeak noise . Very good for small breed . Durable .
2 #### Our 12 lb dog ripped off an arm in 24 hours . Not very sturdy .
5 #### A super toy for my Schnauzer , but keep away from dog chewers as it is filled with small beads .
5 #### My dog is very fond of the toy . Unfortunately it is not as sturdy as some dog toys so we keep it in bed where she will cuddle it more than tear up on it .
5 #### Arrived earlier than I had anticipated . The dog toy was just as pictured . I am quite happy .
5 #### LOVE IT ! It 's fun and certainly catches pet 's attention . Different from traditional squeek !
5 #### I bought this on a whim specifically because I had a very similar Lambchop toy as a child . Yeah , totally worth it . - It 's somewhat large , 10 to 12 inches in length . It 's about the size of my smallest dog ( a small chihuahua ) . - It 's very lightweight so all 3 of my dogs , especially the 14 lb chihuahua mix , can still use it and toss it into the air themselves . - It 's not thin and cheap but it 's also not the most heavy - duty stuffed toy , so if your dog is a chewer you may have an issue ... then again you should never let your dog continuously chew up any stuffed toy , ever ;) - It 's fluffy and soft , good to cuddle with or play with . My dog likes to use his toys a pillows after he 's done playing , and this is the best one for that . - Manufactured in China . No weird scents or anything that throws me off . I felt perfectly safe giving it to my dog . - There are small squeakers in each foot and one large squeaker in the belly . No batteries in this Lambchop . - Overall feelings : I like it , my dogs like it , no regrets .
5 #### My dog loves this toy . She 's a 12 lb Havanese and a light chewer . She is n't destructive at all , so this Lambchop is holding together pretty well . She mostly gently chews on it or licks it . She occasionally wants to play catch with it , whipping it around and playing tug - of - war with it , but it was yet to tear or rip . It 's most likely because she is n't super aggressive with it , so it 's perfect for my dog .
5 #### Lamby ! That what we call this one ! This was my huskys very first toy and he loved it more than anything . He 'd carry it around everywhere ! I have a ton of pictures of he and his beloved , Lamby ! It lasted through his teething stage and beyond ! I 'm sad to report that poor Lamby met its demise a few months ago when the neighbors dog stole it and tore it to shreds I their yard . :-( we tried to replace Lamby thinking that Jett would n't notice but he did . Jett is over a year now and we can entertain him most days with a game or two of fetch . He will play with this lamb but it 's not the same and he knows it .
1 #### Cute toy but too big for my pug . Had no interest in it so it is now with my collection .
5 #### My Golden Retriever has two laundry baskets full of toys but Lamb Chop is his favorite . It has a loud squeaker in the middle and is just the right size for carrying in the mouth , as retrievers like to do . We always have to have a few spares stashed away , in case they ever stop making them . If Amazon offered a case discount we 'd probably take it . :)
1 #### My dogs loved plaiyng with Lambchop , so much so she did not even last 12 hours before she was ripped apart and all stuffing on the floor . Actually had to cut some chewed up parts off after even the first hour . Nice and soft but more durable would be nice .
5 #### Takes abuse . Just like the SNL Mr. Bill , this toy puts up with A LOT ! ! ! ! Love it ! ! ! !
1 #### Bought 3 of these . Only one actually had a voice box that worked . Defective merchandise ! ! !
1 #### My puppy was able to tear off one of the eyebrows and ate it . I did n't notice until she threw it up .
5 #### My four dogs love toys that make noise and do n't just squeak . I may get tired of hearing the sounds but it sure makes my babies happy , so we will always have some of these around !
1 #### Can somebody make a toy that last longer than a day . Do n't waste your money .
4 #### Who does n't love Mr. Bill ? He 's really cute and of course he says " oh no ! "
2 #### Destroyed with days , not a chew toy for a dog . Maybe better as a cuddle toy for a child .
4 #### It 's very cute and my dog loved it . She loved it so much , it 's now in pieces all over . LOL It 's all good though , she enjoyed it and I knew ahead of time she is a chewer . Especially with stuffed plush toys with squeakers in them !
5 #### Oh my gosh I do n't know what it is about this little Lambchop but our 7 month old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel absolutely loves this more than any of his toys . He is now on Lambchop number 3 because he plays with it non stop ripping it apart as much as he can , trying to bite the ears off . It 's so funny ! He gets an ear in his mouth and then shakes it fiercely like he 's showing Lambchop he 's the boss . This is the only stuffed animal that he does that to . I 'm thinking about ordering a couple of them to have for back ups because he was so upset when we had to take the last one away from him because he had the stuffing coming out .
5 #### This is the third at least we have gotten for our dog , who goes through squeak / noisemaking toys like candy . It is the only toy that reliably lasts more than an hour or so in his jaws ; we think because the noise it makes sounds different enough from other squeaks that he does n't immediately have the urge to destroy it . Even after he dissects it to remove the noisemaker ( which usually happens several weeks in ) , he loves and plays with the toy , and it holds together well enough after this process that he is able to play with it for months . For whatever reason , even though he usually saws the limbs off of other toys with any protruding bits , he leaves the arms and legs on Mr. Bill alone . It is not a very sturdy toy , but because of the sound it makes , and because of its design , it actually manages to last longer than any so - called " indestructible " toy we have ever tried , and make our dog happy for a very long time . The only toys that last longer are a miraculous spider ( still squeaks a bit after a few years , though he 's long since chewed most of the legs off ) and the " bubble wrap " style of squeak toys that are made out of a mat with 6 - 12 squeakers sewn into different parts of the mat . It also sounds less obnoxious to humans than most squeak toys .
2 #### My dog loves his " lambie" ... but the last few lambies have all had an open seam on the back . Defective lambie lot ?
1 #### Muzzle area weak and easily torn . Dog loves it but it does not last long
3 #### It 's okay . better for a small dog . My 6 month old lab destroyed it in a couple of days . No fault of the toy , however but the stitching could have been a bit stronger .
5 #### I bought this for my puppy 's first ride in car - which was when he came home with us . at first , it was bigger than he was ( 2 lbs) ... he is now 7.5 pounds at 10 months , and still loves to snuggle with this squeak lamb when napping .. he tosses it around , shaking it , squeaking it , and it 's still in very good condition .
5 #### I have purchased over 10 of these , they are great toys for the price and I do n't mind them scattered about my apartment because they are so cute and remind me of my childhood . They are durable enough to last for about 3 weeks to a month for my Australian Shepherd , which is worth the cost to me . Will continue to purchase .
5 #### Oh My Goodness , does he , Snoop Dogg , ever love Lamby . As do Henry , Reba , Franklin & Molly ( my sister 's and niece 's " kids " ) . So much so that after a while he , Snoop , oves Lambchop to death and I need to send him , LC , to heaven to be replaced by Lambchop # ... So , it 's a darn good thing that Amazon runs occasional specials for this sweetheart making it possible for me to stock up . Oh Yes , I remember Sherry Lewis and I loved Lambchop so much ( the real Lambchop , the living Lambchop ) that this little gem takes me back to simpler times when life was so much easier , when we , my sister , brother grew up on the Jersey Shore ( the * real * Jersey Shore aka downashore on LBI ) . This toy is a hit but it 's not all that sturdy . So do n't buy it . We need all of them , I say , all of them ! ! ! [ Maniacially laughing ] hahahhahaha
4 #### The first large ( extra ? ) Lambchop I purchased came from Amazon , and my destructo - dog loved it . He seems to have a preference for toys with squeekers . It is about half his own size , so he has some difficulty getting a grip to tear things off because it is so plush . While I am a little frustrated by the squeeker moving around in the belly of the beast , the search occupies him . Then I purchased the smaller one ( twice ) from the grocery store aisle - one to play with while the other is in the wash . He knows there are squeekers in the paws , but has n't been able to " work " them and focuses on the belly squeeker . The top seam on one of the small ones did come apart even though it was in a laundry bag and is awaiting my repair . I have found them to be worth the expense . Other toys have not survived his concentrated efforts to dismantle , puncture , shred , or eat them .
5 #### this one does its job well . definitely my dog 's favorite .
5 #### My Maltese loves his lamb ! It is much cheaper online and I love that there are squeakers in each of its feet as well .
5 #### I got this for my 12 week old pug puppy and though he was n't interested in it at first , mainly because it was the same size as him , but it quickly became his favorite toy . He loves that there are squeakers that he can actually bite and squeak on all 4 on lampchop 's paws , there is a large , loud squeaker in the stomach , and there is a lot of stuffing so it makes it fun to play with . The quality is great , especially for the price , and has kept his interest when other toys have fallen flat . IMO , if your dog is the destructive type , then only allow them to have it when supervised or bypass it all together , as it is n't a tough kong type and is more like a plushie with loud , good squeakers .
5 #### This Lampchop is very cute with a squeaker in each foot . My puppy loves this one .
5 #### My puppy loves these Lamb Chop toys . She has one in each size .
5 #### Bought this for my dogs for Christmas . Mr Bill was a big hit . He was immediately picked - up , shook & tossed around . He speaks when squeezed and made everyone laugh -- well that and the antics of my 2 dogs ! It 's now March . My girls are n't hard on toys and ca n't make them speak by themselves unless they pounce on it landing just right , but it 's a great toy to play with your little dogs . I suppose larger dogs could make it speak by themselves . Got this one and Woody Woodpecker . and both are still working unlike some dog toys that if they work when you get them you feel lucky and if still making sounds a week later well ... such a deal ! I would n't hesitate to get more like these . They 're fun for kids of all ages--2 and 4 legged .
1 #### Theirs a sound box that a dog can ( and will ) get to and it poses a real choking as well as toxic hazard Stay away
5 #### Most adorable dog toy EVER . Each paw has a small squeek , as well as the tummy . It 's my dogs favorite toy .
5 #### Lamb Chop is a favorite character of ours and has also become a favorite of one of the family 's four legged members . Skruffy plays a game with her every night before bedtime with her human . Lamb chop is a perfect size , soft , has a squeeker and perfect .
5 #### This is of excellent quality except one foot squeeky has been pierced and no longer works but is adorable and puppy loves it !
5 #### Our little Maltese loves her little Lambchop . She is not rough with it being only 7 poiunds , so I do n't know if it would be durable if a bigger dog got a hold of it . But I would recommend this product and it is a soft and friendly looking toy .
4 #### I bought this in a hurry , skipping right over the fact that this was a dog toy . :/ I was looking for a small lambchop for my little grandson , and this was an add - on item , so I snatched it up quickly . There are squeakers in the tummy , and in all four feet of the toy . I find the squeakers to be very loud . ( I ended up making a small incision and removing all the squeakers easily enough . ) If your dog is n't startled by loud noises , they will love the squeaking . I honestly do n't know how long it would last for a dog that gets rough with their toys and chews aggressively . It really is made to feel like a typical stuffed animal for a child , which is why I subtracted one star . My dog could have destroyed it within a few days easily , but it would be suitable for a milder - tempered dog that enjoys cuddling with plush toys .
3 #### My dog loves this little guy but we are on our 5th one because it breaks soooo easily .
5 #### " Lammy " is our new puppy 's best friend - really good quality item - stands up to the rigors of puppy play
5 #### Cute ! Does n't have a squeaker , has a noise maker in it . Really gets my dogs attention ! They love it ! !
5 #### My 2 Shih tzu 's love this . Is soft for sleeping on and fun to play with . Squeaks in many places .
5 #### My dogs love this toy ! Of course they love to tear out the stuffing . The nose part of the face and the back feet have a material that is really easy for them to chew through , but I have essentially just sewn those off after they tore it apart too many times ( I can pretty easily sew it in the sewing machine ) . Does n't really look like lamb chops anymore , but they still like it !
5 #### They shredded it pretty fast but had a very very good time . LOL , they chewed and shreded and he said , " ohhhhh Nooooo "
5 #### Perfect ! Our Siberian Shepherd and our Beagle Pointer mix both love this ! I 've bought this toy several times . Well made , soft plush toy .
5 #### dogs favorite toy . the lambchop is his favorite , and has not been ripped open ! great .
3 #### My dogs LOVE this Lamb Chop toy . ( So do I ) . She squeaks , she 's fun to throw and catch , and she 's soft and cuddly too . This toy was their 3rd Lamb Chop . The weakness is in the fabric that constructs that iconic face . It is too easily torn . Maybe if my dogs were not so competitive over the same toy , despite having another identical toy , perhaps this one would have lasted more than 20 hours . If your dog enjoys tugging games or likes to chew , this Lamb Chop will be better suited inside a clear hampster ball than free among the doggie general population .
5 #### i think i have bought 5 of these .. my dogs are crazy over mr Bill !
1 #### Bad ! Lasted one day - could n't even handle a pug !
5 #### We got this plush toy for our grand pup and she absolutely loves it ! Great squeak too ..
3 #### I love it , but Murphy 's rather indifferent . He 's ignored it since I got him the Outward Hound Kyjen PP01529 Hedgehog Dog Toys Grunt Toy , Medium , Brown ( copied and pasted ) .
5 #### My little mut LOVES his lamby lamb chop . It 's now his favorite toy . Well made big / loud squeak in the middle and little squeakers in each foot . It 's perfect
5 #### My 1.5 year old Cavaton finally killed the " OH NO " squeaky and tore a hole in his arm . He played with his old one a lot .. had it since he was little It held up very well . I expect his new Mr. Bill will also . He loves this toy .
5 #### This is the third one I 've purchased over the last eight months . Mr. Bill is my Aussie 's favorite toy . He plays with it until the motor dies , as which point I order a new one . Thus the reason we are on our third one . It 's pretty durable too .
5 #### My dogs love these Lambchop squeaky toys . They carry them around , bring them to me to throw or play tug with . One just loves to sit and squeak it . We have 3 now .
4 #### Our 5 month old puppy went nuts over this toy , but unfortunately it did n't last very long . I sewed the face up several times . Finally decided to remove all the stuffing and squeakers . Now it is a flat toy- and she loves it again !
5 #### Great toy has held up with my chewer . His favorite toy
5 #### My little 6 pound dog loves Lambchops . For some reason she goes for this toy the most .
5 #### My pup loves Lambchop ! Carries it around all the time . Very soft & squeaky . Will have to get another one soon - white toys do n't tend to stay white for long !
5 #### My doggies LOVED this Lamb Chop . The multiple squeakers inside really entertained my 3 year old and one year old dog . But my dogs are competitive with one another , and they do still enjoy chewing , so Lamb Chop did not enjoy a long life . Poor Lamb Chop could not survive the bitter tug of war between the two . I 'd love to buy another one once the puppy settles down a bit . This toy is more suited to dogs that will refrain from chewing the poor toy 's face off .
3 #### 3 stars because my dog love it . I would have given it two . The soundboard broke within 4 days . From the beginning , it felt faulty when you pressed on the plush doll , felt like the parts were n't aligned right . I had to hold him at a weird angel to make him speak . However , I also gifted one to my mothers dog , who loves it as well and the sound board works perfect . I guess i got a faulty one .
2 #### Although cute , the voice box came apart inside ( I can feel it not together anymore ) within 2 mins of my dog playing with it . So it no longer speaks ... Bummer . Would n't buy again because of this
1 #### Very cute toy . I was hoping it would be more durable . It lasted about 15 minutes .
5 #### This toy is a real favorite with my puppy . Her mouth is small so the fact the hooves have squeakers in them make it so much more fun . She really likes to throw herself at it and wrestle it like it 's another puppy .
5 #### Very cute but the dogs destroyed it with in a day .
5 #### My dog loves this toy ! Very soft , and she loves to chew on it .
5 #### We first came across one of these cool " Mr. Bill " dog toys when we were visiting family in another state and their dog had one . We both fell in love with it and , while we do n't have a dog ourselves , we have purchased several of these as gifts . They are so much fun and are honestly the best stuffed doggy toy ever ! Loads of fun for the dog and their humans love it just as much . Of course , it is a stuffed toy so , depending on your dog , you may end up going through a few of them . This will crack up all Mr. Bill fans and probably even those that do not know who Mr. Bill is . Absolutely adorable . " Oh NO ! " It 's Mr. Bill !
5 #### Adorable and so soft ! My dog loves to lay his head on it !
5 #### awesome toy - it is my poochie 's fave toy ( she has Many ) She gave them as gifts to her doggie friends this Christmas and they love them also there is a squeaky in it . Only thing I wish was different is the material on the back feet , is is like a mesh and holes appear there before anywhere else on Lambie Make a great pillow for dogs who like to rest their head on their toys
5 #### Well made plushie for dogs , seams are strong , and wo n't fall apart with simple chewing or carrying . Soft material and easy to squeek . The large Lamp Chop comes with 5 squeekers one in each paw and one in the stomach . My golden retriever loves his " baby " and carries it around the house . If your dog gentle chewer and likes to squeek and shake his toys , this is perfect . If your dog likes to tear at his toys and is very destructive I recommend a Kong .
5 #### Every Christmas we buy our dog a Mr. Bill plush toy . He is a 110 lb . collie mix and , though he loves the plush duck toys , he tears them to stuffing within hours . It 's now 2 weeks into January and Mr. Bill is still kickin . He has lost his nose and done stuffing , but still shrieks his iconic " Oh , nooo ! " Point being , he is well made and stands up longer than other plush toys . Plus he 's hilarious . Will continue to buy Mr. Bill for my pooch .
3 #### My big pup went nuts for this toy when it would say " Oh , noooo " . Unfortunately , she eventually decided it was time to finish him and he was quickly turned into a carcus . When I ordered a new one , the noise - maker was defective . I returned it only to receive another one that was defective . And again . I 'm giving it one more try , Amazon . But it looks as though the whole lot is defective . That 's my reason for only 3 stars . The properly working toy is a definite 5 stars .
5 #### I purchased two of these and gave one to my son my fuzzy grandchildren and then I bought the other for a friend and his fuzzy fur feet doggie . They love this guy . They all found that he talks " OH NO ! " Perfect ! The dogs love squeezing this guy and hearing what he has to say . Maybe not too good for the parents but for the dogs they love playing with this toy .
5 #### MY DOG AND MY SONS DOGS LOVED IT . ITS SUCH A GREAT TOY AND MADE WELL .
4 #### I bought this because of the good reviews . I have never seen Mr. Bill and expected " Ohhh Noooo " to sound like Oh No . I bought 2 Mr. Bills and to me both should like " Oh Say " . My dog loves stuffed squeaky toys and is very gentle with them . She grabbed for Mr. Bill when the mail arrived but when I squeezed him , it frightened her . It has taken several weeks for her to play with Mr. Bill . She is now carrying him to bed . Her doggie friend received his Mr. Bill on Christmas day and loved Mr. Bill . He is the exact opposite of my dog and tears out the squeakers from stuffed toys . He immediately grabbed Mr. Bill and aggressively chewed Mr. Bill being delighted at the sound . When we left 7 hours later , Mr. Bill was still intact and the speaker box though compromised was still saying ohh saaaa . I expect this dog finished off Mr. Bill the next day . Stuffed toys usually last about an hour with him . I like this toy ! He s cute as he can be . I just wish Mr. Bill said , Oh No !
5 #### This is my third one of these dog toys , and that alone should tell you my dogs love it .
5 #### my siberian husky has gone through 10 + of these . he loves them but destroys them ( siberian husky ) . in fact he destroys almost everything . the squeakers last forever though ... have not had one bad squeaker and that 's why the dog loves them because he can squeak them so easily .
4 #### My large silly dog really liked this toy . But if she had decided to use it to chew on , I do n't think it would have last as long .
2 #### Might be okay for some dogs . Mr. Bill said " Oh No " about half a dozen times before he was gutted . I know my dogs are very hard on toys , but this one did n't last five minutes .
2 #### I just had to have one of these after reading the reviews . My dog loved it for the day that it lasted . Was cute but sound box is now broken so did n't really last very long . I 'll let her play with it until it 's too grungy and I toss it .
5 #### this is the second lambchop I 've ordered for my dog . She 's big and crazy and destructive and this lasts fairly well with her trying to surgically remove the queaker . It 's a cute little stuffie .
5 #### Out of all the toys my dogs ( Springer Spaniel and Spinone Italiano ) got for Christmas this is their favorite . Not sure why but the size seems perfect and they must like the feel in their mouth . It does get dirty so I will be giving it a bath soon . We named it Lambie Pie and if we say go get Lambie Pie they both go running .
5 #### Just ordered my 2nd Mr. Bill . Even after she ripped out his voice box , she still plays with him and carries him everywhere . My 10 lb . morkie loves him and so do I ! He makes everyone around laugh . My favorite dog toy yet and we 've had 6 or 7 now .
5 #### The lambchop is a big hit in my house . It has a squeaker in each foot and a big one in the body . They hold up well and is a lot better than I expected for the price . All squeaker toys eventually die in my house so I came back and bought two more for when that happens as I know my pup would be bummed when this one goes in the trash .
5 #### Adorable ! Just like Lamb Chop :) Very well made . A LOT bigger than I thought it would be ; as I bought it for my Snorkie who is 10 pounds ; and it is way too big for her . But , I also have an Australian Shepherd and she loved it ; and she does not like very many toys . So , Patches gives this one 2 paws up !
3 #### Oh noooo . Lol . Cute toy . Hard for my dog to get ahold of though .
5 #### Mr. Bill was a hit with our dogs , the oldest one loves it the best .
3 #### My 16 lb Havanese , Ivy , destroyed it after 10 mins . This toy is is for non - aggressive chewers . R.I.P. Lambchop .
5 #### The cutest stuffed toy . My dog loves this and carries it all over . It 's very soft , she sometimes even uses it as a pillow .
2 #### Very cute toy ! My Min - Pins had this toy tore up within a day ! Has a lot of squeaker which my dogs loved but it did not last the day .
2 #### Lambchop arrived this morning , and my 17 pound puppy had chewed open two of the legs within ten minutes . He had two squeekers out and half the stuffing - within ten minutes ! And I think he ate part of the red foot as there are parts missing and nowhere to be found . And our pup is not an aggressive chewer - all of our other stuffed toys are intact . :( I fear this must not be well made for it to have come apart so easily .
3 #### I love lamb chop so I got this for my dog thinking he 'd have a cute little friend to sing songs with . Instead lamb chop lasted a few days and there was stuffing all over my floor . I know dogs rip these toys up but he found the stitching that still had the stitch string hangoing out and went to town . Lamb chop did n't stand a chance . I expected this toy to last longer especially with my dog since he 's a small puppy and a Pom / jack Russell mix . I was cleaning up fuzz everywhere and not to mention my dog had " fluffy " poo 's for days from eating some of the stuffing as well . I love the toy idea and design but it 's not a dogs toy .
5 #### This is my pet 's favorite toy . Even though he has bitten threw / destroyed several sound boxes , one hangs in there and he continues to enjoy this for over a year now !
5 #### My first golden retriever and my sister 's chocolate lab both thought this was the best stuffed animal ever made !
5 #### This is a very soft toy , which is good because the boxer I got it for likes to mouth soft toys , so for him it was a hit . However , for a dog like his brother who is rough and shakes and pulls on his toys it probably would n't last long . Luckily they do n't usually play with the same toys so I expect the lamb chops will last for awhile .
5 #### " I " LOVE this toy ! However , it is NOT very well made . I Bought it for my kitten to sleep with & he does . He also carries this BIG thing around with him . In fact , I find it in MY bed every couple of days . The face is made out of a knit fabric , that snags & unravels VERY easily . I SUGGEST they find a more substantial fabric for the face . I 've had to repair it so many times , the face is just eyes & mouth & we 've only had it for a month . But .... DANG ! IT IS CUTE ! ! !
3 #### Super cute and soft , but the rear feet are made from a knit that is too easy for dogs to destroy . None of these plush toys last terribly long , but making the feet chenille is just a bad idea .
5 #### My dogs FAVORITE toy . Just wish the noise box was a little sturdier .
1 #### My dog loves the OHH NOO but the toy is poorly made the sounds breaks easily and ca n't be replaced . Not well made and a waste of money .
3 #### Super cute and super soft ... but keep it away from the chewers !
5 #### I love all the Multipet " look who 's talking " toys . So far , the new dog does not . But we 're working on it . ( She 's a rescue and has n't had toys before )
5 #### My dog has one , but she has played with it so much that I had to get her a new one for Christmas .
2 #### Sadly this toy lasted about 2 days with a 3 month old Border Collie before the stuffing was coming out of it and it was put out to pasture ( toy , not the dog ) .
5 #### A squeaker is in each foot and in body . My dog loves it as he enjoys the squeaks ?
5 #### this is so super cute . perfect for the lambchop fan . its super soft and a great value for the price .
3 #### Got this one in the mail too and it want work . So I hope the next one will work .
4 #### My dogs favorite toy . She has about 5 Bills in various stages of decomposition around the house at all times . She absolutely adores her Bills . It would be nice if they were sturdier . She is a relatively gentle , medium sized dog and she can destroy a Bill very quickly . Not for dogs who like to destroy their toys because it 'll be gone in a matter of seconds .
5 #### Pet Lamb Chop Dog toy , My little Llasah Apso 's favorite toy . It 's out second Lamb chop .. Wore out the first . It is so adorable , I will buy another just in case of an ... Emergency ! ! ! !
5 #### The upside is my small dog just loves this toy . The downside is he can take it apart easily . But it is fun with 5 squeeze horns .
5 #### Another great toy from Multipet . We have this for our dogs along with the gefilte fish and dreidel , both of which are favorite play toys . Once out of the box , it did n't take long for them to start trying to steal it away from each other . Mr. Bill only says " Oh NOOOOOOOOOO " , but that 's okay . It 's kind of funny when the fish does its " Oy vey " and then Mr. Bill goes " Oh NOOOOOOOO " . We do take these away when it 's bedtime or else we 'd be awakened whenever one of the dogs rolled over onto the toy . These toys are quite well made and easily make it through several trips in the washing machine . None have started to lose any stuffing or have any sound problems and our three dogs put these toys through some pretty rough play .
4 #### Larger than I expected for the price which is wonderful . Out of the box I wanted to give this 5 stars . But after seeing my puppy playing with it for a day ... Although my puppy absolutely loves this ... Strings are already coming out of it ... Which has never occurred with any other of my puppy 's Kong plush toys ( she has 8 plushes in a variety of sizes ) . Specifically the mouth is now gone . Plus ( not the fault of the product ) to clean loving puppy parents out there keep in mind that although the sheep is suuuuper cute ... White + puppy saliva + dragged across floors = grey + spotty sheep pretty quickly
5 #### This was my puppy 's favorite toy ! Sadly departed after 3 months ( I 'm surprised it lasted that long ... )
5 #### great item for a small dog , darby my carin terrier loves this toy , he says yes yes yes , feel free to buy
4 #### Adorable design my dogs favorite toy was a purple lambchop she carried it everywhere as a puppy . This ones like original lambchop my little Zoey loved it yesterday when i gave it to her then i woke to white fuzz all over my living room . Broke a record fastest destroyed toy for my Zoey she s not very destructive so i would nt suggest for heavychwers cute for the 12 hours it lasted
5 #### I bought this about 3 weeks ago . My two Westies love it . My youngest dog can be toy destructive , but she is taking care of this one . It has even withstood them fighting over it . They were so happy to get it that now it is a regular bed partner .
1 #### The Mr Bill doll is NOT a dog toy . It speaks , says " Oh no " . It contains electronics and batteries that a dog can get to by crewing open the doll . It 's unsafe to give a dog anything that contains electronics and batteries as they 're poison . Spare a emergancy vet trip and skip this unsafe item .
5 #### Nostalgic for me and our dog 's favorite bedtime toy . Lambchop only stays in the bed , not " played " with , only for bedtime cuddles . Sometimes , our dog will chew at the stitching that is the outline of Lambchop 's nose , but overall , very happy with the durability of this toy withstanding an energetic dog .
5 #### My dog usually destroys stuffed squeakers within several hours to maybe a few days within giving it to him . This Lamb Chop toy has survived a whole month with all 5 of the squeakers still squeaking ! I 'm really impressed . It 's very nicely priced in comparison to things I can get at the store too . I highly suggest !
5 #### My German Shepherd absolutely loves these . 5 different squeakers so plenty of fun . Can get them cheaper here as an add on item than in my Supermarket . I order them 3 at a time and only have to throw them out after they get too nasty looking . Very durable .
5 #### Soft soft soft ! And , bigger than expected , especially at this great price . I must have skimmed over then 10 " size in the description because I was thinking I would receive something about 5 - 6 " . The pups will love it .
2 #### We 've had this for about half a day . My puppy played with it for 20 minutes before finding a weak spot and killing the poor monkey . He never even had a chance .
5 #### Very good quality toy . My boys and I love it . My aggressive chewer has not been able to take out the stuffing yet like he does with all of his other toys . I will definitely be buying another when needed .
5 #### adorable , but I think I like it better than Scruffy does ;)
5 #### My dog 's favorite toy ... I have gotten more that I can count ...
5 #### One of her favorite toys . Getting a lot of use .
5 #### love this toy . has held up well and my little pom carries it with her everywhere and sleeps with her head resting on it . when she is angry , she bites the heck out of the squeaky , but still squeaking
5 #### My puppy loves this toy . Comes with 5 squeakers ( one in each foot , and one in the body ) .
5 #### It 's lasted a longer than some of his other toys . My dog LOVES that there is a squeaker in each of the paws and in the middle of the body .
2 #### Took my boxer less than a week to destroy it . I was hoping it would last longer .
4 #### Cute , thought my dog might just chew on it herself , but she 'll only play with it as an interactive toy , and tug of war . Which does n't bother me , as long as she 's happy .
5 #### Arrived quickly and as described . I liked it more than my dogs . They were scared of the voice :)
3 #### Would'nd order this again . It does n't make the " Oh , No " sound . It does make a sound but I do n't think that 's what it is . We ca n't figure it out . Our dog is fine with it but I would not recommend it for the sound . It 's cute though .
5 #### There 's a little squeaker in each foot and larger squeaker in the belly , for a total of 5 squeakers . They 're a good noise level , so not irritatingly loud or anything . Lambchop is very soft and squishy , which my dogs like . The white fabric fur has a neat swirl going on . Lambchop 's eyebrows are a bit uneven but that gives her character . This is a great quality dog toy Amazon offers at a sweet price through the add - on program , so it 's no wonder this is a very popular toy . I do n't really want to have the most popular dog toys since I guess I 'm a hipster , but I 've got some sentimental ties to that little sock lamb so it makes me happy . The same sentiments go for Mr. Bill , though I got him long before and at a grocery store so that makes me cool .
5 #### I put this in a pet lover 's basket at a shelter fundraiser . Cute little lambchop toy . Everyone was eyeing it up !
3 #### Time to lose its face : 2 minutes . Time to lose it 's arms and legs : 4 minutes . Time to lose its guts : 4 minutes . My 60 - pound pit loved lamb chop very much particularly its lips .
5 #### My dogs love anything that squeaks . I have two pups , 11 & 15 pounds , they do n't tear anything up so this toy is still intact . Very well made
5 #### My little dog loves this thing . I will have to order another soon as she is wearing it out .
1 #### Bought it because it was specifically advertised as tough and resistant to being chewed through . My dog had it skinned and unstuffed in less than 5 minutes ... Was n't worth it , returned . Get a better brand .
4 #### It 's cute . Soft only thing If ur dog chews mine had the squeaker out in less than 5 mins
5 #### love it ! Durable and comes out of the wash like new !
5 #### When my puppy spent 8 days in the animal hospital fighting for her life battling parvo a kind soul at the vets office bought her a toy like this . She was in isolation and could have very little human interaction ; this was pretty much her only source of comfort and she cuddled with it . Knowing that everything from isolation would have to be thrown away I bought this so she would always feel comfortable at home . Now , even though she is a thriving and healthy puppy she still loves to cuddle with this toy and she enjoys the 5 different squeakers . She is pretty rough on toys and so far this toy has lasted .
5 #### I love these toys and so do the puppies and dogs . They are standing up well to the attempted disemboweling the pups are trying to do . So far they are still in tact after 5 days !
1 #### Cute fluffy toy . Fqueaker not inserted deeply into stuffing . I have it out as a decoration . Now I 'm buying dog toys without squeakers as most squeakers lie against the fabric . Easy access for a dog
3 #### My dogs did not like this . Picky dogs I guess
5 #### Cute toy and well loved by my dogs and grand dogs , all of whom have rec'd one or 2 over the years . Wo n't withstand tug of war battles but likes to snuggle . The " oh no " can get kind of annoying when the pups get rambunctious with it . That 's when Mr. Bill gets relegated to the top of the refrigerator to take a nap .
5 #### My dogs favorite toy , I ca n't figure out why , but my 100 lb shepherd and my lab mix love this toy , they fight over who gets to play with and they carry it around the house all the time , its too cute . Has held up really well , going to buy another one .....
5 #### My dogs love their Lambchops . So cute . Big enough for two of them to play tug of war . Have had them a couple of months and they still have n't been able to tear them apart .
5 #### The dogs love it and play with it and the others I bought all the time .
1 #### Received this super cute little lamb 5 min ago . Have to my mini weiner dig and she had the squeaker and stuffing ripped out in less than 5 min . Not cool
5 #### I have a new puppy and every time I want to buy her a toy I have to buy 3 - 1 for each of my dogs , even though one of them is n't all that interested - she sure gets interested when I give them to the other dogs . I 've bought A LOT of toys since I got the puppy in April 2015 because she loves them . Even though she 's a little yorkie poo she does a good job of destroying them . Of all the toys I 've bought , this is the one that my golden retriever and my puppy have played with the most , and it has not been destroyed since I bought it in June . For some reason they love this particular toy more than all the other ones , in fact the puppy is playing with it right now . The other toys stay in a pile for the most part , so there 's something special about this one . It was reasonably priced , appears to be well made and I highly recommend it for both little dogs and larger dogs .
5 #### My Cavalier puppy loves this lambie and it came out great in the washer and dryer .
3 #### Good for light chewers . Once my puppy turned five months old and had all of his adult teeth in , the poor toy was destroyed . We even replaced it because up until then it was his favorite . So I would suggest for puppies four months and younger only ! And watch out since the little ears were the first to get ripped off , you 'll want to monitor so he does n't try to swallow the pieces .
4 #### Got this for my APT pup , and she 's a strong chewer , so I did n't expect for this toy to last that much .... and it did n't , just for a couple of days . She 'd cuddle with it , and then she would of course begin to pin lamb chop down and pull at her face . I had to toss it out when I realized that my pup bit a whole in lamb chop 's hand , and chewed out the squeaker . It 's a very cute toy , those that got it as a toy for a person , no shame , I was tempted to buy myself one just for kicks .
4 #### My dog loves her monkey so much , she now needs a new one because this one is in tatters . The only thing of concern to me was the material they used to stuff the toy . I was always watchful that my dog did n't try to eat the stuffing whenever a new tear would appear or seam break . Like I said she LOVES this monkey ! :)
5 #### All I say is , " Where 's Lammi ? " and my dog freaks out looking for his stuffed toy . He loves this soft lamb and spends hours cuddling it , tossing it in the air and chewing it 's feet . Whoever decided to put squeekers in all four paws plus the belly of the lamb was a genius . I do n't expect Lammi to last very long as he 's already missing his tongue , three squeekers have gone silent and his nose is slowly unraveling but for now , it 's my dog 's best friend . Oh and the pics you 'll get of your dog and Lammi are pretty darn cute too .
4 #### It is a bit too big for a toy breed , but my long - haired chihuahua will haul it around sometimes . The smaller version I found has held up well through the tuggings and shakings that my dog has given it .
5 #### My little havi is nuts crazy about her Mr. Bill . After one day of play she figured out how to make him say his famous " Oh Noooooo " . Now we just say " Go get Oh Noooooo " and off she goes to get him . The toy seems very durable . We 've only had it for about 3 weeks and so far my agressive toy destroyer has n't made even a loose thread yet ! This toy was so much cheaper thru Amazon then at the local pet store . If you 're considering purchasing then buy it here at Amazon . Ours arrived in exactly 2 days with Prime .
5 #### Nice dog toy my Puggle loves it and it 's a good size that he wo n't tear it up to quickly ! Plus he loves the squeezes there in the paws and the head and belly !
5 #### My dog loves this thing . It 's his little buddy and usually the first toy he goes for when it 's play time . As far as toughness goes , it 's a dog toy , it 'll get torn apart at some point . After a few days Mr Bill no longer has any lips . After a month or so of throwing it around , the electronic gizmo no longer works .
5 #### This is so cute I hated to give it to my dog ! ! Brought back childhood memories . My dachshund loves it . Has squeakers in each of the feet and in the tummy .
5 #### Great dog toy that my cat plays with also
5 #### I bought a small Lambchop for my puppy ( from a retail store ) . It 's her favorite plush toy and she has not destroyed it yet .
5 #### My puppy loves this toy so much , she wo n't put it down .
1 #### Absolutely terrible . Two minutes with my small pup , and the squeaker inside seems to already be broken . He did n't tear it or anything , the squeaker is just that bad . Wow . Not worth the money , at all .
3 #### Unfortunately the squeaker did n't last more than a day
4 #### Our 55 lb . lab mutt and 7 lb . terrier mutt both love this toy and would both play with this for hours . But our lab loved Lambchop too much and ripped his face off . RIP Lambchop .
5 #### My furry baby 's favorite toy ! ! ! My doberman , Brutus . loves this toy and is always carrying it around . He loves the squeakers and loves his " baby " . He even carries it to bed with him and puts it next to his head to sleep . He loves the squeakers and so do I. They are not obnoxiously loud and are tolerable to listen to for hours at a time . Eventually , the squeakers give out , but only after they have been put through hundreds of squeaks . As with all stuffed toys for animals , they will tear if your dog loves to tear things up . Fortunately , Brutus does not like to tear up his stuffed animals . On the other hand , my other doberman , Sarge , loves to tear up stuffed animals and will shred one of these to pieces in a heartbeat taking all of the stuffing out of the body and the squeakers leaving a lifeless shell of Lambchop in the yard for poor Brutus to find . Even though the squeakers and stuffing may get taken out by Sarge , Brutus still loves it and will carry it around with him even though it wo n't squeak . We call it " raggy baby " and he knows which one we are talking about . I have multiple Lambchops on hand for the times they will need washing , repair , or being sent to doggie toy heaven . These are great toys :)
5 #### My Yorkshire Terrier adores this plush toy ! The first toy lasted a long time , held up to multiple machine washings , and survived surgery many times ( SO had to sew it up ) , but we never expected it to last forever . We are on our second one of these lamb chop toys and we 've ordered an additional for gifting .
1 #### Wished there was a MINUS star option . After reading the reviews , purchased this for my dog who loves toys and has many from the Dollar type stores , still intact . This one however was totally demolished during the time I took a short ladies room break . This has NEVER happened with any other toy . I do n't think a life span of less than three minutes for a toy should be allowed to be sold
5 #### Although this is almost as big as my 10 lbs . chihuahua , she loves it . It is very well made and it makes my dog very happy .
5 #### My puppy loves this toy . Multiple squeakers definitely a plus !
5 #### My border collie loves her Mr. Bill talking toy ! ! It 's so funny when she pushes his belly with her nose and he says , " Oh no ! " The brand is Multipet and this is another winner ! !
5 #### Great toy , my pet loves it ! She has n't stop playing with it since it was delivered .
5 #### My Doberman loves this - cuddles it and wo n't let the " Destroyers " near it . That would be the 4 GSP girls .
5 #### I loved lamb chops as a kid nd my dog loves carrying her around and squeaking her .
5 #### My dogs love this toy ! Have bought more . Keeps them happy and occupied . Highly recommend !
4 #### As plush dog toys go , this one is maybe a little above average , but by no means indestructible . My dog loves it . She loves plush squeaky toys in general but is picky about which ones she wants to play with . This was her favorite before she discovered lambchop . The most important thing to me though is the price because no matter what I buy she will always pick a favorite , and no matter the quality they will eventually be destroyed , bleeding white fluff all over my house . Sock monkey can get a bit too expensive for that .
5 #### Bought several ; dogs absolutely love this product . Some made better than others though . A couple fell apart at the seams within days of purchase while a couple of the others are still being tossed around mercilessly !
5 #### My pup loves it ! He used to carry around a squeaky sock monkey all the time when he was little , but my dad ran over it with the lawn mower . But this one is bigger , sturdier , and he loves it just as much as his old one ! I 'm definitely going to buy from Multipet again in the future !
5 #### Our puppy got Lambchop when we brought her home at 8 weeks old . She is now 4 months and this is her FAVORITE toy . Lambchop is carried , tossed , chewed and loved off and on all day long . Just got a new one as this one is getting dirty and little rips and want to have one when it is time to replace it !
5 #### Lambchop is so cute . My dogs love to play with him .
5 #### My Shih Tzu loves lambchop her original one was left at a relatives so I ordered her another she loves it a lot of squeaking going on lol
2 #### My AmStaff is about 1.5 years old . He liked the toy , but I only purchased it based on other reviews that it would hold up . Nope . Oh no is right . Lasted about 5 minutes .
5 #### Bought for my friend 's 20 pound King Charles Spaniel . He loves it !
5 #### Another of Rover 's favorites . The kids love it also .
5 #### I got this toy for my puppy as a gift 7 months ago . She loves it and sleeps with it in her crate . I bought 2 more here on Amazon because I wanted to give one as a gift to a friends dog and I thought I better get a back up for my pup . I do n't know what it is about it but dogs love this toy ! You ca n't go wrong buying it !
5 #### My dog loves this toy and he would bite and chew it all hours of the night . At first it was alarming to wake up to " ohhh nooooo ! " At 3 am but eventually he loved mr bill to death so he no longer talks .
5 #### I have two of these , and they are great ! I wonder if every one of them has a paw that squeaks different than the other three . Both of mine do . Keeps my dog occupied in the house .
5 #### She love all toys that squeak but this one is the absolute favorite squeaky toy . We have lots of toys for both dogs but this one is special . One of our dogs recently lost her eyesight to glaucoma and she now carries a large toy around to sort of cushion her contact with various things like walls and doors and chair legs etc . etc . I guess it 's her version of a cane . Of all the toys for the dogs Lambchop is softer so I 'm guessing that 's why its her favorite . I will be ordering some extras to put back so she will always have this toy to help her find her way .
5 #### My Bostons LOVE this toy ! Plus , its hilarious when they bite down and play tug of war as Mr Bill screams " oh no ! " LoL very durable and keeps making noise even when being torn to shreds ;)
5 #### this is the dogs favorite toy . one of the few stuffed toys that does not immediately get destroyed .
3 #### My dog is a pretty tough chewer for a Chihuahua and he managed to tear most of Mr. Bill 's head off in about 10 minutes . Do n't get this if your dog is an aggressive chewer .
5 #### The dogs fight over this . They love this for some reason ! It is a favorite toy .
5 #### Probably my dogs favorite toy . I think it reminds her of another puppy .
5 #### My dog 's favorite toy ... but warning that the sound it makes can get on your nerves after a while . I give to my dog in moderation . LOL
5 #### My dog loves her lambchop ! She 's playing with it right now as I write this . We have 3 of them in various conditions . It is her go - to toy . I do n't know what it is that she loves so much but she does ! ! ! Super cute too ! ! !
5 #### Oh No ! We could n't resist this toy . I think more for us than our fur babies . It 's a sturdy dog toy . Recommend .
5 #### This thing is stupid but my dog loves it . It 's the only toy he 'll play with .
3 #### I thought it would talk since it is Multipet . . but it just squeeks ! !
5 #### All of the multipet plush toys are great , my boxers have several but the favorite ones are Mr. Bill and Mr. Magoo . I guess it 's the way they talk the dogs really love them . Mr. Bubbles is great if you have 2 dogs that play tug of war with toys , they each pull on his long arms .
5 #### One of my dog 's favorite toys . He carries it around with him and takes it to bed with him at night .
5 #### I recently bought this lambchop toy at a local pet store . Our puppy has really enjoyed it , and while it ripped across the top within a few weeks it may be just because she has puppy teeth . She does n't play tug with her plush toys very often , but does chew on them a fair amount - no ripping . With the cost and her love for this little lamb , I did n't mind to buy her a new one to prevent the insides from being all over the house . We will keep her none the wiser about destuffing a toy - for now ! I am sure it is coming ! ! I will also be buying the Mr. Bill from the same company as I think she will love that one too !
5 #### Although I thought I ordered the smaller one , my yorkie still loves this toy !
5 #### A Christmas present to our one year old lab / shep and it 's still talking and looks as good as if new ! ( June now ) He 's really good with his plush toys , and this one is holding up just fine and sounds so cute saying " Ohhh nooooo " when the dog bites it . Good sized and well made . This purchase was a win !
5 #### It 's a nice toy ! ! I have 2 small dogs and they really enjoy this toy .
5 #### Silly but I love the little guy . Some days he is right on the money . It is supposed to be a pet toy but my two Pugs have enough of their own .
5 #### I sought this out after a friend told me of having one for her dog years ago . I expected a cheaply made but amusing dog today that would not last long . Instead , this is made of very sturdy materials and is just funny as all get - out . If your dog loves squeaky toys and you like Mr. Bill , you 'll love this little guy .
5 #### Dogs love it , and the " oh , nooooooooooooooooooooooooo " is hysterical . You 'll save $ buying this on Amazon vs in stores . I 've bought this toy for my dogs many times - eventually they 'll break the speaker - but this is affordable to replace .
5 #### my dog cuddles with this toy every night so soft and cute
5 #### My Jack Russell got this toy as a tiny puppy nearly one year ago . Since Jake loves her so much , she has taken quite a chewing in that year . She has had surgery so many times that she now has no face , one hind leg , and no hind feet . But , he still squeaks the 3 remaining squeakers and runs with her all through the house every day ! ! So what am I doing now for his birthday ? ? ? Buying another lamb ! ! ! I think he 'll love it just as much . Oh yes , I have washed it several times with no problems . I love this lamb as much as Jake . Another note : My mother moved in with us and was used to seeing the lamb . When I showed her this picture of the lamb , she exclaimed , " Oh , it was so cute ! I never knew it had a face ! ! " Time for another lamb !
2 #### Unfortunately only lasted 3 days with my pit bull before he decided to tear Mr. Bill up and rip out his voice box with absolutely no effort .
5 #### If you 're a fan of the old Saturday Night Live shows , you 'll be delighted with this dog toy ! My dogs are fascinated when they bite down on him and he says " OHHHHH NOOOOOO ! " The price of Mr. Bill is less than half on Amazon than at the grocery store ( ... and that 's IF your grocery store even carries it ) . I bought one as a keepsake for myself that the dogs will never get !
1 #### Battery was dead ! Never heard a peep out of him ! OH , NO ! Mr. Bill !
5 #### This is our dogs favorite toy ! It 's like his woobie ! He carries it everywhere , snuggles with it , goes to get it if he 's board or frustrated . Very well made toy . We do go thru about one a month or so . He eventually bites three the middle , pulls out the stuffing and " oh nooooooo " box it 's great fun . We keep the voice boxes around to call him . Still in training 8 mo old Golden Retriever ...
4 #### Love Mr. Bill , My lab loves him too . Squeaker is gone , but , that was expected . My Lab goes for all the squeakers . He ca n't get enough of the toy until the squeaker is gone , then , it is put in his stock of dead toys until he feels like playing . When he wants to play , he goes to his basket of dead toys and searches for the dead toy he wants to play with . Mr. Bill is one that he brings out on a regular basis . Mr. Bill is in good condition but his squeaker is a goner ! !
5 #### Oh no ! ! Mr. Bill ! Bought this as a chew toy for our dog , liked it so much I ended up hanging it on my bar instead . Great for old friends who remember Mr. Bill from SNL . I 'm guessing the dog would have liked it but he did n't get a chance to tear it up .
5 #### dog destroyed it in record time . we both had fun killing mr bill . OOOOOO ... NOOOOOOOO ! ! !
5 #### My pup loves his lammy ! ! This is his second one .
5 #### This was a winner but not with the dog ; the grandkids took it !
4 #### He loved it but destroyed it , I liked it more than he did LOL
4 #### We loved this toy , as did our dog . She is a serious chewer , so stuffed toys are n't the best idea for her but this lasted about two weeks before she managed to damage the squeaker ( the " Oh no ! " recording ) and had stuffing coming out of it . I wish it had lasted longer but it was n't really any fault of the company , it 's the dog . She wo n't let go of it , so it was only a matter of time before it wore out . Definitely fun hearing " Oh nooooooo ! " every so often . It 's well made and a great price , too .
5 #### My dog absolutely loves this toy ! it 's the only toy he 's able to squeek on his own , he drags it around everywhere
2 #### Was delivered an hour ago ... Miss Freyja our Akita already has Mr. Bill 's head torn off . It was n't as durable as I was hoping . RIP Mr. Bill .
2 #### The stitching was VERY loose and my tiny 4 lb dog had it ripped apart in only 3 days - not NEAR as durable as most dog toys I buy . Sorry . It was adorable , cute & soft but I was shocked at the poor quality stitching .
5 #### This inexpensive toy is greatly loved by my puppy , Sheba . She cares for it as if this Lambie was her own puppy . The price was great and it arrived quickly for my Sheba .
4 #### We love this dog toy . It screams " Oh NOOOOOOO " when the dog gets it . It does n't last long , but then it is my husband and the dog 's favorite thing . It reminds us ( my husband and me , not the dog ) of our youth watching Saturday Night Live .
5 #### Asia 's favorite toy . Sleeps with it every nite , this was her first toy I got her 2 years ago ! I keep ordering new ones ! ! She refuses to let me throw away any of them . I wish they made the voicebox out of something much stronger
5 #### I have not given to the dogs yet . I want it for myself because I remember " Lamb Chop " on T.V. growing up .
5 #### My pooch loves her " lambmikins . She lays on her back , spread eagle , and just squeaks it and squeaks it and . . . . .
5 #### I have a 9 - month old Hungarian Boxer who weighs 55 lbs and loves to chew on everything she can find . I got this as a handful of random toys on Amazon and had no idea about the sound . After about a week with it , it 's hilarious how much my dog loves this toy ! The " ohhh nooooo ! " makes her jump and start howling at it , then going crazy attacking . Worth every penny already .
1 #### Mr Bill is a really cute toy , but a poor choice for our little power chewer . It lasted less than 3 days .
5 #### My name is Bill and I 'm old enough to remember the SNL Mr. Bill skits . I bought this as a pet toy for my dog and it seems to be here favorite toy . I think she has adopted it , she grooms it and often naps with it , and the occasional unexpected " Oh , no ..... " brings a smile to my face .
5 #### My dog loved the small Lamb Chop Dog Toy and he loved the big one as well .
5 #### Our German SD loves this toy . Us not so much as she squeaks a lot , but it is her favorite toy so much that we had to take away from her for awhile . She has yet to destroy . The only thing that has torn is the ear . Holding up well .
4 #### Buster used to visit Tassajara Veterinary practice every morning ( and in the afternoon too , if he could ) . The staff sometimes brought their dogs to work too and kept them behind the counter . They also kept a lamb chop back there and he was the most prized possession . Buster often tried to steal lamb chop . He often tried to behead lamb chop and we all joked that all the dogs loved lamb chop so much that they wanted to tear his head off . Love dhim to pieces , literally . We moved away ( sad ) . So I bought Buster a lamb chop . Within 10 minutes he tore off lamb chop 's face . The head was gone in another 20 minutes . I wo n't usually give such a good review to toys that can be destroyed in less than an hour . But dogs do love lamb chop .
5 #### My dog loves this toy , and it 's really funny to watch him play with it and listen to Mr Bill say his thing !
5 #### My dogs love lamb chop . She 's pretty durable . I have a mastiff and a boxer who play tug of war with her . The only bad part is the face is vulnerable , and she 'll start to hemorrhage fiber fill . But the dogs love her . She made it through several washer / dryer cycles . Will be purchasing a new one soon .
5 #### Again our dog loves any dog toy that has sound or squeaks . Very durable ! ! ! !
1 #### I ordered one of these before it was about 20 " and my dogs had it for a long time . I went through my history to order it again . It was maybe 8 " and my dogs had it ripped apart in under 30 minutes .
4 #### Got two for my large rescue dogs ( pit bull , lab , pointer , and other mix ) . They both love to carry them around ( after they have performed the squeaker - ectomy ) . Reduced price was a good deal too .
3 #### one of my dogs shredded it and the other dog loved it at first but now is bored with it and leaves it laying ... I think its cute but I am not the one who is suppose to play with it ..
5 #### My 5th one , and we still love it . Worth every penny ! I guess you have to be a child of the 70 's to really appreciate it .
5 #### My dog loves this toy . This is his third one . He usually gets it open . But I remove stuffing and fill with an old socks and sew it up . Lasts longer for playtime fun and I do n't have to worry about my guy chocking on stuffing or squeak things inside it . Get the 6 " if you have a small dog < 15lbs
5 #### My puppy loves his lamb toy . The toy squeaks in all the right places and so far he has n't chewed it to pieces !
5 #### Love this toy . It cracks me up everytime it " squeaks " .
5 #### I 've ordered three of these , now , but it is not due to the quality - or lack thereof - of the product . This lambchop stood up to more abuse from my lab mix puppy than just about any other stuffed toy . The first one had its adorable little face ripped off and an ear pulled off ( retrieved before swallowing , of course ) after a couple weeks of abuse . When it looked like lamby was going to the big dog food factory in the sky , soon , I ordered a second one . For a short while , my pup had two lambies and was in crazy - pup heaven . Then she finally got a seam on the first lambie open so it had to go away . The third lamby is a gift for my in - laws ' dog , so second lamby is still surviving ( barely , but hey ) my girl 's daily abuse . She 's rough on her toys - because she loves them so much - but each generation of this one has survived weeks longer than any other stuffed toys , so far .
5 #### my dog loves this toy and carries it around
2 #### Loved it at first , then the dogs were eating batteries and electronics . Lasted about a week and the sound effects really attracted the dogs and were great amusement to us , but just too dangerous once they ripped it open .
2 #### This toy lasted all of but five minutes . It was very cute , just sad to watch that money go into the garbage .
1 #### Second toy I bought that states made in usa , tag states made in China so not happy ! ! ! !
2 #### Very cute - but my dog chewed it open within about five minutes . Not for dogs who chew .
2 #### The thin , sock mesh on the nose gave out after one day . Total POS .
2 #### Lambchop lost his stuffing early in life . I forgot to read to see if he was stuffing free . RIP Lambchop !
3 #### My puppy loves it but can easily chew it open . It 's stuffed with something I think is bad for her if she ate it . It 's the cutest toy and we 're on out second one . But I have to repair it often .
5 #### Very nice toy . Lambchop is a very cute and dogs love it
3 #### I purchased the sock monkey the beginning of last month . My pug/ jack russell terrier mix loves playing with it . Sadley , he tore off the sock monkey 's face about two weeks ago and now the sock mokey is just a stuffed sock . I 'd give it two stars due to the face coming off but my little guy still plays with it so it gets an extra star .
5 #### Wonderful toy . Although it 's quite large , my Cavalier loves it . Mr. Bill really does say " Oh Nooooooooooo . "
5 #### This is a great dog toy . This is the second one we have had and my puppy loves this more than all of his other toys .
5 #### I had bought the smaller Lamb Chop for my dog at Christmas and the bigger one for a friend 's dog . Well , seems my little dog thinks she 's a big girl and prefers to play with my friend 's dog 's bigger Lamb Chop so I bought her a bigger one . She just loves it . She squeaks it a lot and runs around the house with it in her mouth , tossing it around and having fun .
4 #### this one is okay , does nt hold up great , but i have a doxie
1 #### Hardly a dog toy , it broke the first day and had I realized how big the voice box was i would n't have purchased .
5 #### LOL this product is a screem ! OH NOOOOOOOOOO my dog loves it . Not certain if my dog loves it because it makes the entire family laugh or just likes the toy .
5 #### Mostly de - stuffed in the first afternoon ; but , still one of my black lab 's favorite chew toys .
5 #### The story is so soft and my dog loves little lamb chop
4 #### I think I like it more than my dog does . Of course , I understand the reference and she does n't , but honestly , the noise freaks her out . I guess I 'll have to find another dog to gift this to .
3 #### Dog loved it but killed the talker in the first 10 minutes .
3 #### I 've purchased two Mr. Bills and both have broken speakers . My dog is big lab and he grips his toys in his mouth to play keep away . He does not rip his toys up . The stuffed Bills do hold up in a good game of tug of war . After a year or so they are still in pretty good shape .
1 #### Lasted a very short time ... puppy chewed off the arms , nose and ears within a few hours !
3 #### Oh , no ! Mr. Bill lasted about a day before his squeaker died . Then he lost an arm . This is a cute toy ( for adults ) but not recommended for dogs that love to rip things apart .
5 #### The boy loves his sock monkey . Within five minutes , it 's eyes were gone . That 's a good sign he likes it . I like it because so far that 's all he 's destroyed .
5 #### i know puppy will love this toy once she gets a bit bigger
5 #### Mr. Bill holds a piece of my Heart . When I was younger and there was no such thing as recording TV , we would be glued to SNL to watch Mr. Bill and Sluggo .
5 #### My dog 's favorite toy , well made , love the squeaker , it says o noooo , very funny / cute , my dog carries mr bill all over , it 's like his prize possesion , he will let people look but not touch , sometimes he hides mr bill under the cover on his bed if someone tries to mess with mr bill , best toy ever . Since my dog enjoys mr bill so much I bought another one to give to a friends dog , can you tell I like mr bill too , lots of fun watching my dog being so silly
3 #### Seems nice enough , my dog does n't really like it , though .
4 #### Dogs LOVE LambChop ! ! I bought two of them for the holidays . Right away they were the favorites . One was a lemon and tore , but we have bought many of these and it is definitely rare to find a defect .
2 #### My Shih Tzu loved this toy . UNFORTUNATELY , I searched on " Made in the USA " , this was one of the toys that came up . It was not made in the USA it was made in China . I do n't let her have any toys made in China , so I was disappointed when I noticed the tag after she had played with it .
3 #### This toy was much smaller than I thought . I thought it would be more like a full sized lambshop . Oh well . Our puppy likes it anyway , but it has n't lasted that long since he already tore off an ear and an eye . I would recommend this for a smaller dog ( we have a 3 month old german shepherd puppy but apparently this toy is too easy to rip apart for him ) .
5 #### My puppy loves to pack Lambchop all over the house . Sturdy enough for my Min Schnauzer to wrestle with and not destroy .
5 #### My dog LOVED this toy that is until the other dog in my house got his scent on it , at which point lamb chops was brutally ripped apart . Fast shipping !
3 #### The item is very soft and extremely cute , but found the sewing to be lacking . Within a few days our Yorkie had the one ear off . This maybe a rare thing happening with this one item , but It did disappoint me . I will definitely sew the ear back on because it is so darn cute and worth the effort .
5 #### the little hedgehogs are just small enough where my puppy can always make them squeak , and mister bill - well he 's just the hit of a cat 's meow .
5 #### My dog loves it ! This is the second one I purchased for him and its machine washable .
2 #### " OH NOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! ! " Cute toy , but only lasted a couple of days with our little beagle boy , who 's a champion chewer . He love it ... while it lasted . We had to throw it out once he chewed through the plush and started trying to get to the sound inside . Was great while it lasted , but if your dog loves to rip things apart , do n't waste your money .
5 #### My D.J loves his Lammie Chop , he was raised from two months old with one , he 's carried her wherever he goes;has been his sex toy ( rather than permit humping everything in sight ) wo n't go to bed without toy , constant companion . I decided rather than him lose his joy - toy(the store stopped carrying ) Amazon had them so I purchased 10/ in a lifetime one every 2.5 yrs- he will always have his comfort toy(his Linus blanket)he even has one when he is boarded.he knows her every squeak !
3 #### SOUND STOPPED WORKING THEN DOGS TORE IT UP BY RIPPING OUT THE BACK SEAM :( OH WELL IT LASTED LONGER THAN ONE DAY SO I GUESS I REALLY SHOULDN'T COMPLAIN I SUPPOSE LOL
4 #### My dog loves this toy . He does n't destroy his toys , so this one is still in tact . The noise box is still working , however it did n't work on the day I got it ( weird , I know ) . I think a hard toss knocked the noise box into working order again , hence the 4 stars . It 's pretty comical , and he enjoys the " Ohhh Nooooo ! " sound a lot .
5 #### My dog has never seen Mr. Bill and so far has looked at me like I was crazy ! Mr Bill has the same voice and seems well made . Need to give my dog some time but I imagine I will hear Mr. Bill screaming soon
5 #### Long lasting toy that has continued to yell , " OHHHHH , NOOOOO " for months ! For some reason my dogs to not yank the stuffing out of this toy . They play with them a lot and love the sound ... they just do n't tear it up ... No idea why except maybe it does n't have a " squeaker" ... it 's got a voice box of sorts . So , if your dogs always yank the squeakers out of their toys then you may want to give this guy a try !
2 #### Made it two days with my 10 lb morkie . Now it 's missing it 's arm and the other arm is hanging by a thread . Why do n't they know this and use stronger thread ? Cheap crap . She did love it while it was intact though .
1 #### My dogs would not touch this , despite so many other great reviews . Nothing wrong with it , but they would n't lay a paw on it .
5 #### I bought this for my friend 's Chavalier Spaniel . She loves it ! She has a very gentle nature and natural mothering instincts and she takes this to bed and grooms it . So sweet !
5 #### This toy is my dogs all time favorite toy . This is the 3rd one . It only needs to be replaced because he plays with them so much that eventually they are raggedy , faded and dirty . He is the best dog so he deserves shiny new toys .
3 #### this is pretty flimsy . our 8 lb dog destroyed this in a few days and she is n't that tough or anything .
1 #### This lasted for about 30 min then it stopped working . My dog is extra large tho so I am not shocked , nothing lasts long .
4 #### My beagle loves her lamb chop this is her second one . Unfortunately my dog is a heavy chewer so they do not last her first one lasted a couple of months and her second a day . If my dog was n't a heavy chewer it would last longer
5 #### My dogs seem to really like his voice - I crack up every time I hear them running around with Bill in their mouth - I enjoy this as much as them
5 #### My dogs love it but died the same day .
5 #### My pups love this toy . It has held up well , and I 'm happy it has n't been disemboweled yet .
5 #### My puppy LOVES it ! He plays with his little sheep everyday . Great toy ! !
5 #### ca n't buy enough of these . All my dog owning friends do not want to let their dogs play with this toy~
4 #### Bought one of these for the dog . Boyfriend liked it so much he took it to work and I have n't seen it since . Bought another one for my parents ' dog ( they are fans ) and it 's hilarious . If your dog is a strong chewer it will not hold up but for those that just like something to carry around it 's perfect .
4 #### please supervise your dog if heis a heavy chewer , the voice box is not very dog friendly . My dog loves this toy but he shut him up within a few minutes , once Bill stopped protesting his eyes were removed and his brain was torn out . I took the voice box out and my dog played with Bill untill his head and one hand were removed . His limp body is still a favorite .
5 #### Oh noooooo , Mr. Bill is just plain fun for my dog . He is bright and a nice size .
5 #### Still alive , missing his nose , mouth and a button
5 #### Oh , no Mr. Bill ....... ! Doggie loved it so much !
5 #### This is my dogs favorite toy . Goes everywhere with lamb chop and if he is out of sight watch out .... my dog is on a mission !
5 #### My dog loves this , as do our guests who remember Mr. Bill . Oh no !
2 #### Cute Mr Bill . I purchased this after reading the reviews . Alas my dog will not go near it . It would be great if the seller would let me send it back and get something else . I have never seen her reject a toy
5 #### These are awesome toys . I get them for my dogs , friends dogs ... so funny to hear " Oh nooooo " as your dog runs around with him in their mouths ...
5 #### Who would n't adore this ? My pups and I both do !
5 #### Our puppy 's mother had a Lambchop toy and thought our puppy would like it as well . We were right ! She LOVES this toy . Many hours of fun play time . This toy is made well and wo n't fall apart after a day . We have a small dog ( Bichon Frise ) and she really loves it .
5 #### Just as described . Nice doggy toy for smaller dogs . My dog dystroyed it but he is a chewer and big .
5 #### My dogs all love this toy so much , I 've ordered multiples to give as gifts . Sturdy and nice size for my Briard . Lasts a very long time , but my dogs are not destructive . If your dog rips toys , this is not for you .
3 #### My dog loves it . I did n't realize however that it was made in China . I try NOT to buy things , especially for my dog from there . Wish we would come back to making things here in the US .
5 #### MY DOG LOVES IT AND IT IS VERY TOUGH . MY DOG USUALLY TEARS UP TOYS IN A DAY OR TWO BUT MR BILL IS STILL HERE AFTER LAST CHRISTMAS . YOUR DOG WILL LIKE IT .
3 #### My puppy loves it , but it comes apart and stuffing can come out
2 #### Squeaker broke right away . Stuffing out in less than 10 minutes
1 #### Lasted less than 24 hours before there was a hole in it and the stuffing was pulled out - and this is from our 40 lb Vizsla who is not usually particularly interested in destroying his toys .
5 #### " OH NO MR . BILL " our 4 1/2 month old Rottie loves the doll ! I have had to perform surgery on the hand , but other than that , great soft stuffed animal toy . If he likes a soft toy , he tends not to rip them to shreds !
5 #### Awesome toy , quick shipping , only thing is , My Rat terrier destroyed it in two days ...... LOL , Her MO . Thank you for a great product . LOVED IT !
1 #### I feel this dog toy is extremely poor quality . Black eye lash and tan ear fell off after 2 days of puppy use . Extremely dissatisfied with this " dog toy " . Not durable for our 3 month old puppy .
5 #### Brought this for my pup . But I think its more for me . Very cute .
5 #### Nobody I know is old enuf to remember Mr Bill , this is my dog 's second toy she shredded the first one when a puppy , thank god she 's over that . Monitor puppy play .
5 #### I have no idea what it is about this toy , but my two puppies get into crazy fights over who gets to play with it ! They just ca n't get enough !
5 #### So adorable with squeekers in the tummy and all four paws . My pup loves it .
4 #### This is my dogs favorite toy , ever . I have bought him about 7 because he tears her the heck up . I love this toy though do n't get me wrong . She does last for a a good while before he completely ruins her beyond repair . I usually sew her up and she 's good for more time . But then he gets to the point of death so I buy him back up lambys . This is his girl ! Favorite toy ever .
3 #### Stitching on back fails early , otherwise , a great dog toy
1 #### I have a small Yorkie & it was torn up and the stuffing was coming out in two days . Not worth it poor quality . Do n't waste your money .
5 #### Had to buy a second one because my cocker loved it so much
5 #### I bought 4 different toys and this is the one my German Wire - Haired Pointer loved . OOOOOOOhhhhhhhhh !
5 #### Mr. Bill begs for mercy , my dogs shows him none !
3 #### My dog loves Mr Bill but he breaks up easily . The " Oh No " chant does get annoying after awhile .
5 #### For some reason , these Lamb Chops of all sizes are the ONLY toys my dog will not lose interest in . As soon as he kills the squeakers in one , I got ta get a new one . I 'm a customer for life .
5 #### My dog sister loves lamb chop , this is her third one .. the last one she pulled apart and took out the big squeaker .. she has this one since June so let 's keep our fingers crossed .... they are a reasonable price , so they are easy to replace ..
2 #### My dog loved it , but Mr. Bill stopped saying Ohh noooo after the first day . It 's made by a company called Multipet , but it could n't survive a house with just one :-(
3 #### Average quality dog toy . Got destroyed in a few weeks . But my dog liked it while she had it . Very average .
5 #### Lambie as quickly as she emerged , but hey ! she had a good week - long run at least . She is now a hollow shell of her former self but my dog still likes to drag her around . My dog was a 20 - lb German shepherd mix when she first got Lambie . She loved the squeakers as much as she loved to kill them . She also thought that Lambie 's face needed some " help " . Dogs do n't know how to cherish anything . Tsk tsk * . I must point out that the 10 '' Lambie comes with a knit face that is VERY easy to pull apart with canines . The smallest Lamb 's face is made with a different fabric , which seems to be more durable . No idea on the huge lamb yet , since I have n't seen it in stores .
5 #### Got this as a ' present ' for my roommate 's dog because her old toy was destroyed . Figured it 'd be safe because my own dog is really particular about her toys , and so I 'd only get one . That was a mistake . The instant I pulled the toy out both dogs wee enthralled , and are now engaged in a very long game of hide - and - seek/ keepaway . I 'm pretty positive I will be ordering another monkey in the immediate future . The sock monkey version of this toy is a nice soft plush with that does n't have ' long hair ' or anything - it just feels like , well , a soft cotton sock . It 's a good size and the limbs are different shapes / widths , which is great because that means dogs with any type of muzzle can pick it up and run with it . I highly recommend this to anyone who 's looking for new all purpose puppy toys . We fetch , play tug of war and chase with this toy- it 's brilliant !
5 #### I am so over impressed with Lambchop my dogs are playing with it . But using it more as a body pillow . They just love it to cuddle with
5 #### I have now purchased 4 of these . It is the most beloved dog toy for 2 of my dogs . I ca n't just have one or the other gets insanely jealous . The toy has multiple squeakers which they love and makes the toy last longer . The owner just needs to watch and make sure none of the squeakers are eaten by the dog . But this toy is seriously the best thing ever .
5 #### I got this as a gift for my friends dog(a female standard poodle ) . The dog just loves it . It is holding up great and still squeaks !
5 #### This toy was so much fun ! My dog leaned quickly how to make it say " Oh Noo " and just loved pressing it . The sound did go out after a few weeks , but I think that 's because my dog likes to chew , but he still plays with it and it 's still all together . Great toy ! Would definitely recommend for a pet lovers gift
5 #### I do n't know how this guy is still around and yelling when the pugs have had him for about a month but he is . Very cute . I do n't know if it sends the best kind've message to your dog , but darn cute and durable .
5 #### I did n't buy this toy from Amazon but only because I did n't think to check . I 'll definitely buy another one some day if my puppies ever manage to destroy this guy . He has survived 18 months with my first puppy who is admittedly not horribly destructive with his fetch toys . But the fact that Mr. Bill has survived 10 months with my adopted rescue pup who decapitates and dismembers EVERYTHING she gets her teeth on is just beyond amazing to me . I 'm not sure what it is about this material that makes her not do everything in her power to destroy it , but she LOVES it and chooses it often from her toy box to play fetch and tug with her brother . They ROUGHLY play tug with him several days a week for hours for the last 10 months and all 4 limbs and his head are still firmly attached . Color me impressed !
5 #### Both of my chocolate Labs love this Lamb Chop squeaky toy ! Very cute and reminds me of when I was a child and watched Sheri Lewis and Lamb Chop on TV . I recommend this product .
5 #### My dog loves all things that squeak . This toy is especially entertaining bc when it says " oh no ! " my dog brings it to me to " fix " . It 's funny to watch and the dog has a good time tossing Mr Bill around . It 's surprisingly durable ( it 's still around and it 's been about a month ) . Good fun !
5 #### i bought this for my puppy , but my older dog loved it , too . They have fun playing with this . It is a nice size and pretty durable considering two dogs are chewing on it .
5 #### Loved it stuffed and squeaking and still love it after removing the squeaker and fluff . Hey , they are terriers , it 's their job . Would recommend getting more than one if you have multiple dogs . They will each want their own .
5 #### Great toy for dogs , durable , long lasting battery . Had one for about three years , still works , got one for my sister 's dog .
5 #### seems to be holding up somewhat well after a month with the German Shepard puppy . and who does nt love the humor in it ? ?
4 #### Bought this toy after reading some hilarious reviews and finding out that Mr Bill shouts " Oh nooooooo " when squeezed . My dog loves it . However , the stitching on Mr Bill 's back came off after my dog 's first play with him and this normally does n't happen with her other plush toys . Not too big of an issue as we can sew it back up .
4 #### My dogs love any and all of the talking dolls . The squeaking toys are ok but give them a talking toy and it 's on ! Mr Bill is one of his favorites .
5 #### This is her second Mr. Bill . She loved the first one , but eventually chewed open the back and removed the battery pack . The three button batteries are a definite hazard for pets , so I only let her play with Mr. Bill under supervision .
5 #### Our 2 year old Lab LOVES Mr. Bill . He holds up better than other plush toys and continued to cry Ohhhhhhhhh Nooooooooooo for about 4 months . A few trips to urgent care for stitching kept the stuffing intact in between . He 's lots of fun to throw and play catch with and our Lab never tires of squeaking him to hear him talk . With lots of play , Mr Bill met his demise today , but we definitely got our money 's worth and I 'm ordering another . Highly recommend !
3 #### My husband and I thought this toy was hilarious , our dog thought it was terrifying . Did n't stick around very long ...
4 #### my puppy loves mr.bill but despite all the ' oohhhhhhh , noooooooos ' . mr bill has been hospitilized on several occassions . he recovers , returns to play & is soon back in hospital . we 're were thinking of signing him up for the ACA but it 's just too pricey
5 #### we have 5 dogs and they all LOVE THIS TOY ! ! ! they play with it everyday . we hear poor mr . bill shriek ' oh noooooo ' all throughout the house . they love figuring out how to make it talk . definitely the toy to play with here . it is still working just fine after 5 dogs - will get another one .
5 #### I got Lamb Chop for my Spitz mix because she only likes soft plush toys that fit in her mouth . I did n't realize that it would immediately become one of her all time favorite toys . I would say it 's her second favorite out of a whole basket of toys . The lamb is always present and when she 's playing with it she is n't a 9 year old dog but a pup again . i hope they never stop making this , because I 'm sure I 'll be buying back ups . Great toy and the squeaker is n't too obnoxious either . I ca n't speak for it 's durability because my girl is n't an aggressive chewer , but it has held up to considerable nibbling on the ears and eyelashes .
5 #### We buy this for our Golden Retriever . He carries it around like it 's he 's baby . When he get 's tired of the talking he begins to tear it apart . Mr. Bill just keeps on a talking . We love this toy ...
5 #### My mom has a standard poodle who she got this for two Christmases ago . The poodle lovedddd it ! He still carries it around and it holds up great ! I brought my puppy Rotti over to play one day and sure enough he found it too ! He loved it so much I had to buy him one for home ! They hold up great and the " ooohhh noooo " sound works for a very long time and they LOVE it !
5 #### This is the perfect size for a medium sized dog and so adorable . Our dog loves the squeaking and chewing on the ears . Very durable and a great price .
2 #### Cute idea , but the sound stops working within the first 15 minutes of use . We ordered this twice ( returning each time on the same day it arrived ) for our Boston terrier ( small - medium sized dog).He loved it at first but stopped being interested when there was no sound coming out any longer . The construction seemed well stitched and did n't fall apart during the relatively short period of time our dog played with it .
3 #### Did n't last long . The mouth came off almost immediately . The " Oh no ! ! ! " talker stops as soon as it lands when you toss it . Bought it mostly for nostalgia . Do n't expect much more .
4 #### My 80 lb , one year old , Golden Retriever absolutely loves this toy ! It is his favorite by far . I do not know if it is my dog , or the construction of this toy , but I keep having to re - sew the seams . He does play with it a lot . If this ever bites the dust , I will definitely buy another one !
4 #### My dog loved this toy and so did my friends . It did die a slow and unfortunate death but it lasted long enough for my dog to have some good times . A great retro toy . I may buy one just for me !
5 #### Dog loves it and it does give me flashbacks of " oh no " so far it has held up well so we will see
5 #### Our dogs love this toy . Instead of the usual squeak , when they pick it up it squeals " Oh , Nooooooo ! " They know what to go for when we say , " Go get Mr. Bill ! " Lots of fun .
5 #### Very fast delivery . My dog loves this toy . I love it too . Reminds me of the old Sat . Night Live . Funny !
3 #### My dog really likes this toy but it takes a lot of pressure to activate the sound . So he does n't play with it much .
5 #### We have a chewer in the family so I knew this would n't last long . Fortunately , our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off . Eventually , she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment . However , we did know this is n't a chew toy . The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed . We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his " oh no " cries . If they made a durable version of this I 'd buy in a second .
4 #### I have a one year old lab ( about 50lbs ) who loves chew toys of all kinds . But he tends to shred most soft toys within hours . This one he prefers to carry around with him and toss about rather than sit and chew on . He can not resist the " oh , no ! " sound it makes , and a person squeezing this toy sends him into a frenzy until he manages to get it . I do n't think it would handle a prolonged chewing session any better than other plush toys I 've tried , but given the way my dog plays with this particular toy I would recommend it .
5 #### Very soft and I find the girls , ( poodle doggies ) , often sub them for pillows . They also Love the mulitple squeekers .
5 #### Got this as a kennel mate for my 8 week old puppy she has loved it since the day we got it . The first one lasted about 3 months . It is still in good condition she just has chewed its face ! The squeakers are good and for the most part quiet . There are mini squeakers in each foot and a big one in the middle . My puppy is a Brittany Spaniel every time we buy one she gets very excited ! We will continue to get these for her ! My first lamb was white so I was a little surprised when the second one was bright yellow ; regardless of the color she still loves it ! Highly recommended !
5 #### I ran across Lamb Chop in the grocery , and over three weeks or so my dog has loved it to death ! It is now inside - out with all suffing removed . We found the inside tummy squeaky to be covered by a cloth envelope and sewn to the inside body - definitely a plus for destructive pups ! Now I have to order more , and of course my golden retriever has as much fun tearing up the postage box as he does the toy ! Each of the red feet also have a squeaky inside , and so far they are still intact .
4 #### This is an adorable dog toy , but it 's not very thick material . If you have a dog that likes to chew or tear , this would n't be a good choice . If you 're looking for a plush toy for your dog to squeak or carry around , it would be great .
5 #### This is a durable and soft plush doggie toy - The dogs have a small basket full of toys , but Lambchop is one of their fav 's to pick out of the box and tussle around . Has a couple squeaker 's - so if that drives you crazy you may want to consider something different . Lambchop has also been machine washed and dried in the dryer ( on low temp ) several times and survived just fine . I have even purchased them a replacement for when the old one does bite the dust , they will have another -
2 #### gets torn apart instantaneously , they should make it out of rubber ! having the sound box in there is bad for the dog to chew ....
5 #### Purchased the toy for my dog . It is a very plush feeling toy . He loves it ! Will be purchasing another
5 #### my dog 's favorite toy . I 've heard " OH NOOOO " 4000 times at this point , and it keeps getting funnier every single time . well made too , has n't even ripped yet .
5 #### Our dogs have an obscene amount of toys . I thought that this would be funny to get for them as a joke . Little did I know how much they would love this toy . I have to put it up on a high shelf most of the time . If I even go near it they freak out . They fight over it , they 'll do ANYTHING for it . And they have n't destroyed it yet , which is a plus . I am buying a second one so that hopefully we have less drama in the family .
4 #### My dogs both love the sock monkey . They play with it all the time . I all ready had to sew the arm back on so it really is not that sturdy . My dogs are hard on all the toys they have so I am not surprised .
5 #### Great toy that yells " Oh no " when squeezed . We 're not sure who enjoys it more , us or our dog ! Great toy at a reasonable price .
4 #### This toy is one of my Standard Poodle 's favorites . She loves Mr. Bill and his mournful , " oh no . " She likes to carry Bill around and make him talk to her . It is well made and a good toy for SNL lovers .
5 #### Dogs really take to this dog toy , and anyone from the days when Saturday Night Live was new will remember Mr. Bill saying " Oh no ! " whenever Sluggo was being mean . The toy says that when squeezed in the middle . Fun and well made !
5 #### This toy is carried around by our rescue Jack Russell and has not been ripped to pieces , we like to think it is because he thinks of it as a human and loves it . He has many because humans are not supposed to keep saying Oh No as it get on anyone 's nerves even a dog .
5 #### My dog is used to the usual squeak of his toys . So when he picks up Mr. Bill in his mouth and hears " OH NOOOOOOOO ! " he quickly drops it and starts growling at it and then chomps on it again . Round and round it goes . It 's hilarious . Also , Mr. Bill has lasted a lot longer than most stuffed toys . I mean , he 's lost some of his fluff , but usually my dog would have done in a toy like him by now .
5 #### My granddog approved . Good service . lots of fun for all watching and playing with our sweet pup was great fun .
5 #### So this is now the 4th Mr. Bill in the last 6 years . I think my dog has torn up 1 after about 1 year of having it and the other 2 have been killed via circumstances beyond my dog 's control ( one was mistakenly left outside and peed on ... repeatedly , and the other was left at a coffee shop ( but I think someone stole it ) . When I pulled Mr. Bill out of the box , my dog 's face lit up like it was the best day ever and he carried it around crying and wiggling and making Mr. Bill say " OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO " . Its entertaining for the dog and definitely for us ( we like to ask him questions and then hear Mr. Bill say " OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO " ) . He takes Mr. Bill to bed with him every night along with his teddy bear and spiderman ball and Mr. Bill has to go everywhere with us ... along with his teddy bear and spiderman ball ( the dog is n't spoiled at all ) . As long as Mr. Bill can be purchased , there will be one in the house .
5 #### My sons mini schnauzer loves this particular toy . The price can not be beat . The shipping as always was very fast .
3 #### Our maltipoo and our parents ' cairn terrier were not that amused by the toy . It is pretty big and hard from the internal parts that make it make sound . The sound it makes is really loud . It was so thick and hard that I do n't think the 18 - lb - ish dogs could even pick it up . I think it would be great for a larger dog , like a golden retriever or airedale .
4 #### Bully grand puppy was a little leery of Mr. Bill at first but now loves him . Great toy . Keeps him around her bed !
5 #### Mr. Bill is a toy for my dog , and when you push his stomach he go " Ooooooooooooo Noooooooooooooooooo ! My dog ca n't quite figure out of he 's hurting it , or what , but my dog had her ears all perked up , trying to figure it out ! ! ! It is cute watching her play with it .
5 #### Blast from the past . Great memories as my dog abuses Mr. Bill . Oh noooooooo . It really sounds like Mr. Bill .
2 #### Poor Mr. Monkey . He arrived at 8 this morning and was loved by all , especially my 5 month old min pin puppy . By 9 , poor Mr. Monkey had lost an eyebrow and one eye ; the other hung dangerously close to his chin . Shortly afterward , the other eyebrow , eye and one nostril became an early morning snack for Barney . At 10:15 , Mr. Monkey lost his nose and began leaking stuffing . Shortly afterward , Mr. Monkey went to his final resting place - the trash can . Barney absolutely loved this toy and it was n't out of his sight for the 2.5 hours we had it , so needless to say , I was very disappointed . I do n't know if the issue is poor quality or sharp puppy teeth . But either way , I ca n't recommend Mr. Monkey to owners with actively chewing dogs .
1 #### I was very disappointed . I ordered Pokey , Gumby and Mr. Bill and returned them all . They were made in China . I do not recommend .
5 #### I love my , " Oh no Mr. Bill " dog toy , and will be buying one to bring into the office . My dog likes it a great deal , and all of my friends do too . I would definitely buy this again , and the Amazon price ca n't be beat !
5 #### Bought this to replace the one that our dog has totally destroyed . I love the " Oh Noooooooo " sound and so does the dog .
5 #### This is a very cute little Lambchop doll . I bought 3 of them for my little dogs ' Christmas presents . These dog toys seem to be fairly tough and they 're very cute . A nice gift for your pup .
5 #### my sister 's dog is IN LOVE with Mr. Bill . i 've given her at least 3 or 4 since she was a puppy ( 7 now ) and she adores this little guy . fun , inexpensive , adorable toy .
5 #### This was one of my boxer 's first toys . I think she loved it , although she would get concerned for Mr. Bill when he screams " OH no ! " . She would protect him and hide him from my other dogs . It was pretty durable and the sound box lasted a long time .
5 #### I bought this for my one - year old Chocolate lab mix and she loves it ! When you squeeze it hard enough , he screams , " Oh No ! " and I laugh every time . She did bring in my bedroom at 2AM and squeeze it and it scared the daylights out of me , but other than that , it 's a great toy . My dog does n't chew toys apart so it 's held up well for us .
5 #### Too cute ! Takes me back .... I HAD to purchase it as soon as I saw it . I bought it for my dog b / c I knew she 'd rip it to shreds and Mr. Bill would cry out at the same time . What a riot ! ! ! My dog is a lab and would gently carry Mr. Bill around in her jowls . When she 'd bite down , Mr. Bill cried out - cracks me up . She played tug - o - war with it with my sister 's dog , too . Within a short period of time , Mr. Bill was sadly torn to shreds , but it was fun while he lasted !
1 #### Do n't bother . My chocolate lab tore this thing open within an hour and had the stuffing everywhere .. What a waste of money .
5 #### This particular Lambchop Toy is very well made , had a good loud squeaker in it , but most importantly is soft and comforting to my " big baby " , a 75 pound Labrador Retriever ! ! He had a smaller sized one about two years ago , and he loved it to death by sleeping on it , carrying it in his mouth , regular tooth pulling play time , and we finally had to retire the scraps of what was left ( when he was not looking , of course .... ) . He looked for Lambchop for awhile , but he gave up . I was so discouraged that I could n't find one ANYWHERE . THEN , I was so pleased to see a new and BIGGER one on Amazon ! ! The Price was outstanding , and my Labrador and his Lambchop are back to being cuddle buddies again . This is a great dog toy . I highly recommend it .
1 #### We had a Mr. Bill toy , purchased locally , for over a year and it worked perfectly until someone ripped a hole in him and I took it away . Got my new Mr. Bill from Amazon today and within 30 seconds the talk box stopped working . Going to have to look for one locally that 's not already broken .
5 #### Cute toy . Be careful as the stuffing will come out and your young puppy may choke on it . My puppy will just spit it out and not actually eat it . He loves carrying / attacking Mr. Bill though .
4 #### So , do n't expect it to be a toy they 'll love for years . It was cute while it lasted , and drove the dog nuts until she destroyed it . She can be very focused . And , is n't that really the point ?
5 #### My dog loves this toy Lambchop . He walks around with it in his mouth . He has plenty of toys but this by far is the favorite .
5 #### My two - year - old Doberman never tires of Mr. Bill . He constantly carries the doll around and pacifies on its head when he is settling down for a nap . The doll machine washes nicely but you will find after a couple of washings ( sometimes just one washing ) , the voice box no longer functions . In this case , it does n't matter as Mr. Bill is more companion than toy . We bought the neighbor 's dog one and she carries it around as well . I 've lost count of how many I 've purchased from Amazon but have found it is the least expensive place to buy it , especially if you are a PRIME member and do n't have to purchase $ 25 of merchandise to get free shipping .
5 #### Yep , this is a keeper ! It has held up well with my 2 yr . old cockapoo puppy ! I think he 's one of her favorites . . . It 's a must have ! !
4 #### So , Mr. Bill is not the sturdiest of dog toys , but he 's hilarious . It 's a great toy to give the dog when we have company over , because his ' Oh Nooooooooooo ' squeaker makes everyone laugh . Our pitbull / rotweiller beheaded Mr. Bill in a few days , but the squeaker has survived , and our dog is terrified of it . If he 's doing something naughty , we pull out Mr. Bill 's squeaker , and the " Oh Noooooooo ! " stops him in his tracks . Worth the money , for sheer entertainment value .
5 #### I originally purchased just one of these , but after my other dog saw it ( she almost never plays with toys , while the other loves toys ) I knew that i was going to have to order another ! They have lasted a pretty good time considering my dog usually tears through " heavy dog toys " in about a week !
3 #### This is one of my dogs favorite toys but I 've bought two of these so far and the first one is in better shape then this one . Great toy , wish the construction was as good as the first one
2 #### My dog , who is normally very gentle with all her toys , managed to remove one of the monkey 's arms within 15 minutes . There is no indication on either the monkey or the arm that it was removed - no tear , no pulled stitches , no stuffing - nothing . It must have been sewn on with a couple of stitches , and it did n't take much effort to remove the arm .
5 #### I recently got a puppy who is chewing on everything , except most of the puppy toys . This is one of the exceptions . He loves it . His two favorite things are his Mr. Bill doll and his bully stick . Both of them are holding up well . If I activate the " Oh , noooooo " sound , he pounces on it and jumps around . If he activates it in his mouth , he does a demonstration of the shaken baby syndrome and runs around the house . I am amazed at the abuse this toy has taken . If he ever destroys it , I will be getting him another . As to the reviewer who bought it for his brother , not realizing it was a dog toy , I am sure any fan of Mr. Bill ( and maybe even those who have never heard of Mr. Bill ) would love to have this doll . Update : Wow ! I just purchased my fifth Mr. Bill doll and Malmo was just as excited as ever when it came out of the box . He 's a more aggressive chewer than when we bought the first doll , so I do n't know how long it will last before the stuffing comes out . But who can deny your baby his favorite doll .
5 #### A great talking toy featuring the famous " Oh nooooo ! " Our dog loves it and it 's hilarious to see her reaction to the sound it makes when she squeezes it . Priceless ! One of our dog 's favorite toys !
5 #### We actually keep one on back - up at all times , in order to ensure no lap in coverage , lol ! I have two little Boston 's , and it takes them a good 2 - 3 months to fully tear apart .
3 #### I thought this was a really cute idea , but did n't realize that there was a hard plastic mechanism inside to make it say , " Oh noooo ! " Had I known that I would n't have bought it because my dog cracks those mechanisms right away . It would probably be a fun toy for a dog with a different temperament .
5 #### We 've had this thing for years ( 2 anyway ) and where our terrier will destroy 99 % of her toys , for some reason she treats her " Mr. Bill " doll with love . I love the ridiculous Mr. Bill yelp - ohhh , noooooo ... Some times it drives the husband batty and he 'll put it on top of the fridge for a few days . Wait . Maybe THAT 's why we still have it ?
5 #### This toy is just great ! I originally bought one from Target ( on sale for about $ 2.00 ) and my dog just feel in love w/ this him . He was playing with him , sleeping with him and he has to have Mr. Bill next to him at all times for next few days ... Then somehow , we lost him .... so I had to buy him another Mr. Bill ! He still loves to play with him and I think the sound he makes is just great ! :) Totally recommend this product to any dog owners .. My dog is a 15 lb maltipoo btw
3 #### This toy is okay but not for a real rough housing pet . Becareful to watch you dog with this toy because they will tear off a leg and stuffing will come out .
5 #### My 70 pound Lab loves this toy ! She is a bit scared , but still interested enough to play with it . She is a chewer so I had to cut off the nose because she was trying to eat it , but other than that she has not chewed the toy up . She got one for Christmas and accidentally broke it when I threw it and she caught it and her tooth hit the box that makes the noise . I ordered 2 more for her . This is her favorite toy and it is durable .
5 #### Where do I begin ? Let 's say the materials used on this toy are 100 % perfect . My Boston Terrier tries to rip this guy apart but to no avail . My dog loves to make Mr. Bill scream , " Oh Noooooooo ! " over and over again much to my chagrin . I think he thinks it 's a real person . Your dog will enjoy hours of fun with mr . bill . In fact , I 've order over 15 of these nthe past year ! ! ! We leave the at my relatives houses for my dog so he has something to play with when we visit . Not to mention I give these as gifts to all my friends with pooches . Hysterical ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Our 2 golden retrievers LOVE Mr. Bill . They 've had him since Christmas and he 's still going strong . Yesterday I was finally grossed out enough ( dog drool all over Mr Bill ) to finally put him in the washer . Amazingly he looks good as new and still says " oh no " .
5 #### Kira loves her Mr. Bill plush toy . She had one once before and played with him all of the time . We had a large dog visitor that crushed him , so he could no longer talk . Kira would bring him to me like " Mom , he does n't talk anymore ... fix him ! "
5 #### THe large dog , Dixie , LOVES Mr. Bill . This toy is not for an aggressive dog . Mr. Bill is a good companion for Lambchops .
5 #### Our two Schnauzers love this toy . As with most toys , if they last six months , I 'm happy . It 's been about six months and Mr. Bill is going strong . Our Schnauzers are pretty smart . They know their toys names and will retrieved them when called . This one is called " Oh No ! " , what Mr Bill calls out . As soon as we say OH NO ! they are searching for Mr Bill . When we travel , Mr Bill is one of the toys that they look for in their travel bag . It has been a lot of fun for the dogs and for us too .
4 #### Our new puppy loves this toy , and he 's well on his way to ripping its leg off . It 's not going to last long-- it 's not really made to survive a puppy who 's bent on destruction-- but he really likes it . It 's a good size for him , easy to carry around . But when he hits the sound button inside it and Mr Bill goes " Oh nooooooooooo , " it really freaks him out . Every time that goes off , he cries and runs away for a second . I wonder if the " noooooooooo " sounds a bit like a dog howl to him ? I 've also noticed that the cat comes running into the room when the " oh no " goes off-- he 's fascinated with the sound .
4 #### What 's not to like ? Says " oh no " when you squeeze it . Confuses the dogs when they make it speak , and annoys my wife when I squeeze it over and over . Quality is pretty good , has outlasted many other toys .
5 #### I bought these for a friend because her pup loves these things and he needed backups . My friend told me that I got all three for * LESS * than what she paid at the local ( big name ) pet supply store . Ca n't go wrong on this if your pup loves the Lambchop .
4 #### Very well made , good quality toy . Our pup loves it , but let me warn you that if your dog is a chewer you 'll be dealing with the " oh no " sound for quite a while . I 'm finding I tend to hide this one from her if I 'm concentrating on t.v . or work . But it 's a very funny flashback to a character I used to love .
5 #### I thought Mr Bill was designed to attract people , but it turns out he 's our two dogs ' favorite toy ! They 're working on dismantling and disemboweling him , but surprisingly enough he 's lasting longer than any of their other toys . We just ordered a spare for the day the original turns to scrap , and when the dogs heard the " Oh , No ! " when we unwrapped him , they came running , and we had to hide him for that future day !
5 #### There 's nothing about this toy our dog does n't like ! He 's a 110 pound German Shepard and he loves to nibble on Mr. Bill and make him " talk " . There is nothing on this toy however that he could possibly nibble off and choke on . He knows just where the mechanism is to make the toy say , " Oh noooooooo ! " and we hear is frequently ! ! ! We 've had it for about a month and have no complaints , Mr. Bill still looks almost new and that 's with daily play . Great product and I would say if your dog likes toys this is a fun one to add to the box .
5 #### My puppies love these sock monkeys , and I am pleasantly surprised at how well they hold up to aggressive play .
3 #### Our dogs are very strong chewers , but are not intentionally destructive . This Lamb Chop toy is their absolute favorite , though they do n't last very long . The squeakers last about 20 minutes , 30 tops , and the feet are chewed through in less than a day ( you have to remove the remnants of the plastic squeakers so they do n't eat them ) , but the dogs still love them and sleep with them like a comfort blanket . I always have an army of Lamb Chops on hand . Definitely recommend , but do n't expect durability .
3 #### My puppy just really is not into this toy . I do think it was alittle pricey as well . He generally loves any toys that sing or talk but for some reason he has zero interest in this one . Bummer ....
5 #### Mr Bill says " oh noooooo " when the dogs put him in their mouths . They love him . I put all their toys away and he 's back out every day .
5 #### We got this because we thought it was funny -- we remember Mr. Bill . Our dog took to it right away . She is easy on toys so she has had it since Christmas .
5 #### my pooch LOVES this toy . He is used to squeaky toys , so the " ooooooh noooooo " sound effect is a nice change , and it seems to intrigue him . I 'm glad he likes it because it makes us laugh to see Mr. Bill being chewed on and tossed around just like the good old days of SNL
5 #### Snarfie loves this thing . The Oh No sound freaks him out and he pounces on poor Mr. Bill . The toy is actually holding up well . Unlike the squeaker toys that go silient after about a week we 've had this since Christmas and Mr. Bill is still bitchin ' about his circumstances .
5 #### This is now the 4th Lambchop we have purchased . Our pug plays , tugs and sleeps with his lamb chop . The first few were eventually worn out when our pug was a wild chewing puppy .
4 #### Not the " Ohhhhhh noooooooo ! " again ! This toy gets to be very annoying because that 's all it says but it 's fun to see the look on the dog 's face when Mr. Bill says it . This toy is not for destructive breeds or if the dog does n't use the soft mouth . The box inside breaks if dog chews on it alone . It has stuffing in it but if you want and know how to , you just sew it back up . It 's a fun toy but easy to break . This was the 3rd toy I 've bought for the dog . She likes the " Ohhhh noooo ! ! ! "
5 #### Love this toy ! Sturdy construction . Bought it just because we loved the character back in the old days on Saturday Night Live . Brings back lots of fun memories !
5 #### Very well Made , it is my dog Cooper 's favorite toy . Yes , I recommend this Company and their product . M / B Rio Vista Ca
5 #### Our shih - tzu loves it , made by the same company that makes deedle dudes . I knew we could n't go wrong . We are always looking for dog toys that do n't have squeakers inside because he will have it chewed up within minutes to get that squeaker out . With the voicebox that says OHHHHH NOOOOOOO our dog still loves it but he takes care of it instead of ripping it open .
5 #### Arrived on time and as described . When you squeeze it 's stomach it yells " Ohhhh Nooooooo ! " sounding just like the real character !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R25JSZ5A17IE0 K " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1LF9Hp8GaS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71zSAXnaMNS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;My wife bought the Mr. Bill doggie toy for our dogs for Christmas . As you can see in the video they love to play with this guy . Every time they bite his stomach Mr. Bill says " oh .... No .... " This toy comes highly recommended and gets a 5 paw rating from both Krebs and Dover !
1 #### I remember the high pitched , " Oh no , Mr. Bill " famous phrase . This does n't sound like him ; it did n't smell right to me ; and my 27 lbs mini golden gutted him in less than five minutes . I had big fiber looking cotton balls all over the floor in minutes . Cute for ... nothing . Save your funds and buy some bones . I do NOT recommend for dogs with teeth .
5 #### Very durable . I remember back in the 60 's watching this show . My poodle loves this toy the most and sleeps with it . This was my second puchase of this product . Too cute .
5 #### We had to laugh when we seen this and could not wait to get for our friends dog . We all had a good laugh but its a little hard to understand him .
5 #### My dog is an 80 lb . mixed breed who just loves to pull the stuffing out of any and every toy . Mr. Bill far outlasted any thing with a squeaker in it because of his speaking box . When the dog started getting a little rough , the " Ohhhhhh Nooooooo ! ! ! " would make him stop . Ahhhh , but it was not to be . Mr. Dog conquered Mr. Bill , but it took him over 2 months to slowly and painfully , bit by tiny bit , get the stuffing out -- first at the nose , then slowly , hour by hour , day by day , then entire head was emptied , and VIOLA ... 2 months later Mr. Bill no longer had a voice ... alll bets were off , he is now nothing but the shell of the toy he used to be . But he 's still good to play tug of war with . I already got Mr. Dog another one but I 'm saving it for Christmas .
5 #### My 20 month old German Shepherd shredded Mr. Bill in less than two weeks . Oh ! He loved the toy and always kept him close , even sleeping with him . However , for a reason known only to " Igor " , he got carried away one day and shredded Mr. Bill into microscopic pieces . I managed to salvage the voice box , but Mr. Bill has no body now to go with his voice . However , since Mr. Bill was a favorite and is reasonably priced , I have ordered Igor yet another one for his Xmas stocking .
5 #### I got this for the dog that rescued us , knowing that he is excellent at unstuffing everything he can carry . But , " Mr. Bill " has always meant something in this household , so I got it . Many , many , many weeks later , I have only had to put a couple of stitches in Mr. Bill 's armpits . We still hear " Oh Nooooo . . . " during the night when Judah picks him up and puts him back where he belongs . This many be the best made toy we have ever bought . So , I bought more .
5 #### Lambchop is by far our dogs ' favorite toy - I ended up buying three so I can be sure to have one when they get a little too dirty . That 's the only drawback - it 's white so it gets filthy relatively quickly . Still , the joy this brings our fluffy friends is well worth it !
5 #### this is a great dog toy , holds up well - however , I will pass on something that makes it even better . Clip the eyes down even with the rest of the face or the dog will pull on those and rip the material . This was my second one and I clipped the eyes and it is still going strong .
5 #### Our little dogs have pointy little teeth that make short work of many such toys . This one has held up for months , and they love it . Of course , we 've had to hear " Ohhh Nooooo ! " hundreds , if not thousands of times . But it makes them happy . When it finally dies , we 'll get another one .
1 #### My 13 pound , 1 year old small dog ripped the tail , arm , ear and eye off of the Sock Monkey in the first 10 minutes it was out of the package ! This is the most poorly constructed dog toy I have ever purchased . With how easily it is destroyed , it also may pose a real danger to dogs who play with it unattended and swallow pieces .
5 #### Seriously . She was my Maltese puppy 's first stuffed plush toy and is his favorite . I got Lambchop because I thought she might remind him of his litter mates and he has loved her from the very beginning . If you see him without Lambchop in sight , all you have to do is ask him where Lambchop is and he will go running to find and bring her back . Lambchop is very well made . She has to be to withstand the daily tumbles she has to endure with the puppy . Not one seam has come loose , nothing except she 's beginning to look pretty grungy and I 'm not so sure about touching her any more without washing my hands afterward . I 've ordered some stuffed animal cleaner and sure hopes it works . And , uh , this is kinda sensitive and I 'm not sure the pup would want me to share , but I think it 's time to call the vet .
5 #### My rescue dog absolutely loves this toy . She will carry it around the house , and generally uses it as a pillow when sleeping . By far her favorite toy out of the multiple toys we 've given her . :)
5 #### Purchased this for my English Bulldog . She loved hearing it say " Oh No " . But bring a puppy , she tore him up within a few days . I have purchased four of these for her . They last a little while but not much of a match for a bulldog . Definitely a cute toy .
5 #### I have a 4 - mo - old border collie mix , and she loves this doll . It 's solidly built , and can withstand quite a bit of tug - of - war . I do n't think that an adult German shepherd or pitbull mix would have any trouble destroying it in minutes , but my dog is generally rather nice to her toys , so that 's not much of a concern . That said , I own a number of stuffed dog toys , and this one feels better - made than pretty much any of them . The soundbox is located in the upper chest , and the trigger is a little finicky ... You have to squeeze it in just the right way to make it go off . Which would normally be a problem , but considering the loudness of the " OH NOOOO ! " , I 'm not complaining that it ca n't go off every 10 seconds ;) . I 'm nearing age 30 , and the Mr. Bill sketches on SNL were some of my favorites as a kid . Makes me realize how long ago the 80 's were though , considering the fact that many of my friends have NO idea where the Mr. Bill character comes from . Oh well ! Even if I did n't have a dog , I 'd probably still like this for the novelty factor :)
5 #### My little Chug just loves his sock monkey ! i had to get a replacement after she chewed the first one up .
3 #### I bought Mr. Bill and Lamb Chop for my 18 month old , 11 lb Shih Tzu . She spent a few minutes playing with Mr. Bill and making him say Ohhh nooooo ! ! , but the real star was Lamb Chop . She absolutely loved Lamb Chop from the minute I gave it to her . Unfortunately , she managed to rip apart Lamb Chop 's back in under 15 minutes . I had to take out all the stuffing and sew the rip back up . I 'm disappointed because she really loves it , but it 's a very poorly made dog toy . We 'll see if Mr Bill fares any better !
5 #### I got this for my dogs but I 'm keeping it for myself ! ! It is sooo cute and when you squeeze it the sound is perfect ! !
5 #### This may be the best of all the Mutipet toys ! Previously gave great reviews of others , but this one never stops ! They bite it , step on it , sit on it and hide it from each other . It always gives itself away tho with its " OOOOONNNOOOOOO ! ! ! ! " I keep 2 around here and have given several to friends . I think it 's particularly popular with those of us who remember Mr Bill , but it sure translates to the dogs ! While these are really durable for us I do n't think real chewers will take long to dismantle this . My guys are over 80lbs bot do n't chew or pull things apart .
3 #### Got this along with a few other toys a few weeks ago . This was clearly my dog 's last choice . In fact , I did n't think he 'd play with it at all . Eventually he started messing with it , so I was pretty thrilled . Of course , after a few days , he 'd ripped some of the limbs open and stuffing was coming out . Overall , not one of his favorite toys , and does n't seem very durable . The only squeaker in this thing is right in his stomach and it 's hard to get to . I 'm not even sure my dog even figured out it was in there , heck , I had trouble getting it . Get something else . Nothing special about sock monkey .
5 #### someone dumped a blind dog here and i was at my wits end ... he LOVES this toy ! ! ! ! And I Do n't mind Mister Bill 's " Ohhhhhhh noooooo ! ! ' it 's always funny every time LOL thank you for this ! Ordering another just in case ... but it sure seems VERY durable even for an Anatolian Shepard ... teeth like a tazmanian devil . He broke it with his massive teeth within an hour ... he is too smart and can figure out where rattle / noisemakers are and -purposely- broke it . That 's ok , I ordered another . It was worth the price for his entertainment ! But it would be nice if they could build a super durable chip / box that can stand up to a lot of hard chewing with big , gnarly teeth .
5 #### I would never have order this dog toy- but after reading the reviews I thought I would try Mr Bill . He was an instant hit . I do n't know why . My puppy has tons of toys , but loves Mr Bill .
5 #### Mr. little 8 month old female puppy loves this toy best of all . It 's unique " oh noooo " sound is activated by pushing a spot on the tummy area and whenever she hears that she comes running ready to play . A couple of times lately she has accidentally made its " voice " go off too which she seemed to like also . It 's good to throw holding by one arm so it does " cartwheels " . I have two dogs actually , both under 10 pounds , and sometimes the two of them both grab and arm and play tug of war after I throw it which is fun too . It 's holding up very well but nonetheless I 'm getting another because she likes it so much and I do n't want to be left empty - handed if the other one quits working or if it just gets too dirty . Me and my two dogs give it a definite thumbs up .
2 #### Our dog loves Mr. Bill and takes him everywhere , but the voice box only lasts for an hour . I 've gone through three of these in a week and am waiting for the fourth hoping this is the one . I 'm not holding my breath . The good thing is that Amazon keeps taking them back and sending new ones via 2 day shipping .
4 #### Little did I know when I bought&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mr - Bill / dp / B002P9KOWI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mr . Bill</a > , that when chewed , he cries out " Oh nooooooo ! " just like his SNL tv namesake ! Lady , my black lab absolutely loves this toy . When we gave her Mr. Bill two months ago , she forgot about her other toys for almost a month . She has started playing with her other toys again , but this is still her favorite . The only drawback is , because of the " Mr. Bill " sound - maker , it can only be surface - washed . This is Lady 's only toy that ca n't be tossed in the washer and dryer , but it 's worth it to see my Lady with this toy . I 'm going to buy a few more , just to have on hand , in case Mr. Bill gets too dirty to surface wash . I only wish they had a Mr. Hand dog toy to go with this . ;-)
5 #### Auggie , our 75 lb . rodesian ridgeback , part hound dog , just loves this toy . This is his second one , and I have another in reserve , just in csse he kills this one . He just loves when Mr. Bill " talks " . He takes him to bed at night .
5 #### My dog got this toy as a birthday present back in Sept. He loves it and it still works so the batteries last a really long time . It 's pretty durable and it 's cute .
5 #### This is a great dog toy for all size dogs . When the dog picks it up it says " Oh Noooooo " Our dog really likes to hear it talk . This is the third or fourth one we have had , the others just wore out over the years .
5 #### I got this for my brothers dogs , but his wife loved it so much she wo n't let them touch it .
3 #### This was another Christmas Present I allowed my 11 # Bichon Frise Bailey to play with a bit early . She loves the fact that it says " oh noooooooo " and loved it when she could get it to say it . My major problem : within 3 minutes she had already ripped of part of his red and blue clothing . She is an agressive chewer , but the first 2 minutes were spent trying to get him to talk , so in reality it took all of 1 minute to rip off pieces of his clothing . That is a record for her . Soooo she really liked this toy , but I had top take it away so she could n't get to the batteries . This would be a good toy if it was more durable . I will still give it to her , but it will have to be in very small closely supervised intervals ( sadface for both of us ) . If you have a dog that is extremely gentle with toys than this is the toy for you . If not , then I would not recommend it , as it does have batteries internally .
5 #### At first , my puppy was scared of Mr. Bill , but now he adores this toy . There are enough strange textures on the toy ( especially the mouth ) to keep him interested and the " Oh Noooo ! " sound is not the squeaky sound my puppy has gotten used to expecting from his toys . I admit , I am tired of hearing " squeaks " all day and I ca nt stop laughing when I hear " oh Nooo ! ! "
5 #### We are on , I believe , our fourth or fifth one of these . You may assume by that they they are not indestructible , and you would be correct . However , in every violent " casualty , " another dog has been the ' killer . ' My dog LOVES these things and treats them like they are her baby . She carries them to bed , she licks and licks them . The licking was the " cause of death " for at least one of them ; I have another around that 's still intact but looking rather haggard from being so well loved ( so we have a new one as a ' spare ' ) . She LOVES the FIVE squeakers , and it 's a great soft , squishy size . ( FYI , my dog is a 7 - year - old 70 lb Golden Retriever female ; she 's typically somewhat gentle on stuffies , although she 's certainly destroyed her fair share , too ) . For MYYYY dog ( and I know this does n't work with all dogs ) , if she sees me cuddle and pet her toy for a while first before letting her play with it , she tends to not destroy it ( or , at least , not as quickly ) . I 'm not sure if it 's because it gets my scent on it or if she decides that my actions mean it 's to be ' babied . " I guess I 'm playing into her maternal instinct . This has absolutely been her FAVORITE toy for the LONGEST of all , so I definitely recommend it if stuffies are at all an option for your dog .
5 #### Our puppy loves this toy . He sleeps with it in his crate . He has chewed , tugged and dragged it all over the place for 2 weeks and so far no visible damage . He seems proud of himself when he sets off the " Oooh Nooooo ! " sound . I am going to buy another one as insurance , because eventually even a well made toy like this will come apart .
5 #### I bought this toy because we have a running joke in my house basically saying that one of my three Pekingese loves to make toys with squeaks in them " scream " . He only plays with a toy that has a squeak in it until it does n't squeak anymore , then moves onto the next . I bought Mr. Bill for him , because I thought that he would love the " Oh NO ! " sound and sure enough ... instant hit . He carried Mr. Bill all over the house with him and we always knew where he was because we could hear the " Oh NO ! " sounds from all over the house . Sadly , Mr. Bill has been retired , because he was taken out into the yard in the rain and got muddy and as I ca n't wash him with his battery pack in , I threw him away until I can buy another one . Anyway , great toy ! Ca n't wait to get him back into our house !
4 #### This is a great soft toy . It 's funny and dogs love it ! My only complaint is it 's kind of thin , so I do n't think it will last too long , but it 'll be fun while it lasts and the price was great !
5 #### A friend got this as a gift for my dogs & my Taiwan Mountain Dog puppy ( 1yo ) claimed it as his own . He absolutely LOVED it when he chompd down on it & it screamed " OH NOOOOO ! ! ! " He got to the point where if I mimicked the " OH NOOO " he would squeeze the toy if he had it & run to find it if he did nt . Jack did n't tear it up for a long time - several weeks - but once he did , the stuffing in the head came out first - then the arms & legs . Once he started in on the body , I took it from him & removed the machine parts & he actually carried it around for another couple weeks like it was a security blanket . Even though it no longer spoke , he still knew to go & find it when I said " OH NOOO " to him . lol This was , by far , Jack 's most favorite toy & I 'll be getting him another one - along w / several others for the future . ; o )
5 #### I bought two of these Multipet Sock Pal Monkey Dog Toys . One for my mother 's tea cup Yorkie and one for my Bichon Frise . Both of these dogs just love this durable toy . They carry them around like they are their baby dolls . These monkeys are good size for a medium sized dog and even though the Yorkie is shy on ground clearance , he does a great job of toting and scooting his monkey around . Great toys and I highly recommend it for all pets .
3 #### I have 2 boston terriers . great pets , but boy do they have strong jaws . nearly impossible to find toys they do n't destroy in just minutes . that being said , they LOVE the mr bill dolls . great for fetch , but pretty easy for them to tear into . we bought a few so we could stretch the use time a little .
5 #### My dog loves his Sock Monkey , plays with it every day . The transaction whent nicly and arrived quickly , i will buy from them again .
5 #### Not only does my dog love this toy , but so do I ! ! ! I have a Westie and he loves to fetch Mr. Bill and then toss him around and shake him . He gets really excited when he hears the " Ohhhh Noooooooo " :-) Watching him makes me laugh and laugh - it is wonderful fun ! Before I gave Mr. Bill to my pup , I had taken him to work . Everyone that remembers Mr. Bill from Saturday Night Live laughed and loved him ! I ended up being asked to pick up FIVE more for friends ! The one reviewer mentions the inside voice box - many of the dog toys I buy my dogs have a voice box - I just do n't let them have those toys for long or without supervision . When the toy gets ripped , I either sew it back up or take out the voice box . I do n't think ANY toy is supposed to be given to a pet without some type of supervision - it just is n't safe . If you , or your friends remember Mr. Bill -- buy this and laugh !
5 #### My dogs love this toy . I wish there was some way to replace the batteries when they inevitably wear out . For now , though , poor Mr. Bill is providing lots of fun for my two mutts .
4 #### Bought this toy for my Golden when he was 7 months old , it was a lot of fun for him while it lasted , maybe one month .
4 #### I did n't know this was a dog toy . I did n't buy it for my dogs . I saw it one day in a store and it cracked me up . I did n't buy it then , I came home and ordered it some time later on amazon.com . I bought it for my adult son for Christmas . I will warn him not to chew on it .
4 #### I bought Mr. Bill for my puppy . Alas , puppy is far too young to have watched and enjoyed Mr Bill on SNL . His reaction to the toy was a politely horrified look saying " What on earth IS that thing ? " After it became obvious that puppy had no intention of ever playing with Mr. Bill , I took the toy into work . Mr. Bill now spends his day wailing " Ohhh Noooo " as he sails back and forth over the cube walls .
5 #### my puppy went crazy for Mr Bill when I gave it to him . It is now his favorite doy . It is super cute and this -oh nooo- drives him nuts . Mr Bill is a MUST for every dog ! ! !
5 #### Awesome ! One large black Labrador named Sammi girl can not put this down ! She normally shares but this is sacredly guarded from her big brother Bear Cub . Hee hee !
5 #### My Jack Russell Terrier puppy loves this toy . He has tried his best to " kill " it , to no avail . Dr. Noy 's toys are almost indestructable . I like the fact that there are no pieces to break lose or come off this toy which could be dangerous to a puppy who likes to put everything into his mouth . This is one great toy , at a reasonable cost , which has provided my puppy with hours of amusement and exercise . I highly recommend this toy .
5 #### My BOston Terrier loves to chew and tear up toys . This one he has not been able to do so . I love it The product is tough sturdy and arrived real fast way before delivery date and in great condition
4 #### I purchased this for my German Shepherd puppy ..... 7 months old . When I opened it from the box it looked like a cat toy . It 's a very small medium dog toy . It 's VERY light on the stuffing , and does have a squeaker , and came with an extra one ( oh joy ) . I was n't too happy with it , but let me tell you . My GSD LOVES this darn thing . She carries it EVERYWHERE ! I even found it in my boot . She is obsessed with this toy .
5 #### Both my dogs agree on 5 stars ! And has lasted much longer than most soft toys .
4 #### Great dog toy and tough but our dog got into stuffing on bears head . Replaceable squeaker is great and extends toy life
3 #### The bear was super soft , but just was n't up to the ferociousness of our 19 lb border collie mix pup .
5 #### These are so cute and fuzzy - love that you can actually replace the squeakers in these through the little velcro tabs in the back . All my dogs ( the big and the small ) loved these . A little on the high side for their size , but will probably buy these again .
2 #### Not worth the 5.50 I paid for it ! There is no stuffing anywhere other than the head . The squeaker is also in the head . It has a fairly secure Velcro opening on its back to change out the squeaker . Squeaker is going to outlast the toy . It is falling apart already and he just got it yesterday . The fur on it is coming off and there are a couple loose strings .
1 #### I do n't know what I received but is definitely NOT what is in the picture above . Very disappointed . This looks like a scam where someone is buying KONG replacement squeaker and adding these aliens bears like to the bags ! This should not be on Amazon
2 #### This is so tiny ! I ca n't believe this is made by Kong . It looks like something you could buy at the dollar store .
1 #### Unfortunately my dog destroyed this within 10 minutes of me giving it to her . Worst KONG product I 've purchased .
3 #### Normally love all kong toys - however- this one tends to " shed " the brown teddy bear fur comes off even when puppy is not playing with it .
5 #### Replacement for a bear that got tossed into the toilet by the " other " dog . Owner is very happy to have his bear back !
5 #### Kong Kong Kong I ca nt say enough great things about the Kong Brand ! This one has minimal stuffing and has lasted over 3 months with 4 dogs .
5 #### This toy is steal intake and I can not complain . The dogs only play with it when they are supervised . No rips and they are gentle with it . Happy dogs and happy owner with less toys to buy .
5 #### This was a really low price item & did n't have any high expectations ! But this little toy is awesome ! I bought this for my rescue dog that 's 19lbs . It 's perfect for her size she loves it ! It has Velcro on the back of it with a squeaker in it & comes with an extra squeaker ! Great buy ! !
5 #### True to their word the product had held up for a long time . Even though it has moved to the bottom of the toy pile , every now and then the pup will drag it out for a game of fetch .
5 #### This little teddybear is perfect for my Pom Pom . She chews on it & loves it so much .
5 #### This size teddy is perfect ! No filling in the body . Has squeaker in the head . Very soft and very nicely made . Great quality . My dog really enjoys playing with this toy .
3 #### My dog loved it but for being a kong toy it was not very strong as my dog tore it apart in minutes
5 #### This is probably my pugs favorite toy . She ca n't get enough . We have two of them and they are both holding up well after almost a year . We have n't had to replace the squeaker . That said , pugs are n't the strongest chewers .
5 #### This is our dog 's favorite toy and it has been played with for over 5 years . With other plush toys , our dog will eventually rip the stuffing out and we would have to throw it out . But this has no stuffing and strong fabric . We love Kong toys .
5 #### More importantly my dog loves his Kong teddy bear toy . He actually loves all of the Kong toys . I worried about the tiny size but that size seems to be what my little guy likes . I also purchased two additional ones for my moms dogs . They tear apart any toy they have ever had . They are chow cocker mixes and they love their tiny Kong toys and carry them everywhere and after two months have yet to destroy them .
2 #### Truly tiny toy . Better for a cat than a dog .
4 #### By extra small they mean REALLY REALLY TINY . Luckily I have a small pup but it is miniature , so be warned !
5 #### My 13 lb dog loves this tiny teddy bear . He loves to gnaw and this is his favorite one to gnaw on !
1 #### It 's cute , but my dog ripped it to pieces within one day of having it . Not for strong chewers .
4 #### It 's really small for the price , but my brother 's chihuahua loves it .
4 #### When this says extra small it means EXTRA SMALL . I think this is smaller than my hand . I do love than you can remove the sqeaker though .
5 #### My dogs love these and they are so cute .
5 #### My yorkie puppy loves wagging this tiny toy around .
5 #### Perfect size for our little guy - he loves it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### This is the perfect size for a gift for my mom 's dog . And as an add on item perfect price . Has little stuffing . Head has the most stuffing with a little in the body and a squeaker . Very soft .
4 #### thank u 4 this toy teddy bear CC loves it might need 2 buy it again 4 her 2 play with thank u
5 #### This toy is really tiny but my tiny dog really likes it . It came with an extra squeaker but the original still works after 2 months . It is well played with even though she has lots of toys .
3 #### The item is pretty small , I was n't expecting it to be that small but it 's cute . It comes with an extra squeaker which is great ! But , the squeaker that comes inside the toy is n't very loud . You need to really squish it to hear a good squeak . It 's a very cute toy though , my teacup yorkie will love this .
3 #### WHEN THEY SAY X - SMALL ITS REALLY SMALL . I WAS NOT EXPECTING IT TO BE SO TINY , OR I WOULD OF GOTTEN THE SMALL SIZE .
1 #### My dogs ( Jack Russell Terriers ) like small toys such as this one . The size is perfect , but the quality is poor . It sheds fuzz and is weakly assembled . You get what you pay for with this toy .
5 #### KONG toys are the only toys that hold up with my dogs . I bought the original style bear in 2005 when I adopted my dog and despite the changes this has remained her favorite toy . Love the fact that if it does end up with a hole there is no worries of finding stuffing every where .
5 #### For some reason my japanese chin loves teeny tiny toys . He loves this little buddy and it comes with a replacement squeaker .
5 #### My dog is a small Chihuahua mix . She is very particular about her toys . She loves this one ; runs around the apartment with it in her mouth or shakes it vigorously then lets it fly . She has trouble making it squeak , but I do not mind that . The lack of stuffing does not bother her at all , Out of the approximately a dozen toys I have bought her , this is one of the two she actually plays with so I bought a second to have on hand .
5 #### It 's really small so I would n't leave my dog alone w it but being that my dog is also on the smaller side she absolutely lives it ! It 's really cute too .
1 #### I have a 10 and 20 pound dog and they tore them up same day . These are small toys
2 #### Dog chewed leg off in two days . The squeaky beaver version lasted two years . Buy the beaver
2 #### I got the extra small and it 's not at all like pictured . It also seems flimsy and the squeaker is n't that great either . my tiny chihuahua puppy still plays with this , but pretty sure it will not last very long , even at his baby teeth . It is less than 2 bucks though , so you ca n't expect much .
4 #### It 's a little small even for my chiwinnie He loves it so much in a day it 's ear has already been chewed off I doubt it last the week but oh well it makes him happy
4 #### He is not a cute bear , do not let the photo fool you ! Squeaks well and replacement squeaker is a great feature but this bear is UGLY !
5 #### This is a great , small squeak toy . Our doxie has n't been able to tear it apart or " silence " the squeaker , which is quite unusual . I would recommend this product to friends .
4 #### This toy is very cute , but we aware it is VERY VERY tiny ! My little puppy loves it anyway !
5 #### Mokka Bit , our minature dachshund loves the KONG small squeaker toys . Just the right size for her 6.5#s . Squeakers are replaceable . So always have an extra package of the squeakers around . She loves her Bear !
5 #### I bought one as a gift , after seeing how much our Yorkie loves it ( hours playing fetch with it , and he " hoards " it and takes it to bed ) . Then I bought one as a back up .... and then I bought one of their yellow duckies . I am very impressed with their sturdy stitching . This comes with an extra squeaker , which I have NOT needed . ( Despite the " mauling " that this gets every day . But good to know it 's there when we do need it !
5 #### This is my dog 's favorite toy . She has a beaver one as well . I think this is great for smaller dogs because the size is bit smaller than my hand . Also it is low stuffing and pretty durable for such a small toy . She carries it in her mouth all the time and plays with it . I would buy this again if current one gets worn out . highly recommend for toy / small size dogs !
1 #### I bought the tiny one for my chihuahua puppy , and in less than 10 minutes she pulled some of the fur off and was munching on it . She 's gentle with toys , she has a small mouth , and she 's never destroyed any toys . The fake fur is so cheaply made that there 's not many " fur " fibers , which is why she was able to pull them off . I grabbed the fur before she could swallow it , but she chewed it so fast she nearly did . I strongly advise against buying this for any size dog .
4 #### Perfect for my 4 pound Chihuahua ! Although I never understood why the extra squeaker ? Dogs this small rarely ever puncture holes ! Regardless , I do n't regret ordering it ! One star missing because just a regular teddy bear though , it does n't have the " Mohawk " as seen in picture . But she can pick it up & run with it so I 'm very happy .
5 #### I , or really should say , my dog absolutely loves these little Bear toys and because she 's so small ( toy ) herself , they are just the right size . I only wish she could n't chew ( tear ) them up so fast ! !
5 #### Already dead but it was very cute the big boy got it
5 #### This is one of my dogs favorite toys . Made very well do n't tear .
5 #### My dog loves his new toy . He always has fun shopping on amazon . The squeaker is replaceable and that is nice . This is perfect size for a Pomeranian .
5 #### My puppy loves this teddy bear , he can not get enough of it . It is definitely a lot smaller then I expected , but for my 8 pound Pomeranian it is the perfect small toy .
2 #### The only thing I feel like writing is that this must have been a defected Kong toy . My Chaplin was terribly disappointed . Jan Connor
5 #### My little 5 lb dog likes it . It is Tiny , but easy to carry around
4 #### My dogs love this . They are about ten pound dogs , and this fits them great . I love the Velcro so I can pop in new squeakers , but the dogs chew along the Velcro and rip them apart . I have different animal shapes , and this is the preferred one . I 've had it several months , and this has no stuffing and no squeaker but they still look for it . One likes to suck on the torn strips like a pacifier , and the other likes to , toss it around as if it were new . I wish it lasted longer , but it does outlast non - Kong toys .
5 #### My little 19 yr old Chihuahua loves this toy . He 's been carrying it around since arrival .
1 #### This thing is ridiculous . It arrived and it 's TINY ... I have 7 lb dogs and they dwarf this toy . It literally is only like 3 " big ! !
1 #### Cheap for the money . Not like the typical indestructible product
5 #### My dog loves this toy . This little bear is her new favorite toy and I think it 's because it 's so small . I have a miniature pinscher so she is little but not too small . She also likes chewing on things and most toys she will destroy them , this bear has held up great but maybe she wo n't destroy it since she 's always playing with it or carrying it around .
3 #### The fuzz comes off in my dogs mouth . He plays with the Kong Bear ... he does NOT chew on it . The fuzz comes off fairly easy .
5 #### My pup loved it , and the squeaker lasts forever . To wash , I take the squeaker out , then replace after dry . Had no problems .
5 #### Really , really small but great for the money ! My yorkie took to this right away !
5 #### My 75 lb Belgium Malinios goes through these rather quickly , that 's why I buy so many . She will de - fluff them but likes to carry , their , " carcous , " Around and lay with them . I collect the bodies and replace every 3 months .
5 #### This is the cutest little toy ever ! ! I got it for my 5 lb Maltese and she LOVES it ! She literally carries it to every room in my house . I actually ordered the yellow duck for my Pomeranian since they were fighting over it . It also comes with an extra squeaker . I threw it in the washer and it was good as new ! Would highly recommend !
5 #### just note , this toy is super tiny . for very small dogs or cats . but quality product . thanks
3 #### This little bear is the perfect size for my 2 lb chihuahua puppy . However she has been able to rip some of the fabric . Wo n't last long with her but it was cheap so no regrets .
5 #### my little doxie loves these . she ca n't seem to get the squeeker out of this ( and she is usually able ) . love that it comes with a 2nd one . we have 4 of these now .
5 #### My papillon LOVES these ! It is small but perfect for little dogs .
2 #### I probably should have paid more attention to the size but it is TINY ! ! My dog is only 8lbs but it is so small I am not comfortable with her having it .
5 #### I chose this for the size of it , I have a small Chihuahua puppy , it 's just the right size for her , she absolutely loves it bc everyone should have a teddy bear .... right ? ?
5 #### definitely small ! i have a 25 lb puggle and its almost too small for him , but does come with a replaceable squeaker
5 #### My little puppy loves this toy , and it is lasting surprisingly long . This toy is very small , but it works great for my 8 - pounder .
1 #### DO NOT ORDER THE SMALLEST SIZE ! Unless you have a teacup puppy and DO NOT mind that it is a completely different bear than they picture , then I do n't see why not .
4 #### Bought this for my yorkies . They are barely 5 and 5.5 lbs . Normally , KONG toys are my go to dependable and durable brand . I usually recommend them highly to the dog people who ask me which toys I think are best . This bear did n't last as long as other KONG teddy bears we have purchased in the past . My younger dog had it eaten in about 2 days . The bottom half is missing . He IS rough on toys . His favorite is a KONG frisbee that is nearly indestructible . He loves to fetch . He loves to chew . He is in love and it is holding up great . His mother is easier on toys and she had the same KONG bear for years without destroying it . The original bear has survived the younger dog too and is still kicking around . I was a bit surprised that this new one is going in the trash already . The materials do seem a bit different . Have the standards dropped a little ? At least there was n't stuffing all over the place when it got destroyed . Maybe I just got a dud . I only got one . With a sample size of 1 , I 'll suspend judgement . Next time I 'll order a few of them and see if it was just one poorly assembled bear or if they KONG standard has slipped .
5 #### I 'll buy any toy made by Kong , they are almost indestructible . This one is for very small dogs .
2 #### The Bear in the picture is not the bear I was sent . The bear that was sent is the Dr. Noy 's teddy bear which also sells here on Amazon . My dog normally likes his Kong low stuffing toys but this one was a bust . And it was so ugly with its big white nose . I gave this to my Maltese dog Beau for his 10th Birthday and he was n't interested in it at all . Thank goodness we bought him a backup toy .
4 #### These are TINY . Yes , the description says extra small , but they are maybe 2 inches ... maybe . Upside and higher rating , my medium and large sized dogs love them . They carry them around and do n't destroy them like the larger toys . Each had an extra squeaker included . I was expecting maybe 2 days out of them and I still have a few lying around almost fully intact .
1 #### Do nt waste your money . Its horribly made . Very cheap . The material is cheap . I would nt give it to my doggie i was so afraid it would fall apart . And the squeaker is in the back under a velcro strip . I m afraid it would come out while playing and she would choke . Just real pile of crud .
5 #### My two shih tzu 's love this . We put their toys up and that 's the one they grab . It 's soft and they play tug a war with it . Will definitely order more .
5 #### Got this for my puppy but the older dog took over so I got him a larger one . Well they both still want what the other one has of course . But both of these have lasted . Usually my big dog would have it ripped to shreds by now .
5 #### They really are extra small , but they come with an extra squeaker should we need it . Cute .
5 #### Love them almost as much as out JRT . We remove the squeaker before she gets it and will play for hours . She prefers to toss , catch and hide them . If your dog prefers to rip and shred I would recommend a different toy .
5 #### Another toy for the baby ... Got ta love 'em . He loves it . (:
4 #### I am satisfied with this , but it does not look like the picture so we now have two of the same bear .... which works out okay
3 #### Well , it 's much sturdier & much less stuffed with stuffing that gets all over the house , so this is superior to other toys like it . But our Boston Terrier , less than a month old , still managed to completely destroy it in less than three weeks .
5 #### Kong is my favorite brand of toy to buy for my puppy dog because they actually last ! Normally the toys that he loves fall apart within a few days . It 's amazing how long this one has lasted ! The fact that I can change the squeaker out once he kills the first one is awesome . these are the best plushie toys ever . They are the perfect size and for my weenie dog , and he loves the texture . He plays with it and snuggles it instead of trying to destroy it . By playing tug of war , I have found that it is very durable , and does not rip easily , although after about a year one of the legs came off . There was no fuzzy stuffing for him to pull out and leave all over the house , so that 's a bonus for me , and the fir does n't easily come off , so this toy is essentially mess - less . This is a great great find , and i 'm sire your pet will love it .
5 #### I got this and stuffed it with a small classic Kong toy , and it 's been lasting for over 2 months ! If your dog shreds dog toys leaving stuffing spread all over the floor , this may work out better as long as they do n't go after the squeaker in the head . My dogs left it alone so far for an unknown reason while they usually tear apart and dig out squeaker placed in the torso with stuffings in other toys .
4 #### Very small , which was perfect for our small dog . Great value . According to the dog books I 've read , you should keep back about 20 % of your dog 's toys at all times , then rotate them so that he always has a " new " toy . Getting cheap ones like these is a good way to execute that strategy since you wo n't have to pay an arm and a leg for an army of toys .
5 #### My dogs love this toy so much but it 's to easy to rip its limbs off .... granted it 's supposed to be for my Chihuahua and my Golden Retrievers are the ones that end up playing tug of war with it !
3 #### wish i did n't get the extra small . only thing the dog messed up was the opening for the squeaker . Besides that its very durable
5 #### I have a 12 lb min - pin who likes to destroy toys , ripping out fur and stuffing everywhere . He absolutely loves this bear . He chews on it , throws it around , and carries it around with him but has yet to rip it apart ( have had it a few weeks now ) . He ( thankfully ) has n't figured out how to make it squeak , but I can do so to get him all excited . The squeaker is in the head and is removable / replaceable via a velcro opening in the bear 's back . They include an extra one in case your dog wears the original out . To prevent him from getting bored and trying to rip the fur out , gut it from the velcro side , etc . , I 'm only giving it to him for a little while for playtime and put it away when he seems to be losing interest .
5 #### My 3 lb yorkie mix is obsessed with this toy . It does n't have any fluff for her to pull out and the squeaker inside has lasted a really long time . It came with a spare squeaker ( the back of the teddy bear is velcroed shut over the squeaker ) but even after 3 + months of constant play , the original squeaker is still going strong . This toy is ideal for tiny dogs that might find larger toys too difficult to carry around
5 #### Very small . My 18 lb dog is easy on toys and this became her favorite one instantly . She likes being able to hold it between her paws and other toys are too big for her to do that . Arrived with an extra squeaker , though I doubt my dog will ever destroy any of her toys . It 's a small bear and is n't exactly as pictured in the product picture . But , all of the other reviews show it accurately . UPDATE : My dog does destroy toys now . But , not this one ! It 's just her little juggling toy . She still loves it .
5 #### Great quality little toy . Stands up to tough play .
5 #### If you have a small dog , get this . I have so much trouble finding toys for my chihuahuas . The stores seem to carry bigger toys or are outrageously priced for ones my dogs can play with . I have seen this toy go for twice as much at the pet store . It washes great . If you have a dog like one of mine who 's soul purpose in life is to rip the dickens out of a toy to get the squeaker out .. I 'd try another toy . Most of mine are now raggy and squeakless , but still played with .
5 #### I bought this for my cat tom tom he likes it and it is just the right size for him
5 #### My pup plays with this toy more than his other toys
5 #### Small but cute ! Perfect time for my 3 lb puppy !
5 #### This bear is smaller than some of the other X small Kong toys but my chihuahua loves it . It is just as strong as the others so I am very pleased with it .
5 #### Great toy for small dogs . I have a 6 lbs Pomeranian pup that loves this toy . The squeaker inside is small enough for him to squeak on his own . Love that it comes with a replacement squeak as well .
5 #### Best toy ever for one of my Yorkies . I love the design allowing one to pull velcro apart and insert a new squeekie when needed . Can buy replacement squeekies here .
5 #### Extremly small ! Perfect for a five poumd dog . I would benafraid any larger dog would choke on it .
5 #### I find this toy hidden around my house in various places and have had it forever . He ca n't destroy it . It 's great .
4 #### Well made , but they are n't kidding , ITS EXTRA SMALL ! ! ! ! ! ! !
2 #### Definitely NOT extra small ! This thing is huge ! But my dog does enjoy playing with it even though its almost as big as he is . NOt sure if they sent the wrong size ? But this is definitely not extra small , its about 9 " tall !
5 #### Great toy for smaller dogs . Very cute . My dog just like to walk around with it in her mouth .
5 #### " Jeff 's Wife"- I bought this for my Morkie puppy . There are tons of toys in our house for the two big dogs but he is so small that he could n't make those toys squeak . The squeaker in this is softer and much easier to squeak . He was so excited when it squeaked for the first time ! There is velcro on the back for easy accessibility to the squeaker should it need to be replaced and it came with an extra squeaker . It has help up nicely since November , a little on the crusty side now but still in one piece .
5 #### These are perfectly sized for puppies . I would not go for dogs any larger than puppies .. I use these in my dog gift bags when my puppies get picked up by their parents and these are perfect .
5 #### Tough , sturdy , and well made . I 'm hoping that these come down in price so that I can but more as they get worn out .
5 #### These little Kong toys are just perfect for a lot of our training games with my little miniature poodle . They are sturdy , convenient to throw in my training bag . And most important , she loves them !
2 #### My little dog destroyed it in less than 5 minutes .
5 #### I have multiple small dogs and I love Kong dog toys . They are the perfect size for a small dog ! AND they come with an extra squeaker ! My dogs love them ! ! !
5 #### This little squirrel is about 3 - 4 inches long , but it takes a pounding from my dog . The squeeky ball inside will occasionally get chewed to the point it will not squeek anymore , and there are replacement squeekers ( small size ) that you can get to put into the squirrel . It has a velcro opening on the back for replacing the squeekers . It is one of my dog 's favorites .
1 #### I expected a much sturdier toy from a name brand like Kong . My 23 lb cocker spaniel tore through this guy in about two days . He does n't have sharp teeth and does n't really destroy things too easily . I wo n't order toys like this from Kong again .
5 #### Second small Kong toy and did not disappoint . She loves this as much as the first . Will be purchasing more Kong small dog toys .
5 #### This is the perfect size for a tiny pup . My puppy loves it . It got here fast too .
5 #### One of few toys my little Yorkie has n't torn up . She LOVES it and carries it everywhere !
5 #### My dogs LOVE these toys ! ! Lasted much longer than expected ! !
5 #### It 's so hard to find toys small enough for my 7 lb Yorkie . This one is perfect . My 15 lb Jack Russell loves it too .
5 #### Cute LITTLE toy . Perfect for my 5 lb and 7 lb pups ! !
5 #### A must have for me and my Chihuahua puppy , great always have attached least 3 for her .
4 #### For some reason my Yorkie loved this bear . I have to get her a new one . She tore it apart finally . I wish they had a medium size instead of extra small and large . Even a small would be good to have . This was her favorite stuffed toy ever .
5 #### This was a replacement . Gaige killed her last on and this has been her favorite toy for 1 - 2 years . Better price than the old one I bought at the pet store . I will only buy dog toys from Amazon from here on out .
5 #### My tiny toy poodle loves this toy ! erfect for the teeny ones !
2 #### My dog loves these for all of 3/ minutes and then the squeaker breaks . Someone who makes this with a squeaker that lasts will be rich .
5 #### Comes with an extra squeaker , tiny and great for the tiny dogs in your life . Plus its very cute .
5 #### My recently adopted 2 year old 6 lb yorkie would not play with any toys , even the ones brought with him , until I bought this toy . He absolutely loves it . He throws it around and then fetches it . I bought one to start with and then ordered three more . Since playing with this smaller toy , he has even started playing with some larger ones . If your small dog does not like toys , I would recommend you try this one . It is a perfect size for their little mouths .
5 #### Looks to be well made . My Peke won ' touch it .
5 #### Tiny and adorable . Kongs products are great ! ! My moms 5 lb chi and yorkie loved it .
1 #### Way smaller than expected . Cost me 1.89 . Not worth my time to drop it off for less than 2.00 . Also does not look like item pictured too .
5 #### Super tiny but my dog loves walking around the house with it in her mouth showing everyone her toy !
3 #### Too small thought it would be bigger should be for a cat not dog
5 #### My dogs love this . They run around with it and have n't ripped it to shreds . Even though they have only had it a week it has already lasted longer than most toys . I have 4 very aggressive chewers .
5 #### My dog loves these and they come with an extra squeaker ! This tiny one is almost too small for my pug but would be great for a smaller breed .
5 #### My dog is absolutely obsessed with these toys and will squeak them over and over again . He has this teddy bear and also the duck . They are the perfect size for a toy breed puppy . The squeaker drives me nuts but it keeps him out of trouble ! :)
5 #### Our 7.5 lb dog LOVED this when we gave it to her for Christmas this morning ! She had this same bear about 5 - 6 years ago , and it was one of her favorites . We threw it out when it got worn , and have had several different soft animals since then . I think she remembered her old bear , because she immediately favored this toy ( we bought another animal too ) , and played hard until she tuckered herself out :)
5 #### Love the price .. we buy extra squeaks because our doxies kill toys ... perfect for 11 lb dogs
3 #### I had to return this . They are so small for my Toy Poodle . I was worried he could choke on it .
5 #### My small puppy has two favorite toys , this bear and the duck . He sleeps with both .
4 #### This toy is adorable . It 's the perfect size for my 8 1/2 lbs . , petite chihuahua . We had her in our family for nearly a week before she had any toys . When this arrived she was so excited . I like that the squeaker can come out so the toy can be easily washed . I like that there 's an extra squeaker . The tags need to be ripped off right away or it 'll be a choking hazard , since they can be easily torn off by sharp dog teeth . I do n't like how easily the Velcro backing for the squeaker opens . My dog has almost gotten it open a couple of times since we received it , two days ago . * Update * It 's been about three months since we got this toy . It is by far my dog 's favorite ! ( Especially at sleep time- what a brat ) Today I finally had to switch out the squeaker . The Velcro closure ended up not being a problem at all . From all the squeezing it ended up so securely closed , that it was even a bit difficult to open today . The mouth and one of the ears has been mangled a little . Again , this toy is my dog 's absolute favorite !
4 #### This little guy was much smaller thank I expected , but I 'm sure my 8 lb Mini Schnauzer will LOVE it on Xmas morning . I appreciated it coming with an extra squeaker , though ! I would recommend this for very , very tiny dogs ; no more than 8 lbs . The construction seems great to me as well ; everything I 'd expect from Kong !
5 #### our puppy loves it and i like how it comes with a replacing squeaker just in case ;)
5 #### < div id="video - block - R21RVNP7P03R9B " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / C137akTH1eS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71fxZ4tVLdS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">I have to buy my guy presents once in while . He loves getting gifts in the amil and was excited to get this bear . It is the perfect size for him to play and throw around . This is a well made kong toy as long as your dog is not an aggressive chewer . It comes with an extra squeaker and the bear has a velcro back to open and change it out . They do also make then in different sizes , I choose the extra small because my boy is not a chewer . I totally recommend you getting this bear if you want to surprise your pup .
4 #### Well made , but my dog is a terror . Did n't make it a month . # NoToyIsSafeWithASilkyTerrier
5 #### My dog loves this toy . He is a Porkie and this is a perfect size for him . It is difficult to find small toys for small dogs . I have purchased several other small Kong toys for him . He takes them to bed at night and plays with them off and on all night .
1 #### This thing is ridiculously tiny . It 's too small even for a cat to play with . And the extra squeaker is pointless . Waste of money .
5 #### I bought this for our Chihuahua , she adores it ..... carries it around and sleeps with it .
1 #### When they said extra small , they were not kidding . The product was very small even for a small12 week old puppy .
5 #### Tiajuana Outlaw highly recommends Kong toys to all toy fox terriers .
1 #### The fake fur on this bear falls apart just by touching it . It 's poor quality and I did n't want my puppy to eat the cheap fur falling off . I was able to return without any hassle .
5 #### Very pleased with this Tiny Bear bought for my kitten . Just the right size for him to play with & carry around in his mouth .
2 #### My BAD ! Did n't realize how bitsy and diminutive they were ..... :-(
5 #### Durable Toy . Has minimal stuffing . Great for a small dog like a Westie or Schnauzer . My Dog loves it
2 #### Pomeranian loves it . Comes with extra squeaker . My dog is very gentle with toys and the leg came off within a few minutes .
5 #### Lasts great for rough dogs who like to chew on their toys
5 #### My.dog.loves.them he loves this toy . I bought several . he I 'm So glad I found this for him he even brings it back . Something about the pitch of the squeaker , he goes batty , trying to get it out , lol .
5 #### A great dog toy ! My dog carries this around and I think it is her favorite . All the others with stuffing have been destroyed . This one is definitely chewable without being destroyed and I love that you can take out the squeaker because those can be obnoxious . It only has stuffing in the head which fits in my dogs mouth . She loves this like it is her baby and does n't want to shred it for some reason . Probably because it 's pretty darn cute too . I 'm going to have to wash it soon . Hope it holds up .
5 #### Our little yorkipoo puppy loves her tiny teddy ! She picks fights with it and growls while they are tussling . She took it out of her crate and brought it onto our bed so she could hop around with it . So cute !
5 #### Perfect size for tiny Chihuahua puppies , this is their all time favorite version of this tiny sized toy .
5 #### My Golden Shepard Samson has loved this toy from day one , especially during his teething months . The toy is still in excellent condition ! It came with spare squeaky but I have n't needed it . Also have washed this a few times in laundry ( I put in a small laundry bag so it would get stuck in the drum ) and comes out looking almost brand new . I will say Samson is not a " heavy " chewer / biter .
5 #### Dog loves his little kong squeakies . It 's perfect for my chihuahua .
5 #### We just got a new puppy that is just over 1 lb and it is the perfect size for her .
5 #### There is nothing like a Dr. Noye 's toy with the replaceable squeakers . They last foerver and ever and the dogs love them . I am thankful for this dog toy .
5 #### Both of our small dogs ( 1 dog is a 8 lb Chiweenie and the other doggy is a 30 lb Chihuahua / Jack Russel Terrier Mix ) absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE these little toys with squeakers in them ! ! The product comes with an extra squeaker in the package also . In the back of the toy , where the squeaker goes , there is a small pocket that is held closed by a small piece of Velcro . When I first saw the pocket I figured the toys would not last 5 minutes . Our Jack Russel Terrier likes to rip toys into small pieces .... that is the fun for him ! We have had these toys now for at least a couple of weeks , or more , and both dogs carry the little toys around squeaking them - they have not been able to rip any of them ( we bought multiple toys ) and the original squeaker is still alive ( WOWWOW ! ! ) . Not 1 rip or tear so far ... that is VERY IMPRESSIVE ! ! Most toys do n't make it past 15 minutes ! ! !
5 #### this was a great toy , lasted 6 months with my lab puppy , not made for chewing but he did anyway
5 #### This toy is very small - and I do mean very small ! Will fit in the palm of my hand small . It has no stuffing , but has a squeaker in it ( and it came with an extra to put in if / when the first one busts ! ) . I needed a toy that I could keep in my pocket so that when the young pup started chewing on my hands - and the kids hands ! - that I could whip this toy out and show her that we chew on toys not on people ( or their clothing , haha ) . So while this is not a great tugging kind of toy , this is a great training toy for our golden pup !
3 #### It was cheap enough but was destroyed within hours .
5 #### We refer to this toy by name , which is " Tiny " . Our lab / shep ( 60 pounds ) loves it . I doubt I 'd give this to a larger dog as I 'd worry about a possible choke hazard , just in case . Our pup ( 18 months ) treats all his plush toys very well and they last as he gently loves with kisses them but does n't chew on them . He loves to run around with this one in his mouth or have us throw it for him to retrieve , squeaking it as he returns . " Tiny " cleverly comes with an extra squeaker that you slip in through the small opening in his back . Our dog really loves this toy and although I 'm pretty sure that if I 'd have known just how small it was , I would not have bought it for this size of a dog , but now that he has it , I 'm glad I did !
5 #### Both of my dogs love the Kong extra small toys . They are extra small toys . My dogs are 5 pounds and 10 pounds each . We have the teddy bear , frog , and duck in extra small . Excellent toy , they have played with it for quite a while and no problems . Will definitely buy Kong toys again .
2 #### My German Sheps liked it , but it was in tatters by the end of the first day .
1 #### Too small for my pooch . I forget extra small is extra small
1 #### Dog chewed it up in the first 5 minutes
5 #### You can not go wrong with Kong . My mini dachshund loved this teddy bear .
4 #### Pups love it but the squeaker is so loud and so easy for the pups to trigger it can drive me crazy sometimes . lol
5 #### My 5.6 pound yorkie @HenrikZetterdog on instagram loves his xs Kong squeak toys , but the bear is his favorite !
5 #### My toy poodle puppy LOVES this toy ! ! ! ! It is definitely one of her favorites ! ! !
5 #### My Aussie Shepard rips everything apart within minutes . This little guy has stayed together better than anything else we 've given him !
1 #### 7 month old Golden retriever puppy vs toy= 10 minutes .
5 #### My dog loves this ... I'm into the sewing up stage now ! Tried to dispose of it & my dog gets it & puts it under the table so I guess I 'll keep sewing .
1 #### Did n't last 5 minutes , our dog had it torn apart and spread out in record time . Had high hopes it could withstand his single minded attack at the squeaker . Alas it did n't hold up and is now in the trash .
5 #### so cute ! My dog likes it so much I can no longer find it . I think he buried it somewhere , as he does with all his favorite items .
5 #### Gave as a gift for a small dog who LOVED it .
1 #### Lasted 5 min with my dog . She ripped the head open and took out the stuffing .
5 #### My small dog loves this " little " toys . When he chews on it , it does squeek . He has a few of this unstuffed toys and enjoys them all .
4 #### The dogs love these kind of toys . I would like them better if there were no stuffing in it at all ( the head has some ) , and if there were less seams for the dogs to rip open . I do like that the removable squeaker is inside a removable sherpa pouch that has a velcro closure .
5 #### Dog dropped a Pigs Ear and took off with the bear speaking all the way . She has gone through many of these bears . Does n't like yellow duck or cute beaver only the bear .
3 #### Delivery nightmare , but I finally received it . Not at all what I expected and one squeaker was DOA . The boy still likes it . I guess that 's what counts .
4 #### As dog toys go , this one is pretty nice . Well made and our little Bichon loves to play with them .
2 #### A little to small but I liked you can replace sqeek
3 #### Tiny Tiny Tiny , much smaller than I thought it would be . Would be fine for a tiny dog , for anything bigger it 's a waste of time .
5 #### Teddy Bear is so cute and tiny , just the right size for small dogs and I love the fact that you can open the back which is closed with velcro and replace the squeeker . My little dog just loves it .
5 #### No tears . Had to put a second squeaker in its body because my dog does nt not like bitting its head where its main squeaker is .
5 #### this is the third one I have gotten of these . It was my tea cup yorkie 's first toy . She does n't play much with any of the others I have bought her . She LOVES her bear ! ! the first one got kind of soggy so washed it ... washed great ( take out the squeeker first ) the other two are my back ups for the day I ca nt fix the old one .
5 #### Excellent quality , will buy from again , thank you so much ! ! !
4 #### Great size for a 2 - 3 lb dog , squeakers do n't last but it comes with extra .
5 #### I have two powerful chewers . This bear has survived over a month in a household that takes toys prisoner in a matter of minutes ! I removed the squeak pouch ahead of time to cut down on noise . Very durable .
1 #### My tiny 3 - month old maltipoo tore it apart in less than 5 minutes .
1 #### My puppy destroyed this within 1/2 hour of play . I do n't like the stuffing they use , to easy for a dog to chew and swallow . Make sure you keep an eye on your dog while playing with this or any plush toy .
3 #### I was hopeful that this would 've worked out better than it did . I have a very tough chewer in the house and it did at least last more than one night , but I now have a headless teddy bear running around the house . I will say that the arms and legs have held on , but a decapitated teddy bear is just a sad thing .
4 #### My one Shih - Tzu likes this toy . It is very small and fits right in her mouth and she loves the squeaker in it .
5 #### bought this for my 3.5 2 year old chihuahua . ITs been 2 months and its holding up pretty well .
1 #### If I could give this product zero stars I would . Very disappointed in this product ! " Specially - designed for the canine who rips toys apart in order to extract the squeaker " not true ! My dog was able to not only find the squeaker and rip it out within 10 mins of giving it to her but also ripped off the nose and arm . I bought it with the idea that KONG made other strong products and so this one would be also . Disappointed to find out otherwise . I would not recommend this product to anyone whose dog will actually play with this stuffed animal .
3 #### my two dogs loved these to the short bitter end . If only one or two little pups , these are great . I have a Goldendoodle pup and a 10 year old beagle that has returned to puppyhood ~ between the two of them , especially the beagle , it did not last very long before the squeaker was removed by the dogs and destroyed . Great fun for a few days , otherwise .
3 #### I 've been wanting to find squeaker - less stuffy toys for me dogs so they wo n't be working so hard at getting that squeaky - hard - part OUT of the toy . These toys are supposed to have removeable squeakers . I never did find the velcro allowing me to get the squeaker out of the head of the critter which is how the toy arrived . I found a velcro seam in the back , which lead to an empty space . The immediate goal of my Siberian husky was to remove the head squeaker and to also remove that irritating velcro bit in the back . Now it 's stuffingless and squeaker less ( as well as noseless ) . The Australian shepherd is n't quite so intent on surgery ... I doubt that I 'd go out of my way to get these again , as they are really no different than any other toy with a squeaker .
2 #### It says it 's indestructible but my dog ruined it within 5 mins . It 's a good baby toy , but you get what you pay for ..
3 #### My Boston Terrier is a destroyer . He loved it to shreds within a month .
5 #### I bought 2 -- one for my dog and one for her sister and they love this toy . It 's small enough for them to be able to carry it around and throw it while playing alone . Dogs are 5 lb full grown
5 #### My dog has loved this toy since she was a puppy ten years ago and we occasionally have to replace teddy . This toy is a winner every time and she loves the squeekies in them . I am so glad it comes with replaceable squeekies so that I get more wear out of teddy . Teddy generally last several mos which is saying a lot since we have six dogs to appease .
5 #### KONG Teddy Bear toy well made , and Chihuahuas love it .
2 #### Cute toy but lasted about 5 minutes with my Golden .
4 #### My dog loved it . I say " loved " because it is gone . Deducted a star because it should last longer .
5 #### My dogs love this toy . I have Yorkies . One of them carries this around the house with her . We have them all over the house . They are hard to find in the store so I stocked up to make sure she has her favorite toy handy .
5 #### This little bear is a delite to my 9 pound min pin . He 's not one to rip up a toy but squeak it forever . I stuffed it a little for him through the velcro opening in the back . It is perfect to replace squeakers ( medium " replacement squeakers " here at Amazon ) very quickly - he 's waiting ...... Easy to wash ( I recommend Gund 's " Teddy Needs a Bath " laundry bag ) and refill with a new squeak or two . Happy dog !
5 #### Long lasting . My puppy loves this to an the other one 's I brought him .
5 #### Mickey loves it but chews it too much so we got him the ones with wire inside -- so far so good with the other Kongs Kay
5 #### My dog is very spoiled ans has access to 20++ " babies" ... this Kong Teddy Bear is always on his bed or near on the floor . I put it back in his bin and less that 24 hours later there is the Teddy Bear ! Very soft , strong build quality ( he has used it for over 6 months ; 70 lb German Sheppard / Doberman and " plays " with his " babies " ) . I highly recommend this product as a cost - effective toy that , for my dog at least , is a must - have on a daily basis . As I type he is laying with it on his bed !
3 #### I have a maltipoo / cocker mix , less than 20 pounds , and she tears through this like no tomorrow . I 'm already on my second one and it has been 8 months . She 's able to tear open the velcrow , invert the bear , and rip out the compartment holding the squeaker . Then she tears open the small cloth to rip out the squeaker . The bear is pretty much deformed , it 's just now a rag full of dog drool . She still likes to play with it and shake it around like a dead animal , but the squeaker did not last a week . It comes with a replacement squeaker but I do n't even bother putting a new squeaker in , she 'll have it out in a few hours . Fabric is n't tear - resistant either . She 's definitely ripped open the torso . My search for a stronger toy continues ...
1 #### Had a lot of faith in the KONG products . Received this toy with the nose already coming off ! Puppy could n't even play with it ! Sent it back the next day . He already has the frog and loves that little guy but this bear is not suitable for puppy play . Wo n't even order a replacement because if it happened once , it will happen again . The frog does n't have a nose or eye balls that are coming unsewn ( yet ) and it does n't appear that will happen , ever . Very happy with the frog ! :)
4 #### The dog seemed to like the toy , not enough time to see how durable it is , only time will tell .
5 #### When I ordered this teddy bear , I did n't realize it was the same bear that comes with the Kong Extra Small Low Stuffing 3pk . For some reason , I failed to notice " Extra Small " in the listing title . I thought it was a bit bigger and might be good when my puppy is older and bigger . My puppy loves the frog and likes the duck from the Kong 3pk . Her least favorite is the bear , of which I now have two . ;-) That does n't mean that YOUR pup wo n't love this bear . He / she will probably love it . Quality does n't LOOK good , but it is . The bear and the toys in the 3pk are very sturdy .
3 #### I liked that it did n't have any stuffing , made clean up a lot easier after my dog demolished it . The toy lasted about an hour for a 55 lb lab that is a heavy chewer . It gets a 3 because I bought 2 of them and gave one to a friends small dog . They had theirs for a few months before it was too raggedy to keep .
5 #### My small dogs love these in fact I threw out all their older bigger stuffed toys and now only keep these smmall ones in the toy box because that s all they will play with . I even bought a bag of extra squeakers ! ! !
1 #### Not work it it 's so tiny and shabby not worth the money at all I 'm not sure it would last now I have to take my little guy to get better one ):
5 #### we have 5 of these . one of our bostons loves it , but then he uses as a sucking toy . instead of a teddy bear , it is more of a tiddy bear for him . really all the dog like them . i throw them in the wash every couple of weeks , but they have held up longer than some of the othe toys .
5 #### My little Yorkie loves the teddy bear he plays with it all the time . He really loves the squeaker that he can make sound with . However , the teddy bear is extra small as described .
5 #### My bichon loved this little toy it got her mouth perfectly . She loved it . It 's a dream for a small dog
5 #### Our Lab loved this little teddy bear . He chewed it to a piece of scrap and still loved playing with it . We accept that because that 's what Labs do , they chew .
1 #### I have a 25 pound mini goldendoodle . I thought no way does she tear through this " indestructible " teddy bear . Lasted all of 5 minutes and she had both ears off and the legs torn off ... What a joke . KONG should not be allowed to sell such garbage . I read the reviews and thought " well they must have a pitbull or a larger dog " ... NOPE , my 25 pound doodle ripped it in minutes . Stay away from this one and go with the fire house toys .
5 #### I love the kong . We have agressive chewers and these last a lot longer then anything else . Plus the price is very reasonable considering what local stores sell them for .
5 #### This was a gift for a puppy for Christmas and he loved carrying around the bear from room to room . It became a favorite .
1 #### My dog really wanted to love this toy . I know , because he carried it around like it was his baby . But he could n't help himself , and within a day it was shredded . WestPaw are the only toys my dog can not destroy .
5 #### 3 and 4 pound puppies like this size for fetching and squeaking and attempted dismemberment ( no limbs lost yet ) . Cute .
4 #### Smaller than I expected , but the dogs like this toy . My dogs do n't try to destroy toys , they just play hard with them .... and this has stood up to their playing .
5 #### My toy poodle loves this toy ! She has the frog as well as the duck . She played with it so much that she wore the squeaker out . It is very well made and I will continue buying this for her as a birthday present or a Christmas present . There are so many toys on the market for dogs that when I find the one special toy my dog will play with over and over I like to have spare toys on hand in case the manufacturer stops making the toy .
5 #### Dog loved the KONG Teddy Bear Toy , however , now for long . Though she got it just to tear up . Would buy more of KONG products .
5 #### Although missing an ear ( was in the way of getting to the squeaker ) , this toy is still around and pretty much intact after a few weeks . My dog carries it around with her , rotating it with a few of her others as the favorite of the day .
3 #### My dog would rate it a 5 because it was so easy to rip to shreds with the velcro back . If you want something sturdy , get Kong 's " Ali the Alligator " instead since he lasted about 10x as long . I just rated Ali a 5 , as the longest lasting stuffed animal my pup has owned . The bear IS cute - I 'll give you that !
5 #### Everyone in my home has a teddy . This one was bought for Lucy my puppy . She is really hard on her toys . This has lasted a year and counting . Sturdy toy . Easy to spot or hand wash .
1 #### This toy was not a large - it was even labelled medium but the sticker for scanning had large on it . Tried again with the same result . Apparently Kong does not make the large one any more ( it did eight years ago ) .
2 #### I know this is NOT a chew toy , if your dog is not a chewer than it will be fine for you . My dog is a chewer and unfortunately this poor little teddy bear did not last long in our house ! The price was perfect so if your dog is not a chewer then I would recommend it because its really cute .
3 #### It 's a cute little toy , however the squeaker does n't work all that well and my puppy tires after a few seconds
5 #### wow my 2 dogs love this , brought 2 of them and very please , was please with shipment and will order again and would recommend this dog toy for any dogs .
2 #### Although this is really cute , it did n't last longer than a few hours . But that 's because my dog is very destructive .
5 #### My little dog likes these toys and I like the fact they have no stuffing . They provide an extra squeaker but she will quickly kill both the squeakers and then just drag the little bear around with her . This is her second one of this same toy because she liked the first one so well that it eventually just started to fall apart . It did last for quite a while though as she normally can destroy a toy in a day . She just kept looking for the stuff on this one which was funny because there is none .
5 #### He is 5 1/4 pounds so this is the perfect size for him . It has a squeaky which he loves . Seems very durable .
3 #### My dogs are truly aggressive with their toys , but sweethearts with humans . This bear 's face and paws were chewed up and spit out by the end of the day . The squeaker was extracted through what was once its nose .
4 #### i like this toy for my dog . it 's made nice and heavy dutty . he has trouble trying to rip it apart .
5 #### My dog usually has the squeaker ripped out in a day and he has had this Teddy for months and it is still living - minus an ear but still ok . I plan to only buy Kong toys .
5 #### This toy is advertised as being indestructible . My significant other says , " Time will tell . " But I say , after watching my five - pound Xoloitzcuintle ( Mexican hairless ) go nuts with this toy , that I think the only problem will be when the toy needs to be washed and line - dried . I think my dog will be depressed until he gets his little " victim " back again . Squeak , squeak , squeak . My dog likes the second squeaker SO MUCH ( it goes inside the toy 's body , with industrial - type velcro to seal it in ) , that when I took out the squeaker , my " Mi - T " dog went nutso , trying to find the darned thing . I mean , he really , really , REALLY wanted that squeaker----bad ! I think he would have spent hours chewing on the squeaker itself , if I had let him have his way . I love that this toy is soft , oh - so soft . And it is significantly light - weight ( no stuffing ) . It is PERFECT . I highly recommend this toy for small and larger dogs , too . Buy one today , if you have a dog that loves toys . Just be prepared for non - stop squeaking . You can always take out the second squeaker and hide it . Good luck with that . UPDATE : It took him months and months of daily chewing , but my little dog finally chewed the end off the bear 's nose . Sigh . I have recommended this toy to lots of dog - owning friends . It 's a great toy !
2 #### My rottie / lab mix puppy , little girl 4 months old , had it in pieces the first night . The stuffing was the first to come out , so I cleaned out all that and let her have the squeaky part . Bad idea . She chewed it out and literally ate the pieces of plastic . If you have a mild chewer I think it would be ok , but it is not for heavy chewers .
4 #### I 'm glad this toy has no stuffing in it , but for a few dollars more , the Kong Cozie is stuffed firmly and has a squeaker in the middle that lasts and lasts . My puppy has two varieties of the unstuffed Kong animals , one being this frog . They were correct to give you a free extra sqeaker . The toy , without stuffing , is very thin and flimsy , and the squeakers do n't last . So far , the toy has not ripped , though , so I think the quality is decent for 5 bucks ! But my 8 and 9 dollar Kong Cozies last as well and there is no need for extra squeakers .
5 #### Really cute ... makes a nice toy for a puppy who is perhaps missing his siblings ... Well made and so soft ... I highly recommend ...
1 #### Ohhhhhhhhh ... the mess ! The stuffing was scattered in a matter of minutes . The flat bear was ripped apart and destroyed within a day . Disappointed .
5 #### My 50 - lb pointer / lab / pit mix loves this bear ! I previously bought the beaver and saw how much she liked that . Knowing my dog 's personality ( more like a lab ) , I thought it would be a good idea to purchase another one to keep her from getting bored . Although she still plays with her beaver , she likes her teddy bear the best ! She sleeps with it , gently squeezes it to hear it squeak . She wants to take it outdoors , but I always instruct her to " leave it " . Reluctantly she squeaks it several times and puts it down ! Most of the time she is carrying one or the other ( or sometimes both ! ) when she moves from one part of the house to the other ! About once a week , I take the squeaker insert out , remove the squeakers ( I put a 2nd one in it ! ) , hand wash the insert and toy , and then put them in the clothes dryer on the delicate cycle . Still looks like new several weeks later !
5 #### LOVES this toy . It 's perfect for her tiny mouth . She likes to do multiple squeakings and shake the heck out of it every time I throw it . After a couple months of playing , it 's still in one piece . Lesser toys fall prey to her teeth in days . This , and the mini Loofa dog are the only toys she really likes and wants to play with consistently .
1 #### he ripped the sqeaker out and played toss with it in the yard . the bear is unrecognizable now , just a pile of brown fluff .
3 #### This little guy had no chance . The first day we got him my dog just destroyed it . I m not sure if its low quality or my dog is that much of a beast . But regardless , any GOOD dog toy should make it longer than this one did .
4 #### My dog destroys every toy he gets in his mouth . This one actually lasted longer than most . He still has fun with it , although it now has no face and most of it is pulled to pieces .
5 #### Lulu 's a small rat terrier mix . She needs a tiny toy and this is perfect ! We keep a stack of them !
5 #### This was a great purchase ! And we got our extra squeaker ! We have a Chocolate Lab & a Black Lab - Blue Healer mix and they love these . I thought they might be a little small , our dogs are 69 & 54 pounds and they have a great time tossing this in the air , running around squeaking a d having a great time .
5 #### These are high quality and very well made . I purchased 40 of them for a fundraising event and people just loved them . It comes with a spare squeaker in case the first gets damaged and the little dogs just love to play with them . We have used other products for this fundraiser before , but this is the most compliments we 've ever received . * Coincidentally , i asked the seller to ship fast and they did - very well packaged too ! *
1 #### My dog loved this bear . She tore it to shreds and had it gone in less than a day . What a waste of money . I can not recommend this toy . My dog is a mixed breed , about fifty pounds .
4 #### I ordered the medium sized bear for my 20 lb dog . The toy we got was not the one in the main picture of the listing with the shorter fur and leopard spotted feet . We were a bit disappointed - My dog actually already has the bear in the main picture and loves it so much that I was trying to buy him a replacement in case anything ever happens to the original . The toy we got was the more fuzzy looking bear that 's pictured in some of the additional pictures for this listing . It ended up working out okay , because my dog loves his new bear . So far it 's held up well , and he plays with it daily . The only reason I gave this listing 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the misleading picture .
3 #### definitely nor for an aggressive chewer . My Spitz destroyed it in under an hour . But he had fun while it lasted
5 #### Very good quality item . My dog is still playing with it a month later ! Good value and highly recommend A+
1 #### My 19 lb . Boston Terrier loves stuffed toys , but only to pull out the stuffing . So , I usually buy stuffing less toys . I decided to give this toy a try based on reviews about how tough it is . Well an hour later the toy is destroyed . I 'll go back to buying stuffing less toys . Do n't waste your money like I did .
3 #### I am a dog trainer and am against buying toys that squeak for a dog with a prey drive when there are kids in the same house . After the squeakers were taken out there was nothing left in the bear lol
1 #### Okay KONG is known for creating some pretty tough , ready to take wear and tear items . This is not one of them . I was looking for a plush like toy my 20 lb dog could play with ... they say there 's not that much stuffing in it . KONG did not have to pick it up from all over the apt . Said brown bear was stripped and gutted in about an hour . Skip this one .
5 #### My little 4 pound Yorkie absolutely loves these squeaky toys . We love , love that the squeakers are replaceable . :) best toys ever :)
5 #### I have a Jack Russell Terrier that is a chew - maniac . I bought this bear hoping it would last a bit longer than most , based on good things I have heard about the Kong brand . It 's been about a month and a half now , and he has ripped out the pouch for the replaceable squeaker ( the squeaker itself was the 1st thing to go- in the first week ) , but the squeaker in the bear 's head is still there . Aside from that , the rest of the bear is fully intact . My pup treats it with care , not biting as hard as usual when playing tug of war . He also plays fetch with it , but surprisingly does not chew it . I have seen him licking it and carrying it around though . When I get home from work , he often greets me at the door with a toy already in his mouth , and this bear is definitely one of his favorites .
5 #### These will not be great for dogs who are especially destructive , or rough on their toys , especially those who 've been taught to destroy plush animals . It is great for calmer dogs who just want to fetch , play gently , or want a " snuggly " ( yes , my dogs are a bit odd ) .
5 #### Purchased for a mini shih - tzu for Christmas . This teddy bear is her absolute favorite toy . Not only does she play with it by squeaking it and carrying it around , she takes it to bed with her at night . She holds her bear under her paws . Provides security for her .
5 #### I got this for my 6 months old puppy and she liked it . A few months later , she loved it . A few times , when Mr. Teddy was downstairs and Al knew we were going upstairs to take a nap , she would carry Mr. Teddy all the way to the bed and rest her paw and muzzle on it . I even bring it when we go on trips .
5 #### My dog is nuts about Teddy . It 's the only toy she will play with . We have teddy 's everywhere and spares hiding when washing is necessary . My dog squeaks this toy and rolls around with it . Just a joy for her .
3 #### My American Eskimo absolutely loves this toy . The moment I gave it to him , he started chewing on it and shaking it around . It seemed sturdy , but I immediately started seeing random tufts of fur coming off of the toy . It 's not a lot but I 'll see a few strands here and there on the floor as a result of him chewing it up . It 's only been a week and I 'm already seeing signs of wear and tear on the toy . My dog loves everything about the toy , but I just wish it were more durable . At this rate I am not sure if it will last more than a month or so . Another comment is in regards to the squeaker . It comes with a replacement squeaker but I am not sure how to even get the one inside the bear out . In the toy I received , the squeaker is in the head of the bear and sewn shut .
5 #### I purchased this item mid January 2012 . Its mid July now 2012 & the teddy has lasted so far with no issues . This is my dogs absolute favorite toy & she plays with it daily . It can be her chew buddy for hours on end & the squeaky noise just thrills her to no end . She has several other toys but this one is her first love . I was about to purchase another one right now as backup for when this one goes out , when I realized that I had not reviewed this & given it the credit it deserves . 5 STARS all day long .
4 #### Having a 3 year old beagle that has destroyed toys in 3 minutes or less after receiving them , I 'm always on the lookout for one she will like , and that will last longer than a bullrider does . This toy is one of my beagle 's favorites ! She fell in love with this critter ! She loves the squeaky in its head , and will carry it around in her mouth . We do n't let her have it when she 's home alone , since I do n't want her to get bored and chew her way through to the squeaker , but otherwise , it 's held up wonderfully . We also do n't let her play ' pull ' with it . It comes with a replacement squeaker , which is nice . It 's the perfect size for our beagle , and almost the perfect toy . If the size we received is ' medium ' , I would n't order anything smaller for any dog except a Chihuahua . I hope to find some more !
4 #### My dog loves to go directly for the squeaker in any toy , but she ca n't get to this one . She tosses it everywhere and likes to play tug - of - war with it .
1 #### The frog and duck toys held up so well that I decided to get the teddy bear ( it is SO cute ) . Poor Mr. Bear does n't last a day . My dog is 12 pounds and it is so incredibly easy to chew the limbs off these guys . My dog gnawed off the leg of one of the bears so we bought him a new one ( what were we thinking ? ) He gnawed off another leg . We duct taped it back on and he gnawed through the duct tape . Cute toy for small pups if they are n't big chewers but my dog is just determined to eat this thing .
5 #### I bought the Kong green frog for my dog at Christmas . Although she has tons of toys , She always picks up the frog when she wants to play . That is why I bought this one for her birthday . It does not have a lot of stuffing , and I think she likes that .
2 #### This bear is about the size of a small hand . My Dachshund tore it 's legs and arms off in a matter of minutes .
2 #### My dog who is an aggressive chewer recieved this for Christmas and within an hour had one of the feet pulled off . He did love it and carried it around the house squeeking its head but , within two days the squeeker in the head was pulled out . They did have the head squeeker sewed into a fabric pouch so I was able to retrive it before it was chewed / swallowed . I did n't bother to put the extra squeeker in the body . Would not recommend this toy for a dog who tears apart stuffed animals , it did n't last more than a couple days .
5 #### The package says it 's for dogs 20 - 40 lbs , so I hoped my 14 lb mini - schnauzer would n't rip it apart too fast . The day it arrived , the schnauzer , and her 30 lb Schnoodle " brother " played tug - of - war with it til they wore themselves out . Teddy survived - yay ! We 've had it for five days now and Teddy still looks like new and the squeaker is great . My schnauzer has pretty much claimed it as her toy and she loves to make it squeak , she throws it in the air and chases it , and occasionally enjoys a game of tug - of - war with Teddy in the middle . I just wish there was a ' large ' because it 's a pretty small toy for a 20 - 40 lb dog . It 's just about right for a mini schnauzer , toy poodle , etc . Update : my little bad - ass Schnauzer LOVES this thing . Some people have said their dog ripped open the head for the stuffing . My dog usually destroys things but she really likes to make this squeak . I hear her in the middle of the night playing by herself , making it squeak . This is the first toy she has not destroyed within the first week and she plays with it all the time . Kongs are my new best friend .
5 #### My Pom is pretty laid back , so he does n't shred most of his toys , and he loves - loves - loves this one . Family member with Duck and Frog . Squeak ! ! !
5 #### Just got a puppy Elkhound , only 8 weeks old and she loves it , my 3 year old Elkhound loves it too . Of course the older one does n't like the squeakier in it and takes it out . They both fight over it so I had to get another one ! Holds up to a 3 year old that destroys all other toys I get ! The small size is way too small , but is still OK .
5 #### My 2 yr old standard schnauzer will chew through anything . I 've been searching for a bully stick that will last more than 20 minutes with her , and still have n't found one . For some reason though , she plays with this toy differently . Handles it gingerly and is more interested in playing catch with herself than tugging and tearing . That said , this is the first non - animal - part toy that has lasted more than 5 minutes . It has become her favorite over the past 24 hours , which is 24 times longer than I thought it would last . Update : one eye is missing from the bear , but all the seams appear to be intact and she 's still very engaged . Very impressed with the item , although I 'm sure it would be torn to shreds if it was her choosing .
5 #### My puppy loves the little bear . I took the squeaker out because he already had a squeak toy . It is very small , and at first he did n't seem to like it , but it because his " in - crate " toy . He loves picking it up in his mouth and moving it around his crate . Now he loves it so much that he tries to sneak it out to toss it around and play .
5 #### My first dog loved this toy as soon as I took it out of the box . He is n't an aggressive chewer , so I do n't have to worry about the toy being ripped apart . He likes to throw it around and chew on it . * * UPDATE * * After 6 months , the paws and ears have been chewed off , but overall still a useable toy . I got a second dog in September , and the two dogs tug on this and love it still .
4 #### I bought the " Extra small " size for my boston terrier for his very first toy ... it was a perfect size for him , considering he was 2.5 pounds . He still plays with it , even though it can fit entirely in his mouth ... I have bought the " small " frog and he was unable to destroy it for about 4 - 5 weeks ( which is the longest lasting toy to date ) . Now that he is fully grown , I have purchased the " Medium " Teddy Bear , and he still plays with it roughly . They are great since you can give it to them without a squeaker so he does n't try as hard to destroy it in hopes of obtaining the squeaker ! It is hard finding dog toys that are soft and do n't have squeakers ! Judging by the size of this toy , I would n't think it should be given to a dog over 25 - 30 pounds .
3 #### I received the bears ( bought 2 of them ) yesterday and I gave my 9 month old puppy Macie(Pug & JRT Mix ) one of the bears . She had the pocket pulled out thru the head where the squeeky is within 30 min or so . She continued to play with the bear but also the pocket and the squeeky is just about destroyed .... lol ... she has a tendency to destroy every squeeky in a toy , so this does nt surprise me . A little bit of stuffing came out - not sure what part of the bears body - but other then that she is still playing with the bear . Let 's see how long the body will last before she shredds it to pieces . I 'm still looking for a toy that she can not destroy and I have n't found it yet . I think toymakers need to give me the toys to test and then if they survive they can be stamped ' Macie approved '
5 #### My two young Siberian Huskies play with this . My girl claims it as hers and often sleeps with it . It fits her mouth about right , as she is on the small side for Huskies . This is her 2nd teddy bear . The 1st lasted about 1 year being squabbled over , pulled on , licked on , and gnawed . It finally died when she figured out how to open the velcro opening in the back and chewed up the squeaker , the velcro , and other parts of the bear .
1 #### Do not buy this toy if your dog has destroyed every other stuffed or cloth toy . Its the same ! Despite being solid under the Kong name , my 6 month old Yellow Lab ripped it to shreds in minutes . Are there any cloth toys out there for Labs ?
1 #### This toy is much too small to be safe for a dog , any size of dog . It is easily destroyed by a small dog and the very small pieces could be swallowed causing a very dangerous situation for your pet . Try the AKC brand of dog toys , they are well - made and much less risly for your beloved pet .
4 #### This teddy bear has lasted almost 2 months with our two big lab mix dogs . They usually chew up whatever soft toy or stuffed animal they get within a few days so I am impressed at how well this has held up . Definitely recommend .
5 #### I have two dogs , one big and one small ... they both love this toy . Best of all , it 's extremely durable . Normally with squeaky toys I have to monitor their play with them because if I do n't then I come back in the room three minutes later and they have it all torn apart , stuffing all over the room and have proudly destroyed the squeaker . This one we 've had for a couple weeks now , it 's in their toy basket that they always have access to , they play with it pretty much daily and they 've yet to destroy it . Fantastic deal on this .
3 #### I have a Chihuahua and she weighs in at 3.5 pounds . She had the stuffing out of this toy in less than 24 hours . Although she still enjoys the outter shell there is no stuffing left to it .
5 #### Our Apollo ca n't live without his Teddy ! I 've never had a dog so attached to his toy . He mangles it , runs with it and sleeps with it . Absolutely in love with it . It has held up better than any of his other toys ... I just wish Amazon would bring back the large version of this toy . I bought 2 mediums in case his beloved large fails . This dog toy is the best and has taken 2 years of 95 lb . black Lab punishment ... now that is a true test ! !
5 #### My miniature pinscher Bella has this little bear and a little duck . Both of them she 's had since she was a baby , 9 months ago and both of them are still in great condition . They last a long time ! She has torn up many toys in the past but these have held up with no problem at all ! They are definitely two of her favorite toys ! They are very small though , do n't buy them if you have a larger dog at all , I think they are just best for toy breed dogs , Bella is 6 pounds .
5 #### Loved the leashes , did n't care for the around the waist belt . See my complete review under the buddy system hands free leash system
5 #### I needed a replacement for the leash portion of the Buddy System I already own , so I purchased one leash in black and the whole new system in red . Now I can be more or less color coordinated as I go about my my daily routine ! I find it very useful since I am a wheelchair user with an assistance dog . The hands free leash allows me to keep the leash out of the wheels in a simple fashion . This item was priced well ( as was the leash component ) . It was delivered quickly and was in great shape . I would highly recommend this product and company .
5 #### We love this Buddy System . We have a very energetic mini Aussie puppy but this helps us teach him to walk properly with us . We would buy it again !
5 #### Great for running with your pup and having free hands getting the mail .
5 #### I have had this system for a few years and run with two large dogs . It was a great decision . This system allows me to run without having to worry about losing balance . I have not had a problem with the lunge buster breaking and I have been using the same original product for at least five years . I have had the clip on the waist belt pop open on me twice at the very beginning of a run . I can only conclude that I did not have it completely locked in place or after five years of use the clip may finally be wearing out . If it happens again I would buy a new waist belt without hesitation .
2 #### About four years ago I bought the buddy system and I loved it . I used it to tether my dog to me during training When I bought this one I noticed that the clip was different , making it harder for someone who 's disabled to use it . I also noticed that the lease was shorter , which is not what I wanted . I feel like I did n't get what I paid for I want the original version back . I Unfortunately ordered two of these
5 #### Love this product it works great for me & my lab ( service dog ) . I have 2 different colors of this item .
5 #### great for walking , jogging or training a puppy and being hands free
5 #### HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANYBODY WHO WALKS DOGS ! ! ! IT SAVES YOUR NECK , BACK & SHOULDERS A LOT OF DAMAGE FROM PULLING ! !
4 #### I have used the Buddy System hands free leashes for some time now . I just recently switched to a different system because of one reason . I am an older person , and I do n't run , I walk . When walking my two small dogs on this system , they would sometimes tangle around my legs , causing a falling hazard . Be aware of this if you are going to walk more than one dog at a time and you are older or very frail , it is a serious problem . Most of the time , my dogs walked fine with no problems and it was a HUGE help to me that they could not run away from me as they are very fast , and I 'm not , but they are also pretty strong and when they wrap around you , it is a problem . Other than that , I loved the convenience of this system and even bought a second one to keep in the trunk of my car !
5 #### Best leash ever ! I am a dog trainer and like to have my hands free for my clicker and offering treats . This leash is perfect . Having the dog attached to my waist also gives me better stability should a dog try to chase after another animal .
5 #### This is a great leash . We have coyotes where I live and wanted to be hands free at night in case of an attack . I can carry a flashlight in one hand and a golf club in the other . I also love the adjustable waist belt . It is very comfortable .
5 #### This is a great leash when bringing home a new puppy . The only draw back is the tag is located near the clasp to connect the leash to the dog . My puppy is a chewer , so she goes right for the tag because it draws her attention by brushing against her fur . Great lead for when you need both hands free !
3 #### Great concept , especially for someone who just had hand surgery . The belt around ones waist allows your body weight to compensate for the lack of a hand . The Problem : When I was preoccupied the other day for less than 3 minutes , he ate through his part of the belt . Needs more steel .
5 #### works great , my dog does not pull and my hands are free when I use this leash .
5 #### Love these- I actually use it for my service dog so she is attached to me and my hands can still be free for pushing a grocery cart , driving a scooter , etc .
4 #### Adaptable , comfortable , easy connections ! Needs a caribeener ( ? ) connection to prevent multiple dogs from getting tangled .
5 #### I could n't be happier with this . Very well made and a great tether for my puppy .
4 #### Works well for me . We have a 100 + pound Akita . He is not a huge puller , but it does keep him closer to my side . Takes a little getting used to , but I use it all the time now .
4 #### Bought the buddy leash system on a recommendation from our dog trainer for a 6 month old pit puppy . Have been working on loose leash walking and this really helps . Really puts the control back in the handlers hands especially while training a young puppy . They quickly learn they wo n't get anywhere by pulling . The belt does seem to loosen a bit by itself during the walk so I generally need to adjust it often . The adjustable leash is great for the dog , I can give him more leash when we are walking in the woods or tighten it up when we are walking on heavily trafficked trails .
5 #### Love it!!!! ... hands fee fun time with my Copter boy ! ! ! ! .....
5 #### This works great for running with my dog . I can also attach a normal leash to it when I run with both my dogs . The quick release is very helpful when the dogs get tangled up .
5 #### I was a little bit afraid that this would be cheap because there was a review that said the clips broke . This leash is very heavy , high quality everything . The clips are very heavy - duty ! I walked the dogs today with it and it worked great !
5 #### Super convenient . I 've used this system on many walks / runs now - it 's such a relief to be able to run with the dog and not hold a leash . Not to mention that my dog goes though periods where she likes to pull , and with the leash attached to my waist it 's slightly less annoying . Both the waist and the leash length are adjustable , and being able to unclip the leash is convenient when I have to get the dog into the car but do n't want to take off the whole belt . We 're 9 months and and no incidents , it 's held up fine . If I lose this one , I 'm certainly buying another .
4 #### sturdy system , works well . width has to be adjusted during walk as it is fairly slippery .
4 #### This is a good idea , especially to help to bond a young puppy to its new owner . I would , however , add two more hooks to the belt -- one would be for a clicker & the other would be for a potty bag holder . I had the bungee extra piece from a previous Buddy Belt that I 've misplaced , & I wish that it had a bit more " spring " to it .
5 #### Great service . I love this buddy leash . Handsfree and easy to use !
4 #### This has been handy for training my dog , freeing my hands . I 'm not a runner , but I could see how it would be very convenient if you are a runner . The leash however is really long --- way too long for my purposes , and even adjusted to the shortest possible , there is too much slack then in the leash between the 2 sections , causing it to become entangled .... an adjustment in design would take of this , or add sliders on leash that would hold the leash together . I also bought the lunger , which works better for me , for training purposes . Runners would probably also like it , if you have strong dog that would lunge - control stays with you , not the dog . Overall I like it ; 4 stars because of the too long leash with poor shortening option . Would be helpful to have short leash ( 3 to 4 feet ) option .
4 #### This product is well made and does what it is supposed to do . In addition , it is exactly as the vendor described it . I left one star off due to one part of the belt that I did n't care for . As you can see from the picture , the small piece and the longer lease part are attached to the belt . The issue is that easily fall off the belt while you are taking it off and on . Otherwise , it has worked extremely well for our Lab puppy .
5 #### The buddy system leash is comfortable for both me and my dog . I use this for a Jack Russell / Chihuahua mix because she likes to scoot around me as we walk . She adapted to the different leash configuration very quickly and seems to really like it . The buddy system enables her to move freely as we walk and gives her enough room to roam without being so long that she can get in the street or into other trouble . The quality is great - the clips are secure so I feel comfortable that she will stay attached to me . I also like the second clip , which allows me to attach another leash or hook her leash up and out of the way when she is off - leash . The only thing that I think could make it better would be to add a pouch for my phone , treats or poop bags that I could attach to the second leash clip because the waist band width is a bit wide for the clips of my poop bag holder and my phone holder .
5 #### I really am liking this for training . It 's handy and I think it could be a great tool for novice handlers who find themselves accidentally putting pressure on the leash .
5 #### It is the perfect way to control the dog while using two hands for other tasks .
3 #### Returning this . My husband is a 34/34 pant size . He can barely close the leash around his waist . He is 6foot 4 and weighs 175 lb - SKINNY . I do n't know why they make it so small .
5 #### My puppy does well , if not better , on this leash than the hand held .
2 #### This product is a great concept and might work well for a large breed puppy or a medium to large dog , but is is way to heavy and cumbersome for a small breed dog or puppy . I have a medium size labrodoodle puppy , and by the time she can support the weight of the heavy strapping , buckle and snap she will already be trained .
5 #### I work as professional dog walker and this system is wonderful . Hands free walking , and really great for dogs that pull . No stress on the arms , pull is on center of body , I just stop , bend my knees , and the dog is n't going anywhere . Highly recommend this product . You can get extensions , for the long lead section , and I 'd recommend getting some extra clips ( the piece that clips onto dog 's collar ) . They last a long time , but I give the clip a lot of daily use , and after quite a long time , clip will loosen , but I 'm talking about after several hundred walks .
5 #### My daughter loves to run her dog with this !
3 #### Love this to run with my dog , however ... The clip on the leash part broke off ( it happened when I moved , so I do n't know how it happened ) . However , even though that clip broke , I use a regular leash on the belt and it works wonderful too . You can just slip the handle of any leash on the belt clip . After I realized that , I could have just used the runners belt with a pouch and put a regular leash on it . This is n't really that different .
5 #### Received the next day after ordering ! I like the concept of being hands free but you do need to be careful . My dog weighs more than I do so I 'm extra alert to approaching dogs , skateboarders , and wayward cats since I do n't want to be flying along in the air !
5 #### I just ca n't say enough about this system that I use for my hard pulling , animal shelter rescue lab / German shepherd mix who has made my shoulder so sore from her constant pulling . She still pulls but with one of the straps clipped on to her chest area and one on her back , she actually is walking almost sideways when pulling at her worst . I also grab on to a lower level leash area to correct her which she feels more strongly and is more apt to follow my directions . The best part is since it is hands free , my shoulder is fine . My waist and body core can take a lot more pulling than my arm and shoulder . Just be sure not to try and correct your dog by pulling back on the leash using your knees or else you will have some sore knees . Also , probably not recommended for frail or off balance people with dogs who pull hard that are over 30 lbs .
5 #### People ask me where I bought this as I walk my dog . It works great . Ca n't imagine going back to a regular leash . On cold days , I can put both hands in my coat pocket . When I have to use a waste bag , it 's a two - handed operation now , so much easier . I can use my smartphone easier . Is this item eligible for a Nobel Prize ?
3 #### This is basically a nylon belt , the included leash is n't great so I switched to just looping my dog 's regular leash onto this , but really any belt could have accomplished the same thing . That being said it 's managed to last much longer than the other similar products I 've purchased in the past and that 's with a 140 lb great dane that loves to lunge out at Squirrels when she sees them .
5 #### I initially bought this so I could have my hands free to carry my paddleboard from the car to the lake when I took my dog with me but now I also use it on regular hikes in the woods ; it seems to keep my dog from yanking me all over the place and it 's a greet convenience not having to keepi switching a leash from hand to hand
5 #### Fantastic product . Helps me keep the pup close by and my hands free .
5 #### This leash is totally awesome ! I just wish it came with a longer extension so I could use it when I 'm out working in the yard and want the dog with me . I 'd like the ability to give him more slack . That is the only drawback to this product . I have a 92 pound lab and this leash holds up well .
5 #### I love this system . It 's nice to have my hands free when walking , jogging a / o running with my dog at my side . I did purchase the extra extender as well which gives my dog some extra length when I use this system with the bicycle . And I have been tugged off my feet at all !
5 #### The Buddy system works great even with 2 dogs at your heels ! I used it alot when I go into Home Depo and never a problem !
4 #### i have a toy schnauzy .... and concerned to just let it run loose , we have lots of birds of pray .... and this way she can walk and I can do other stuff or carry stuff . the only part that not too happy is how short is the leash not the length they described
5 #### I tried a few waist leashes and this one is the best ! I use it for running with my dog and for long hikes ! Also great for having both hands free while at a beer festival that allows dogs !
2 #### I love running with my dog but I wished I did n't have to hold a leash . I tried this system but the leash did not easily rotate around the belt so if my dog crossed sides I still had to fiddle with it . And , although he is usually very good about running close to me , there are those times he sees something he wants to chase and he ca n't help himself and lunges . This happened once while using this contraption and he jerked me right off my feet , luckily I was n't hurt badly . He is a strong 75 lb dog so I should have known better .
5 #### This works perfect . I can walk my dog and push a stroller at the same time . It is all plastic but my dog does not pull a lot ( he is 80 pounds though ) .
3 #### ok so when i first got this i FREAKING LOVED IT , but after almost 1 month of daily use the latch that attaches to the dog opens up when ever he gives the slightist tug(its like a 2 pronged claw ) .... which since he is a huskie is well constantly if i m not running ... great for my workout- bad when out walking with the kids
3 #### Unless your dog is really well trained , it will be potentially hazardous as your dog is very close to you , and if it crosses your path , you will probably trip . Conceptually I like this , but only for dogs who can basically loose leash walk , in which case I would n't need this . Be careful with the short attachment piece ; it seems easy to lose .
5 #### My dog , Charlie is a rescued Service Dog that we adopted . I wanted a dog that I could use as a Therapy Dog . I saw this on Dr. Sophia Yin 's website [ ... ] who is another dog behaviorist / vet favorite of mine . I was really impressed with what she was teaching and how she used this leash . So I decided to give it a try . Now it 's the only one I use . I use it when Charlie and I are doing our Therapy Dog visits . One of the rules is to have your dog under your control at all times . I can use both hands and not worry about whether or not he is with me . We use it all the time for walks and for Therapy dog work . I like it so much , I bought the extra buddy so I can walk both of my dogs using the Budy System . I can use my body to teach them to stay with me if one of them starts to pull . I 'm hooked and you will be too !
5 #### Normally , I like using typical nylon and retractable leashes for my French Bulldog - who is really strong - but after surgery on both my arms , my surgeon told me I could n't use a normal leash for almost 2 months . Even for the 7 - block stretch where he drags me like a maniac to the dog park , I was able to better control him on this leash . I may even use this leash even when I can go back to using normal leashes ... at least for those long drags to the dog park !
5 #### I use this leash everyday and it works well . I jog with my dog in the mornings through rain and snow . I 've had it detach once when my dog leaped forward , but it has n't happened again . ( I think I did n't latch the buckles all the way )
5 #### I was a bit confused about the different parts , sizes etc and was n't sure I was ordering the right things . I gave the company a quick call and they sorted it out for me . Then I ordered it on Amazon . I will probably go back and get the buddy leash also since I have two dogs . Right now I am using it for training , one dog at a time .
4 #### I use this mostly when we go to a store and I want to have both of my hands free . Or I use it in the house if for some reason , I want her to stay with me . I find it easier to just carry the leash for our walks , but I suppose if I worked with her and taught her to use it for a jog it would be good . We just have n't spent the time to do that . I also used it when we went camping so that I could keep her by my side . It 's a decent product and is nice for hands free leading . I would probably buy this again .
5 #### In 2012 I had 2 shoulder surgeries , 3 months apart . Doc said I was n't allowed to hold a leash so this is a great substitute ! Also allows you hands free jogging and you 're able to adjust your MP3 player . I did n't get the additional " lunge " guard and my dog is a " puller " , you really do not need it .
5 #### I would consider this one of my best buys for my dogs . I initially bought it for biking with one dog at a time and it is perfect for that . My younger dog will occasionally pull and having her connected where my weight is centered she does not pull the bike off balance . When I 'm biking in particular I like to use the BrilliantK9 vest because I think it 's gentler and safer for the dog than using with the collar and is designed for an upward correction . Anyway , the Buddy System Dog Leash has made biking easy and safe for both of us . I 've recently started running and I use it with one dog and hold the leash of the second dog . I have n't decided If I will buy a second attachment leash , but as we all get used to the routine I suspect I will . I like having my hands free .
4 #### I love running with free hands . I was really unsure which product to buy as my first purchase , I am satisfied with this ! I always held a lease in the past , which made it harder to run freely . I love that this is around my waist also which gives me more control since I can use the weight of my body and not just strength of arms .
3 #### I love that this is adjustable but the plastic adjuster on the waist has given me bruises on my side
4 #### Great concept and convenient . Would not recommend for strong dogs that are not well trained but very nice for service dogs and dogs you leash only because of leash laws
3 #### This is a good waist leash but it does n't suit me as I need one that is fixed at the waist and can not move around my body . I am sure this is a selling feature for this leash , but the work I do with my dog requires the leash to be fixed and I ended up using safety pins and I spend a lot of time adjusting and readjusting it .
5 #### Buddy System took the stress out of walking my 2 Border Collie dogs ! No matter how well my dogs walked separately when together on the leash they would pull . And how do you correct one without confusing the other ? So now I can take the strain off my arm and let me waist ( and body weight ) take the hit . I walked 4.5 miles with my pups and no strain on me and no obvious issues for them . Eventually I hope to use it for its intended purpose i.e. running but only when the dogs are older I would definitely recommend this product
5 #### I love the buddy system ! It makes morning runs & evening strolls with my pup a breeze . I can move my arms freely & know my pup is n't going anywhere without me . Its a great investment for anyone who likes to exercise with the pups .
4 #### I 'm going to like this product better now that I have a No - Pull harness to assist me and my over energetic puppy that is LARGE .... Can't wait to see some good results in improved health ! However , I do worry about its ability to handle the huge dog ....
4 #### I have dogs that pull on leash . This helps them stay close and not pull . Allows to walk more dogs .
5 #### I walk two small dogs , and it seems they always want to walk on opposite sides of me ! That means I have a leash in each hand . This Buddy System with the Extra Buddy works great . How I can walk the dogs and swing my arms like a person not completely controlled by her dogs !
5 #### I did leash running with my 2yo Aussie and it was miserable . I could not use my arms properly and ended up switching hands often depending on where the dog was going . First run with the buddy system allowed me a more natural running motion . Only 2 cautions : 1 ) I bought the extension because I kept overstriding and tapping her rear legs , which is especially important if your dog pulls and you are " following " vs. running side - by - side . 2 ) a pocket for poo bags would be nice . I tied it to the leash , but something more elegant would be nice .
5 #### This is such a great product . I had ordered the medium size , but ended up giving it to a friend that has MS and could not walk her 2 dogs . Now she can and loves it . I highly recommend it . I have carpal tunnel and am a bit uncoordinated :-) I kept dropping the leash so much that I thought I could not walk my dog any longer . But after I bought this , well , lots of walks . I bought the extra large size so my 85 year old father could also use it and at times walk my dog . He is much larger than me . The extra large can be made much smaller so it fits me also . Great product . I am now thinking of buying an extension so my dog can at times wanderer more . At this time , we connect another leash to the system to give her more length ... and that works great also .
5 #### I purchased this product because my dog had knee and hip surgery . I did n't want him to be crated all day , but he was not supposed to be off leash at any time as he was prohibited from any kind of running or jumping on furniture etc . Holding a leash ALL day was becoming a nuisance so I went searching for an alternative . This was perfect ! I can sit and type with both hands at my computer while he lays on a cushion next to me , but I do n't have to worry about him darting up to bark at the doorbell or chase the cat . This would make an excellent potty training tool for puppies as well . The best way to teach them to not go in the house is to keep them attached to you at all times . I also purchased a " Fuel Belt " attachment that is like a pouch so that I can have treats on me at all times . The product is well made and is strong enough for a larger dog . The hardware is a bit heavy where you attach the leash to the collar which could be a problem if you have a tiny dog like a chihuahua . Overall I 'm very satisfied with my purchase and I ca n't wait until my dog is able to go for walks again . We will definately be using this for its intended use when the time comes .
5 #### Works great for both walks and runs ! Nice to have hands free and not get my arm pulled out of the socket when my dog tries to lunge at a something .
4 #### The smallest setting for the belt for this is still slightly too large . I wish it were a wider belt , too . Also , I have the lunge buddy assistant but unfortunately , I ca n't clip it directly onto the belt , it stil requires a longer lead than I like .
5 #### I paid a LOT of money for another hands free leash system that was frustratingly poorly designed . I was so unhappy with that leash , I ended up purchasing this one as a replacement . This one is simple in design ( no water bottle holder , poop bag holder or cell phone holder ) but it does a great job of holding what 's important - my dog . It 's light weight and compact enough to wear under my old butt bag . I wish I had bought this one first , I could have saved myself $ 70 a a lot of frustration !
4 #### Lets me have use of my hands . Great idea . Just be careful of tangling if you run more than one dog .
4 #### This leash is great for what I need it for , running with my dog ! Overall I really like it . There are just a few cons that I did n't think of until after I bought it : 1 ) The belt is relatively thin . The first time I put it on , my dog ( a lab ) got really excited and decided to pull really hard , which left my midsection feeling a bit bruised and battered . A harness ( for the human ) might make it a little more comfortable . On my dog 's end , there are no complaints that I can tell . :) 2 ) The belt material has rough edges that can snag on your running clothes , especially the sweat wicking type of material . It helps a little that the leash can move freely around the part attached to your waist . Other than those two things , this leash is great !
4 #### I have 5 dogs of my own and use this system to walk them all at the same time or walk any number of them . I also use it for my Australian Shepherd / Border Collie when we go on runs or when I bike and she runs , depending on how lazy I am that day ! I would like to see stronger clips that can handle a dog that suddenly lunges at that squirrel or that dog . I do n't recommend this system for dogs that have n't been trained to walk loose on a leash and to focus on their handler .
5 #### This was an excellent product idea . I 've always wanted something to walk my dogs but keep my hands free , this works exactly as purchased . Be careful however , an out of control dog will pull over the someone using this . So be sure you have a properly trained dog before using this product .
5 #### I hesitated getting a leash like this just because I thought my regular leash worked fine . If you 're a runner with a well behaved dog , GET THIS LEASH ! It 's awesome . Your hands are free to hold a water bottle and you avoid cramping up and avoid bad posture . The leash moves from side to side on the belt part so if your dog chooses to move around you , you wo n't get yanked around . It 's built sturdy ( probably even sturdier than our regular leash ) and it 's a great price .
5 #### I have always been the dog walker in the family ; however , since my husband decided it was easier to walk than do P90X ( hah ! ) , I convinced him to walk our lab retriever at the same time . So though I 've never used one of these , I bought him one as a gift . The hands - free leash system is the best invention since peanut butter ! ! He has used it every day now for almost four months and it still works fantastic !
5 #### I use it regularly and is a very good purchase . I walk with my dog daily and usually walk 3 miles and this is what we use . I have good control of the dog also and keeps me from tripping over a leash .
5 #### I found this product to be extremely useful . I can walk and carry a cup of coffee without spilling it or wearing it . I like the short length because my dog will focus on me and my actions instead of attending to her own agenda .
5 #### I just received this product in the mail . My husband decided to begin exercising again by walking three or four miles daily , so I bought him this leash as a surprise to take his beloved dog , Roxie , lab / pointer mix . She is four , 68 lbs , and all energy . My husband loves it .
5 #### I 'm a big girl with a Great Dane ( Jax ) so I got the Xlarge Buddy System . I 've only had it a week but so far it 's working really well . Jax walks great on this , right beside me without pulling and it 's saving my poor arm . It 's also really nice to have your hands free . He is 7 months old and weighs 112 lbs right now so I will update when he gets larger and let you know if he 's jerked me off my feet yet . I 'm giving it 5 stars because it does what I bought it for . May 30 , 2013 - -Jax is now 19 months old and 145lbs and still has n't jerked me off my feet . Still 5 stars . :)
3 #### The waist part of this leash is fine . If you walk , it 's fine . But I found the leash to be too short for running with my dog on the trails . I just attach my regular leash to the waist belt and off we go . I have to wrap the leash around my waist when we run off leash . A pain , but at least I do n't need to hold a leash while running
5 #### This is a very functional / useful leash that allows you to ' arm swing ' during your walk / run with you dogs . This ' extra buddy ' added a leash to my BUDDY SYSTEM that allows me to easily bring both of my dogs . It took a few days but the dogs do very well with the system and I love the quick release system to quickly re - position the dogs . This is one of the best running training tools that I have bought ...
5 #### We have a 2 year old 70 lb yellow lab that is full of energy and does well on the leash rather it is walking or go along with us on a bike ride . My wife wanted to take him running with her but did n't feel like holding on to the leash because typcially your arms move a lot when you run . She told me about this belted leash she saw online one day so of course I pulled up Amazon typed it in found about 5 different brands saw this was the cheapest and best reviews so I bought this one . I bought it on Friday around 3 pm and paid to have it shipped in 1 day for $ 3.99 because she wanted to use it on Saturday because of the nice weather we were getting . She went for a good run with Scout or dog and said it was AWESOME and the cool thing is the loop can go from left to right depending on what side the dog likes the most . I 'm not a huge runner but I did take him out on it for a walk on Sunday and I have to say it was pretty nice to not hold on to the leash the whole time . The good thing is you can grab it like a leash if you have to just in case the dog starts to pull away . We highly recommend getting this esp . for the price .
5 #### received mine in a timely fashion and i was overall pleased with the leash . good strong material for the straps and heavy duty buckles . i have a 14 month old 65 lbs German shepherd that loves to go on walks and jogs . she does nt pull too hard away from me when we go for a walk or jog , so i do n't have problems with that but i did buy the lunge buster attachment just because and it works like a charm as well . i would recommend this product .
5 #### I recently bought the Buddy System , after giving it to a friend with two australian shepherds and receiving her rave reviews of it . She recommends using a splitter at the end of the leash rather than buying the extra buddy . the extra buddy makes it difficult when two dogs go in two different directions . The splitter makes them move more in tandem . I love that it connects around the waist as I run with a 50 pound border collie who is more in shape than me . This means lots of pulling for the first couple of miles . I live in a hilly area and this was causing muscle strain from running off balance . With the buddy system this is minimized as I am pulled straight forward rather than off balance . I even get to use both arms while running instead of the one armed swing I used to us . As winter approaches I continue to be impressed with the buddy system as I am able to balance better on slippery surfaces or keep both hands in my pockets to keep them warm . The lunge buster , however , was a waste of money . The lunge buster seems to encourage pulling as the dog is able to maintain constant pressure on the leash . My walks went from enjoyable to a seemingly constant of tug of war . I also was n't able to communicate as easily when she needed to stop .
5 #### This a great way to save your arm from tugging . I got this because I have nerve damage in my arm . At first my dog pulled on my waist , but now has settled down and walks well on it . I also think this great way to get dog from car to house hands free ! If you ca n't have your dog pull on your arm this is a good solution .
5 #### If you run with your dog , or just have a dog that drives you crazy , this is an amazing product ! I can now just hook our hound - mix up and barely even notice that he 's there when I 'm running . The leash quickly detaches from the belt , if the dog needs to go potty . Also , to keep him out of trouble when we 're home , I just attach him to me with the extension , and he has to follow me wherever I go !
4 #### This is my second waist leash . I ca n't do without them . I use them for walking and biking with my dogs . It comes with a link for a second leash , but you have to order the second leash separately . They did send me the wrong size , but it ended up working all right . As I said , this is my second waist leash . I suppose the first was a little better quality -- thicker and double - ply . But there 's nothing wrong with this product . The price is right and you 'll wonder what you ever did without it .
3 #### we got this to have hands free jogging w/ our dog . it does what is says - but the clip that attaches to the dog 's collar actually broke easily once it had a strong pull . in the end this is just a leash with a belt - so you can make your own if you already have a leash and a belt .
5 #### I got this a while ago , I'm still using it as my dogs primary leash . It is very well made , lasts forever .
5 #### I love the buddy system . I use it all the time . It frees me up for a fun walk with my loveable pup . We trudge along and really love our walks ...
1 #### I wanted this to work so badly but it broke on the first walk of a 25 pound dog . Please ! I was going to give up completely on this concept until I found a seller on Ebay who makes such a high quality hands free leash I ca n't stop gushing about it . Go on Ebay and look for TJ 's Custom Made Pet Supplies in the store 's section . I shop enough on Amazon for them to deal with this referral to Ebay .
3 #### This style of having the leash attached to an adjustable belt is a great concept but it could use a little tweaking . There are 2 plastic clips that hang from the belt . The leash is clipped onto either of these . The clips themselves have not been strong enough to survive unexpected lunges from my 42 pound female pup . Even with the elasticized lunge buster , I have had 2 clips snap in my 1st month of use ! Other tweaking has to do with how you " store " the leash if and when you set your dog loose . The second clip , which hangs from the belt , comes with the system and allows you to plug in the collar end of the leash ( or to attach a second leash , as an alternative ) but when you do this , the part of the leash that is left looping in front of you is cumbersome so I wind up tucking some of it into my clothing which looks a bit weird and draws comments from others ! In conclusion , I really like the concept of this product . The manufacturer replaced my first broken leash quickly and without charge . I acknowledge my dog is very active ( she 's not nearly as strong a many dogs out there ) but I would like the plastic clips to be heftier or better made .
5 #### I have had dogs for most of my life and have walked hundreds of miles with them . Sometimes it can be a lot of fun and then there are days it is just a challenge adjusting your glove or zipping a coat , putting a scarf back on , etc .. Sometimes I have two dogs and their leads cross . Now with the Hands Free Leash < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Buddy - System - Hands - Free - Leash - Regular - Dog - System - Black - Regular / dp / B0002ZAZLC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Buddy System - Hands Free Leash - Regular Dog System - Black Regular</a>&nbsp;every walk is a joy ! ! Just clip on my waist band , hook on the dog and I am good to go ! I can adjust the leash length depending on whether I want my dog close and in tight , or loose and able to sniff . I can have one dog on either side of me to keep them apart . My arms are free to hang loose , make adjustments to my clothes , drink some water or do my Chi Walking ! ! I absolutely Love this creation ! Makes walking a lot more enjoyable for me ! !
2 #### we got this to have hands free jogging w/ our dog . it does what is says - but the clip that attaches to the dog 's collar actually broke easily once it had a strong pull . in the end this is just a leash with a belt - so you can make your own if you already have a leash and a belt .
5 #### First Impression : Well my leash skills are so darn good Dad decided to just hook me to his belt and not worry about me . He purchased the " extra buddy " which does not come with their belt and saves about $ 7 . It 's really no different and will slide right onto any belt . Now when dad wants to go photographing he can have both hands free and I never get left home . Conclusion : Excellent ! Strong buckles and leash . A must have !
5 #### I have the original buddy system but my puppy got to it with her razor teeth and though she did n't chew the entire way through I wanted to have a leash that was n't damaged . I love the original and the replacement is just as great .
5 #### I have two dogs and I am able to walk both dogs on the buddy system . It also has helped me get the concept of heal across to both of them simultaneously .
5 #### Got a second dog and needed the additional leash to take them for walks . Works great ! Very happy with my purchase .
5 #### This frees up my hands so that I do n't have a leash in each hand . It has made long walks with my two dogs more enjoyable for me , and they do n't mind it at all . I notice that people stare at me , but I do n't care !
5 #### The greatest leash ever made ! I have the belt and three of the leashes and walk 3 dogs 7 miles about every day . Love it !
5 #### I had been looking for a way to walk my dogs without all that pulling on my shoulders . I have to walk with walking poles so it was really miserable to have two leashes and the poles . Teaching them to heal with poles was hopeless . Now I can walk them comfortably . I am very happy .
4 #### The smallest setting for the belt for this is still slightly too large . I wish it were a wider belt , too . Also , I have the lunge buddy assistant but unfortunately , I ca n't clip it directly onto the belt , it stil requires a longer lead than I like .
4 #### Have used this several times . Only compliant is when running two dogs , you have to train them not to cross over . A little de - tangling required
5 #### Now I can walk with my dogs hands free . Great obedience training aid . I like the fact that the leash length is adjustable .
5 #### I have had other hands free leashes and I really like this one . The problem was I meant to order the belt and leash and I accidentally got this . However , I had a belt from another same brand product which was exactly the same so , voila , it worked after all and I ended up with two connectors for both my dogs .
5 #### This is a very functional / useful leash that allows you to ' arm swing ' during your walk / run with you dogs . This ' extra buddy ' added a leash to my BUDDY SYSTEM that allows me to easily bring both of my dogs . It took a few days but the dogs do very well with the system and I love the quick release system to quickly re - position the dogs .
4 #### I got this for my wife to walk our baby daughter and 2 to 4 of our 4 dogs . Believe it or not , she actually could walk the baby in the carriage and 2 small ( ~30 lb ) dogs on this leash while walking our other tinier dogs on conventional leashes . It works well for running too , but does take a few days of training to make sure the pups do n't pull or try to stop to sniff something in the middle of a run . The only reason why it got only 4 out of 5 stars is because the belt does slide down if you do n't have a decent size rear to hold it up .
5 #### My little Pomeranian puppy loves this toy ! She insists we play fetch with it every day . It 's a fun interactive toy for any dog lover :)

5 #### I love these toys ! It 's nice being able to wash and dry them - so they stay clean and stink - free . My dogs really enjoyed the squeakers and you get extras . However ( ! ) , they are a total waste if you have a dog who chews .
5 #### We have Basset Hounds and they love toys that make noise and are soft , not rubber or vinyl . The replaceable squeeker has saved this toy more than once , so they can continue to play with it .
3 #### I bought a few of these toys and easch one of them my Teacup Chihuahua who weighs in at 4 pounds has taken the stuffing out of them all . One or two of them she had the stuffing out in less than a day the others in a week . She still enjoys the outter shell of these toys and for that I give it 3 stars .
1 #### My 22 pound dog had the stuffing out of the head after an hour of play . Not for chewers as advertised .
3 #### I do n't think these are any tougher than any other stuffed toy . not worth the extra price
3 #### This product is n't quite as high quality as it looks in the picture above , and I 'd highly recommend you take a close look at its dimensions before purchasing it ( if this is a ' medium , ' I ca n't imagine how tiny the ' small ' must be ) . I 'd also only recommend this item for supervised play ( not , as I 'd hoped , as a snuggly toy to leave in my puppy 's crate overnight ) . The body of the toy is only the length of my index finger , and I 'm concerned that any larger breed puppy will rip this thing to shreds in minutes if you let him . Oh well .
5 #### I have two dogs that love to chew , a dachshund and a pit mix . They love their stuffed toys . Most only last a day before they are torn to shreds . These kong stuffed toys have lasted over a month . Worth every penny !

5 #### Just purchased this teddy bear as one of the last installments to my puppy 's Kong collection . :-) As always , very durable , perfect size for his 7 lbs , and something he really likes to play with ! Out of all the toys he has , the Kong products are just about the only things that he ca n't chew through !
3 #### This little chipmunk is very hard for my 7 lb pup to do any damage too , except for the tail . The hair - like fabric that it 's made out of is easily plucked out of the animal . I 've noticed my dog walking around with the fibers stuck to his mouth . Overall though , these Kong Material products are great !
3 #### After purchasing several Kong Material stuffed animals and seeing that my little 7 lb puppy could n't rip them apart , I expanded and purchased most of their other stuffed toys in size small . This one is n't my favorite . I think the material is just too plush . Kong also uses a fleece material for their other toys , and I feel that maybe they should have done the same for this one . Definitely sturdy though !
5 #### I have a little Scorkie pup ( he 's 7lbs now ) and this little toy is perfect for his size . I 've purchased toys from the pet stores and other places , but in the last few months , he 's been teething , and can chew through any non - Kong stuffed animal . He loves the squeaker , and I love that he can bite the thing as hard as he wants , and it does no damage ! This brand is the best I 've come across so far !
1 #### My 35 lb . springer spaniel mix is a brutally aggressive chewer . She slaughtered this lamb in ten minutes or so . I bought this toy based on the strong reviews as a last attempt to see if a soft toy could stand up to my dog . This toy faired no better than any other stuffed toys I have purchased .
5 #### My dog loves this toy . He 's a 65 lb border collie mix ..... it even comes with an extra squeaker . The belly has a velcro opening for speaker replacement . It 's perfect to have him carry to keep his mouth busy and his brain focused . It washes perfectly ( I removed squeaker first ) . It 's a good toy .
5 #### Our french bulldog will tear anything up in a day . I read somewhere that this specific model seems to be the strongest . I have n't tried other Dr. Noys toys , but I got ta say the little guy loves it . We got it for him 3 months ago and he has not tore it ! His toys rarely last , but this one is still intact .
5 #### My pug loves this little toy . He does n't get it to squeak , but he plays with it alot . Good toy !
4 #### This is a nice small toy to carry around so your puppy can chew on it instead of your fingers . Our boxer pup loves this toy . . . do n't know how well it will hold up when he is older , but it is perfect now .
4 #### The " Dynamic Duo , " ( a male Westie and a female Scotty ) , have three criteria when they evaluate a toy : 1 ) Do they like it ; 2 ) Is it safe ; and 3 ) Does it stand up to repeated abuse and gnawing , ( the " durability " factor ) ? Based on these criteria , the DD say , " Four Stars , " for the large Dr Noys Chipmunk . After 6 months of being chomped , tugged and mauled - the Chipmunk pretty much looks like it did in the beginning - including it 's tail . One caveat : The DD are " small , " ( 20 pounds each ) , dogs - but the " large " munk suits them fine - except for the very smallest dogs , ( or perhaps puppies ) , I recommend sticking to the large version .
4 #### In her review of Frosty Dog , Chantal Ritz says that she does n't think that any dog toy is " truly ' indestructable . ' " I agree . There 's not a dog toy made that can withstand the chewing of a particularly determined mutt . So the only really fair tests for a dog toy are whether your dog likes it ; whether it 's safe ; and whether it holds up reasonably well when subjected to day - to - day gnawing ? With those tests in mind , the " Dynamic Duo , " ( a male Westie and female Scotty ) give Frosty Dog four stars . They are currently trying to dismember their second . The first one lasted a year , the last six months of which were spent with two legs and no nose . And they would still be playing with it , except that I got tired of looking at the poor bedraggled thing . By the way , I think that the " large " FD is probably the right size for all , but the very smallest , dogs . The Dynamic Duo only weigh in at 20 pounds each , but the " large " FD suits them fine .
5 #### As soon as I opened the Amazon box , Harri was right there , jumping up and grabbing the toy in her mouth and tearing off like a dog on fire . She seems to like the visual texture the dye - job provides , along with the actual texture of the fur . I got her the large dog toy , wich seems to be just the right size for her . She 's a 65 lb . Coonhound , which is not what I would consider to be a large dog , for those of you wondering about which size to get . So far , it seems to be a sturdy toy , but it has yet to be tested by a good game of tug - of - war between Harri and her sister , Sally . It has held up very well to a lot of other plush toys , and I 've found that I 've had good luck with Dr. Noys in the past , so I 'm more likely to take a chance on Dr. Noys compared to other plush toys .
5 #### I have purchased the Dr. Noy 's Extra small bear , small rabbit , and medium lamb from Amazon . I have a smallish breed - he 's a pup at around 10 lbs and should max out at around 15 . His favorite of his animals is by far his medium sized lamb . He carries it with him everywhere . He has managed to put some holes in all three of his Dr. Noy 's , so they definitely are n't indestructible , but they are very sturdy . He is teething currently and they are withstanding that phase for the most part . The medium has an advantage of having a designated pouch inside the toy for the squeaker that the extra small and small did n't have . It makes the toy a little bulkier in the middle and adds some extra popping protection for the squeaker . Great toy !
5 #### These toys are among the best plush dog toys out there , and we 've tried several . I do n't think any are truly " indestructible " since there 's always a dog somewhere that will defy that claim , but these are well made and worth buying for the majority of dogs . Just be * sure * to buy the size that suits your dog ; do n't buy one too small that can be swallowed easily ! Dr. Noys ' toys are great in that they always include an extra squeaker in the pack , and the toy squeaker is easily replaceable in its hidden velcro pouch . ( Squeakers are not indestructible ; that 's why they include an extra . But the advantage here is that they are very secure , and ca n't be eaten . ) You can even buy separate packages of squeakers if your dog is tough on plush toys . Or you can remove the squeaker if it drives you crazy ! ;-) Pay attention to the sizes listed : extra - small is really small , best for only the tiniest toy breeds or for small puppies . Medium will work for most dogs , but if your dog is a shredder , loves to destroy plush toys only get the large sizes . So if you 're tired of buying so - called " dog toys " that are really glorified baby toys and easily destroyed , try these . Even better , they 're usually included in the Amazon 4 - for-3 promotion , so you can get one free if you buy four ! That way you can test out different designs , or save one for later . Highly recommended !

3 #### As a big fan of the Dr. Noys toy line , I was quite disappointed when this bear arrived . After searching in the bottom of the box for it , I found it drowning in the peanuts ( just kidding ) . This size is seriously more appropriate for something like a Yorkie or chihuahua . It 's too small for our 20 lb . mix , and definitely not ten inches tall as the description stated . Still , our dog has tossed it around , and I 've found Dr. Noy 's toys to be quite durable .
5 #### Our dog Selby just loves this toy - he sleeps with it , drops it at our feet for " fetch " and uses it to push a tennis ball around . It is very durable - we play tug with it and he has n't managed to pull off the ear or the tail . We 've washed it a couple of times and it still looks great . I would recommend any of the Dr. Noys plush toys .
5 #### My little Pomeranian puppy loves this toy ! She insists we play fetch with it every day . It 's a fun interactive toy for any dog lover :)
5 #### I have been giving my lab mixed breed dog Glucosamine for the last several years -- on advice of a vet . Since my husband and mother swear that the people version help their arthritis and aches and pains , I figure why not the dog ! He will be 13 years old in two months and people ca n't believe he 's that old -- still jumps and runs around like a puppy . I will continue to give him these tablets .
3 #### I noticed this helped my 14 year old Border Collie with her mobility . Problem is that it 's a real chore for her to eat it . She simply does not like the taste of these tablets .
4 #### I needed a hip and joint supplement for my 8 year old Malamute / Shepard mix . At first I thought she was going to be finicky about it , she did n't readily accept them . After about 3 days of offering them to her she finally took them , now she digs them out of her kibble first . My mother 's dog , a 14 year old Shi Tzu wo n't eat them , but she is really finicky , so we were n't surprised . The price is a great value for the quantity of tablets verses the weight per dose ratio . One tablet per 40 lbs .
5 #### This product is a great buy ! I decided to check Amazon.com after the vet recommended a joint supplement for our 40 lb shepard mix . The product they recommended was very expensive , I thought anyway at $ 60 for 90 pills . This was probably one of the first ones to come up , but with the strong reviews ( even with complaints about the taste ) I decided to give it a go . Turns out my dogs * * * LOVE * * * these pills ! ! ! It 's probably their fav treat ! So I 'd say give it a chance , you might find your dogs actually love this product !
5 #### Excellent product and pleased with the expeditious shipping . Would recommend to other dog owners ... Amazon always a pleasure to visit and shop your web - site .
5 #### My 20 - lb 10 - year old mutt 's back legs ached whenever the weather got cold . He whined in pain , and could barely use his back legs in the winter . I got this for him and initially gave him half a pill in the morning and the other half in the evening . The pill crumbles when I cut it , but while it was very bothersome to do this , he puked whenever I gave him a whole pill , so I had to do it . To be fair , my dog has always had a weak stomach since he was a puppy . He also dislikes the taste , so it 's always a battle to get him to swallow . Several weeks later , I got too lazy to continue cutting up his pills and shoving crushed portions down his throat twice a day , so I reverted back to giving him a whole pill in the morning . He 's used to it now , so he has n't puked it back up since then , although he still dislikes the taste . He also has n't limped and/or complained about his aching hip and joints , so it 's totally worth it . He 's been taking it everyday for a year now . He chases balls like a puppy again , and enjoys long walks .
4 #### Gunnar is about 10 years old . He is a huge lab and is beginning to feel the effects of age . This product eases his way in the world . Your prices were good and service as described . Thanks .
4 #### Pup has been on this for about a month .. starting to see slight improvement in the movement .. don't expect a overnight improvement in any of these products .. need to look for the long term .. will update as time goes on
5 #### Already knew that the product was working for the dogs who are 12 and 9 years of age , but at $ 14.oo a bottle in WalMart I was looking for a better deal and I found it ! Kudos to you ... you beat WalMart !
5 #### I gave this to my 7 - year - old Shar - Pei mix because he was walking funny from time to time . So I thought he might need some type of supplement to strengthen his hip and joint . It must have worked because at the moment he is wrestling with a puppy , and he has a huge grin on his face !
4 #### My only complaint is that for a 40 - lb dog ( and below ) you have to cut the pills in half . And they crumble more than cut . Use a pill cutter for better results . Directions : one dose each morning and evening .
5 #### I was very happy with the product , my dogs love it . I went to purchase more and the price was almost double . I was sad to see that as I am buying another brand now . I understand prices go up , but almost double ? Please .
3 #### Would be nice if this was a tablet that my dog would eat without extreme persuasion ... but it is n't . I have about a 50 % success rate with him eating them on his own , the other half of the time , he spits it out .
5 #### we give them to the dog to help hips
2 #### It does n't appear to be working too well . I am trying different items to find what works best and this showed the least results out of the 3 we have tried so far .
5 #### He actually will eat these ! Most I have to crush and mix with food .
5 #### Regularly order this for our dogs . Love the size
5 #### I have 2 weimaraners and I want them to have strong joints . I have n't had any problems with their joints or anything yet . They get a lot of exercise and I think this supplement will help them to keep strong joints .
5 #### Great product that helps our dogs greatly . We do dog rescue of elderly dogs and other sick or injured dogs . This medication / supplement helps tremendously with them walking down stairs to go outside . We really liked the results and the dogs look forward to their morning " treats " because they apparently taste good ( although I have n't tried them ) . Strongly recommended .
3 #### Here again the Dog , has the word . But he will not take them without Peanut butter .
4 #### Good product . Its an afforable option for me to give my dogs some glucosamine as a preventative measure and overall health ! My girl eats them as treats if i break them in half but my male is more difficult and i have to crush them in pb , wet food or mix it into dinner with a crushed treat or he wo n't take them .
5 #### My dog seems to be in much less discomfort after a long walk or a evening of chasing her ball . She is almost 10 and is n't ready to slow down quite yet .
5 #### I 've been giving these to my 6 year old Shepherd . I went to advanced strength because I noticed he 's still pretty stiff getting up after being on the regular strength for several months . He really likes the taste of these . It 's just like a treat for him . So I 've no complaint about these , I just do n't think they were strong enough for my dog . Hopefully the advanced strength will work a little better .
2 #### She fought me daily on this one . Something about it just made her not want to eat it . I did notice it smelled different than the one I 'm giving her now . This one was a morning battle every day .
5 #### This has really helped my lab mix with his arthritic hips . Before I started using this , he struggled with jumping up on his ottoman and struggled getting up on all fours . I gave this to him with good results . When it was time to order more , I decided on the Advanced Strength for even better results . Thank You ! He is so much better and even friskier !
4 #### We have used this product with our dogs for several years . While there is no way of knowing how the dogs would have fared without the medication , they seem to be active and pain - free into old age . Maybe I should be eating these things .
5 #### From the point that our dogs they are about 5 yrs . old , we use this product as a regular part of our their diet . This seems to help for our Lab 's . Have n't had any problems so far.for years.on . It seems to help
4 #### After ACL repairs to my yellow lab 's leg , this was very helpful in aiding with her recovery . I continue to give it to her daily to prevent future joint and bone problems . They must taste good because she acts like they are a treat when offered to her .
4 #### My dogs love them , and I 'm very pleased with the fast shipping , I have been buying them from Amazon for over a year
4 #### My dog suffers from elbow dysplasia and this really helps him move . It 's almost a cure , really they are good .
5 #### Always check with the vet to be sure , the product worked great on my 2 small dogs , with a great price ! ! !
2 #### I have to hide them in cheese - and even that is only successful half the time . They are large too ...
2 #### I purchased these after advice from a dog trainer . I have been using them for over two months , and have yet to see a difference . My dog 's also do n't really like the taste , so it takes some coaxing to get them to take it . The look at it more like medicine rather than a dog treat . Maybe it will work for other dogs , just has n't worked for mine ... yet
3 #### My puppy gets car sick , so I had high hopes that these would work for him . However , he still throws up like a champ after having these , so they just did n't work for me . He does gobble them down , so they must taste okay , they just do n't work for calming him down .
5 #### Knocks our boys out ! It takes about 20 - 30 minutes to kick in but lasts all day .
2 #### Did n't help calm my little dog and I think it gave her diarrhea .
5 #### These work great for calming down my anxious blue healer / English Shepard mix that is very anxious .
3 #### My dog likes the taste of this treat , but we have n't noticed any improvement in her anxiety or increase in calmness with use . It might work well for dogs with only mild nervousness or anxiety .
5 #### This helps to take the edge off of my anxious chihuahua . I give him one 2 - 3 times a day to help with his separation anxiety and before stressful events like fireworks . I have a prescription for him for stressful events , but except for car rides , this treat has kept him calm enough to not need the prescription the past couple of months . So I am now a monthly subscriber . The price has been reasonable too .
5 #### We found the Pet - Ease chewable tablets a while ago and they really help settle the dog down when we take her on longer road trips in the car , but it was sometimes difficult to get her to take them . She likes the wafers much better , and they work just as well .
5 #### I give my 110lbs German Shepard only 2 - 3 every once in a while and I believe they calm her down , she gets anxious with heavy winds , thunderstorms , fireworks or alot of company is overwhelming .
2 #### AGAIN WITH SOFT ? I ca n't get my dog to eat , chew something hard . His teeth were never developed correctly a genetic flaw . MORE money down the drain .
5 #### My pup will not eat any of the anxiety pills or treats I 've tried . He eats these and they work ! He is not get sick in the car
5 #### All natural ingredients , and it works wonderfully . The great thing about buying from Amazon , is that it is always available !
5 #### My dog would always vomit on car rides but not anymore ! These wafers really do work . You need to feed it to your dog at least 30 minutes before your car ride since they do need a chance to get into their system . I have noticed that they will calm my dog a bit , like taking the edge off . However , they do not make him slow or drowsey which is fantastic because I still want him to feel like himself and be able to play and run around . I love this product ! ! !
4 #### These really did seem to help calm my dog , whom for some reason get car sick a lot . Even when we have to leave him at home by himself we gave him these and he calms down nicely . Would buy again
3 #### Does n't work for motion sickness . Calms pup down though
1 #### dog would not eat them too dry and hard
3 #### I honestly do n't know if they work or not . My extremely picky German Shepard puppy will not eat them .
5 #### We have tried a few different treats to help our pup with car sickness but either they did n't really work well or she did n't like them even if we mixed with her favorite food . These were really a lifesaver ! As we prepared for a 1500 - mile move in a U - Haul truck these were our last hope and thank goodness they work like a charm ! Plus , she LOVES them and will even beg for them ! During our 4 days crammed in the cab of our U - Haul she stayed can and relaxed and did not throw up at all ... Not once ! And that is great since any car ride over 20 minutes almost always resulted in her throwing up . We did use this in combination with a " Motion Sickness for Dogs " oil blend but there have been times we have used these treats without the oil and she has still done great . We will ALWAYS have these on hand ! ! !
3 #### I think you need to give your dog double weekday the weight to treat ratio is in order for them to work . Even for a 12 lb . dog we gave them to , one was n't strong enough .
3 #### It really did n't make any chances to my dog before getting her in the car
3 #### I can only give this 3 stars bc of the fact that both my dogs eat it without hassle , however , it does nothing to calm them down . I have 2 very excitable yorkies and this did nothing for them . Because I purchased it already , I give it to them as a treat once in a while .
3 #### My dog did not seem to care for the taste and even when he did eat them they did not seem to do much for him .
5 #### Our 8 month old puppy gets car sick even on short trips and that is sad . Have used these several times for short car rides and he did not get sick . Like these because they are natural and seem to be working . Flash likes them too so much that we have them stored in a top cabinet out of his reach .
1 #### Did n't help my pup at all . She still vomits in the car .
4 #### This works alright for my dog 's car sickness . She went from throwing up in the car about every 15 minutes to once a trip . She still is shaky and anxious on car rides .
5 #### These chews are great ! My dogs really enjoy the taste . I have 3 dogs and I can give 1 or 2 treats and it works pretty quickly . I do have 1 dog that is pretty big and tends to get real worked up whenever it thunders and I have to give him 6 of these treats . It takes about 30 to 45 minutes to kick in , but most of the time it does the trick for him too .
1 #### This product was totally ineffective for my dog . My dilemma is , should I throw it away or let someone else try it .
4 #### We buy these for our two mini weiner dogs , who when we travel get a little bit anxious and it seems to calm them down just enough so that they are manageable . They do n't mind eating them , in fact they gobble them down . It is not a magic pill and it does nt make them behave like zombies but it takes enough of the edge off that they can at least get to sleep . I know for us whenver we have to go long distances in the car we use these without fail .
1 #### Did n't work at all for my car anxiety dog . She was exactly the same
3 #### I purchased these in hopes that it would help with our puppy 's car sickness . She was not real keen on eating one at first but did after I broke it in half . The first time I gave her one she was pretty calm for a couple of hours . The second time she still was n't excited about eating it but did eventually . I took her for a car ride a couple of hours later and she still got car sick . So I can only say they did not work for the car sickness but did calm her down for a few hours .
5 #### My little Meeka loved them .... she gets one before her bath and grooming .
5 #### I used them to help with my dog 's separation anxiety and to help her settle down at night time . They worked within 15 minutes of her taking them and she just laid down and relaxed until she eventually fell asleep . And we 're talking about a rowdy pitbull .
3 #### I have to put peanut butter on it for her to eat it . By itself she wo n't touch it . I do n't mind putting the peanut butter on it . It seems to work . Have to give it an hour to 45 minutes prior for it to kick in .
5 #### We have a very high strung german shorthaired pointer who did n't like going in car for rides , this has helped alot . We give her 2 about 30 minutes before going in car and she is much calmer .
5 #### Calms down my 80 lb . , 2 year old , golden retriever for a few hours Just enough to use 1 tab to calm him . Recommended dose for sleep times .
3 #### My puppy really likes these , however they do not seem to do anything to relax him or make him tired ... oh well .
5 #### I give 3 of these to my dog in the morning before I take her to Doggy Daycare or any other time she 's going to ride in the car . She used to throw up every time we drove somewhere . After we started giving these she stopped . Forgot them one day , and she threw up like she used to . I 'm 100 % certain these are what helps her . Needless to say this product is a must for us now .
5 #### Have a really shy and fearful dog in the shelter where I volunteer and these help him relax so that we can work with him .
1 #### Did n't have any effect of my fear aggressive dog .
1 #### These wafers did not help my dog 's motion sickness in the car . Based on other reviews , I was really hopeful , but after only an hour my little girl got sick all over the place . I also tried to give her a wafer a few times at home , she always ate them , but did not help with her being hyper all the time ( she 's a Pomeranian ) . Really wished they worked ...
5 #### Works like a charm on my high anxiety GSD .
5 #### This chewable are amazing , My mix Huskie Malamute , all the sudden has been howling to the extreme , he walks and run a lot during the day but lately when is bed time he is just not himself like he was before , he is a big boy so I gave him 4 tables to start and with only one dose he is back to normal , lying down without all the noise , and going to sleep peacefully ! ! ! I was ready to take it him to vet , I thought something was wrong with him but after I reading some of the reviews I decided to give it a try . It makes me happy that he is able to go to bed and be calm again , highly recommend it !
5 #### It 's the only thing that keeps us sane with a very fussy , elderly English Bulldog . I also passed a few on to our friends & they have also done the same with their friends . I think this company owes me some kick back ! Ha ! Seriously though when our baby boy gets fussy for whatever reason this helps a ton . It calms him down & sometimes he will even take a nap . Our friend 's dog has issues with storms & other events & she ca n't believe how much better this works for her little guy than some sad prescription or the thunder coat ( seen that but never used it ) . Worth every penny to try . I suggest going with the lower dosage first . According to the ingredients I would dare say it 's almost like giving your dog a Thanksgiving dinner & a beer . Snooze central .
5 #### These treats work well to calm down my extremely active puppy ! Needed just a little more than recommended .
4 #### Used these about four times so far and they seem to work . Once you figure out when to give it to them they do seem to work . The first time I gave them to my dog I gave it to her about a half hour before we left and she still got sick . The next few times I gave it to her about 15 minute before we left and that seemed to do the trick .
4 #### These tablet have been a lifesaver for my Chihuahua during thunderstorms . They take about an hour to kick in and usually last about 8 to 10 hours .
5 #### These are wonderful . Calm my dog in times of stress .
3 #### Did not work as well for my animals as I had hoped , did give a sense of calm .
5 #### These seemed to help our dog get through the 4th of July . One treat was fine for her 37 lbs .
5 #### Love this stuff . Calms down my unruly American Bulldogs and Vizsla when I am ready to go to bed . About to re - order !
4 #### My Boston loves the nutri - vet pet - ease . We got her the treats because she was digging in our flower beds when ever we left the house . The treats have worked on most occasions . We will continue to purchase the Nutri - vet pat - ease wafers .
5 #### my dog stayed calm like it states when we were traveling
5 #### These work very well for our little 11 - pound yorkie . We got them to use when we moved to a new house and to help with her separation anxiety . They really seem to help calm her down a bit without making her drowsy . I definitely recommend giving them to your dog at least 30 minutes before an event , such as taking them to the vet , in order to give them plenty of time to work . Also , the calming effect does n't seem to last more than a couple of hours , but overall they worked for us very well !
2 #### Very hard to review because I really could n't tell any difference in the dogs behavior . He was having a pretty good day anyway .
3 #### My dog prefers the crunchy biscuits made by the same company , because these have a gummy - like texture that he does n't like . These are no miracle cure , but when given about 1 hour before bedtime , he seems to noticeably calm down .
3 #### Seems to work OK but I do not like the labeling ! Dosage listed as 1 wafer for every 10 pounds but in very small print below that is says not to exceed 6 wafers per day ! ! My dogs are 75 , 100 and 120 pounds so the final note that says repeat as needed is totally wrong : can not even give them the dosage stated . I did give the 100 pound dog 10 wafers before I used a magnifying glass to read the rest . She was very thirsty and I encouraged her to drink . She was sleepy but not unable to walk outside and seems to have no ill effects this AM . The other two got the max of 6 wafers . All were still a bit stressed over fireworks for New Years but not quite as much as usual . Pictures of the label for the same product in chicken flavor clearly show the dosage .
1 #### I was hoping to use these for a long car trip but they did not work at all . I ended up using DAP spray to help my dog stay calm during our trip .
3 #### My husband and I adopted a dog from a shelter who had separation anxiety , whenever we left the house . These chew work somewhat , but do n't seem to be as fast working or as potent as Vetri - Science Composure Small Canine , 30 Mini Bite - Sized Chews . I also do n't think they taste as well because we have to coat them heavily in peanut butter for him to eat these chews , and ordinarily he is not a picky eater at all .
5 #### These work great . Not the first time I 've purchased
3 #### My dog love these as a treat , but they did nothing to ease her anxiety . Bummer .
5 #### I bought these and counted them -- had 76 in my package , so that 's probably a pretty good ballpark count and a very good price -- quite a bit cheaper than the tablets in the 8 oz . package . These chewable tabs seem to have about the same ingredients as the tablets ( Ingredient lists are written up differently and a little hard to compare ) and my 6 - yr old dogs love them . They each ( 12 & 14 lb . ) get one in the morning before our walk and two each if we 're expecting rain , thunder , a car trip , or a house full of guests . Our male seems to calm down within 30 - 40 minutes ; our female does n't seem to be affected as much . But we were having trouble with male lunging at the female and growling every time she tried to get close to me . He even would growl and run at my husband if he got in bed after I did . So along with the Pet - Ease we started a rigorous removal and scolding any time he growled -- he seems to be getting the idea that we wo n't tolerate this nasty behavior -- nonetheless , we think the Pet - Ease has had some good effects .
5 #### these genuinely work for my dog . I have a 155 lbs great dane and have to give him the full dose but these naturally take the edge off for him . he was a rescue who was severely abused and can get nervous when I have company over and I do n't want my dog to be drugged just to relax . its sort of like having a beer after a long day , he is just at ease . and he loves these , no issue in getting him to eat one .
5 #### The dogs love these . They smell kind of awful but apparently to humans and not to dogs !
2 #### Did nt work for my dogs as much I as wanted it to . Using the recommended dose my dog was just as wild but with a little stomach trouble . Thanks but no thanks .
4 #### My dog is an older dog and has never liked storms or fireworks . We use these during the rough storms and firework season and they help him a bit . They are not 100 % perfect , but they seem to work for a few hours .
3 #### My senior Maltese has separation anxiety and she seems to do well with it . She just does n't like the taste .
1 #### yep . my counter surfer grabbed the whole jar while i was at work . i thought , well gee this might be a good time to brush him out , he must be REALLY relaxed ! nope . in fact , i could n't even tell which of the two dogs ate it , as there was no noticeable difference in their activity . on the up - side , there was also no adverse affect either .
5 #### I finally found something that worked for my jack russell . I give her two a day and it seems to help .
4 #### I give these to my dogs at night before bed so they can be calm and sleep . they love the taste and it sort of works . its not the magic cure for calming hyper dogs , but for some when you first give it to them they kind of mellow out .
3 #### These are alright for the most part . They did ease a little bit of anxiety ... but not significantly . My dogs would eat them eventually ( in their own time ) , but they were n't exactly crazy for the taste . Not 100 % sure if I 'd buy them again for my dogs , only because they did n't seem to enjoy the taste . These may work better for someone else 's dog .
2 #### I bought these because we were taking our two Pugs on a road trip , and they do n't really like riding in the car . They travel in crates in the back seat , and I was hoping these wafers would just help them to lay down and go to sleep . No such luck ... I did n't notice that they made any difference at all . Plus , the first ingredient on the label is brewers yeast , which is not good for dogs .
5 #### My dog gets awful anxiety in the car . She seems calm but really she is so anxious that once she s been on the ride for about 30 mins or more you hear that awful sound ... dog vomitting . I got these treats as well as the thundershirt to fix her anxiety and they worked ! I use both to be safe but I have used just the treats when Its hot out and it totally worked . No more dog throw up and I can take my girl on trips with me without the worry ! I highly suggest these treats if your dog gets sick on long car rides ! Also try to keep your dog 's main meal of the day away from the time of travel to be safe . I have a 7 year old , 37 lb female Blue Heeler and she 's had this problem since she was a pup .
5 #### My dog loves this product . He is a boarder collie and is always busy . At night I keep the pet - ease by my chair and he set and waits for his little pet - ease bone before bed time .
3 #### The dogs do not hesitate to eat these ; however , it does n't seem to calm them any during storms , etc . Not 100 % sure it 's worth the purchase .
2 #### do nt waste your money .... just make dog drowsy , I really do n't like giving my dog these , but its better than a tranquilizer from the vet . I use 1/2 the recomended amount on my 40 lb dog
5 #### I live in the mountains in CO and raise dogs . Taking adult dogs down the 25 mile mountain switchback road often necessitates stops to clean up after sick dogs . Puppies are even worse ! Just a piece of one of these for a small dog solves that problem totally ! I was having to use Baby Benadryl , and I do n't like drugging my dogs or puppies . This works ! LOVE IT !
5 #### My nine - month old Plott gets rambunctious at times , especially after dinner . Not a good thing , as her breed is prone to intestinal " bloat " . When she wants to get wild , a few sets of " puppy push - ups " with two of these as treats calms her down quickly . So happy I found them on Amazon !
1 #### kinda stink . The Chill Out ones smell better . You do n't know until you try them . Good for other dogs it seems .
4 #### My pit gets bad seperation anxiety so I tried her on these for a month and I 'm pleased so far . Just bought another container . I have to leave my pit for work in the morning so I give her about 4 - 6 of these before I leave and I can see the calmness take over . NO more crying for hours and no sloggish behavior either . ALL natural and it works for us . thx
5 #### My collie ( and every dog I 've had ) is terrified of thunderstorms and fireworks . I 've tried other anti - anxiety products , and none of them work as well as these , other than Rx drugs that I do n't want to use . As soon as I suspect a storm is coming , I give her a couple of these and she is much calmer . without acting drugged . Once thunder has begun , she is too anxious to take one , so I suggest giving them ahead of time . This also works very well if she is given a couple of them before we trim her nails ; she 's very cooperative instead of being nervous and pulling back her paws . She loves the taste , and thinks she 's been given a crunchy treat instead of an anti - anxiety wafer , so be sure to keep them out of the dog 's reach ! I like the fact that this product uses all - natural ingredients , so I feel I can give these to her as often as needed . Instructions call for one wafer per 10 lbs . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### I wrote a pretty lengthy review for this item when I ordered them before . Long story short , I love them ! Obviously I do because this is my re - order .
5 #### I was nervous about giving any type of mood altering snacks to my 3 dogs - I came across these at Petsmart right before they switched to a different product line ( BOO ! ) - I was dropping my dogs at the PetHotel and they were very stressed because it is not often that they are away from me - A few of these little snacks and they mellowed out . -- Now I order them through Amazon b / c Petsmart no longer carries them . I work from home and there are some days that my youngest dog is pretty hyper . I can not have that while I am working b / c I am speaking to clients over the phone and they are not to know that I am not actually sitting in the corporate office -- on extra hyper mornings I will give him a could of these and after a few minutes he has settled down -- they also work great with the anxiety that my dogs get during monsoon season . I recommend these items to anyone who has a dog who is usually pretty mellow , but needs a little assistance during stressful situations . I wish that Petsmart still carried them and not the GNC product line that they now carry .
5 #### These are great . My maltese really loves them and they keep her calm . I will buy these again and again .
5 #### We used this originally for our Australian Shepherd , who suffers from fear aggression and anxiety , but we decided to try it on our Border Collie / Great Pyrenees cross who developed severe allergic itching . It not only helped settle our Aussie ( along with her Babble Ball ) when we were at work , but it helped our Pyc with her itching somewhat until her allergy tests came back and the vaccine was manufactured . It also helps our older Border Collie sleep at night while she is on Prednisone for an immune disorder . I think for the price , it 's worth a try if you need to calm a dog on a temporary or occasional basis . I hope it will also help my Aussie when the next thunder storm comes along .
5 #### my dog loves them no matter if it is the wafer or soft chew and they really work ! ! ! Great product !
5 #### I have a Miniature Pinscher named Noah that I rescued and few years ago . He has been dealing with anxiety and stress issues since I adopted him into our family , but seemed to get worse within the past year . He even started running and hiding under my bed when my other two dogs would start playing with their squeaky toys . I recently took a vacation with my dogs to Florida where one of my best friends live . She noticed Noah 's anxiety issues and gave me a sample of Pet Ease that she had at home . I noticed a slight difference in Noah after being on Pet Ease for about 2 weeks . I decided to keep Noah on the pills and took a trip to the pet store to purchase a bottle . He has now been on them for 2 months and Pet Ease has worked wonders for him ! He has even started playing with his toys and rarely hides under my bed . From my personal experience this product did wonders for my dog Noah and I will continue to keep him on Pet Ease . They are also easy to give , he eats them just like a treat .
5 #### I used these for my JRT when she went on the plane ride home with me . She is a HYPER dog . These were great . Really calmed her down .
1 #### The title says it all - every single one of my dogs , from 19 to 88 pounds each , all rejected these calming " treats . " Pretty funny , actually , to watch them spit out food when normally they 're quite enthusiastic about anything given to them by hand !
5 #### Bella is a lab / beagle mix and full of energy . She loves to chase the bubbles and this gives her more exercise and keeps her more focused than just running around . I even do them in the house when it is raining ! Great product !
1 #### This product seems like it would be a lot of fun , but as it turns out , the bubbles are watered down and the applicator is too short . With the solution being watered down , it only blows a few bubbles at a time and even then , it 's not continous . You can dip & blow as many times as you want , but it just runs out of the applicator into your hands , or onto your clothes . It doens't damage your clothing , but who wants to walk around with wet bubble solution on their clean clothes ? So the applicator is to short and it falls into the bottle NEVER to be returned unless you do like I did , and find a twig in the grass to help dig it out . It was no fun for me because I had to do extra , extra work to get three bubbles , and it was no fun for my dog [ Mabel ] because she spent more time waiting for me to blow a bubble than actually chasing them . Boooo !
5 #### I got these with the bubble blower awhile back for my Golden Retriever . He LOVED them ! ! We just got 2 puppies so I went on the hunt for these specific bubbles again ! The GR loved to play with the bubbles and the machine made it super easy ! Definately one you can use in the house - I had no problems with residue or anything . I am looking forward to their arrival so that I can watch the puppies have the same amount of fun and so that we can use them inside on the rainy days as well !
5 #### My parents ' springer spaniel is crazy for bubbles . I got him the Gazillion Bubbles Fetch a Bubble at the local pet store along with some chicken flavored bubbles . I 've never seen the dog so happy . His tail is going so fast he ca n't run straight ! We tried the bubble gun too , but the Fetch a Bubble is far superior .
2 #### Right after I took it out of the package - before the dog even got to it . I wo n't buy this brand again .
2 #### I purchased this for my two labradors to play tug with . The Tuff Balls are the standard , pretty durable balls , but the rope / weave that attaches them did n't last a day . My dogs are average chewers and I was quite disappointed that it did n't last long . I ended up having to cut the balls free and just let them play with those alone .
5 #### Program is the safest long lasting flea treatment for pets-- I used to work in a veterinary hospital and I have seen many cats have serious reactions to Advantage and Frontline , which are topical pesticides . Read the inserts for Advantage and Frontline , it says that they are NOT safe for sick animals , young kittens , etc , etc . My cat is allergic to both Frontline and Advantage . Frontline gave him a lump in his neck and Advantage gave him a bald spot where I applied it , and he kept trying to lick the spot . Program is super safe-- you can put it in a dish and mix it with tuna and your cat will eat it right up . You can use it with Capstar ( also super safe , but not long lasting ) to kill live fleas if your cat picks one up . This is the best monthly flea control to keep your cat safe and healthy ! I have used it for almost a decade and I will not use any other product on my cat .

5 #### Worked great , sadly they are not available now and Little City Pets supply of the same stuff does not hold up for my pets as after two months on treatment my pets were covered in fleas .
5 #### So far it seems to be working . My cat is strictly indoors , so I only had to give him a few doses over a couple months to get rid of what he had . Since then he has been happy and healthy all the way around .
5 #### What can I say ? It did what it was supposed to do , got rid of tape worms . And did it at less than half of what they cost at the pet store , for the exact same product , exact same size . Shipping was very fast and my pets and I thank you .
5 #### I operate a small scale rescue , so having a LOT of worm tabs on hand is a good idea . At vets and feed stores these can go for up to $ 25 a bottle ! They work , and they are cheap . As long as you follow the weight limits to a tee , you 're grand .
5 #### When I realized my dog had tapeworm I did not know what to do . I got on the net looked up what I needed without a prescription ( because I just could not afford a trip to the vet ) and found this product . I then called the pet stores but they charged way too much for it . I finally found the best price on Amazon and was able to get the meds to make my pup all well . It is a great product . It worked quickly and my pup felt better in a couple of days ! Yea !
3 #### Two months of use so far , mediocre results . Still fighting fleas . Using Capstar as well , which kills the adults . It IS easier to get the cats to take than putting the drops on , which they hate .
2 #### One cat got ill . The other tried to lick it off all day . There was so many problems with little results .
5 #### We had fleas resistant to Frontline and Advantage . Capstar & Program solved the problem . There is quite a bit of liquid in a Program tube , but we sprinkle it on food over two days . We crush the Capstar tablet and give it in food . It must taste all right .
5 #### worked about 7 hours after being treated but the remarkable health and wellness that my dog has now is so great
1 #### I purchased this for my cats to try after a recent flea incident in the house . I tried to mix the suspension with their food ( I tried dry food and wet treats ) ... they sniffed it and walked away . I then followed the instructions and had to hold the cat and squirt the suspension into their mouth . It was messy , they hated it .. and I felt horrible trying to get them to take all of it . I 'm sticking with Frontline Plus ... much easier for my cats .
4 #### I like this product . I did wish to purchase pills and got the oral liquid . Its all good , just convenient to have pills . Now we are working on getting rid of adult fleas !
5 #### just fine , and at a discounted price from some of the other products , veterinary and other , that are on the market . I hide them in just a bit of cheese or bread and dogs never know they took a pill .
5 #### I gave this to my little Cocker when she picked up tape worms from getting fleas from the out door kitties . They were small enough to make a little pocket in a chunk of cheese and insert the tablet . She did n't even know she had been given a tablet . The bottle was enough to give her a repeat worming at the appropriate time to make sure the parasites were eliminated .
5 #### We worm our dogs 2x a year with these and Nemex to conquer all the worms a dog could get ! No issues , easy to use and affordable instead of going to Vet and doing the " monthly preventative " !
1 #### Just go to the vet and get the good stuff . This is a waste of money , like most over the counter " tape " de - wormers . Went to the vet after this " treatment " and had instant complete results . These tabs did nothing .
5 #### Our little puppy showed no more signs of worms within 1 - 2 days ! Will buy this product again if need be .
5 #### This is the best flea product in the world ! I had a cat that was allergic to everything . Flea bath , treatmant , even it being on the other cats and not him . I discovered this product and he had a very happy life ! I use it still on his 2 siblings and the new kitten . It 's wonderful !
2 #### I do n't know what is going on with the fleas this year . They seem to be impervious to prevention medication . I tried Revolution , which worked for one month , and then stopped working . Advantage did nothing and Program is the same . My cat 's ears look polka dotted with some bleeding sores unless I keep him inside . At least I do n't have fleas in the house .
5 #### I used program many years ago , then had a 14 yr span with no fleas . A few months ago we noticed fleas on our three cats . The newest way to treat fleas is with topical applications , so we gave it a try . I hated it , and so did our cats . They smell and create an oily mess of their fur . I was also worried about them ingesting it because they groom each other . So I went back to Program . You add it to their food once a month , they do n't even know it 's in there . It does take a couple of months to be fully effective because it does n't kill the adults , just the eggs . I 'm happy to say that I 'm going on the fourth month of using Program and we have no fleas ! I 'm going to keep using it through the summer just to make sure new fleas do n't find our yard !
4 #### Easy to use , works well for the two feral cats I care for . Put in food and they ca n't smell it .
4 #### I was sick of Frontline and Advantage . They were beginning to lose effectiveness and I did n't like the weird , chemical smell and the way they made my kitties act . This is a great alternative , it really does weaken the fleas , I used it for 3 months straight and most of the fleas on my cats are gone . It did n't completely eradicate them , but combined with Capstar this is a safer program that does not harm kitties or people . It did not make my cats sick at all and the hardest part is getting them still long enough to squeeze the tube in their mouths . They would not touch their food when this was mixed in to it . My cats are pretty smart and figured out something was up so I did waste one tube but that 's ok , live and learn . It works . It made the fleas weaker . They were easier to smoosh . That gives me great pleasure , smooshing fleas . I recommend using this program concurrently with Capstar for instant and long - term flea death !
5 #### Due to a mix up with products , this product was incorrectly reviewed . The product has not been used as of this writing and can not be critiqued at this time .
5 #### My Siberian Husky was scrapping her bum across the ground in a comical looking fashion . As amusing as it was I knew something was wrong . I could have gone to the vet and paid $ 300 for a diagnosis and treatment . Instead I did some research online and quickly narrowed down what it could be . I found small white grains in her stool the next day , which settled the matter . I spend $ 16 instead of $ 300 , but I could n't have done it without these pills . I wo n't hesitate to use this product again ; I highly recommend it .
5 #### Easy to give and the dogs did not show any signs of being medicated . However , the tape worms were gone in days and stayed away , no repeat dosing needed .
4 #### I use it for my cat to help prevent fleas . However he tends to run out and probably collect more adult fleas which I 'm interested in killing / preventing infestation immediately . Keep in mind this medicine only kills flea eggs and does not work as immediately as the topical flea medicines . I would prefer to mix this stuff into his food and not have to deal with wrangling my cat down to apply cold topical on his bare skin but in the end , I think I have to go back to the topical . :(
5 #### I have a german shepherd puppy who I was fairly certain had tapeworms and wanting to get him fixed fast I gave these pills a shot . They are fairly easy to administer , they are not really big and can easily be hidden in food or favorite treats , and my puppy suffered no ill effects that I was aware of . We were n't 100 % certain that our puppy had tapeworms but he did have some fleas when we got him so we wormed him as a precaution and I plan on doing a second dose 3 weeks after the first dose(he was a hair under 30 lbs for his first dosing so recieved 2 pills and will need 3 pills at his next dosing as per the directions ) .
5 #### Tradewinds Tape Worm Tablets worked great and now my Cocker Spaniel is worm - free ... Medicine delivered in a timely manner also ... Had taken my pet to the Veterinarian 3 - times in 3 months and he still had tape worms until I received this product and administered it to him .
5 #### I have four dogs . I have to treat all four even if only one is infected , which means that my costs are quadrupled . After much research , I decided to try this product due to its minimal side effects and fast action , not to mention the reasonable cost . I could n't have made a better choice . No adverse affects , fast acting , low cost , and 100 % effective . What more could I ask for ?
5 #### Fast shipping and worked so well I only needed it for two months and my indoor cat became flea free after treating the house . Thanks for getting us flea free
4 #### Works well but I think the fleas are getting resistent to this stuff . Maybe need to switch it up with some other chemicals . It works good most of the time though .
3 #### " seems " to do the trick . I 'm not a scientist or a vet . It 's " insurance " and seems to keep the scratching down .
5 #### Worked so well ; I did not even have to use the remaining dose available in the packet . Thank you !
5 #### This is the only product I use on my pets as it works really good
4 #### As expected ... outside cat , so I really ca n't tell if she actually has fleas or not !
5 #### Absolutely works , unlike drugstore brands . Gets rid of fleas in the same day . Keeps them from coming back . I suggest gently brushing cat fur at neck to get rid of any loose fur . Be sure to apply to cat 's skin , not just on top of fur . Expect scratching to briefly increase a few hours after applying . Then , bye bye fleas .
5 #### I PREFER ADVANTAGE ORIGINAL BUT THIS IS ALSO GOOD . FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS AND DO NOTPUT THIS ON ANY OTHER ANIMAL BUT A CAT OR YOU CAN KILL YOUR OTHER PETS .
3 #### Made multiple purchases of this product and it did not seem to keep the fleas at bay . I used it and the instructions stated fleas would abate within 48 hours . 72 hours after I used it , the fleas were alive and kicking . I 'm pretty sure I saw a bunch of them gang up , point and laugh at me . My cat fleas might have been immune , I 'm not sure . Still looking for a long term product that will work for us .
5 #### We agd bad flea infestation . Day I put this product on my cats , they have n't seen a flea since !
5 #### This is the best flee product for cats , I have tried other product but not compares to this . Its easy to apply and most important it odorless .
5 #### Great for cat flea maintenance - do n't use anything else !
3 #### It kills the fleas and lasts about 3 weeks . I gave it 3 stars because it took a really long time to ship to my house .
2 #### Too bad Bayer did not keep it 's regular formula of Advantage . This OTC product does not knock down fleas at all . I would rather pay prescription price for the original than be able to purchase this at retail stores everywhere . It just no longer works for us .
5 #### Ordered off reviews online and from a vet when my cat got fleas . I use monthly now as a preventative measure . I 'd do ANYTHING to keep from having to go through that again .
4 #### Have been using this product for several years now on our indoor / outdoor female tabby ... have never had flea one . She spends a lot of time in our flower beds during the warm weather and lays in the grass sunning herself . Would not use anything else , this works .
1 #### This crap does n't work in florida , even for my indoor cats . go to your vet and get the pill .
5 #### We were having fleas everywhere . Those lil buggers would n't die . Got this , and the next day they were gone . Love it and its definitely worth the money .
5 #### So far so good the product seems to be working . shipped quickly .
5 #### Only Advantage II works the best on my four cats !
5 #### I have been using both Program and it 's partner , Capstar , for over 10 years with fabulous results . I found this flea medication after having 3 dogs infested with fleas from our neighborhood squirrels and raccoons . I tried EVERYTHING short of flea bombing my house . As a last ditch effort I used Capstar ( immediate formula to kill existing fleas ) and then the Program ( monthly maintenance)and could not believe how fast it worked ! Seriously , not sure what happened to the one star reviewer except maybe they purchased some out of date product , because this stuff works - hands down . When my vet asked me if I wanted to purchase Frontline for flea control and I told them I used Program and Capstar they could NOT argue with my choice ! Do n't waste time and money on the other stuff that does n't work , get control of the fleas on your animals right away the right way ! ! No , I do not work for any of these companies , just very pleased and excited about the results of this product !
4 #### It works well . The main things I have found with Program is that it takes awhile to get into the system . You wo n't see immediate results here . It really kicked in good on the 3 to 4 month and from that point on no more eggs , larva or baby fleas . The other thing is it must remain in their blood stream so it has to be given every 30 days . For it to work right you have to kind of commit yourself to using it on a regular basis for the long haul . I think it is worth doing . It does work very well at what it does
2 #### Advantage used to work to rid my indoor cat of fleas , but it certainly does n't anymore !
3 #### did nt work :( I have decided to stop poisoning my cats and keep them indoors . I just hope after 8 years , I have n't totally poisoned them with flea chemicals :( Now that my baby is 8 years old , I 'm scared - and esp since these did n't work any longer , its like the fleas habituated to the chemicals .
5 #### I buy the capsules for flea controle for my other cats , but my " big boy " woun't eat it on his food or stand still to be given it by force . This is the way he gets his !
4 #### I like the new design of the box , but I feel like it takes up more room now . The old package was slimmer and fit in my bag I keep my cat supplies it . But I do think this product will be better than FrontLine .
4 #### These individual dispensers have done the job for my cats . They are easy to open , apply and do not smell . The cat 's fur does not show a oily splotch . No hair loss , which we experienced with other brands .
5 #### We have tried various flea treatments and this is the only one that does the job for us . Have been using it for years , do n't intend switching ever ...........
5 #### This product arrived looking like it had been through the war but the product was intact even if the packaging was n't . Used it on the cats and it works very well . The cats stopped scratching with in a couple of hours and I have n't noticed a flea since .
5 #### Done its job . Happy with the product and shipped on time .
5 #### Advantage works very well on my cats . They tolerate it well , and it gets rid of fleas quickly . I use this every other month on my cats and it controls the fleas very well
1 #### Has n't worked at all . I have 3 cats , all are indoor animals . One got out and picked up fleas in the 3 hours he was out . It just has not worked .
3 #### It worked when I first put it on but after about a week the fleas were back . I purchased some a couple of weeks later from the pet store and the fleas disappeared completely .
3 #### Expensive . I use it because my vet tells me to . I do n't have a flea problem , but my kitties are indoor so I ca n't say for sure this stuff works .
5 #### This year I decided to go cheap and purchase a less expensive brand of flea control ... well I certainly paid for it with a nice infestation of fleas , even on my inside cat ! I went back to this more expensive ( but certainly more reliable ) brand and the fleas have completely gone . I noticed with the cheaper brands they have a lot of liquid and it takes forever for the big greasy spot on the back of the cat 's neck to try . How unsightly ! But with this I could n't even tell if I was putting any on them , it was so discreet . I will definitely be sticking with this from now on .
5 #### Pests love my pests . This kills off the pests I do n't want and helps to keep them from coming back . Hardest part is getting my cats in a leg lock long enough to get it on them , but they are n't very helpful animals in general .
5 #### Dealer had to work with me here .... wanted old Advantage as first advertised in picture which I printed when I purchased it . New product makes cat sick .
2 #### I have used Advantage for years and appreciated how it kept fleas at bay , although I have also been uncomfortable with the idea that I am pouring poison on the back of their necks . I have two cats and only need to use the product every 3 months or so . I 'm not certain if they changed their formula or if it 's because my cat is getting frail and old ( she 's 18 y.o . ) , but the last time I used this product on her she became so severely ill that she could barely move and I thought she was going to die . I have never seen her so sick and it was heartbreaking to witness . After a 24 hour period she slowly recovered , thankfully . I read some other reviews and it looks like others have had this problem and one person said her cat DID die . I do n't like not being made aware of the possibility that I could be killing them by using this product ! As I mentioned , I had been using this product for years so I do n't know why the sudden difference in response . I just wanted to alert others of the possibility that their cat could have a severe reaction -- something the manufacturer should be doing ! ! Unfortunately , my cat now has fleas and I am trying all that I can to remedy the situation , but nothing works as well as these poisons .
5 #### I do n't really like putting this stuff on my kitty so I wait until I see that first sign of bugs and put it on him . He gets mad at me for putting it on him but in 24 hrs the bugs are gone .
5 #### Advantage is the only flea medication that will work on our animals . So a big thanks from my cats ... no more scratching and biting !
4 #### I like this for use on my cats . However , it doesn t last 30 days and I find the need to re apply about every 3 weeks .
5 #### Tried Frontline . Frontline did n't work very well , even after multiple uses . Advantage is amazing . Fleas were literally falling off the cats , in death throes , within an hour after dosage . Definitely recommended for cats . Have n't used on dogs , so can not review canines . :)
5 #### Fleas ! We hates them ! Nasty little bitey bugs . But this stuff kills them- for one application , for an entire month . Easy to use but the little applicator is a teensey bit confusing , do read the instructions . One other " advantage " the cats did n't seem to mind it as much as some other prodcts . And- it works .
4 #### I started walking my cats outside at the beginning of summer , so I knew I had to have some flea protection . I had n't had them on any flea prevention for at least 3 years because they were strictly indoors . Prior to that they would go outside on their own and I used frontline . Frontline seemed to stop working after awhile . I switched to revolution , but that is extremely expensive , especially when you have 3 cats . My only reservation about using this product is that it does n't kill ticks , just fleas . Even so , I thought I 'd give it a try because I figured that I would be able to feel a tick on them as they are always climbing all over me and I 'm constantly rubbing them . So far , so good . No fleas or ticks and it does n't stink nearly as much as frontline .
5 #### For my cat , the older formula advantage seems to work better than their newest one , and my cat seems to tolerate having it applied a little better , too .
1 #### My cat was in perfect health other than a possible case of fleas ( I 'm not even sure of that ) so I took him to the vet for the first time in YEARS for a flea bath . Instead of a flea bath he put this poison on my cat . The very next day my cat began refusing to eat or drink anything , and would just lay on the floor and not move . I called the vet who said the flea medication could n't POSSIBLY harm him because " it 's FDA - approved " ( what a load of B.S. ! ! ! ) . Anyway , this continued for nearly a week until my cat became nothing but skin & bones and was suffering terribly . We finally accepted the fact that it was n't going to get better & had to take it in to be put down . There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Bayer killed my cat with this poison ! ! ! Now I remember why I stay the heII away from doctors ( including vets ) . Please read : [ ... ]
4 #### Product works well to kill all fleas on cats that seem to stay indoors . For outdoor cats there are still some fleas left , just limits the population on outdoor cats . Does n't kill all the fleas on them .
2 #### One of my cats was miserable after we applied it . He worked so hard until he licked it . Became nauseated vomiting and could n't eat for several days . Finally had to take him to vet . Was diagnosed with dehydration from so much vomiting bad to give him IV med and fluids . $ 500 later he is fine .
5 #### Great to buy in " bulk " so to speak . Have too many cats I guess , but so many people dump cats , all are rescued from these terrible cruel jerks .
4 #### cat loves it not . I do n't know why i have to write more to get this in , it is stupid and makes many now want to even write
5 #### I also thought it was cute that the picture on the box looks like my cat too --- no seriously , this product works and I 've never personally had a problem with it on any of my cats . As usual , do be careful what you put on your pet .
5 #### Needed some for my cats . The price was great ! I 'll definitely buy again . Keeps down on the population of fleas and makes my cats more comfortable .
3 #### We put this on our cat monthly . I have noticed her scratching close to the area we put it . I do n't know what it is and I do n't know if others have noticed this or had the same problem . We will try something else for our precious .
5 #### I have used this product for many years . I have tried others and always come back to Advantage because it seems to work the best . I purchase on line because I can purchase a 6 month supply a lot cheaper than at the vet . I was concerned about the expiration dates in the beginning , however , I have never had a problem . My cat is happy , healthy and flea free ! Highly recommend this product for your pet !
5 #### SUPER DUPER GREAT PRODUCT , GO FOR GOLD , YOU'RE IN IT TO WIN THIS IS IT AND DO IT WELL BUY THIS ITEM ! 19 WORDS TO FILL THE REVIEW WOOT ! WOOT !
5 #### I remember the days of flea collars and how ineffective they were . This product is like a miracle . My current cat does n't have fleas but my last cats did , and this worked great . Definitely worth the higher price .
5 #### This is my second time ordering and have had no problems with either purchaseas . My cat has done well with the advantage and has less fleas then with other products . Will buy again .
5 #### Bought this here because I could get it in bulk cheaper for 3 cats , also use this brand because the other leading brand burned my cats skin , just sayin .
4 #### I have used Advantage flea protection for almost 15 years and only the price has increased over time . We may or may not have fleas , hard to find proof , but if an itchy spot shows up on my arm or leg we give the cats the treatment . Seems to work at least for mild flea issues .
5 #### Lick , lick , lick , lick , lick , lick ... does your cat do this ? Licking more than usual ? Does you cat leave you slimey hairball slugs they 've hacked up on your floor or furniture ? Do they pull out their hair in tufts to leave around your house ? If so , look closely , as they may very well have fleas , even if you do n't see them ! This is what all my cats do every year -- and they 're INDOOR CATS ! I have no clue how they get fleas , but every year we go through the same process and they start to drive everyone crazy with their insane licking , their disgusting slimey hairball slugs and their tufts of hair all over the place . However , this solution actually works : Advantage Topical Solution Flea Treatment . Usually within 24 - 48 hours , the symptoms have disappeared and my cats are back to their normal cat - selves . It is n't cheap , but it works .
5 #### We have four cats at home . They do n't go out ever . For years on end they were infested with fleas . We tried EVERYTHING . Every product and every possible thing you may think of . Until we used this product . NO FLEAS . I used to check them everyday and use the flea comb to clean them of the insects . Now I only check them with the comb once a week and I still ca n't believe it . After two months , they still have no fleas . How come ? ? ?
5 #### works as it should . just be sure to de - flea your carpeting .. if your cats are indoor cats ; It 's a good idea to do your yard also . I 'd highly recommend
5 #### We have a 19 pound Maine Coon male cat . Maine Coons ' have many layers of fur and all different lengths . The under pelt is so thick you ca n't part it enough to see the skin . He is an inside cat but still gets his Advantage Purple once a month for prevention . There are many dogs in the area that roam loose so fleas can come in from the dog activity outside . I like the ability to apply Advantage topically and Oscar tolerates it very well . I have read reviews where professional animal care providers say that Advantage is the best topical flea medication available . We get it through Amazon for far less than what the vet charges plus it 's delivered right to our door . No more " out of my way " trips to the vet! ... and complete flea control .
4 #### I ca n't give it 5 stars because I used it in combination with the generic version of Capstar . Making sure to cross the t 's and dot the i 's . As of 3 days later , fleas are gone . Easy to administer ( a welcome relief after attempting to get my kittens to take pills ) . Worth the money .
5 #### Safe , effective , and instant . I 've used this and only this on all of my pets and could n't be happier . Never had a single problem , though my cats do seem to enjoy licking it off each other even though it 's supposed to have a bitter taste to discourage that . If you have more than one animal you may want to be wary of this !
5 #### This product is very effective and works almost immediately . No negative side effects some people complain of . Just make sure to get the right dose based on the weight of the animal .
4 #### This is By Far the better commercial product . Vets use products exactly like this - and it has been proven to work and is safe as long as the user knows what they 're doing . The only time to use this product is when there is a problem . I would not ever use any sort of drug unless the need is called for . The idea of using these types of drugs as a regiment is silly . If you have a flea problem on a constant basis - you need professional exterminators to handle your living conditions . But if , by chance your kitten comes into contact with fleas ( like a neighbor bringing them in or getting them at the Vet ) this product works great . Use the first ' squeezer ' and see if the pests are still around after a month . If so - you 've got the problem , not the kitten . If not - do n't put the animal through the drug any further than needed . It 's just like any other form of chemo - therapy . And I know all about that ... Richard Lewis
3 #### My kittens were infested with fleas and worms when I got them in July ( wonders of rescues ) . Since they were so young initially , I used peppermint - infused castille soap and watch the fleas literally jump off . If you have young kittens or a serious infestation , I would recommend this . I also talked to a woman who bathes dogs at an animal shelter and she recommended using the original ( blue ) Dawn dish soap or baby shampoo . I tested one cat with baby shampoo and one with the peppermint soap and am awaiting results . A few months ago I ordered Advantage Orange hoping to get the fleas to kick it once and for all , but it has so far been ineffective . All of our cats are indoor only and we have hardwoods , so really no place where fleas would live in the house ( and we bug - bombed two weeks ago ) .
3 #### I panned ACCSusan previously for a mix - up on my Advantage order . I was finally contacted yesterday by phone by them , accompanied by an apology and we came to a mutually satisfactory resolution of my problems . If Advantage II lives up to their claims , I will continue to do business with them .
5 #### After switching from cheap - o junk to Advantage in November 2010 , I can tell you that there 's virtually no reason I 'd use anything else . I think the only reason I 'd use something else would be to alternate with Frontline , since I 've read that alternating the pesticides helps reduce the chance of the fleas becoming resistant . Have n't done that yet but Advantage / Advantage II have worked wonderfully . After getting a nasty flea infestation under conrol in Nov / Dec 2010 , I have n't seen any fleas , nor any signs like out - of - the - ordinary scratching . I even stretch the applications from every month to every 6 weeks to save money . I saw some alarming side effects from the cheap drops but have n't seen any issues in the cats with this stuff . It has really paid for us to spend more . As much as I 'd rather use something natural ( totally useless here ) , we love this stuff !
5 #### I was accidentally sent the wrong weight boxes I ordered for my cats flea drops . I sent a note to the company through my Amazon acct and they were very quick to respond and the correct weight boxes are on way to me at NC . I would not hesitate to do business with them again .
5 #### I was very happy to find this product for my cat at such a great price . Ca n't say that my cat is happy about it , though .
5 #### i used this in conjunction with a ton of other things to finally rid my poor ferret and cat of fleas . had to use over a period of time but finally kicked in .
1 #### Bayer has stopped making Advantage with the single active ingredient Imidacloprid , and some suppliers are substituting Advantage II which also has Pyripoxyfen as an active ingredient . The picture of the product and the billing information indicate that you are ordering regular Purple Advantage for cats over 9 lbs . , but you will receive Advantage II , which has the same two active ingredients as Advantage Multi . The only warning of the product change Entirely Pets gives is a pop - up message which may be missed or blocked . When I asked to return the substituted product , Entirely Pets customer service promised to e - mail a mailing label , but I never received it . If you 're considering ordering directly from Entirely Pets , I recommend checking their many online customer service complaints before making a decision .
5 #### Product works well but like human drugs , it 's very pricey . When is a generic coming out ? ? It does keep the fleas away , very definitely . I 'm re - posting about a year later . My cat , Kitten Kaboodle , started reacting strongly to this drug so I switched to Frontline , and he 's better with that . And , a generic version of Frontline is out now . Both Advantage and Frontline are excellent at keeping fleas away , not only from the catters but from my home .
5 #### I have used this on my cat for several years and have never had a flea problem . Definitely recommend Advantage !
5 #### This is the only product that works on my three cats ; Frontline did nothing for them . Amazon 's price is the best anywhere , every time I have purchased it .
4 #### Killed off the fleas but ... it makes my adult cat sick for several hours . She ca n't stand to be touched , pants excessively and drools a bit . One month later after application there are new fleas in my home . This may be a transference from me going outside or from her . I ca n't really tell . The product does kill and keep the fleas off my adult cat ( age 5 ) . I hear that side effects are normal with chemicals . I wish there was a way to not introduce chemicals into her systems and keep the fleas off her and out of the home .
3 #### Advantage works . I know because it cured a flea infestation my cat brought inside last year . HOWEVER , I have since learned that you can buy the Kit for dogs and reduce the dosage for cats . It is MUCH cheaper and my vet says it is just the same as he used in his office . Do n't waste your money on single dosages . But do buy Advantage !
5 #### I have a Persian kitty and we tried everything to get rid of his fleas . Nothing ever worked , they would hide in all his fur . Finally we broke down and bought this . We have had it for 2 months now and I have n't seen one flea since a week after we got this ! Love it ! !
5 #### We have several animals and flea control gets expensive . This product was exactly identical to what I normallly get from the vet and easier as it comes to me .
4 #### The vet told me our cat did n't need anti - flea med if he did n't go outside ( my cat has never been outside ) . But the cat kept scratching until he developed the flea allergy dermatitis , and went wild , and bit himself , whenever I touched his back . Then the vet said the cat did have fleas , and prescribed Advantage . It seems to work initially . But I am concerned about the fact that it does nt seem to be effective for the entire month . The instructions say not to use it more than once a week . Does this mean I should use it every 2 or 3 weeks ? I also wonder about the alternative packaging , with the cats sitting upright , with more purple or orange on the front of the package ; is this newer packaging ? which could possibly mean the the packaging shown here is old product .
5 #### I have used this product both of my cats for a good while now . It works great and fast . My cats are sensitive to a lot of things but neither has any kind of reaction to this product . I will continue to use .
5 #### I had been using cheapo products before buying this and at least one of the cats reacted badly every single time . I 've decided that the manufacturer of Advantage definitely puts some of what they charge into making sure their product is safe . I 'd prefer not to need anything like this but we do need it and it did n't make our cats sick at all . And it worked so quickly ! About an hour after I applied it , both the cats were jumping around , I 'm sure because the fleas were going nuts trying to get away from the poison . The cats had settled down quite a bit within about 5 hours and in the morning they were completely different kitties . No more scratching , biting , pacing around , meowing for no real reason , etc . It 's been several weeks since I used it on them and they are starting to have some trouble again but I think that 's really because we got lazy and did n't treat one part of the apartment with diatomaceous earth when we did the rest about a month ago . I 'll be using this every month from now on . It 's worth the cost , especially at the prices we can get it for here at Amazon .
4 #### I 'm so happy to see I could buy Advantage through Amazon . I thought I could only buy it through my vet . I 've used Advantage for my previous cat and for my current cat . My previous cat did not like Advantage at all . She 'd try to lick it off . If I put it on her too low , she 'd be able to get at it and her mouth would foam up . Apparently , this was not unusual , since the people at the vet 's told me about the foaming mouth when I reported it to them . They did n't think it was too harmful . To prevent the foaming mouth , make sure to place it where they ca n't get to it , higher up on their head . My current cat does n't seem to mind it so much . Easy to use , and the scent is n't bad compared to other brands . Not too greasy once it 's fully dispersed over the fur . No fleas so far . This is my preferred flea product for my cats .
5 #### I have been using this product for a little over a year since my cats got fleas for the first time while living in a nasty apartment , so I know the product works well . This seller is great , I received the product ahead of time , and they even gave me an extra dose for free ! This seller has the best price I 've been able to find in a year , and they provided me with stellar service . Thanks !
3 #### I found the Advantage treatment difficult to get out of its applicator , and most of it seemed to get all over my fingers instead of the cat . This was my first time trying Advantage , I do n't think much of their applicator , and think I will go back to using Frontline 's much easier applicator instead .
5 #### First the info : Saw fleas in July , treated 3 inside cats with Frontline Plus Still fleas . Cleaned , washed , vaccumed spray with flea spray containing growth inhibiter Still fleas . Treated cats a second time with Frontline Plus Cleaned again , sprayed again ( rinse and repeat ) Still fleas . No fleas on the floor or carpet but the cats had fleas AND EGGS . After the second treatment , and seeing the eggs where the cats slept ( I washed their bedding every day ) , I bought Advantage Multi . After 3 days ......... no fleas . None . Zip . Nadda . No fleas on the cats , no flea dirt , no eggs . Let me repeat , No Fleas
5 #### Advantage is the first flea control for my 3 cats that seems to be effective . We have tried lots of products and this is the bomb . No more fleas on the cats , no more fleas on my ankles , no more fleas period . You 'll need one dose per cat per month . I got the six pack and treat all 3 for 2 months at a time . This stuff is alot more expensive at the pet store . Found it on Amazon and bought it from a place that resells overstock . The box was wrinkled , but the contents were in perfect shape . Paid an excellent price , I think around 34.00 for 6 doses of the up to 9 pound cat mixture , and the shipping was free ! Quit wasting your time with other stuff and simply give it a try .
3 #### I do n't care what the box says - Advantage does NOT last a month . In two weeks the fleas will return . I found that flea protection is best when you use HALF DOSE ( 0.4 ml per cat - this contains 0.8 ml per bottle ) , applied twice a month . For me this has worked perfectly . Now if you have indoor cats , you most likely will not need to treat your cat all the time . Use a FLEA COMB a few times a week to monitor the presence of fleas . If you see one single flea , get them all treated , but use HALF DOSE . That may all your indoor cat needs . Once in a blue moon my indoor cats need to be treated , and this works well . Also please vacuum your house . The flea eggs and fleas can not and will not survive in vacuum cleaner bags , and is the best way to deflea your house , and include your furniture :-)
5 #### Although my cat gets out sometimes , she never has fleas or ticks thanks to Advantage . At one time I used another product that did n't work ; Advantage does . I 'm so glad I have it to use . I know my cat is too . ;-)
5 #### I usually go to Advantage when the flea season starts ( and it always worked good ) , but Costco had the cat Frontline and I tried that this time ( I figured they were all pretty much the same ) . Boy what a MISTAKE ! ! ! ! My flea population EXPLODED on Frontline ! ! ! I had my 2 cats and 2 dogs on the Frontline , and they were all itching and scratching with fleas . I waited for the month ( literally picking at least 30 fleas off each of my dogs every night by hand to try and help ) , and then went back to my Advantage . The day after applying Advantage , I found 1 flea on my dog ( I have long hair cats , and I can not see the actual fleas on them , but I can on my dogs ) and it was almost dead , it just fell off her ( on Frontline , I went from having about 15 fleas fall off my dogs while bathing them before the application , to almost 100 while they were on it , so they had A LOT of fleas when I applied Advantage ) . My cats are not scratching constantly anymore . In 1 day , this product did what the people at Frontline told me would take up to 6 months for their product to do ! ! Advantage SAVED my animals and house from being COMPLETELY infested with fleas ( gross ) . This stuff is amazing , and I will always use Advantage ! ! !
4 #### Works great . I 've been using it for about 3 months now an none of my 3 babies have any fleas . The only downside is price , but at least Amazon has it cheaper than stores .
5 #### This product works -- my two cats are always free of fleas and ticks . Once a month application offers complete protection .
5 #### Fleas were really bad this spring , garlic in her food was n't working . W / i one day she stopped scratching . It 's about one month now , so will treat her again , but the little tormentors have n't started up yet . Great price on Amazon , got it two days later with Prime .
4 #### There was great savings purchasing this product through Amazon . It was delivered quickly and a lot less expensive that at the vet .
5 #### I like Advantage as it does n't bother my cats when I put it on , and it is very effective . I used Frontline before and they acted like I was putting acid on them . This is gentle and it works ! ! !
5 #### always trying to stay one step ahead of the summer infest has been my best bet with 22 cats . 22 flealess cats and the guests they invite over . i am the party house .even the guests get a dose so we have no unwanted company . it works .
5 #### Received the product very quickly and at a good price . Would do business with this seller again .
5 #### Advantage is a great product when it comes to keeping fleas off my cat . My cat has a flea allergy that causes her to lose her fur due to flea bites . I 've also used Frontline ( on my cats and three dogs ) but it seems to lose its flea and tick - fighting edge after about two weeks . Advantage works - and works fast .
5 #### Being that I 've been using Advantage for close to a decade , I do n't put anything else on my sensitive " I like to have allergic responses to flea stuff " old man cat . It takes care of the problem and there is no mad itching , no bald spots , no scary frantic rush to the vet for saving after a bad reaction .. and best of all , after a week , no flea sign at all . Hands down , as the owner of an allergy prone cat , it 's the best in my opinion .
5 #### I have been buying other name brands and store brands ... and this is the WINNER ! I will never go back ! My kitties are flea FREE ! After only 48 hours ... my white cat who had endless flea dirt is completely clean ! I was so amazed I dug around his hair trying to find anything ! And I came up empty handed aside from a kitty wanting to play ! My cats go outside via the doggy - door . So they constantly get a chance to get re - infested . I am very pleased with Advantage . my one cat who has reactions to flea treatment only coughed for about 60 seconds at most , then was fine . Other brands she would drool and throw up ! not with Advantage ! She seems very happy to be rid of the fleas too ! Next step ... see if they have this for my dog !
1 #### I put this on my cat 4 times over a 4 month period . ( He is a healthy 3 year old ) Each time , he reacted more negatively than the time before . Last dose , he acted as if it was stinging him , and he was aggressive and in a bad mood for 2 days . I looked up information regarding counterfeit flea meds and although the vials do have the right wording -- the epa # on the vials is one of two epa # 's that have been counterfeited . I am not taking anymore chances with the last two vials . I am throwing it out . Guess I will have to buy from a more reputable source in order to feel safe about this .
5 #### I have been using this product on my cat every since I bought her and it is great . She was from the SPCA and was flea infested but as soon as I used Advantage she has not had any fleas since . My cat lives outside and she still does not pick up fleas .
5 #### Just so you know , your cats can become immune to the different flea medications and you have to make a change . I was using Frontline on my indoor cats and it worked well for awhile then it stopped working all together . The cats were treated , we bombed the house we bathed them to no avail ! So I took them to the Vet because I could n't take it anymore ! She said sometimes you have to change so we tried the Advantage , bombed the house and it worked ! My kitties are flea free and I 'm so happy to see them not itching and miserable ! So if you are having trouble with one product , try another . It 's too expensive to keep using a brand if it does n't work . P.S. The Frontline is still working fine on the outside cats .
5 #### I have tried other flea killers , but this is the only one that killed ALL of the fleas on my little fleabag .
4 #### Having had a miserable summer attempting to use Frontline Plus for cats with no success we switched to Advantage . Advantage worked , where Frontline Plus did not . We still see the occasional flea but only rarely . Our cat is much happier .
4 #### As strictly related to shipping , it arrived several days late , which causes me concern with a product that should be kept in a controlled environment . Amazon shipping is usually spot - on , but this was not one of those times . Frustrating to wait for something that we needed for our pets . So I suggest ordering ahead of your actual need . We have 2 indoor cats that had what I would call a minor flea problem . The initial dose seemed to do the job . And unlike some treatments I 've used it was well tolerated . No irritation to the skin , etc . We had a recurrence of fleas just over a month later and had to re - apply the product . I know fleas are hard to get rid of completely so I 'm not totally surprised . I was hoping that the first dose would end the problem , seeing as the fleas were n't that bad . I shopped around and Amazon had the best price . So really the only thing bugging me was the mishandling of the shipping .
5 #### Product delivered quickly , and for a fantastic price . I 've used Advantage in the past and highly recommend the product . Our inside cat gets to go outside every now and then , and in Florida , we have no ' down season ' for fleas , they 're rampant pretty much all year round , but we never see any on the cat . When we moved into our current place it had a flea infestation in the garage due to previous tenants , but my cat did n't get ANY , even though it took us several weeks to kill them all . The stuff works . Buy it .
4 #### I had previously tried Front Line on my 2 cats and been rewarded with healthier fleas . After applying Advantage , my cats are now flea free . Product works !
5 #### my cats ticks and fleas are gone ! they had them pretty bad too ... after using frontline for 6 years or so ... it was no longer working ... i had heard they reformulated , so i called the company first to confirm this info and the customer service person i spoke to said they hadn't .... either way this did what frontline could not do for both of our cats in either 1 or 2 days which i find pretty amazing as one of the cats was having some major hair loss from itching / scratching from the fleas so much ! ! ! i 'm sold ! we had a problem earlier in the season with the tiny deer ticks all over the cats and ended up getting a flea collar for such little money , and it worked great until they started to get the fleas ... hopefully next year the ticks wo n't be so bad or maybe just switching from frontline to advantage will do the trick ! thanks for all the reviews as i have always been told by the vet and pet store that frontline is the one to get ... but after reading the reviews it convinced me to give it a try and me and my 3 kids are glad we did ( nevermind the cats ) !
5 #### I looked at my local large pet food supply store and their price was ridiculous ! They wanted $ 63.99 for a 4 pack . I paid less than that WITH SHIPPING for a 6 pack from Amazon . With a multi cat household , I need the value . Thanks Amazon for your great pricing and service
3 #### I put Advantage on my cats and they do n't seem to be scratching as bad , but it 's been 3 weeks and I am still seeing fleas on my white cat . Just trying to save money getting flea meds without a vet visit . I probably need to go to the vet !
4 #### I use Advantage on all my cats every month . The price and time it took to receive it was terrific . The product is really good & I do n't worry about fleas or ticks because of it .
5 #### Advantage to the rescue ! I purchased this after a disasterous non - working purchase of Frontline . Advantage had all the flea 's dead within 24 hours . I will stay true to Advantage from now on ! Thank you Advantage for saving my legs / ankles from many flea bites that Frontline could n't even think of doing !
5 #### I have used this on my cats for 6 years and have yet to find a flea on my two indoor outdoor cats .
5 #### Advantage has worked on my cat for five years . She never scratches . I 've never seen a flea on her , nor have I had any fleas in the house . Other products smell horribly . The cat would try to outrun the scent , but to no avail ( obviously ) . Advantage has a slight odor , but it is n't offensive to me or the cat . The only thing the cat does n't like is the wet feeling on the nap of her neck . I have to sneak up on her in order to administer her monthly dose . The liquid leaves a greasy patch on the back of her neck for a day or two . Stop using those worthless and dangerous flea collars . Try Advantage . You 're cat will thank you for it .
4 #### I have 3.5 cats , one 's the neighbors cat half time . His dogs and cats have fleas . My 3.5 cats do n't Nuff Said .
5 #### If you want a flea treatment for your Feline friends , then this is the only product I have used for the last 6 weeks .
5 #### My cats barely seem to notice this treatment and it seams to sting less than other similar treatments I have used . I have found it effective for up to three weeks the first two applications and now after having used it consistently for almost a year I have found that the cats need a new treatment every 5 - 6 weeks . This Advantage works much better than other products I have tried .
5 #### I have used Advantage on my cats for years . I could only get the 4 - tube package at my vet and it was rather expensive . Being able to get the 6 pack and at a price less than what I pay for the 4 pack is amazing to me . I have used this product for over 13 yrs . It keeps the fleas at bay . I would n't use any other product .
5 #### Mine is an " indoor - only " cat who apparently had some fleas on him when adopted . I tried other similar products from the pet store , but he still scratched on . One app from Advantage and the scratching ended .
5 #### I have two under nine pound inside kitties ... no scratching ... no fleas ! Need I say more ? Have used Advantage since they were kittens and now the oldest is almost seven and the youngest close to two . It 's a great product !
5 #### I have used this products for many years and it has always worked . Will continue to use it until we are all gone . Dinne
4 #### I feed several feral cats and bring the fleas inside to my cats . With one treatment , no more scratching cats and no more fleas on my socks .
5 #### I was very grateful for finding out about Advantage by taking my cat to the vet . Flea control on your pets is especially important in the hotter weather , when fleas seem to attack any furry friend around . What is impressive about Advantage is that is a once a month application , meaning that , as long as you apply it to your pet once a month , you do n't really have to worry about it until next month . This beats having to deal with flea collars , or powder that cats or other pets sometimes lick or get in their system somehow . And , of course , the other obvious impressive thing is that Advantage works like a charm . You will see a noticeable different in your pet ; they probably will seem less agitated about having to bite fleas all the time . The one stickler with the product is that you need to make sure you apply it in the right spot , otherwise kitty might try to lick it and get a bad taste in his or her mouth . Other than that , it is extremely helpful . This price offered for this is very good too . If you buy it from you vet , it will probably be at least ten dollars more , so it is worthwhile to purchase it here . Easy and pain free application and easy and pain free for the cat as well . It will make you feel better having this mainly because your cat will feel noticeably better and happier .
5 #### I 've used only this flea treatment since it was first introduced . It really gets rid of fleas . . . fast ! It 's safe for the cats and very convenient to use . I have one indoor and one indoor / outdoor cat . I treat the indoor cat less often because fewer fleas are brought into the house by the in / out cat . I recommend this product over all the other flea products out there . Amazon 's price ca n't be beat !
4 #### This works pretty well . I currently have 2 cats , one is a longhair and one is shorthair . I have tried many topical flea tx 's . One of the cats scratched more the first 3 days after the treatment , then he stopped . The only problem after that is to remember when the end of the month is almost here , so I can treat them all again .
4 #### We 've had decent luck with this product . I do n't think the cat likes it , but we have not had fleas in the house since we started using it . I have n't noticed any allergic reactions to it from the cat either .
5 #### I 've used Advantage for a number of years for both cats and dogs , and find it works better than anything else for flea control . If you are a first time user , be aware that it may take a while to interrupt the multiple life cycles of the fleas that are around your yard , house and animal / s. [ And if you have a severe infestation , you may need to do additional treating of your house -- I am a big fan of using a sprinkling of diatomaceous earth , which seems to be a big secret despite being inexpensive and nontoxic . ] The biggest downside of Advantage is the price , and Amazon seems to offer the best price around ( especially if they have a sale ) . The second biggest downside is that my cats uniformly do not like it when it is applied , but seem to quickly get over it . I have found that with both cats and dogs it is possible to sometimes go up to several months between applications , which is good as I prefer to use any toxic chemical on them as little as possible , so you may want to try going more than a month between applications and see what happens . I 've also had good luck with purchasing the large cat ( over 9 lbs ) product and splitting it between two small cats .
5 #### Advantage is an excellent product . I 'll use it for a few months and then use another product that kills fleas AND ticks . I live in a heavily infested tick area , so it 's necessary to use this flea and tick medication . However , this medication is not as effective as Advantage in killing fleas , which is why I alternate the two . Advantage is also less expensive than " the other medication . "
5 #### For similar products , I have to pay double locally . I 've got 2 cats so this means hundreds of dollars a year I will save using this . Advantage is the highest recommended flea treatment in my area . I 'm on evening one and I expect the fleas to drop within a day . If I 'm not happy I 'll edit the post , but it should last for about 4 weeks per treatment .
5 #### Many products are not safe ... like Hartz , and made my cat sick . Advantage works great on all my cats , and they are indoors at night and out playing most of the day . I alternate cats when I use Advantage , and apply it only every 3 weeks to ONE cat at a time in the winter .... still no fleas ! In the summer I use it every 4 weeks as suggested . My daughter has 8 cats and a dog , and uses only Advantage for flea control . It works better than anything else out there . It 's so nice not to have flea bites all around my ankles , or fleas in my home ! !
4 #### I guess it works but I have not seen any fleas before using it either . I used another brand before and it left a lot of oily mess on my cat 's fur . This one is MUCH better .
5 #### I have always used Advantage on my cats & dogs . My 2 cats have been trying to get outside all the time this year every time we open a door . So they have gotten fleas from sneaking outside . I do not see them scratching anymore & they are still sneaking outside when they can ! ! !
5 #### Ordered Advantage for Cats over 9 pounds in the 6 pack size . Amazon had the best price I could find . Bayer makes this product which is very effective for immediately kills adult fleas ( as opposed to othe products that only kill the eggs ) . However , it appears that Bayer has , and continues , to spend a lot of time and resources to make sure that no one any where sells this product below a certain price they want which I 've documented going up every month and is rapidly approaching $ 10 a month per treatment ( per cat ) . I have 5 rescued cats so the price adds up to $ 50 per month to treat them for fleas . Every source I could find that sold this product at bargin prices has been forced to cease selling it . This use to be called price fixing . Nevertheless , the product works very well . As soon as I can find another product that will kill adult fleas for less money than the outrageous price of Bayer 's Advantage , I will switch . My order arrived very fast and was well packaged . I will use this merchant again . The 5 star rating is for the retail merchant , Amazon and the effectiveness of the product .
5 #### Puts Frontline to shame . It killed them initially , but they came back and/or did n't get rid of them completely . Other products worked at first , but more showed up only a couple of weeks later . Advantage started working immediately and has kept them away . The only disadvantage I see is that it does n't kill ticks , but my cats do n't go outdoors so I 'm more worried about fleas . Put it on my cats and it also took care of the fleas on my ferret without having to put any product on her which was another big plus .
5 #### Simply the best . Tried Frontline several times on my cats and ferret and it did n't work . Advantage did a wonderful job and worked quickly . Most were gone right away . You could tell any stragglers were on their last legs . Easy to use and very convenient .
5 #### Controlling fleas is hard , as they are extremely robust little organisms . Advantage works as well an anything else to control the fleas on our cats . In the warmer months , we find them scratching again about a month after we apply this . When we only had one cat , an application would last longer . This is probably because there are now more fleas living other places in our house ; the carpets , their beds , furniture , etc .. Treating the animal is only part of the flea solution . You must vaccuum religously and keep their beds clean . Also try Program if you are having a real hard time controlling fleas . Advantage works great , but no pesticide will be strong enough to work alone ( without killing you or your cat first ) . Fleas are tough buggers and you must clean your house as well .
2 #### If you 're cat is an indoor cat , yes this product will work well for you . But if your cats go outside like mine , FORGET IT ! Yes Advantage kills fleas that are on your pet immediately . But it does not keep them flea free for 30 days , like they advertise . I 've tried Advantage on my cats a few times . The fleas that were on my cats did die within 12 hours . But within ONE WEEK they were biting and scratching again like before . I 'm picking fleas off of them after only a week and a half . If the product was n't so expensive , it might be worth the money . But do n't waste your money , because it only works well for a few days . Frontline works a lot better .

5 #### I have used it since it came out and I do n't have a flea problem . I also like it for the fact like the drops you can have the problem of the side effects .
4 #### I have used this product on our dogs before as it worked wonders . This time , it does n't seem to be working as well .
5 #### I use this every year for fleas on my dogs . Better than topical . When fleas are at the worst I use it every 20 days instead of 30 days .
1 #### I started giving Program tablets to my dog late summer / early fall last year . I had been using Capstar ( which works miraculously but is too expensive to use daily as a stand alone ) and read many reviews and articles stating how great Capstar and Program are when used together . My dog has allergies ( nasal and sometimes skin ) . Her hair started thinning out a little in the back and I just figured it had to do with her skin allergies . It very slowly kept getting worse . I have been trying over and over to figure out if there was something that could have been causing this , I realized it started after giving the Program tablets . I skpped the past month 's tablet and hopefully her hair will grow back in . Ca n't decide on a monthly to use on her , because Frontline Plus gives her hives on her belly . I will continue to use Capstar as needed ( a couple times a week or whenever she plays with the neighbor 's dog or grass is long / wet and itching starts ) . I 'm not saying it is a problem for all dogs , but it did cause the hair loss on my dog . This may not be a common side effect , but I ca n't recommend it to others because of this .
4 #### My dog is MDR1 positive ( common in herding dogs ) so she ca n't have certain medications , including Frontline ( which caused a paralysis of her leg ) . At a recommendation from other MDR1 dog owners I decided to try this and so far there has been no reaction but it has only been two months . I have n't seen any fleas .
4 #### I previously used Advantage to take care of my cat 's flea problem , and it worked immediately - but my cat absolutely hated the smell which lingered on her body . She would howl and run off when she saw me approaching with the Advantage vial , and I hate being the villain once a month . So now I 've switched to Program . It 's kind of a pain mashing the tablet and mixing it up into wet catfood . Also , it takes a couple of days to take effect . But - it does work well , and my cat is very happy . I will definitely buy Program tabs again .
5 #### My cat is allergic to Frontline and Advantage , which are topical pesticides that get ingested when the cat grooms itself . He would get a lump on his neck wherever I would apply it , so I stopped using topical insecticide for flea control . I really like Program . It controls fleas for a month , and I never have a problem with my cat getting sick . I put the medication into a little bowl with tuna juice from a can , mix it up , and he drinks it right away . Even if your cat has a flea infestation , just give them a flea bath and use Program . You can also use Capstar which works faster than anything else , and kills all the fleas on your cat in 5 minutes , but is not long - lasting . The people that give this product a bad review need to realize that if you cat is infested , you need to do something about the active fleas and the eggs . Program is an ovacide that prevents fleas from reproducing so it wo n't stop an infestation , but it 's so much safer for your cat . I 'll never use anything else .
4 #### There 's a good article comparing the flea products : [ ... ] The condition of the surrounding and pets all need to be considered before choosing the right product that suits your needs . I have a cat and dog . My dog is a flea magnet and the only product that works for him is Revolution and I love the fact that it 's a heart worm prevention med also . However I put the cat on Program since she is an indoor cat and I feel more comfortable using this on her because my dog licks my cat but not vice versa . I use the Greenie pill pockets to wrap the tablet and has no problem at all enticing her to eat it . So far this combination works perfect for me . Every animal is different . It takes a little trial and error to find the best product for that animal specifically .
5 #### Best dog mitt . Others let moisture from waste seep through , not these !
5 #### Thick and easy to open on cold winter day .
5 #### Great product ! With 2 Great Danes , these are soooo much better than those flimsy little blue bags ! Highly recommend if you have big dogs .. which means big messes :)
5 #### These bags are used daily . They are stronger than other dog bags . Buying in bulk is cheaper and more convenient .
5 #### Best poop pickup bags ever . Roomy , and very sturdy .
5 #### No breakthroughs with these mitts ! Found this brand at a public park in a teeny tiny town in eastern Colorado !
5 #### Hope I do n't get reincarnated as a Mutt Mitt bag
1 #### I need to preface this review by saying that I have been using these bags for years , probably since they first were sold . I thought they were great and would spend the extra money on them . They were thick , strong and better than any other bag I have tried . I think I have used them since the days of the Pooper Scooper and that was a long time ago . I recommended them highly to anyone who had a dog . Now , the last batch I got had some printing on it that I have never seen before . The bags have become paper thin and tear while using them . That is the last thing you want when you are picking up poop . I did n't mind paying more money for a quality product but I will not buy these again until I hear that the quality has returned to what it has been for the past 15 years or so . This is awful ! !
5 #### What can you say about a " poop bag " except these are perfect for the job . I walk with my dog twice a day and pick up all of the time . Who wants to get anything on their hands or have the thing tear while in use ? These are exactly what is needed for the job and for the planet . I have been buying them for 5 years for my dog , for myself and for the planet . Well worth it .
3 #### The new bag with the newly designed box ( sporting made in China ) are a noticeably thinner , cheaper bag . As I have some left from my old box , it was apparent as soon as I touched these . Visually they 're not the same either , and very noticeably not as nice a the ones made in the US . Really liked this brand when I started buying them and recommended them lots . I do n't feel I can really recommend them as much anymore . I have a greyhound and a large gusseted pocket is essential . The pocket is noticeably smaller and again , thinner . I have n't had an accident with them ( just got them today ) but will keep my eye on that . Visual inspection of the seams of the bag do n't look to be well done either . The old bag has very nice thick seams to which I never worried about them busting . These I do ! The manufacturing difference is night and day and a terrible shame that its such a downgrade . To that end , I will be on the lookout for a better bag . I wish they still made these in the US or at least at the same quality as the old ones .
5 #### I was very pleased with the strength and size of this product . It does exactly what it is intended to do . I feel much more secure using this product vs. some of the very flimsy bags that are available .
5 #### I have purchased this product before but not through Amazon . They are perfect size for a lab and are bio - degradable . I highly recommend them .
5 #### We 've been using this product for years . It 's the best we 've tried .
5 #### So my big dog did the unthinkable : he dropped a load on a neighbor 's front lawn . Luckily I had Mutt Mitt Dog Waste Pick Up Bags on standby ! I dashed home to get a bag and was able to clean up his mess without gagging . No unpleasant feelings in my hand , no heat or texture transmitted , as it were . Then I noticed an old mess on the same lawn , so I got another bag and cleaned that one up , too , since the Big Guy had made a dash for freedom the previous day when contractors left the gate open . Hey , it could have been his ! So , now I am a fan and I noticed the price dropped since I bought them , it figures . When I need more bags I will look for these ( or just press my Dash Button ) .
5 #### These doggie poo bags are awesome ! Thick plastic . Keeps odors in . Worth every penny !
5 #### These are the best . They take an annoying job and greatly improve the experience . It is worth the money to have the extra strength and barrier between me and poop . They came nicely boxed . Fast shipping .
5 #### I have had a dog since 1993 . After using grocery bags and other purpose made poop bags I 've bought Mutt Mitts exclusively for the last several years . I have never received a " warm surprise " when using these bags and they are large enough to easily fit over my large hand and have plenty of room to pick up the dog waste .
5 #### No one wants to feel the poop we pick up . Get these . They are plastic and reinforced where the hand grabs the poop . Brilliant idea ! I 've reordered .
5 #### This is double coverage and we reorder these every time . They are not flimsy in any way so I ca n't say whether they break down easily , but I know they withstand the elements since we leave these out until trash time ( once a week ) and do not stink .
5 #### I have a large English Golden Retriever and these mitts are the best ever . So dependable and make the chore of picking up dog waster much easier .
5 #### These are the best bags I 've ever used -- by far .
5 #### I use 3 or 4 a day and the work perfectly .
5 #### They are the best bags for the job . Judy
5 #### These are the best bags ! ! Its my 2nd time ordering them . Love the double layer preventing you from feeling the poop . I even bought the vinyl bag to put them in which clips to the dogs leashes .
5 #### I love these bags ... they cost a bit more , but for me are well worth the price . I like that they are not overly thin , and I do n't feel like my hand is in the poop , when I use these bags . I have never had a bag to tear , have a hole or rip at an inopportune time . I truly like that they are biodegradable . Their expiration date is generally one year , so I can only stock up so many at a time , but that 's OK .
5 #### Outstanding product . This is what I take for the walks . I need something that is not going to tear , rip or split when a few leaves or twigs get scooped up with the mess .
5 #### Used these when I went on vacation with my two boxers . Love these mitts . Your hand touches nothing ! Nice and large as well .
4 #### My municipality uses Mutt Mitts in the parks , but a different version . I liked those so I bought these a while ago but found them just too thick to pick up after the dog - in theory I guess the double - ply heavy duty plastic is good , but I just found it too difficult to get the tactile feedback needed to grab the waste without smearing it into the grass . HOWEVER - I found a great alternative use ! We get a lot of uninvited four legged critters that move into our attic and garage in the fall . Despite all attempts to seal them out , mice still come in . These bags are PERFECT for disposing of full mouse traps , they are just the right size and the thick plastic and double bottom mean the trap 's copper bar wo n't poke through . I think it is much more sanitary and Eco - friendly than using several used grocery bags per body . I just drop them in a Mutt Mitt , tie it off and drop it in the trash . They should market these to exterminators .
1 #### My husband and I were big fans of mutt mitts since we discovered them at a dog park two years ago . We often gave them away to other pet owners ... especially those with big dogs . We just ordered a new package and were surprised to discover that they have changed . They have not changed for the better ! They no longer dispense without ripping terribly , they are thinner , and they are not as long as they used to be ( making it more difficult to knot ) . I contacted Mutt Mitt to let them know that I was disappointed in the changes and they blew me off ! I 'm on a search for a new product to use when my current supply of terribly ripped mutt mitts runs out .
5 #### These are the thickest poop bags I have ever found , and the have the extra covering at the end to make the job less disgusting .
5 #### These are great ! I only wish they made ones in a slightly larger size , but they 're LIGHT YEARS ahead of the standard poop bags .
5 #### As much as you can love a dog poop bag , I LOVE these . They are way way better than other poop bags , way less disgusting . They do n't break . That is a big deal ! There is nothing worse than being a good citizen , scooping the poop , and then having the bag break before you get home ! Thick ! Nice thick bags give you a lot less of that icky feeling , you know , feeling too much . And , get this . The smell stays in the bag because they are heavy . I 've had many different brands , always have had dogs , and these are lifesavers . The best , worth every penny and dollar .
5 #### They work great and I do n't worry about them breaking through .
5 #### On time , as advertised , securely packed for shipping . A positive experience . Would order from this vendor again . Bags are very durable , not prone to embarrassing leaks or breaks . Good - quality stuff . :-)
4 #### The city park near us stocks these . They 're the best dog bags I 've ever seen , but 9 times the price of the Amazon - branded , thinner , bags . I do n't think I can justify the price to myself without first suffering an accident caused by the worse quality bags !
5 #### These beat all other poop pick - up bags by a mile ! Sturdy , easy to open unlike those roll - up style and extra protection for the pick - up .
5 #### Love these . They are nice and thick and biodegradable .
5 #### I have been using these for over 10 years . I like that they are biodegradable , yet still have some substance to them .
5 #### " Hands down " ( pun intended ) these are the best poop bags you can buy . We have an English Mastiff . With a giant dog , you get real close and personal with dog poop . It can ruin your whole day when you get some stuck under a fingernail . Sure these are more expensive than other brands , but some things are just worth paying more for . Mutt Mitts keep flies away better because the waste is securely sealed and the smell is masked . I highly recommend these for all dog lovers ! I hope this helps .
5 #### These are the ONLY bags to use if you want to eliminate all smells and make sure you always have a safe barrier between you and " the business " . Other bags are not nearly as thick so you 'll run a risk in both camps . These cost more , but I draw the line when it comes to poo on my hands .
5 #### On the pricey side , but boy these things are awesome . I travel quite frequently with my lil furry friend , and these are perfect for the road trips , and walks around the neighborhood . Highly recommend and will continue to buy . I 've found that Amazon has the best price too !
5 #### Best dog poop bags for a large breed , and double lining reduces the gross factor
5 #### These are seriously the best poo bags out there . They make a really gross job a little more doable . I hate those little thin bags . These do a great job of concealing the sights and smells associated with the task at hand .
5 #### I buy these for me . Picking up after one 's dog is n't fun but Mutt Mitts make it so much more pleasant . The extra cost is my reward for being a good citizen . I 've found the best price on Amazon . Make sure you get the double bag ones and check quantity / cost as it seems to vary . But do yourself a favor and get them .
5 #### the best bags ! less mess all around ! i will not use any other kind from now on
5 #### The poop bag mitts work great for people , but they are too big or my dogs paws . When we are on a walk , and I put one on him , he can never pick up all my poop .
5 #### These work great for picking up pet waste . We also use them for dirty diaper bags as they are high quality and mask smell .
5 #### I 've been using these for years . They are the best poop picker - upper that I have ever used . Nice to buy in bulk . May buy the bigger box next time though 200 should last me for a while . Fast delivery and a fair price too .
5 #### I can not give this product enough Kudos . With two dogs over 130lbs , removing waste is a constant challenge particularly when the waste is not solid ( a problem I have solved and will outline in a different review ) . These Mutt MItts do not tear or split and are as sanitary as anything I previously encountered . Because of their size , I take the dogs for long walks at 4:00am . Picking up waste used to be a nightmare but this was solved by these bags . My only negative is I wish I had designed and marketed these myself !
2 #### Just make sure you use them up within a year ! I got these for the occasional ' babysitting " I do for my relatives dog . I am not used to picking up dog waste and these are thicker than other bags they gave me to use - so that part is good , while they lasted . BUT they do not have a very long shelf life . I used them about once a month for a day or two , and when I went to take one off to use it last time , the side seam just designated ! Ripped wide open . Inspected the rest of the lot and all are the exact same - totally unusable now . What a waste of money , I only used about 24 of them . Who would have thought they would have an expiration ? ? ?
5 #### The best bags ever ! Love that it is a glove and you never get dirty . The material is thick so other animals wo n't rip it if you toss in the trash
5 #### These are great and heavy weight plastic . I did n't realize they were white but nothing escapes these bags and they are completely opaque - so no visuals ! !
5 #### These are great . Best quality poop bags I 've ever used .
5 #### These bags are wonderful . They have a really nice and convenient hand scooping feature and I feel pretty good knowing there is a relatively thick layer between my hand and the feces .
5 #### These are fantastic , nice and heavy where they need to be , where the rubber meets the @?#$?>% ! ! ! ! Just wish they were a little more affordable , but will definitely buy again ! ! !
5 #### These are THE BEST doggie poop bags anywhere ! I have a LARGE dog ; you can imagine the rest of this statement ..... the GREAT thing about ' Mutt mitts ' is that they are DOUBLE STRENGTH and thickness where your hand is picking up the doggie do - do ! These are the best , most durable and thickest bags I have found ... I've bought them for 3 years , and their thickness ( weight ) has not changed .... amazing ! ! ! Great product at a fair price ! ! ! ! VIRGINIA FROM SOUTH FLORIDA
5 #### Fantastic bags - I never thought I would ever be reviewing poo bags but these really are worth purchasing . You will never use the thin flimsy bags again !
5 #### Have been using these for years - will never be without them .
5 #### Have a double layer at the bottom of the bag . Nice thickness - don't feel like I 'm actually touching poo . Also do n't disinigrate like the other kinds of bags .
5 #### These mitts are the best ! They work fabulously , and having the metal dispenser mounted on the wall inside our closet is perfect .
5 #### Been using religiously for the past 9 years .... nothing else compares
5 #### Have two puppies and these work so much better than regular plastic bags . Pick up the poo , pull bag off you hand an tie off the top . Out is sight and no smell
5 #### these thick bags make picking up warm poop and little more manageable .
5 #### Great poop bag . Exactly what I was expecting . Thick plastic and it is 2 ply around where you grab . The 2 ply feature is really nice because if you have pine needles or any sharp twigs it is strong enough so it does not penetrate the bag within reason . My local park used to purchase these and switched to a lower quality bag . I did not like the new bags and found these on amazon . Thanks for the great Mutt Mitts .
5 #### Good bags , not thin and are useful for picking up more liquid dog waste or other items
5 #### Mutt Mitts only way to go . Thick and big
5 #### Where have these been all my life ! ! ? ! ? ! My 80 lb Golden has some nasty movements from time to time and this adds an few extra layers of plastic between my skin and his business - these are awesome !
5 #### These are great . We take them with us when we are traveling with our St. Bernard or when we take her out for walks .
5 #### We must pick up after our two ' boys ' when we walk around the neighborhood and this double thick bag is WAY better to do what needs to be done . Two boxes means we do n't run out .
5 #### I love these bags . I have two danes and these bags have never failed me ! Wayyyyy better than those 1 ply bags .
5 #### These are great . With walking 2 dogs daily , I 've given up on the cheap varieties that tear easily . These make picking up after them easier and much less messy . I 'll never go back .
5 #### Mutt Mitts are the only bag I 'll use when walking by bigger dogs . The double ply thickness is great when cleaning up after my Lab .
5 #### best poop bag you can get , just saying .. not that I get all into it , but these are the way to go
5 #### Worth every bit of the 10 cents each that they cost I really love not feeling the squish or the warmth of a bag of steaming lovin' from my black lab when we go to a campground . He tends to poop only once every few days when he is n't at home and this bag is needed to get it all first try . Those flimsy little see - through bags got nothing on the Mutt Mitt !
5 #### Love these bags . Work really well and are quality
5 #### Love these bags . They work really well , never rip and are easy to use . Well worth the money
1 #### Initially , these were 5 star bags . They worked wonderfully . This lasted for about 18 months , at which point , every bag would split along the seem when used . It appears , there 's a shelf life to these bags and the ones we purchased have exceeded it . Given the cost per bag , I would n't expect them to become useless in 500 days .
5 #### My husband hates feeling the heat of the feces when picking up poop , so I bought these . Now this is all I buy . It would be even better if it had a handle that you can tie and make for easier carrying when on long works or dog has multiple poops on the walk .
5 #### These are awesome , i 've been using for years ! ! ! Ca n't fathom using any other , thin bag .
5 #### It 's like a GLAD trash bag with a second bag wrapped around it ... Very thick , odor repelling , absolutely perfect . Worth the $ 30 .
4 #### More expensive , but worth it . Hands stay clean ... Minus 1 star because I can still smell it while I walking my dog and becomes annoying when a trash can is not nearby .
5 #### Best poop bags ever . No need to worry that there is a small hole and you just touched poop . Nope , these are double lined , if you will . I will never buy another kind of poop bag again .
5 #### They are made of a good thick plastic , too , so at least for small dog stuff , you do n't even feel warmth like you do with cheap bags . They also hold a lot more ! And are n't see - through , and do n't let odors seep out . They 're definitely worth the money . Once you use them , you 'll stick with them !
5 #### I walk my dog two or three times a day , and always carry a couple Mutt Mitts with me in case she decides that " now is the time . " Mutt Mitts helps me to clean everything up easy - peasy , and there 's plenty of room in the bag for her deposits , no matter how small or large . I 've been buying this product for several years , and would n't be without it .
5 #### These Mutt Mitts are great . We do a bit of camping and although most campgrounds provide bags , you end up carrying to a wastebasket . Most of the of the other bags are flimsy but not this one . It is perfect for picking up the unsavory and transporting it to the dump ! They are pricey , but well worth the extra . I feel they must be more sanitary since you have more plastic between you and the ground dropping !
5 #### New puppy means new ways to clean up after said puppy ! we bought a box of these when we first brought Wild Child home and we could n't be happier . 3 more dogs later and we still use the box of bags . I will order another box soon . This box lasted us at least 3 years . great value , easy to use and super clean .
5 #### We love this doggie bags , the only thing better is if was biodegradable .
5 #### Why Did n't I Know About These Before - They Are Great !
5 #### Protects hands from poo . The clean way to pick up after your pup . Large , durable bags .
5 #### These are great , I will never go back to those cheap poop pick up bags .
5 #### I love these dog waste bags . They are virtually indestructible . Some empty bags have gone through the wash undetected in jacket and pants pockets and still come out strong and useable . The best feature is the double layered " mitten " .
3 #### The bottom of the mutt mitt is a little much and would liked to have had them in rolls to fit into the mitt case or plastic bone holder but overall it serves the purpose of curving my Princess Kimber and we have more than enough currently so i thank you for the timely deliver thanks
5 #### These are very substantial . Easy to pick stuff up without getting anything on your hand . Pricey , but much better than other dog bags .
5 #### I have been using Mutt Mitts for 9 years now , originally because the town I lived in placed courtesy containers of them at popular trailheads . I later bought them direct from the manufacturer . Well worth the money ; absolutely the best dog poop/ biohazard bag ( dead rats etc . ) I have ever used . The clever Mitt design is actually a heavy duty double - thickness section at the pick - up part of the bag ; I have never punctured one even while picking up poop in rocky terrain . My dog is a German Shepherd , so I appreciate the generous size of these bags , unlike the typical pet store bags made for smaller dogs . Great that Amazon now carries this first rate American - made product . These bags are bio- and photo - degradable so very environment friendly .
5 #### Love these bags . Ample size for any dog . Best thing about this product is I never had one rip , tear or break ; and that 's a good thing !
5 #### Once you use these you can not accept another style . Very easy to open and use , makes clean up easy .
5 #### Excellent product and price . I buy this product for me . Picking up after my lab is no fun but Mutt Mitts remove a lot of the ick factor .
5 #### This is the only bag I 'll use for my 14 lb dog . It 's doubled so no chance of breaking . Can even be opened and used again a block later if needed .
5 #### Durable bags . Since I always have several with me at any given time I 've used them for stuff other than poop like seed gathering , makeshift gloves , bowls , fish from the lake , take out . Long enough and thick enough to complete the job with no leaks and they are easy to twist and knot . But ... use them . If they sit around too long they degrade and split down the side seam . Store in a cool place indoors .
5 #### You know there 's dog poo in your hand , but you do n't freak out .
5 #### great came fast and I have already ordered my second box !
5 #### Have used these for years for good dog walking street manners . The mil thickness keeps stink inside bag , too !
5 #### These are the all time best bags I have found . I have purchased them for years and years and will continue to do so . Since I have large dogs these are the right size for my use . I appreciate the double layer design and the grabber " mitt " designed into these bags . They would be absolutely perfect if they designed ones that were also biodegradable . That is the only con with this product .
5 #### Mutt Mitts are an absolute must have for dog poo pickup . We have two dogs and always have one on each leash and a few extra in my messenger bag . The bags are thick and durable - no need to worry about holes , and the bags do not emit poo smell . They are large to easily allow for full poo pickup and accommodate even my husband 's very large hand . Another great Amazon Prime value .
5 #### Ordered more because have used these for years . They are biodegradeable . No risk of running fingers through the plastic or getting holes in them , there 's a double layer of plastic between your fingers and the dog poop .
5 #### I do n't mind the little bags that come in rolls for small dogs , but they are n't substantial enough for our two large dogs . I also do n't like bags that you can see through . It 's bad enough having to carry a bag around , but I do n't want to have to look at the contents . This plastic is thick enough to feel secure . I have been using these off and on for several years and have never had one break or slip and get my hand dirty . And as a bonus the bottom of the ( empty ) bag can be used to give our dogs a drink of water if I did n't plan ahead and bring a dish .
4 #### A very large bag with a reinforced bottom layer . Is very good for cleaning up the yard as it can hold 2 to 4 messes in a single bag . I am cleaning up after a 7 month old German Shorthaired Pointer so as to give you a perspective of the capacity of the bags . Also these bags are packed such that they are stacked one on the other , no need to tear bags apart . They are easy to separate at the top , no fumbling with thin plastic edges that will not come apart .
5 #### Really no other dog waste / poop bag compares -- the material is thick enough that risk of break - through is virtually nil and it is large enough to capture a 100 pound lab 's waste without problem , leaving plenty of room to tie the tops into a sealed bag for disposal . Often more expensive than other bags , it is worth every penny .
5 #### Really like the thickness and opaque nature of these bags - makes dog business easy to clean up .
5 #### These work fine and I like the way the box opens and they 're easy to get to . I had my husband make a wooden box for them to put on the wall by the backdoor and they 're easy to get to and are good quality .
5 #### Have been using Mutt Mitt bags for years . Easy to use and biodegradable !
5 #### Very handy to have these bags with you at all times - love the box they come in as easy to pull out and take with .
5 #### These bags are great . Amazon has the best price too ! !
5 #### hello , these mutt mitt bags are larger than most bags , but when it comes time to pick and scoop , you will be glad they are sturdy and handy . some of the smaller bags online look nice in a roll and fit into a nice plastic container ready to clip onto the leash or whatever , but they are so thin that it makes scooping treacherous to say the least . no one wants a rip or a tear in this process , that is for sure . sometimes those thin bags in the rolls necessitated a second or third bag to make the odor go away . is that why most of those are sold in the multi pack rolls ? we take several mutt mitts with us on walks and drives and fold them up to fit into our pockets . when it comes time for scooping , the thicker mutt mitts are a welcome product . only one is needed , way to go mutt mitts ... also , there is no smell on this brand to make things feel like a perfume factory in your car or pocket . make sure it says unscented or you may wind up with a scented one . these twist up quickly and the knot keeps the smell inside . thanks for the great product ... yrmv
5 #### I love these Mutt Mitts and have been ordering them for years . They are double walled and seem much sturdier than other dog waste bags . Also , and this is a big plus , they are bio degradable ! ! I order a case at at time and I have given some to friends and family who have dogs so that they can see how nice they are and maybe start using them .
5 #### I have been buying these for at least 10 years and I can not believe that Petco or Petsmart does n't carry them . I like the thickness and shape of these bags and that they are biodegradable . Would not even think about trying another bag !
5 #### Mutt Mitts take a lot of the " yuck " out of picking up after my dogs . They are very thick , and I do n't have to worry about the bag bursting . The bags hold a lot of " product " , so I can pick up after both of my dogs with only one bag .
5 #### Mutt Mitts are the best dog poo picker uppers ever !
5 #### These are the hands down best way to clean up after your dog , and come out of it with clean hands . The double bag end is genius , and and these bags are big enough to contain even what a big dog ( or several little dogs ) can leave behind . I could n't live without them !
5 #### The ONLY way to clean up after your pooch .
5 #### These bags are the Rolls Royce of dog poop bags . Ideal length and the durability is the best on the market . I have two large dogs and these bags are perfect for cleaning up their mess . These bags may appear a bit on the pricey side but are well worth it because they do not skimp on the quality . You will not have to fear that these bags may break and leave your hands messy .
5 #### love the product . Thick and big enough to hold several peepads along with dog poop . Does not tear and keeps hand clean . Box is great because you only take out what you need .
5 #### my local park stopped using these and switched to a yellow ( thinner & i;m guessing cheaper ) baggy ... i think you just ca n't have enough plastic between my hand and my dogs poo ! SO i am buying these from amazon , they have a pretty good price for that clean hand confidence ;)
5 #### On our third box . They are a bit of a luxury as you can get cheaper ones or even use grocery bags . But they are worth the extra if you can afford it . Heavy plastic , makes it easy to pick up waste and never any dirty hands .
5 #### Why did I bother with another single - ply brand ? Disaster . I 'm back to Mutt Mitt for good . It 's the sole product that can handle whatever a 70 - pound greyhound has to offer . Also ideal for scooping up the remains of birds , mice , squirrels , opossums and wee snakes , all courtesy of one naughty kitty .
5 #### Work well . Box makes it easy to pull out for use .
5 #### These are great bags . They do n't rip and when you pick up the poop and close the bag you ca n't smell it . Also , since the bottom of the bag is black you do n't have to look at it either . But the best is that is is very simple to open the bag . I ca n't tell you hot often I struggled to open some of those other bags .
5 #### These are pretty fantastic for picking up waste , if such a thing exists . The two - ply plastic for where you pick up is a nice reassurance that you wo n't get anything on your hand if the inner layer tears for some reason , even though it is a very good quality plastic .
4 #### The Mutt Mitt bags are definitely thicker and a bit easier to use than the less expensive & thinner bulk poop bags . If you are squeamish about picking up poop , then I recommend these bags . If a lower price per bag is more important to you , stick with other bags where you get more bags for less cost .
5 #### Love , love , love these bags . Large , sturdy , thick - just awesome .
5 #### I love these bags ! Even if there are dispensers in parks , etc . , I use my own bags . They are substantial and easy to " scoop the poop " !
5 #### LOVE these bags ! Anyone that we have known that has gotten a dog we have purchased these as a gift for them . Once they use them they never go back to the thin cheap bags . Cool design to hang up the box too .
5 #### 4 dogs here , these bags make the chores much easier !
5 #### My husband has a guide dog , and these are the best product we 've found to clean up after him . ( The dog , not my husband . )
5 #### Absolutely the best of the poop pick up bags ... I've used them for years and years ... tried others but none could match this performance ! !
5 #### These are the first dog poop bags I have ever used , but I really like them . They are thick , and very easy to use . They are pretty huge too . My dog barely fills 1/4 of it , so it is very easy to tie off . I 'd buy again .
5 #### excellent bags ! , great quality , easy to open , fits over hand(no touching poop ) , good price , fast shipping ! thanks
5 #### Perfect for Los Angeles . No more plastic bags available at stores .
5 #### After trying cheaper bags , which sometimes were not much better than picking up poop with my bare hands , I bought these and am totally satisfied . They are large , strong , and easy to use . No leaks , no ripped seams , no overflow . It 's not clear from the labeling whether these degrade over time or not . But the instruction to use them within one year implies that they break down in the landfill . Hope so .
5 #### these are great , you can pick up multiple piles with one bag too , and your hand is completely protected .
5 #### The perfect bag for picking up after my animal . Very strong plastic and holds up well .
5 #### Does n't break . Thick enough to not get too intimate a feel of the poop . Tall enough so you can tie the top in a knot without involving the contents .
5 #### I have a large dog who has large poops . I have been using these bags for three years now and adore them . They are thick enough that they do n't tear ( and I do n't have to feel the gross warm squishy feeling ) , and big enough to hold all my dog 's poop with plenty of room to tie it easily . I 've used other bags ( they were so flimsy they tore , too small to tie , and I had to use two bags to pick up everything from one poop ) - I will never use another dog poop bag again . They are more expensive than other bags but completely worth it .
1 #### DO NOT BUY THESE . At first they are great and are well thought out . However over time the sides split and then they start to flake . Those little flakes get on and stick to nearly everything they come in contact with . We put them in a backpack for a hike before we caught that they were flaking and we are still picking off little white flakes from items stored in that backpack weeks later . Virtually all the bags seemed to disintegrate at around the same time .
5 #### convenient to use , less unpleasant than the other varieties , well worth the price
5 #### Bottom line - These are great ! Thick , roomy , easy to tie the ends - well worth the price ! Very handy in cold weather when my fingers do n't work so great , and are , ahem , " roomy " enough for my large golden retriever .
5 #### Love this product . I walk my dog every day , and I use them every time he does his thing . bag is a great size and very easy to use .
5 #### The BEST ever in Dog POOH pick up bags . I do n't know why ... EVERYONE is n't using these ! ! ! !
3 #### Best bags out there . Priced out of my budget now .
5 #### Although we have a lot of dog parks and dog poop bag stations near where I live , and the $ 1 store is always a great bargain , I realized quickly that just making do with free bags was not going to work with a 90 pound dog who is still growing . The night that my nails tore through a paper - thin $ 1 store bag while picking up a giant pile of excrement was the night I purchased these bags and I am never looking back . These bags are well worth the money and provide piece of mind that I will always have a sufficient and reliable bag with me , no matter what my dog squats down and provides on our walks .
5 #### Love these bags I 'm a bit of a germaphobe so I feel much more protected when using these bags plus biodegradable !
3 #### Too thick and I went through them too quickly .
5 #### These are terrific for the big dogs ! Also can be used as an emergency drinking dish .... yes , really ! Great that they are biodegradable .
5 #### the only thing to trust your dog 's poop with !
5 #### The best product . I hate trying to open those cheap , tiny bags , especially in winter when my hands are so dry I need to almost spit on my fingers to open the bag , all the while standing there freezing my butt off . These are sturdy and you ca n't see the waste inside the black bottom . My only gripe it the price . So , I bought some for use in the winter . Alternatively , I have often opened a few cheapo bags ahead of time in the doggy drawer so I can just grab and go .
5 #### Expensive , but easy to use , thick , and opaque . The only improvements I can think of would be a lower price and handles , to make it easier to hang the full bag from the leash until I get to a garbage can .
5 #### These are absolutely the best things ever ! ! ! ! Very sturdy and not thin like regular poop bags ! ! ! We will never be without them :)
4 #### I really like that I do n't have to " feel " the substance I am picking up ; however , the double - ply bottoms of the bag are so thick that it makes it kind of difficult to get a good grip to pick it all up . The bags that are much , much thinner allow me to get my fingers underneath and scoop it all up . Still , I think I prefer these over the thin ones . I recommend them .
3 #### These are thicker and sturdier than the poop bags I was using previously , but do n't claim to be biodegradable . They work fine for the intended job . The 2 - ply construction at the bottom guarantees that the bag wo n't burst at the wrong time . I plan to use these up , but next time I will make sure to buy biodegradable bags .
5 #### The only pick up bag we use . After years of letting our dogs run loose on 10 acres and never having to pick up the poop ( the dogs graciously went deep into the woods ) We moved into a gated community . There 's something about following a Rottie and Lab around a couple of times a day , and picking up massive piles of warm Poop that started us looking for a bag like this . We Highly recommend them .
4 #### The miser in me was using plastic grocery bags and quickly learned they make an icky mess worse . Saw these on sale and gambled on them . What a difference ! I can dutifully pick up after my dog without dirtying my hands . Only 4 stars because they are absurdly expensive . But with 200 in the box , they should last a long time .
5 #### These are the best poop bags we have used because they have a double layer of plastic at the bottom where it counts . One of our dogs considers it his mission in life to never set a paw out the door without pooping at least a little . As a result , we use a huge number of bags and have tried many brands . For a while they were not available and we were so happy to be able to buy them again . Also , they are supposed to be biodegradable so we do n't have to feel too guilty about all the plastic .
5 #### Nice mitts , gave some to my next door neighbor . Nice and sturdy
5 #### Our chocolate lab loves to leave huge presents ! These bags are big enough and thick enough to contain what he leaves ! Highly recommend this ! ! We do n't have any spontaneous holes , like in the cheap bags , just as you are picking up crap !
5 #### I love these ! So much better than plastic . No mess and easily decomposes .
5 #### Great product - easy to use ( none of the issues of opening the cheap bags ) . Buy a box of 200 and they last a good while .
5 #### This is the best poop pick up bag around . I 'm kind of a germaphobe and very squeamish when picking up after my dog , but this bag provides plenty of protection so I do n't accidentally touch it with my bare hands ! Easy to use - goes on like an oven mit , then just pick up poop and pull hand out , thereby turning the bag inside out , then twist and throw in the trash . It 's big enough and easy to pick up several pieces at a time .
5 #### Best bags by far to pick up dog poop . You ca n't feel the warmth or squishiness and no smell
5 #### I love these and they SAY they are biodegradable but they really are n't . But they are excellent for picking up larger dog poo ... and easy to turn inside out ! It 's also MUCH cheaper to buy 200 on Amazon that it is to by them locally and for less bags per package / box .
5 #### Works extremely well and I will buy it again highly recommend to anybody with a dog
5 #### We travel with our dogs . These mutt mitts are perfect . They are a nice weight and very easy to use . We have been using these for years and have never had one rip or tear . Highly recommend these . * Just purchased this item again & I noticed the price went up over ten dollars . Same amount , nothing different . Can someone explain why this is more expensive now ?
5 #### These are the best bags to use ! I started using them because my apartment complex allowed dogs and had these bag dispensers on posts so when you walked your dog they were available . They were such a high quality , that I now buy my own supply . Nice and thick so you do n't worry about leakage , the other bags that come in rolls are so thin not only do you feel what you 're picking up but you also see it through the bag . These Mutt Mitts are a solid color so you do n't walk around showing the world what you 're carrying on the way to the trashcan . And they hole a LOT , so for big dogs you do n't have to use two bags . Purchasing these in the box is much more cost effective then buying them in the 30 count at the stores .
5 #### These heavy duty pick up bags do the job .
5 #### These are the BEST doggie bags ever ! The double thickness at the bottom of the bags makes it a lot more pleasant doing the duty .
5 #### This dog poop bag lives up to its ' reputation . It fits nicely both in hand and on a standard pooper scooper - OH JOY !
5 #### These bags are worth the money ...... the big difference is that if you have to carry the bag for a while it 's no big deal . The odor stays in the bag ..... not so with the single ply !
5 #### They work as described , roomy and thick for super poopers . Random : also , we have had a few ( CLEAN ! ) bags go through our washer and dryer accidentally , and they were still totally fine to use , unlike the thinner bags , which have gotten shredded / melted in the past ( yea , we should really check our pockets before doing laundry ) .
5 #### Love these bags . Works easily , big enough to get everything , smell is contained . What else can you want from a poo bag ?
4 #### I have a large dog and could make different sizes . Not sure if it would matter for large dogs . But small ones for small dogs would be better
5 #### I had no idea that these were sold on here . Glad to know it . I used to buy them through their own website . Anyway , my HOA buys these overly recycled plastic bags that crumble in your hand or while trying in vain to get the opening open . It is impossible to separate the two pieces to use the bag . And if you did you are sorry as you get dog poo on your hands from the deteriorating plastic . Well say hello to Mutt Mitts . They have genuine biodegradable two ply plastic . I love them . They ship free too . Ca n't say enough . I even buy their smaller bundle with the resealable zip top for the car and road trips .
4 #### We have an 85 - pound dog and use 1,000 bags per year ( 3 per day ) . There is no denying how good these are , as described by other reviewers . It 's the most comfortable way to handle an unpleasant task . What bothers me though is the extra plastic and expense involved with these . Taking into account environmental and economic factors , I prefer to use the smaller and thinner&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/120 - Earth - Rated - Dog - Waste - Bags - Lavender - Scented-8 - Rolls-120 - Count / dp / B0088LIINY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">120 Earth Rated Dog Waste Bags , Lavender Scented , 8 Rolls , 120 - Count</a > . So what we do is keep both items on hand in a fanny pack . For the biggest or messiest " jobs " , we use Mutt Mitts . For typical " duty " , the above linked product is very good . That way everyone wins !
5 #### Easy to use open the bag and use , wide opening , and no smell comes through . Wish they were greener for the environment , but they are definitely the best product available .
5 #### Great product . Love the box w hanger . Saw this at my veterinarians office and now ca n't do without them . Especially love the double reinforced bag tips ! Thanks !
5 #### Love these ca n't do without them- saw them in the walk area at my veterinarian office - they are awesome- especially love the double bag tips !
5 #### These bags are the most durable I have found yet and I love them . My Irish Wolfhound puppy is 13 weeks old and 36 pounds - we use one bag each time usually . I know that for my breed of dog I will be stepping up to two or three bags used each time , but that is ok . Bigger bags would not help ( if there are bigger ones out there ? ) - I can only get so much poop into my bagged hand at once anyway LOL ! These are great poop bags , you will not regret your purchase !
5 #### We have a couple Labradors . these are great for larger dogs .... I have n't purchased any other poo - bag brands for a couple years now ..
5 #### These bags rock . They are thick , double coated and a good size . Best of all they are bio - degradable . I 've used other bags . The " feeling " is very different . With Mutt Mitts you do n't " feel " anything . Making cleaning up your dog 's business pretty easy . Try them once and you 'll see the difference .
5 #### I 've tried a few mutt mitt bags , but this is the best by far . Generously sized bags means larger poop can be securely contained !
5 #### These are the best for large dogs where the smaller , thinner dog poop pick up bags are too fragile for those long walks .
5 #### These are my favorite mits to pick up poop with because they have a thick bottom . We order 2 boxes every few months , we have an 80 lb dog and pick up his poop in the backyard once a week year round .
5 #### Thick bags and double wall means you will hardly feel the details of the poop . Been using for a year now ,
5 #### These things are great ! ! ! Every coat pocket has one for those just in case pick - ups . The good thing is , your fingers never go through the bag ! You can pick up on rough areas and never fear a tear . There are never any leaks ! ! !
5 #### I have a large lab and these bags are big enough for me to be be able to clean up after him without risking getting anything on myself . They are so much better than other bags I have tried and the free ones along the trails .
5 #### These have a large capacity , thicker where it counts and keeps your hands away from the dog 's business product . Good product .
5 #### These are great bags for picking up what you should pick up after your ( or other ) dog . They are well designed and well made . The are of a good size for either men or women to use . We have tried other brands and keep coming back to Mutt Mitts . For good reason .
5 #### These bags are sturdy , and the double - layered bottom makes clean - up super easy . Before finding these , we used to have to use two bags on each walk and cross our fingers that it did n't make a mess or tear . This is the second time I 've ordered the Mutt Mitt bags , and it stinks whenever I have to use anything else !
5 #### These are the best bags for scooping poop . Something one has to do when taking animals outside that these bags make easier to do .
5 #### I 've tried lots of the others and they all did n't work as well picking up the waste of a 100 lb dog . This gets the dirty job done .
5 #### I have 3 dogs ( i.e. , a Shih - Tzu , Golden Retriever and Black Lab ) . These bags are a life saver . I am able to quickly pick up after them in my back yard without worrying about the sanitation of my hands . Afterwards , I can tie up the bags and throw them away . It is also good for when it rains . I do not have to worry about the soggy newspaper . These bags are a must have in my house .
5 #### These are the best pooper scooper bags out there . I always have a few in my pockets . They are large and strong , and have doubled plastic at the useful end . Edited June 2016 . I have continued to buy these bags and the quality is as good as ever . The box of bags is large enough to last several months , even with my big dogs . They are biodegradable which means that if you have some tucked away in a jacket pocket or a tote bag for a couple of years , they may start to disintegrate and open at the seams . Otherwise they are study and protect my hands from the contents really well .
5 #### I have a giant Great Dane . These are the only poop bags for me . Broader than the standard black / blue bags you see everywhere , durable , deep enough for a good twist and tie . And it handles quite a volume . Which I need . This is the good stuff . I order these exclusively .
5 #### I absolutely love these things . They are made really well ; of great quality , and really make a messy nasty job not so nasty . Prefer these above all others .
5 #### These are STURDY AND HAVE A DOUBLE THICK ' HAND AREA ' WHICH IS GREAT if you have a larger than average dog ! Not a product most poeple would comment on , but this really is a great product ! Thanks .
5 #### Mutt Mitt Doggie Bags are very handy to have on hand . First saw them at a marina where we stopped with our boat . We now use them all the time . Hands stay clean and they control odor better than regular plastic bags .
5 #### Compare to regular plastics , those are thick enough for my daughter to scoop up the thing without acquiring the poop odor on her fingers .
5 #### A great product ! Does the job ( so to speak ) - no mess , no fuss . We have been using Mutt Mitts for several years with our two big dogs .
1 #### I hated these bags ! Yeah I know , I stand alone in this . But I do hate them ! Wen I clean up dog poop , I also clean up any remnants of poop on the grass , sometimes pulling bits of grass out on purpose so as to leave nothing behind ( as best as I can ) . These bags make that impossible . There is no give in these bags for detailed work such as described . These bags are like doing surgery with hockey goalie gloves on . So I am back to standard bags which work great ( I prefer Bags on Board - come off roll clean , never fail / tear / etc . , can pick up more than one pile ( we 've smaller dogs ) , etc ....
5 #### Great bags ! ! Heavy duty - best bags out there ! ! Easy to remove from box and tie onto dog leash handle .
5 #### Hate to rave about poop scoop bags , but these are definitely a cut above any other bags I 've used , esp for picking up after a larger dog . They are larger and thicker , not to mention biodegradable . Highly recommended if your budget allows .
5 #### Amazing . A MUST HAVE if you have anything other than a tiny dog ( then they seem wasteful ) . PLEASE MAKE THESE FOR SMALL DOGS !
4 #### It 's hard to love a poop bag , but these are 2 ply bags in the part where you actually pick up the poop with . I prefer all the protection and distance my hand can get from the poop , so I prefer these bags to any others that I have tried . I buy them exclusively now .
5 #### We have a 70 lb dog , so I need big strong bags . Mutt Mitts are the best . They are long enough that you can easily tie them after you pick up the poop and strong enough that your nails or sticks never go through the bag .
5 #### We fould out about these a dog park and fell in love with them . They are biodegradable , in the winter we do not have to take gloves off to use , and are nice and thick so they do not rip . They do cost more but being able to have confidence that the bag will not tear , that we can get all the poop in one bag is worth it to us
5 #### Picking up poo is no fun , but at least these protect my hand and make it easier to cleanly do so !
5 #### Mutt mitts are my solution to enjoying my daily walks with Sadie and my germ phobia . Much less smell and strong . Highly recommend spending a little more for these .
5 #### I first discovered these on Facebook . The lady who manufactures them has a really funny FB page that I recommend you check out . These bags are great . I never go on walks with the dogs without a couple in my pocket ( and often an extra one or two to share with those dog parents who just maybe did n't think about the fact that they should pick up their dog 's business ) . They come in different sizes and a clean one can even double as a portable water bowl for your furry friend . I like that they are biodegradable so I am not adding to the landfill problem . You can use them to put your cat 's litter box deposits in as well .
5 #### I found these in a dispenser at a public park . They were more ingeniously designed than you would expect . Much better than a plastic bag . More like a mitt and thicker . So I found them here on Amazon and bought them . I 've bought other bags , but never felt like I should be paying for a thin , plain , small plastic bag . So I used anything I found around the house . These are worth the money ! I feel like I 'm getting some quality and value .
5 #### I know these bags are more expensive , but honestly , they are the best ones out there ! They are sturdier , less sheer , and really do mask smell better than other poop bags I 've used ! Poop bags that are scented ( which Mutt Mitts are not ! ) really add an extra awful odor to the poop and just make the whole process worse ! Mutt Mitts are the way to go ! :)
5 #### I like how heavy duty and large they are . I 'm not a fan of the bags on a roll , these I never have to fight to open .
5 #### I have been using these for the last 7 years for my Great Dane . They are in a league of their own and can not be compared to any other product of its kind . The bags are the perfect size for any pick up and the extra lining on the bag makes a huge difference . I am brand loyal and will continue to use this great product . I recommend them to everyone I know that owns a dog . Like I said they are great for my Dane and can handle the test she puts them through .
5 #### These really do the job while protecting your hand from soiling . Large , easy to use , heavy duty , biodegradable . They work exactly as advertised .
5 #### Forget any other poop bags , these may be a tad more expensive but i wo n't be retrieving with anything less ever . Also doubles as a water bowl in a pinch ..
4 #### I use these primarily to clean my backyard ( 3 dogs ) . As such , I 'm usually picking up multiple ... well you know ... at one time . The double thickness of bag makes it more durable and prevents unpleasant rips or punctures . However , the design is n't great . I 've found that the end gets a bit crumpled , and it would be better suited if it was designed like an actual " mitt " with a separate thumb cavity so that you could get a better grip , etc . Otherwise , I 've been very happy with them .
4 #### We have an 80 - pound dog . There is no denying how good these bags are ( as described by other reviewers ) . It 's the most comfortable way to handle an unpleasant task . What bothers me is the extra plastic and expense involved with these . Taking into account the environmental and economic factors , I prefer&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Earth - Rated - Dog - Waste - Poop - Bags - Lavender - Scented-60 - Rolls-900 - Count - Plus - Two - Dispensers / dp / B008BGRXXM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Earth Rated Dog Waste Poop Bags , Lavender Scented , 60 Rolls , 900 - Count Plus Two Dispensers</a > . So what we do is keep both items on hand using a fanny pack . For the biggest or messiest " jobs " , we use Mutt Mitts . For typical " duty " , the above linked product is very good . That way everyone wins !
5 #### I love these bags . They are the best poop pickup product I have ever used . They are larger than most and really get the job done
5 #### We have been using these bags for a long time and have been very happy with them . They are not as big , as I would like ... but they get the job done . I hate the thought of putting dog poop in a bag that is n't biodegradable . And I am upset to learn that mean bags that claim to be biodegradable are not really . I was pleased to find these bags . I will continue to purchase Mutt Mitts , and recommend them to people trying to live a little greener one step at a time .
5 #### much better than thin lined bags . These are easy to use and thicker . May cost more but worth it especially if you have a larger dog ! !
5 #### Mutt Mitts are the best waste bags I 've found . They are much sturdier ( you wo n't stick your hand through ) and the double layer at the bottom of the mitt means even more strength and protection from unpleasant poop pick up . These are pretty good sized , so it 's easy to tie and fabulous for extra large breeds down to small breeds . The packaging is well designed too . The two holes at top allow you to hang the bags near the door or out of site behind a door or panel . Two thumbtacks easily hold up the package and allow you to tear off bags as you need them . A++ product . If you have dogs , you really should try these baggies !
5 #### We 've been using Mutt Mitts for years and they are all we use . The extra layer keeps hands clean and allow for easy bag and carry . If you have to pooper scoop , these make the experience about as good as it can be .
5 #### I 've used many different " waste bags " . By far , Mutt Mitts are the best I 've found . PROs : Mutt Mitts are stronger and denser than most bags . That makes them less likely to tear ( ick ! ) . In fact , I 've never had one tear open , even when there are rocks or twigs mixed with The Stuff . They are also much easier to open than the typical bags . The design also has a " mitt " . Much like a puppet , your had fits around an indentation that makes scooping easier . CONs : Cost . These are more expensive than other bags .
5 #### Been using these for over a year now . Picking up poop is not the most enjoyable thing but I love the thickness of the bag and it is so easy to flip it and tie it . To me a must have product for dog owners - ca n't live without these !
5 #### They may not be environmental friendly but I ca n't stand the green bags that are ; they do n't open easily & are too thin . If others like them , more power to them , but I ca n't stand the thought of the bags leaking and being unsanitary . These bags are my preference and do the job whether at home or traveling .
4 #### thick and have never torn ... all that is required in a poop bag for me . Local dog park used this , and I got used to using them . Any other brand feels a little " less " to me now .
4 #### These are excellent and beat using a plastic market bag . Occasionally the handle will rip off . Otherwise these are wonderful . I have been using these for years . PetSmart used to carry these , and that was convenient for me , but they do n't have them any more , so I order them through Amazaon . I am satisfied with the product even though it is expensive .
5 #### These are the best poop gathering product I 've ever used , not even close . Easy to open Easy to fit your hand in and effective to scoop and grab the poop Plenty of size for all but the garbage bag sized poops I 'll buy anything that works better , but for now the only easier poop scooper is having SOMEONE ELSE pick up your dog 's poop !
5 #### use it every day , can only strongly recommend it ! very handy , fits everywhere , extremely durable and easy to use . a must - have !
5 #### Mutt Mitts sure beat the old fashion way - which for me , was a plastic bag and some paper towels . Best invention since sliced bread .
5 #### Makes the job of cleaning up more palatable - opaque material and large enough to easily flip around and knot -- and the good news is that the bag actually disintegrates in the landfill . I found missing 2 - 3 year old bags in the garage that shredded . It 's a good product worthy of purchase .
5 #### These are the only poop bags that separate your hand from what it is picking up . The double thickness on the business end makes an unpleasant task bearable . They are worth the extra cost .
5 #### These are my favorite poop bags so far . They are just so darned expensive , even in bulk . So I have to supplement them with less expensive ones once in awhile . But you ca n't go wrong with these bags . My hands always feel protected .
5 #### Do n't dig those grocery bags out . Pull one of these out of the box . When your dog does his business , holding one of these is so much more secure and effective . Do n't forget your dog needs to focus , just like you .
5 #### No doubt about it , these bags make the responsible but rather unpleasant task of cleaning up after a dog much more tolerable . The typical ultra - thin bag makes the process a little too intimate . These are like wearing thick gloves ...
5 #### With three dogs going on a walk takes alot of planning . three leashes and yes alot of poop bags . With these bags , you can use your hand inside two layers of plasic , pick up the mess , and just fold the long white part over with plenty of lenth to tie a knot . The plastic also feels heaver that most of the other bags , maybe 3 times as heavy as a grocery bag . And since we care about the enviorment , being biodegradable is important . We first encounted them at a dog park and if they were good enough for them , they were good enough for us :-)
5 #### This is the bag that does it all . I love using it more than any other doggie bags on the market . It keeps my hands clean and it is ok for environmental purposes . There are never any holes ( as in other bags ) for anything to drop out . Love these bags and you will also .
5 #### I have a disability that leaves with the use of only one hand . The opening is easy to find ! The design makes it easy to do a one handed turn about to reverse the bag without touching or smelling poop . I give it a simple twirl and done . All the makers claim their bags are big and thick . Well , they tend to exaggerate alot ! These bags are large and they are thick and they do n't have a perfumey smell that adds a sickening smell to attempt to mask the smell of poop . I never understood that anyway . I suffer migraines and bad scents trigger headaches . I gather all the bags in a 5 gallon hinged can with a yard bag as a liner . My backyard is romp ready for the dogs and you ca n't walk by and smell poop from my yard or trash cans . I have a medium and large breed dogs . Thanx to ther reviewers for thorough reviews that prompted my purchase .
5 #### These bags are convenient , strong , easy to use , and handy to carry around . We like them so much that we give out samples to other dog walkers we meet .
5 #### I think the other bags tend to be flimsy and weird to handle - I would have all sorts of mishaps and end up with dog doo on my hands . Yuck . These are just more substantial ( and I tend to only need one on a walk with two dogs and not two or three of the smaller bags I usually need ) .
4 #### Certainly very handy for ( responsible ) dog owners and caretakers . How good this product ultimately turns out to be will hinge on its true biodegradability -- when buried deep in a landfill .
5 #### Sturdy plastic , a good - sized bag , and a well thought - out design that keeps your hand away from the poop make these bags top - notch and above the rest ! The price is worth it --- and they are WAY better than those horrible , tear - ible biodegradable bags !
5 #### I have three big golden retrievers and feel this should lend credibility to my claim that I 've become a poop - bag expert . ( It also explains why I order a couple of the 200 - count handy dispenser boxes at a time . ) And , thanks especially to the extra layer of hand protection other bags do n't have , the old cringe factor is gone . Though Amazon now has an option for a video review , I think it might be best to give it a pass for this particular product . However , hope you 'll take my word that I 've tried lots of other bags and these are far and away the absolute best !
5 #### We love these bags . They are strong , easy to use , and priced right . I was especially impressed that I ordered them from Amazon one day , they shipped the next , and they arrived the day after that . We have bought these from Amazon on a regular basis for several years now and will continue to do so . And I think the price has come down since we started ordering them . I ca n't believe we got them so fast ! We have two dogs and the 200 count lasts about three to four months with picking up their poop every day . My husband likes them better because they are thicker than most poop bags and do n't tear , especially in the winter when the ground is frozen and harder to deal with . We highly recommend them , especially for big dogs and in harsh winter climates , where you have to pick up after them .
5 #### It really is a good product . Better than the average poop bag , because it 's so tough and durable . It 's my favorite poop bag when I can afford it .
5 #### Can poo bags be so good they make you want to cry ( because for years you used inferior ones ) ? This poo bag puts all others to shame and is worth every penny I spent on it ! They are thick and the little pocket is so deep I can pick up all of my large dog 's poo in one bag , and there is enough room to tie it off at the top . Ever go to a dog park and you and the other dog owners are standing around talking with your bags of dog poo but you want to leave because the stench of feces is bad ? If everyone used a Mitt Mutt , you would n't have that problem .... Best Bag Ever !
5 #### These bags are wonderful . You do n't see the mess . It 's the right size for a little dog and there is room to spare . There is no smell during a walk and it 's strong enough to do the job . It has made cleanup a breeze . But my main reason for buying these bags was that they are biodegradable . I hope the company is n't lying because I like everything about these bags but will not buy again if I find out they are not degradable bags . I highly recommend the product .
5 #### This type of " poop " bag is very good . They are thick bags , does n't seem to emit the smell if you have to carry around with you a little bit until you find a trash can . This is the 2nd time I 've ordered this brand and will continue to do so - they are very durable and easy to tie .
5 #### This is a TERRIFIC product . I have 2 standard poodles and have been using Mutt Mitts for a few years now . They are NOT easy to find . PetSmart stopped carrying them long ago the I located a website that carried them and dropped them a couple of months ago . I am VERY happy to have located them via Amazon.com -- where I should have looked in the first place . GREAT PRODUCT ! ! ! GREAT SERVICE !
5 #### I highly recommend Mutt Mitt , after using groceries bags to pick up my German Shepherd 's poop . The bags are large , roomy and thick , so work very well to pick up a large dog 's waste . The extra layer in the mitt section is very welcoming , as it creates an extra barrier between your hand and the dog waste . They do n't tear or rip . I 'm ordering more !
5 #### I would recommend this product to anyone that has to clean up after their dog . The plastic is thick enough where you do n't have to worry about the dogs waste coming through onto your hands . I 'm not someone who likes to pick up poop after their dog but I do n't mind it now using the bags .
5 #### Okay , so I never thought I would be writing a product review for " poop bags " but this is such a fantastic product ! I just bought 2 more boxes of the 200 - count bags , not for myself , but for friends . These bags are far superior to other bags and the bonus is that they are bio - degradable . Most of the other bags I have used are very thin and sometime too small to " scoop " all the contents . I have a whippet , but have walked other larger dogs and these bags are designed with a thicker plastic at the end and very good for scooping - they have designed the product so that scoop portion is maximum size and thickness . I highly recommend this product and it 's a good value at this price .
5 #### These Mutt Mitts are the best ! I first became aware of them when they were provided by the Doylestown Township , PA , for dog walkers in Doylestown 's Central Park to dispose of their dogs waste . These Mutt Mitts are strong and clean to use and I highly recommend them < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mutt - Mitt-100 - Percent - Degradable - Dog - Waste - Pick - Up - Bag-200 - Count / dp / B00032HGKW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mutt Mitt 100 - Percent Degradable Dog Waste Pick Up Bag , 200 - Count</a > . I always tie a few to my dogs ' leashes so we 're ready for " pick up " at any time ! Wish more dog owners would use these Mutt Mitts to clean up after their dogs !
5 #### these bags are a very nice weight and also very large which reduces the ' gross out ' factor of picking up after the dog .
5 #### I 've had so many bags that have seams not adhered from the manufacturing process , that I was ' double ' bagging everything . Not so with this product . It 's wonderful . I know it may seem silly to get excited about a ' doggy poo bag ' but it 's just one more thing you do n't have to worry about when walking your dog . Great product ! ! !
5 #### This is a great idea -- I first used a similar - ish ( if that is a word ) product when living in Japan . There , trash is sorted most particularly , and dog poo was to go in ' burnable ' trash . Rather than using grocery type bags there was a nice product with a burnable plastic and paper lining . Very nice , but a little small . Even with that drawback I found myself missing those bags and once again resorting to grocery bags once we moved . Not good for the environment , and just not good in terms of quality . I was very happy to find the Mutt Mitt -- larger in size ( enough to handle my 55 # dog 's poop easily ) and sturdy enough not to make a mess . Also , biodegradable ( and made in the USA ) . Even the box is cardboard , so less plastic junk to mess with . I saw some reviews commenting on a quality change -- I did not know about these to compare , but I do find the current rendition to be of enough durability to have no worries about shredding or falling apart ( something that did happen when not careful with my Japanese version of these ) . I do HIGHLY RECOMMEND these ! JTG
5 #### What can I say ? it 's a poop bag & it works . I like the double sleeve at the bottom ; it makes the job a little more civilized .
5 #### These protect your hands better than plastic grocery bags and most other doggy bags . Definitely more pricey than most but well worth it if - like me - you get squeamish about pick up duty .
5 #### Hands down the best poop bags . Have tried many many different types . Main perks of this product are : 1 ) NO scent . These do not have a nasty " fresh scent " or baby powder scent like most of the bags out there . 2 ) No breaks , ever , even when trying to pick poop out of tall park grass . 3 ) Hold 1 super poop or both poops from two dogs , easy .
5 #### sure beats carrying a plastic grocery bag , paper towel , & one surgical glove ! ! ! We have a big Lab , and a smaller dog , so we were loaded down w/ junk on our nightly walks . . .I also do n't worry about tossing it in a curbside trash bin once it 's tied .
5 #### The Mutt Mitts are the best bags I 've run across . They are extra roomy at the bottom with an extra layer so you do n't poke a finger through . I wish they were bigger so they would fit my scooper but are much bigger than others I 've used . I wish all the bag listings would give sizes for the bags . By the way these bags are 8 " wide x 13 " tall & gussetted at the bottom , the other bags were much smaller & thinner . Would highly recommend .
5 #### I have gone through my first order of 100 bags and bought the dispenser box with 200 bags . I love my Shiba Inu and I make sure his dry dog food and treats never vary . Even then , I never know on any given morning or afternoon walk what his poop will be like so I am so fortunate to have these bags which are so large , durable and easy to use . I especially like that you ca n't see anything once you tie these Mutt Mitts up so I no longer have to walk around with a see - through plastic bag filled with poop !
5 #### I have used these bags for many years and several dogs . They are the best . There is no way you can get poop on your hands if they are used correctly . I keep some in my dog bag that goes traveling with my dogs and in my dog walking coat pocket . Buy the largest box to save a few pennies .
5 #### I was using small plastic bags off a roll I bought at the local pet store for picking up after my dog . They were flimsy and not very easy to use . Then when walking my dog at the local metro park I discovered mutt mitts . My town provides them for clean up in the parks . There are sturdy , easy to use and biodegradable . I initially ordered 400 and in the last year have used most of them . I recently ordered another 200 . The construction of the mitt is great ... a plastic mitt that goes a little more than midway ( on me ) to the elbow and has a double layer of plastic on the pick up end . You simply put it on like a large mitten grab the dog " residue " and fold the sleeve inside out and using the long sleeve tied into a knot seal the bag . I keep a garbage can at the end of the driveway to keep the mitts in until pickup day . Much better and easier to use than the usual flimsy bags from the pet store ... highly recommended .
5 #### This is the greatest invention ever for dog owners and the environment , they are biodegradable and dissolve quickly , not like using a regular plastic bag . Keeps your hand clean and keeps the ground safe for others to walk on . Our village actually has the dispenser and a big garbage can for disposal . I think I have one in every pocket of everything I own just in case my wonderful dog Brandy has to poop ! Easily folds into into a small square storage in your pocket . All dog owners should try this product !
5 #### These bags are great -- the double layer provides security and manages the additional debris such as stones or small sticks that usually come along as part of the package . The bags are deep enough to tie knots too !
1 #### This is the flimsiest , most unstable " barrier " ! Was so hard to put together & my dogs could knock it down by just bumping into it .
3 #### It really depends on your dogs . It did not work for us because the gaps in the bars so not prevent my dogs from pawing at the leather seats , which is what we needed the barrier for . If your dog is more well behaved , then this may work for you .
4 #### Pretty easy to install , although the wingnuts are a tad large and make tightening difficult . But made it 's made in China , so they are n't very big on making things with the customer in mind .
1 #### Butterfly screw caps not so great . Hard to tighten . The dog pushed down on the bars that the plastic piece holding the bar broke ; no good after that .
4 #### I have a Honda Element and I purchased this item because we were moving 2 hours away and we waited something to contain the dogs in the back seat . Set up was a little difficult , kind of like setting up IKEA furniture , but once it was it was set up it was very sturdy . It came completely disassembled , which is perfectly fine , just expect spending at least a half hour on setting it up . Okay for the test .... Driving 2 hours with 2 large dogs , how did it hold up ? Well considering I have 1 dog that 's over 150 pounds ( Alaskan Malamute ) I feel like it held up pretty well . We had to pull over twice , Once on the freeway and once on the side streets to fix it , but considering we do n't feel like that was bad . Where we set it up in our Honda Element , it was against the doors and were could n't get it as tight as we wanted it . Do I suggest it ? YES ! I think this is a great product and it did exactly what it was supposed to . I would of given it 5 stars , but 2 of the plastic pieces came broken . We worked around the plastic pieces and did n't bother asking the seller to send us new ones .
5 #### Perfect fit and keeps the big dogs in the back . I have used other barriers and turned out to be a waste of money . Highly recommend this barrier
3 #### Does n't install well if your ceiling is uneven . One of the plastic pieces broke while installing . Good price though !
3 #### I intended to use this to keep my dog in the cargo area of my SUV . She is too good of an escape artist for this item . She figured out several ways to get past it - first time I did n't make it around the block and she was up visiting me . I gave up .
4 #### Before I got this one I got the Pet Net Barrier which was a complete joke . The next day I threw it out and bought this one . It went in much easier and is way more durable . It keeps my dogs in the back no problem . I only gave it 4 stars because it does have plastic clips that hold the bars in place , and if my dogs are rambunctious enough I fear they will jump on the bars and they 'll snap , but they have n't so far . Very glad I bought this !
1 #### It Has Plastic Clips That Hold The Bars On Before I Went To Use It One Already Broke . Dogs can Break It And Get Out So Easy . Why In The Heck did n't it Have Metal Clips . TO CHEAPLY MADE . I Have German Shepherds Not CHIHUAHUA 's DO NOT LIKE ..
5 #### very easy to install , works great and nice looking . Keeps clean unlike nylon or other fabric barriers . I ordered a Kurgo nylon ' easy install ' barrier first ... after an hour of fudging with it in the blistering heat i never managed to get it fully intalled . Mostly due to the fact that it has to be wrapped around little parts of the seat in various points which were inaccessible in my mini cooper . After you put this one together it just slides into place using pressure springs . i d say its so easy that its foolproof , and worth every penny .
3 #### Takes out odor but not the stains that show up under black light .
3 #### I hope this product works better for me as I use it for problem areas .
5 #### This pet stain carpet pre - order spray is essential if you have fur babies ! Gets the stain out and keeps it from returning , has a pleasant smell and is easy to use . The only negative is the spray nozzle setup . Poor thought behind this design . The nozzle spray holes are way , way too small and inconvient . You wind up getting a hand cramp trying to get enough product out of the bottle . Otherwise , excellent weapon in your house cleaning arsenal .
5 #### I have used it on dog " regurgitation " ( not the same as vomit I have been told ) from some newly adjustment to food and antibiotic treatment . The maintenance guy in my bldg brought his wet vac and industrial cleaner in here , but the stains would only go away maybe 60 % . After I sprayed this on ( and did n't even wait the full 15 min ) - it came off like erasing pencil off paper . And , I have berber carpet which is somewhat annoying to get things off of . I have also used it now that I bought a wet carpet scrubber , setting for the full 15 min . The stain will look like it is still there until the carpet is dry . My machine was nowhere near as powerful at sucking out water as the industrial one , so I thought it did n't work the second time ( when I cleaned it ) - but it was just still wet .
5 #### I used a blacklight led flashlight in low light to find the stains , pretreated with this , then steam cleaned with the machine formula . Miracle !
5 #### Works as advertised . The Bissell Green Machine is the best investment we 've made in years .
5 #### This stuff smells fresh and clean and it works great to get out piddle stains and smells on my carpet .
5 #### Works great on old stains ! Use as a pre - treatment for carpet shampooing and let it sit about an hour ( well worth the wait ! ) . I used it on old dog and cat urine and throw - up stains and it surprisingly got most of the stains out . I did go very slowly over it with the shampooer but this stuff definitely helped !
4 #### This product is good , but inferior to the Bissell sanitizing and pre - treating spray , in my opinion !
5 #### My go to pet stain remover this stuff works the best , and I 've tried it all , even the urine gone by natures miricle , this stuff is better . They do n't remark after I use this . Blot the stain then drench it in this stuff rub it in the fibers then leave a moist paper towel over it for an hour , clean it up and you wo n't even know your dog marked there
2 #### Spray not as expected and did not get the job done .
5 #### I think this stuff works better than Nature 's Miracle . I first bought it when we first got our chihuahua pup . The dog refuses to house break fully and had many many little pee accidents on the carpet . This stuff was the only thing that got rid of the smell and stains . It also works great on cat urine odor . Honestly , it does n't get rid of the smell completely b / c cat pee is the devil , but it reduces the smell a great deal and w/ multiple treatments along w/ a good cleaning of the area , the odor does eventually disappear . Something that Nature 's Miracle never did in our experience .
5 #### This is a great pretreatment for pet urine and other stains like juice . Used the Bissell Spot Clean Professional Portable Carpet Cleaner and Bissell Pet Stain and Odor Formula as well with this.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Bissell-3624 - SpotClean - Professional - Portable - Carpet - Cleaner / dp / B008DBRFBK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Bissell 3624 SpotClean Professional Portable Carpet Cleaner</a><a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/BISSELL-2X - Pet - Stain - Odor - Portable - Machine - Formula-32 - ounces-74R7 / dp / B002S52WX8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">BISSELL 2X Pet Stain & Odor Portable Machine Formula , 32 ounces , 74R7</a >
5 #### I have purchased this item a few times in the past . The pretreat works very well when used as instructed . Great for the little messes .
4 #### This product works great . It takes the pet odor away with a good scent
4 #### Works fine . I think it did n't remove all of the stain because our carpet is a very light color . Fast shipping :)
5 #### Amazing . You need this and the one Woolite makes as well ( I believe they are made by the same company ) . Very good for odor and stains .
5 #### This is a product that lasts but is used a lot by me for my dog
5 #### Love this stuff ! works on old stains great too ! has great fragrance that covers up odors . Great foam action . Great price . This is my second bottle !
1 #### This stuff does nothing to remove stains or odor from dog urine on carpet ! Please do n't waste your money on this product ! There are far better products out there that do a better job .
5 #### have n't used it yet but I expect it to perform as previously .
5 #### I have 5 cats and a dog and this stuff gets the gross stains and smells out . I 've tried errything on the market and this is one of the best !
5 #### This pretreat works fantastic ! ! Got out stains on my beige rug I thought would never come out ! ! Let sit 15 minutes .. Use your carpet cleaner and boom ! Gone ! ! :)
3 #### Did n't notice a difference when comparing to other products . I will not buy again . Chemicals are harsh and it does not work that well either . I will try an organic product next
5 #### Used with Bissell 2x Pet stain & Odor Full size machine formula and Bissell Big Green Deep Cleaning Machine and had wonderful results . Would highly recommend all three products and a black light so you can see what your pets have been doing around your house . Read all three of my reviews on this product . Hoover is a thing of the past as far as I 'm concerned . Has quality issues now the Bissell has mastered .
5 #### This is the BEST cleaning agent for your rugs . We have 5 dogs who track in and out . This helps clean up messy spots asasp . Great on old dog urine treatments as well . I give this to new puppy owners - friends .
3 #### Natures Miracle products seem to work better . This is okay . Probably would n't use it again . Used it in conjunction with Bissell Professional Pet Urine Eliminator .
5 #### I use it to pre - treat my carpet in heavy stained spots , but it 's also VERY handy for when my puppy has accidents here and there . Instead of cleaning my carpet all over again ( no way , it takes too much time ) , I just spray this and clean it off . I think this works better than the concentrated 2X formula , not to mention its scent is even better . If you own a puppy or a pet that is n't fully housebroken yet , buy it . You 'll be glad you have something that cleans your carpet easily and fast without the use of a cleaner .
5 #### Used it on a number of rooms . the carpet looks new it is 15 yrs old raising kids and animals
4 #### This works well to pretreat the carpet before shampooing . It takes any pet odors out and makes them unnoticeable for the most part .
5 #### We were not aware our cat had marked our carpet in a few areas until it was dried in . This product got the pee out so good when it came time to move we got 100 % of our security deposit back -- and they check really good for that kind of stuff . The carpet looked as good as new . Whew ! We used a carpet shampooer after this product and it worked just like it said it would . Thank goodness .
5 #### I 've always been a bit leery of pre - treaters since -- for whatever reason -- they 're obscenely expensive and hardly ever work . This one is the exception to the rule . Our dog ripped her nail off ( OUCH ! ) and left bloody little footprints all over the house . We used this , hit it with the carpet shampooer , and there 's absolutely no trace . I 've tried a bunch of these , and this is by far the best one I 've used . No more searching ! I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review .
5 #### We fostered a kitten over the summer , and our cat did NOT take too kindly to that . Even though we tried to keep them separate , our cat sprayed a wool area rug in the room where we moved her scratching post , to warn the kitten to stay away . We tried to get the smell out with various carpet cleaners and the steam cleaner , but it remained . We then treated it with the Bissell Pet Stain & Odor pre - treat stuff and steam cleaned the rug again . Voila ! Odor gone ! I was otherwise going to have to throw out the gorgeous rug that I designed the room 's decor around , so I am thrilled with this product . Thank you , Bissell , for saving my rug ! ! !
3 #### I 've used Nature 's Miracle for years on pet stains , and found it to be the best at removing stubborn smells , but I 'm always willing to try something new . I tried this Bissell Pre - Treat on some old upholstered chairs my husband purchased at a garage sale for $ 5 . He was going to use them out in his shop so he did n't mind a few stains , but I really minded the old - dog - urine smell ! After using the pre - treat as recommended , I proceeded to clean the chairs using my Bissell Spot Bot and was pleasantly surprised with the results . The chairs looked nearly new , only two small stains remained on the light colored material . Unfortunately , the smell was more stubborn , and required a re - wash and application of Nature 's Miracle to finally make it disappear for good .
5 #### If you have pets then you should have the BISSELL PET STAIN & ODOR PRE - TREATER SPRAY on hand for those occasional accidents . Even though my Shiba just turned 2 - years old and she 's potty trained , she 'll still has accidents . The other day she ate something and threw up a little and so I used the BISSELL PET PRE - TREATER to spray the area , after wiping up the mess . I let it soak for a few minutes then used the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/BISSELL - Spotbot - Pet - Handsfree - Spot - and - Stain - Cleaner - with - Deep - Reach - Technology-33N8A / dp / B003Y3AA2S / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">BISSELL Spotbot Pet Handsfree Spot and Stain Cleaner with Deep Reach Technology , 33N8A</a>&nbsp;to power clean the area and it works well together , though the SPOTBOT machine works fine on its own . I think the spray is the same type of solution that you use in the SPOTBOT , so I think this can be used even if you do n't own the machine itself . Definitely keep a bottle on hand just in case .
4 #### We have 5 cats , all of whom are mostly good . Mostly . They do mark occasionally , and it repulses me . This spray is good at helping to eliminate and clean the odor . It is n't perfect ; so far nothing is . This is as good as anything I 've tried yet , and is good . It does smell nice , but more importantly , it seems to mostly remove the basic underlying scent . Good product .
4 #### Works well in getting those hard pet stains out of your rug before you steam clean it . I also use this as a regular treatment for when my dogs have an accident . It works as well as the Resolve Pet and Stain Remover . So since I try to steam clean my rugs once a month anyway , I now buy this instead of the Resolve product I was buying for quick clean ups .
4 #### I used this on some dried spots prior to running the upright steam cleaner . It seems to have made the stains easier for the machine to remove . However , when used as a stand alone spot cleaner , I was not as satisfied with the results . The directions say to spray on the stain and cover with a towel for hours while the solution works . Then it says " uncover to dry " . This process did n't do anything to remove stains for me . Think about it ... they have you spray cleaning solution on there but never do anything to extract either the stain or the cleaner back out of the carpet . How 's that going to ever work ? I think if you let it sit on there for a while and came back with come clear water and a clean towel to blot it all up , you 'd be able to use this as a stand alone spot remover . But just following the bottle directions does nothing . I 'll be using the rest of my sample as a pre - treatment prior to steam cleaning . Works well for that .
5 #### With two long - haired cats , hairballs are unavoidable here , no matter how often we brush them . This spray makes it much more convenient to clean the stains off the carpet , instead of whacking with the SpotBot immediately . Spray on , let dry , and THEN SpotBot . Much cleaner . I 'm happy . Ideally I 'd change all our carpets to hardwood , but ... that 's a much more expensive solution !
5 #### Works great to pre - treat your carpet before cleaning , as well as an all purpose stain remover . So far I have n't encountered a stain that it has n't been able to remove .
5 #### I 've long used the Bissell Spot - Bot for the occasional stain from my cat . The machine works great , but I 've found the cost of the formula to be way too high . Happily , I got to try out this pre - treatment , and am really glad I did . Although it 's intended to be used in conjunction with the regular formula , I decided to try it alone on a couple of mild stains ( fresh ones ) . Then I loaded the machine with plain water and walked away . When I came back , the stains were completely gone - and at a fraction of the cost of using the in - machine formula . I also like that using plain water to clean up the pre - treatment means I do n't have to worry about any cleaning residue on the carpet . A third stain a few days later did require a double treatment , but it was still easier and cheaper than the old way . I 'll keep a bottle of the regular formula on - hand for really stubborn spots , but from now on will just use this and plain water . Highly recommended !
4 #### I typically pre - treat most stains prior to carpet cleaning . This is a ok pre - treat but I like&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/BISSELL - Tough - Stain - Pre - treat - for - Carpet - Upholstery-22 - oz / dp / B00006IV1N / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">BISSELL Tough Stain Pre - treat for Carpet & Upholstery , 22 oz</a>&nbsp;better . I have beige carpet and this cleaner seems to occasionally leave a residue that leaves my carpet with a pink tinge . I 've been able to remove the substance by waiting until the spot dries and going over the spot with the carpet cleaner a second time . For lighter carpets , I would recommend the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/BISSELL - Tough - Stain - Pre - treat - for - Carpet - Upholstery-22 - oz / dp / B00006IV1N / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">BISSELL Tough Stain Pre - treat for Carpet & Upholstery , 22 oz</a > .
5 #### This quality spray did exactly as advertised . I have a cat , who likes to go outside his litter box , and an active toddler who loves to drop food and color on our light - colored carpet . I used this Bissell Pet Stain and Odor spray as directed , generously spraying a stained area , blotting and covering with a wet rag , and leaving it alone for several hours . I am pleased to say that even some long - time stains that I grown to live with are starting to fade considerably or disappear entirely . As another reviewer pointed out , this product does not work on ink . My toddler colored on a portion of our den carpet with an ink pen , and this spray was not very effective on that area . However , as promised , it did eliminate virtually all of my cat stains throughout the house . I have no complaints and would easily recommend this to others .
5 #### I have a Bissell Spotbot Pet Deep Cleaner , which is fantastic . However , there are times when I am looking to clean just a small area and do n't want to have to pull out the Spotbot , fill it , etc . I have found that the Pre - Treat works great by itself to remove some spots . It works great as intended ( pre - treating ) , but I 've used it to remove small pet food stains on rugs and it works great . It smells pleasant as well . For pre - treating , I 've used it and its removed stains like pet vomit or urine in cases where the Spotbot worked but left an area slightly darker than the rest of the carpet . A quick spray with the Pre - Treat and everything was as good as new . I typically have not left it on for the recommended time ( 12 - 72 hours ) , finding a half hour to be plenty . However , I did have a small , tough stain that other cleaners did not remove , so I tried this and left it covered for about a day . After a little rubbing afterward with a cloth and water , it did come out . I have used this on an off - white textured sofa and ottoman as well , and its worked effectively .
5 #### I have a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/BISSELL - ProHeat-2X - Select - Pet - Upright - Deep - Cleaner-94003 / dp / B0019680BK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">BISSELL ProHeat 2X Select Pet Upright Deep Cleaner , 94003</a>&nbsp;which I use to clean - up after my indoor puppy who has had a number of pad training accidents . I like to use this to pre - treat and or clean - up accidents before steam cleaningn my carpets . It has a nice clean scent and it does seem to neutralize urine scent on cat and puppy urine . I 'd highly recommend for spot treating and for clean - up in between steaming .
1 #### We have a cat that pukes due to a medical condition . We used this product , Bissell Pet Stain and Odor remover and it did n't get rid of the stain . It made it lighter though . We than got some Woolite Pet Stain and Odor remover . The stains are gone .
5 #### My dog is obsessed with these balls and the launcher . They have a great bounce and last a pretty long time if you do n't let the dog chew too much . They would probably be too big for the smallest dogs though ( 2 " diam ) . My dog is 12 pounds and they are on the big size for her . My dog adores her chuck it launcher and I like not having to touch the slobbery balls .
2 #### Not a bad product . Regular Tennis Balls work best with the launcher , I 've found , and are much more durable and less expensive . My Weimaraner and I go through a lot of balls when we train . IMHO you 're paying extra for the color and printing .
5 #### If you have smaller dogs that love to play ball , these are smaller tennis balls that fit more comfortably in their mouths ! Not so small as to present a choking hazard , but small enough to allow them to breath as they 're playing fetch . They fit the smaller of the two " ChuckIt " Ball throwers , which are wonderful !
5 #### The only tennis balls my dog will not destroy in one afternoon ! They are pretty sturdy and worth the money .
1 #### My dog bites these in half , so if yours is a chewer or strong maybe try a different one
3 #### My dog 's favorite thing in the world is to chase tennis balls , but there is n't a lot of bounce to these and he did n't really go for them . He repeatedly lost interest and grabbed one of his " real " tennis balls out of his toy box . I 'll stick to Wilson in the future .
5 #### Dog does not chew through these . They float , they bounce , and the color makes them easy to find in the yard . They are my dog 's favorite .
5 #### We have an 11 - mo old lab puppy who is fetch crazy . The only thing is , when you 're not throwing the ball , he really likes to chew off the fuzz , then chew it in half . While these balls are the size of a tennis ball , their walls are much sturdier . The balls are much heavier , and while he can strip the fuzz somewhat , he has n't been able to break through that solid construction . We are teaching him not to chew up his toys , but it 's a process . These chuckit tennis balls are keepers , for sure .
2 #### Unles your dog will not sit and chew on them , do n't waste your money . My lab chewd up in 5 minutes .
1 #### My Lab puppy destroyed both of the balls I bought her within 30 minutes . First she pulled the fuzz off then ate the balls ... Complete waste of money .
1 #### OK , I have a second job to support my Malinois . She is 75 lbs of energy . I have used the chuckit to keep my sanity and the ultraballs generally hold up well for a few months of daily play . I saw these and thought they would be similar . I am not straight up telling you my dog put her paws on one of these , grabbed it with her teeth , and ripped it in two in 2 seconds flat . Subsequently , each ball was shredded and dangerous within a few throws ..... for a large aggressive dog these are worse than tennis balls which everyone knows are bad . So Chuckit company gets blessings for keeping me sane by extending my throw and wearing the dog out after equivalent of 1.5 miles sprinting ( her not me ) . Vendor gets 5 stars for delivery and there was nothing false about the advert per say . However , IMHO , Chuckit should basically say , " If you dog is comatose or edentulous and ways less than 10 lbs , this is the ball for you ...... everyone else spend the money and by the ultra ball .
5 #### These tennis balls really hold up to super chewers and puppies ! !
5 #### Same size as standard tennis balls and works great in standard size launcher
5 #### Our dog loves these balls . We had to replace all her tennis balls when they started to affect her teeth so needed a ball that size without the fuzzy coating , added bonus is that when we play with them outside she can hear them land more easily because they 're heavier than tennis balls and they do n't get lost because the color is so bright . Also , she 's a heavy chewer and they last longer than most toys .
2 #### My dog split them in half in just a matter of minutes while playing fetch . She was not allowed to lay and chew on them yet was able to bite them in half running back to me with them .
1 #### I can not say enough about how disappointing the quality is . Literally the first time throwing it and watching my dog open it in 30 seconds . By the time I got over to pick it up and throw it again it looked like this . It is worse than a regular tennis ball .
3 #### I personally love these , and so does my pit - bull , lab mix , but they do not last to his much love for them . They are not durable enough for his chewing habits . Hoping the solid rubber Chuckits will be a better option .
5 #### I have two labs that love to chase these things . You ca n't have enough of them . The local stores sell these for $ 5.99 . You ca n't go wrong on Amazon .
5 #### Good product , but my dog started pulling the fuzz off and eating it , so I had to give them away ... if your dog 's not a fuzz eater , they 're great for playing catch and much more durable then standard tennis balls .
3 #### Nice size but my German Shepard can still destroy it in less than 3 minutes !
1 #### My puppy chewed off the orange fabric on the ball . very cheap
3 #### Overall , the price was good for these , and they arrived quickly . However , my puppy destroyed these in a matter of days . The size was good for my 10 month lab puppy .
5 #### My dog drools over the chuck it . She could literally go for hours of my throwing the ball . Although the chuck it works with tennis balls , the chuck it ball are nice and bright and makes it easier to see .
5 #### My neighbors dog Ted transforms balls and freebies into rubbish really quickly . These balls are so sturdy that they last ages . He seems to like the resistance to his teeth and with this around he wo n't even go for the tennis balls . They fit perfectly into the plastic launcher that we purchased with them so we never have to touch the slobbery balls or quit throwing . Win for Ted and my family . Each ball seems to last about 6 months .
5 #### I love chuck it balls for my dog and he does to .
1 #### Our Golden has always loved chuckit ! but the last 6 or so large balls I have bought have all split along the seam with in days of him playing with it . Very disappointing . The picture was taken the same day we opened the package :-(
5 #### Always great for the dogs . It is fuzzy like a tennis ball so I have to watch the dogs when they start chewing on it but it is great for fetch with the chuck it .
5 #### These are standard dog tennis balls that can be used to replace the original chuck it ball your dog immediately destroyed . My pupper takes a " you can look but you ca n't touch " approach to fetch , and he makes sure to pop new tennis balls because I guess they are easier to carry around in tqwo pieces .. I have yet to find a tennis ball that can stand up to his desire to destroy in 2 seconds , buthese are great for the price ! I 'll be purchasing more since , well , see above .
5 #### Almost half what the pet stores get and almost impossible to destroy by lab and vizsla , only thing better is Chuck It super balls more durable and less sloober .
5 #### Bought this product for my neighbors boxer . He loves it ! Plays with them everyday . They are durable & easy to wash when his slobber is all over them or its been raining & they get dirty . The delivery was fast & the product was just what I expected . I highly recommend them .
4 #### My dogs a heavy chewer and definitely chews right through these if we forget to pick them up after . Luckily , these come in a pack of 4 so we quickly learned to pick the ball up immediately when he 's done playing fetch and now they 're lasting a lot longer .
4 #### My dog loves these . The only issue is he pulls the fibers off of the ball , but he does this with all tennis balls .
5 #### My dog is a chuckit addict and I prefer the orange balls for locating them in the field . She 's really abused these tennis balls and they have survived . I can imagine a larger , more aggressive dog can destroy them easily , but my 40 lb cattle dog prefers to carry them around in her mouth as well as chase them .
2 #### no better than a regular tennis ball , does n't stand up to the abuse my shepherd gives it , fails in just a couple days
4 #### These tennis balls are nice however my dog chewed them apart in just a few minutes . These are perfect for small dogs but medium / large dogs might need something stronger . Still great for fetch !
4 #### I thought that these were going to last longer than they did . They were a bit more durable than tennis balls , but my serious chewers killed them within days . There are few toys that my dogs ca n't destroy , so I do n't blame the product but I will stick with cheap tennis balls . Not recommended if you have serious chewers like I do but these would be great for other dogs .
1 #### After 5 - minutes of light play I noticed one of the balls had already cracked . I 'll be sticking to the large tennis balls squeakers as they last much longer . Just thought I 'd try these out since they looked promising .
5 #### My dog does n't care for tennis balls , so I gave them to a friend who 's dog is obsessed .
5 #### Good quality dog toy . Nice and heavier than the other cheaper tennis balls I 'd purchased at the store . Good quality , and expect it to last as long as my dog does n't hide them in the yard . Also , great because they 're bright , and easy to find .
3 #### Meant to order the hard rubber chick it balls but ordered these on accident . Figured I would give them a shot with my puppy , he had them coming apart in minutes . Admittedly I knew he would as he is a heavy chewer so it was my fault . My dog does love them though and they are good quality if your dog is n't so focused on tearing them apart . Unfortunately my puppy believes that is the point in them , chuck it does make great rubber balls that stand up to him as well .
5 #### My dog has rarely met a toy he does n't love . My dog has had almost every toy out there . He prefers squeakers . These came on add - on super deal , GIANT TENNIS BALLS ( I think chuckit makes great dog toys all in all).\ TO MY SURPRISE THIS NON SQUEAKING basically well made GIANT tennis ball - WAS LIKE A NEW WORLD OF EXCITEMENT . Another great ChuckIt product . ( we usually go for the rubber balls for their cheweability and durability .
5 #### I Bought the medium 2.5 " set of two as a test for my iFetch LARGE . They worked ! But they get very slobbery and wet like regular dog 2.5 tennis balls ( and the crappy blue ones iFetch sent in the box and were destroyed immediately ) . I have also tried the rubber version of these which say they are 2.5 " but the iFetch says otherwise ! They are a tee - tiny bit too small . SO .... if you want better balls for the iFetch LARGE , the medium 2.5 do work and once they get slobbery the iFetch wo n't throw it as far . I trade out the wet one fore a dry one . After that ... we 're done until the balls dry . As far as can a Dane / Boxer mix destroy this - YES . Will only take a couple minutes if left unattended . I only pull these out of the bag of toys when we are going to use the iFetch . My big boy wears my arm out so I got the iFetch to go the distance .
5 #### Nothing like them . Some of the best products for doggies on the market are in the Chuck - It family ! My dogs loves them . The color is fantastic and unmistakable . We have several of the throwers - just make sure you get the right size of ball for the launcher that you have ! Makes going to the park that much more fun and helps to save your arm !
4 #### Not as durable as regular tennis balls , but fun until they are broken through .
4 #### My dogs loved these . Not a 5 star review because my guys were able to destroy them fairly quickly .
4 #### Great oversized tennis ball . Not incredibly durable if you have a large breed dog . My adult German Shepherd broke it in half after a week of light play . She does love catching it though !
5 #### i accidentally got these in medium instead of the large . but i still use this for my pitbull . she has a very strong bite and these are pretty durable .
5 #### Wish they squeaked but they 're exactly what they say they are . I bought 16 and then bought another 40 so obviously I like them .
5 #### Dog likes them and that 's good enough for me !
3 #### my gsd gets these pretty gross really quick . he prefers the rubber kind and me too !
5 #### Dog loves them and has n't been able to tear them apart or crush them as easily as some other tennis balls ( 60 lbs german shepard mix ) . Bright color makes them easy to find when she inevitably DOESN'T bring the ball back to me .
5 #### These are your standard Chuckit ! Tennis balls . Great price at $ 2.54 especially for a 4 pack ! You ca n't beat this price anywhere !
5 #### 57lbs Husky / German Shepard loves it . I leave it outside , and it 's softened up a bit , but she also seems to love it more that way . I 'd buy em again .
5 #### A must have with the chuck it thrower ! Extra balls for your go fetch critter is always appropriate ! 10 Stars !
2 #### We bought these for our Great Dane after having a great experience with a chuckit indoor ball but unfortunately these were obliterated in a matter of 30 minutes or so by our dog . The fuzzy material on the balls became what seemed to be a choking hazard for her as she shredded most of it off within those 30 minutes and began hacking on it ( yes , we had taken the ball away by then ) . Love their indoor ball but these did n't last long . It made a giant neon orange mess in our backyard in the process .
3 #### My German Sheperd likes these but not as well as the rubber chuck it balls .
5 #### My dog is obsessed with these balls . They 're great quality and do n't shed fuzz like many other tennis balls . I always buy tennis balls in bulk since we bring them to the dog park , and these are a great price .
5 #### Great balls to go with the Chuckit ! I would think you could try tennis balls too , if you find a good deal on them .
5 #### Yay these are my dogs favorite balls ! I use them with the launcher and it 's the best day ever for her .
5 #### Chuckit ! simply makes the best toys for dogs . They are colorful , creative and incredibly well made . Best of all , my dog loves them all , never tiring of any of them - and he has many .
5 #### Love having these replacement balls . My dogs looses the balls on occasion : it 's so nice to know I have these replacements available . Their bright coloring make them super easy to locate in the grass , soaked rained ground too .
4 #### Nice little balls but not small enough for my Yorkie . She ca n't pick it up . There is a smaller one made that I found in a pet store .
2 #### I purchased these thinking that they were the usual hard rubber balls and was shocked to discover that they are covered in cloth . I like the rubber ones because they are easy to clean . These just trap the dirt . So , you need to know that these are covered in cloth , before you make the same mistake . Buy the rubber ones , they last forever and are more sanitary ....
5 #### our three large puppies love these , when my husband and the puppies are playing this toy can wear them out .
5 #### My dog loves these and the , " throw , " that launches these ! Purchase often because Throw really launches the ball . Could n't pass these up , they were an ADD ON for , $ 2.64/2 ,
3 #### Yep . Once again I do n't know why I buy tennis balls because the first thing they do is chew off that felt like material . Lasted 30 mins and that was from my 5 month old mini poodle who destroyed the ball . Not a good item for those hard core chewers . This ball makes a huge mess and can also be dangerous too if the eat the material . Overall I ca n't recommend any tennis ball .
5 #### It 's a tennis ball that is blye and orange . That 's about it . The dog likes it .
3 #### These are the perfect size for my 85 lb German Shepherd who is OBSESSED with tennis balls . They resist grim pretty well ( drool + dirt ) and have good bounce . However , my GSD pops them in less than 24 hours and then systematically dissects them into pieces that she leaves around the house . The felt skin seems especially easy to remove .
5 #### We absolutely love this . The kids will actually play with the dog again , before he would always try to get the ball and nip the kids . I also do n't see what the one reviewers problem was with control , ours went exactly where it should have from the beginning , even our six year old can use it
5 #### I 've owned a Chuckit ! for over three years , and I ca n't imagine owning a dog without owning one . They are durable , inexpensive , and a great aid to throwing balls , especially for we women who do n't have the upper arm strength of you men . They also allow me to pick up the ball ( any standard tennis ball will fit , though it comes with a two toned ball ) and throw it again without bending over , and you need not touch a slobbery , muddy , grass covered wet ball . I can throw a ball at least 3 - 4 times farther with the Chuckit ! than without one . They are very common among local dog owners , and the dogs love them . Treat yourself and your four legged loyal friend to this great toy . I only wish I had invented it !
5 #### THis is the smaller , more portable version of the 26 - inch Chuck - It described below . It 's easier to stow , but I believe ( we need a physicist in here ) that the ball will not go quite as far as the full - size version . Still , it will travel a long distance , may actaully be better for smaller dogs , and is easier to pack ! The Chuck - it is perhaps the best dog toy since the Frisbee , especially for dogs who love to run long distances to retrieve . That describes our golden retriever , for one , a dog who almost prefers chasing tennis balls to eating . Now anyone can heave a ball a long , long way so that your dog gets a satisfying workout and a more challenging retrieval . Just pick up the supplied colored ball ( or a substitute , as chances are you will lose it ) raise your arm high over your head and back , then fling it forward , with a slight punch at or near the top of your swing . The ball will travel far and fast . It may take a few tries , but it 's not too difficult to learn . With practice , you can aim the ball well , and control the distance and trajectory with fairly good accuracy ( much more so than hitting a ball with a racket ) . The Chuck - it is flexible and I 've never broken one . Of course , for very short distances , or for a more intimate connection with your pet , you can still pick up the dog - soaked ball and throw it yourself . Highly recommended !
4 #### A cold / wet weather alternative to tennis balls ... I use these or tennis balls with a NERF ball thrower ( looks like a blue jai - alai C shaped thrower at $ 10 ) in fall or winter . Tennis balls get slimy and wet from moisture or the dogs mouth . If you have a fenced tennis court , fall and winter are excellent for retrieving as a game reward as you get obedience commands . A tennis court is nearly perfect for ' here ' ( recall ) since the dog can not run away and learns that ' get it ' and ' out ' of the blaa result in playing the game . Some dogs quickly learn the fun of retrieving . So I use the NERF thrower on a tennis court if it 's not too cold or rainy . The ball stays barely wet , but clean of debris and spit on a tennis court . So , with retrieve taught ... for praise , small snack your dog may soon enjoy the game a lot . Use the game as a reward for commands like ' wait ' , ' stop ' , down ' , ' sit ' , ' place ' ( on a bench inside the court ) . The balls shown here are tough . Teach the dog with old tennis balls not to bite / puncture the ball . Get help from a trainer if you can not find how to teach it .
5 #### These are the best balls . Far superior to any tennis ball we 've ever tried with our goldendoodle . He will chomp those up in minutes . These he does n't do that . They fit great in the chuck it wand for hours of chucking . Only balls we 'll ever buy again . Great too because the orange color pops against the green grass so do n't get mowed over if left outside .
4 #### My dog is obsessed with the mini version of the chuck it balls . I do have to say , if given the choice between these or the mini chuckit balls that are just made of the rubber , I prefer the rubber , because they last longer , especially since she has a tendency to leave them outside in the weather and the fuzz can be eventually chewed off .
5 #### perfect size and the best color option for finding them in the pasture .
1 #### Tennis ball broke literally within ten minutes of giving to my Weimaraner mix
3 #### These are more like tennis balls and do n't bounce like the other version . Get the ones that do n't have fuz , they bounce a lot higher .
5 #### these balls are perfect for playing fetch with the dogs . not only do they last awhile but they also add to the fun they bounce very well so if my dog hits it it 'll bounce some where else which just adds to the fun for him ! ! ! I highly recommend these my 65 lb lab dog loves these ! !
5 #### Regular tennis balls are not good for your pups teeth so this is the healthier alternative ! I have two larger dogs and they love these balls !
5 #### These are my favorite balls for my dog . As a bonus at least at my dog park not many people use them so it 's easy to see and find .
2 #### My dogs pull the fibers off of it . Not good .
5 #### Great balls for the launcher but can be split in two by my dog
3 #### Probably great if your dog will return the ball without pulling the fuzz off and tearing the ball into small pieces .
5 #### I give these 5 stars because my dog absolutely loves them . He is pretty rough with things , so usually these last just a few days . The ball itself tends to crack along the seam , at which point my dog ca n't help but tear off the fabric . I find it frustrating that they break , but I have not found a better ball for my dog that is safe indoors , safe for him , and lasts even a couple of days . My dog is small , and these are just fine for his gymnastic catching routines .
4 #### I really like playing with my dog with her tennis balls . They are the perfect size for her ! My only complaint is they are n't built for chewing . I have to get them away from her as soon as we finish .
4 #### Much better than regular tennis balls . My dog chews on the balls , so I have learned that the felt comes off quite easily .
5 #### I love this tennis ball launcher ! I m not a very strong armed woman and this launcher helps me through the ball even farther . One of the best purchases for my dogs !
1 #### I have used these ball launchers before , and enjoyed them , but this one is not what I was expecting at all . I got the short sport launcher , and the fact that there is a learning curve with that size is no joke ! Everyone in my house that tries to use it has a hard time actually launching the ball . I think the longer chuck - its might work a lot better , but this shortie was basically a waste of money . I have tried to throw the ball with it every which way . Side - arming it seems to work the best , but it 's very hard to control what direction the ball is going to go with that method . Better than straight down or hitting my dog trying to overhand it tho ! Get the longer ball launcher , not this shortie one . You will thank me later .
3 #### My pet enjoys it but the ball are not durable enough for long lasting
5 #### My dashund puppy loves to play ball with these balls .
5 #### My Labs are thrilled now that we are back to " chukit - ing " - endlessly .
4 #### Perfect size for puppies or very small breeds , I did n't get the same color as they picture , instead I got a completely bright orange ball and I sometimes find orange fuzzies throughout the house , but super great to teach fetch to your new pup .
3 #### Probably a favourite in my lab household . Only wish I had n't bought the felt ones as the like to rip it off and eat it ! Hopefully wo n't cause them any troubles but so far they 're having a blast . Not the most durable but 3 stars for keeping my boys happy .
5 #### My dachshund loves these . They 're the perfect size for his little mouth .
4 #### I like these . They 're easy to see in the grass .
5 #### Love these ! ! They are the same size as tennis balls , but you can find them in the grass ! ! This is very beneficial , esp at the dog park . I started my heeler off with the size small balls as a puppy , we just made the jump to mediums . I would recommend these !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R3ALU83XRVSUWL " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1%2BTq7nG2bS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1wY94fuyXS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;This chuck can sure fling the ball far . My young pup loves it ! ! Everyone at the dog park has them I can see why .
5 #### Very fun and well - made product ! Our dogs enjoy it . It 's easy to use and very sturdy !
5 #### Works great and my dog loves chasing the ball . Shipped quickly .
5 #### Good for the price . Got an orange , which I love . Dogs love that I can launch the ball even farther . Tired dogs = happy me .
5 #### 5th one we got . My dog goes through them once a year . She loves her chuckit
5 #### Perfect size for a small mouth dog or puppy !
5 #### Great small ball . Well made . I purchase these for my doxy who loves tennis balls . This is my second order placed .
5 #### Also bought the Launcher to go with these .... so much doggie time fun !
3 #### Product is fine so long as you are clear these balls are going to be destroyed . Know you are buying a temporary product that will not survive your dog 's teeth unless , maybe , he 's under 10lbs .
4 #### Not sure why but my 12lbs dog cracked one in half in less than 5 minutes . Found the ball cracked in half and he was spreading the outer lining . He passed what he consumed I was surprised a little dog could destroy a dog ball that quickly . Might just be my dog but want others aware .
5 #### My chihuahua luvs these . He is a small dog and these are perfect size for him . He had a different brand previously and they do not stand up to his chewing on them the way these do . I wo n't be switching back to the other brand . Its been 2 month since I purchased them and they still look almost new .
1 #### I have a 3 1/2 lb papillon puppy that has to have teeny sized kibble . So we are n't talking about a pit or rottweiler here . Despite this , within a few minutes of play , the fuzz on this ball was coming off ! Since I do not intend to let my puppy ingest this , it is being returned . This is a ridiculous and unnecessary health hazard .
5 #### My dog loves these balls and the Chuck it they came with . She really enjoys peeling the fluff off the rubber ball underneath so if you 're not into picking up orange fluff then regulation tennis balls are probably a better bet .
5 #### I would like to know where these are manufactured ; my dog 's mouth has become quite inflamed and we are wondering whether the cause is these balls or something in the dye or materials.[[ASIN : B0081Z77QG Chuckit ! Large Tennis Ball 3 inch , 2 - Pack Shrink Sleeve Package I wonder whether the rubber Chuck - It balls might be a better choice ? I am reluctant to shop for pet toys not made in the U.S though I know those might not be perfect either .
5 #### IT 's a dog ball thrower- what 's not to like ?
5 #### I love that I can throw this in a backpack and go . I have two longer ones that are n't easier totable .
5 #### My high energy Doberman needs to play fetch every day , this is a life saver !
5 #### Well made and reasonable price . Shame the ball is slightly too big for my pomeranian .
5 #### My German Shepherd pup loves these balls . Not a regular tennis ball will be play with , it has to be the Orange Chuck it brand .
4 #### My dog loves these . However , once we are done playing fetch , I have to take them away from her or she will chew them to bits . Traditional tennis balls are the same size and do fit in our chuckit . We just purchased a bucket of 48 tennis balls , so we probably wo n't be buying more of these for awhile .
3 #### These are too big for my yorkie weighs only 4lbs . My 7 lb dog has already chewed most of the fuzz off of it . I worry about them choking . Hence the 3 stars .
5 #### Excellent balls for the chuck it launcher , the dogs love them !
5 #### My dogs love the smaller size . We have three standard poodles and the all love tennis balls of any size .
5 #### My puppy , and the neighborhood pack love these ! We love the Kong Air Squeaks but those break easily . The ChuckIt balls last much longer , and are more durable to the chewing that the big dogs like to do .
5 #### My Australian cattle dog only likes this ball . She will run after this ball as long as you throw it .
2 #### Chuck it . Do n't let your dog chew it . My little Maltese chewed this ball into pieces within minutes . She loves balls and playing fetch but , she also enjoys chewing on the balls . I thought this would be better to throw inside then the other brand that I purchase ( made of rubber ) . It 's hard to play ball outside right now due to the foot and half of snow . She goes outside and I ca n't see her .. she 's covered in snow and with her being white . Well , it 's best to throw the ball inside right now . I guess I 'll stick with the rubber balls .
5 #### great balls ! play fetch with my dog all the time with them
5 #### Our puppy loved playing with these at the cabin .
1 #### Many times I read reviews of people saying ' did not last ' etc , however that is true . Total junk lasted one minute . See pic .
5 #### I love these and the chuck - it tool - these are bright enough to find in a " busy yard " come pick up time . With a new 10 mo border collie who loves to spend hours chasing balls , this keeps hands clean .
5 #### My arm gets tired before my German shepherd does . This helps close the gap , but he still beats me . It 's a great toy / tool and we both enjoy it very much
5 #### My small 11 - pound Chihuahuha / Jack Russell mix loves to play fetch , but regular sized tennis balls were just too big . These are perfect size for her ! They seem as strong as regular tennis balls too , so they 're holding up well so far .
2 #### These are Crap ! They split and/or break in half after our dog fetches them 3 or 4 times ... and she 's just a small 40 lb . German Shorthair Pointer . Plain old regular tennis balls last a lot , lot longer .
5 #### I love the Chuckit ! tennis balls . They have a great bounce and both the medium and large are great sizes for our lab / lab - hound mix .
5 #### Our dogs love these and they are holding up pretty well . The fabric gets pretty gross outside , but we keep these as"outside balls " so that 's not a problem . I definitely would n't suggest bringing these insides from outside play .
5 #### I got these for my 115 lb Rottweiler . He tends to only have a toy for a few minutes before it is destroyed , however the Chuckit ! brand holds up really well to his powerful jaws . He has a few toys from this brand and they are all still around , which is saying a lot . Whether you have a powerful chewer or a puppy , this is a good buy !
2 #### My dogs hated these . I abandoned them --one by one-- at the park . Not quality .
5 #### About 2/3 the size of a regular tennis ball and durable . Our dogs love them .
4 #### They are just tennis balls . That 's it . Blue and Orange fabric tennis balls . If you 're looking for something more special , go look at the Ultra balls which are rubber - like ( and the Fetch Medley pack is a nice collection of various rubber textures ) .
3 #### I buy these because they are heavier than tennis balls and therefore go farther . The only thing is that if left with one of my dogs for more than a few minutes , they bit down and they break in half . Too expensive to constantly replace so I 'll stick to the tennis balls . They seem to hold up better .
5 #### Dog chewed them up in minutes ... but he chews baseballs in minutes too ....
4 #### Product was exactly as described and arrived as expected .
5 #### Like the bigger size so they can both grab them and play .
5 #### No more tired arm and shoulder ... just a tired dog !
3 #### Dog loves playing ball ! Downside is the ball that came with it only lasted a week before developing a tear in it .
3 #### My dog loves them , but they last for about a day before he tears through one ! Regular tennis balls are cheaper and las A LOT longer .... do n't think I 'll buy again .
5 #### My PUPPY is now 10 months old and 100 lbs . He does n't try to eat it .
1 #### My dogs can crush these and a 10 minute game of catch .
4 #### I 'm giving this 4 stars because they ship it with a cheesy ball . They do this so you are ' forced ' to buy the Ultra balls separately . Crafty devils they are ! The ultra balls and this thrower are a GREAT combo .
5 #### Best purchase I made to help throw balls for my dogs . Saves my arm and enables me to throw it about 100 feet
5 #### Took a little time to break in the plastic but works great . I take it with me on all my Dog sitting jobs . Keeps everyone running the whole time . :) Just the right size for most residential neighborhoods .
5 #### So I bought this for my 3 year old German Shepherd to give my throwing arm a break . He LOVES it . But I also found out that my 10 year old daughter uses it for batting practice . I guess if you swing it wrong it shows instant feed back on arm extension ( or lack thereof ) during swing ... So now my four legged and two legged kid LOVE this thing
1 #### The fuzz on these balls comes off in big blobs . It 's all over my house , in my dogs poop , in slobbery clumps around the backyard . Ick . Do yourself a favor and get some real tennis balls unless you and your dog are super into slobbery fuzz globs .
5 #### My little dog loves these and go great with the throwing piece
2 #### They are a great size but they fray easily making them a choking hazard .
5 #### My dog will play chuckit ball till she drops . Great exercise and fun for all . These are tough and easy to see in the grass .
4 #### Like other reviewers mentioned , I found these balls to be little less durable than I would have expected . That being said , I think they would work well as strictly a fetch toy . But if you have the type of dog who likes to lay down with his toy after a game of fetch and chew on the ball , then this may not be the best option . Between my two dogs , the 4 balls that we had have now been reduced to one . I 've had standard tennis balls and they seem to hold up better than these . But , again , as a fetch - only ball , I think they would work well . If you have a dog that is going to chew on it , I 'd recommend on of Chuckit ! 's more durable rubber balls . They 're equally as entertaining ( if not more so ) than these and last much longer .
5 #### Good weight , bounce and durability . The darker color does n't look as nasty as a yellow tennis ball after our dog plays with it in the yard .
3 #### These are exactly like regular tennis balls . Not a bad price for 4 balls . However , my dog seems to have an easier time finding the bright yellow balls in the green grass . ( I thought dogs were color blind .... ) Anyway , she does like these two - tone balls as well .
5 #### The dogs enjoy these so much and they 're more durable than regular tennis balls . Ca n't beat them !
5 #### I purchased this Launcher and also purchased a double pack each of the Rebounce ball and Erratic ball . My dogs enjoy play time a lot . I do n't have the space in my backyard to be able to really launch the balls . It 's big enough to really wear down the dogs though with quite a few throws .
5 #### Works very well . I do n't have a good throwing arm so playing fetch with my dog was a chore until I got this . Great product .
5 #### Great quality toy , makes throwing the ball for dogs very easy and effortless , especially for those with disabilities , elderly , or even children .
5 #### Great for dogs that need to burn some energy . If your dog is a chewer get the upgraded tougher balls . The one it comes with is n't designed for super chewy dogs . Lol great product regardless . Purchased the larger one as well .
5 #### This is the same exact one that I found at the Petsmart for $ 11 , works great !
5 #### Both of our dogs love the chuck it balls . We love the handle used to throw them !
4 #### Durable . The covers get wet and slimy pretty quickly so I wish there was a bit less fuzz on the covering . I do n't normally pick them up anyway , but use the tosser .
2 #### My dog ate the orange felt right off of it and ripped the rubber apart after the first use . I do n't recommend this if you have a strong chewer .
5 #### These original ball replacements are better than the rubber ones . The texture allows them to be easily thrown , whereas the rubber ones are textured like a basketball and very difficult to throw .
5 #### Bought these to donate to the dog park . Within two days the other dogs had ripped them to pieces . I am prone to blame the owners for not monitoring their use , but just be aware that these balls are n't mean to be chewed ! ! ! They 're for fetch and chase only !
1 #### GARBAGE CARDBOARD MATERIAL Shame on this company for ripping pet owners off .
5 #### Perfect with the launcher and easy to find if your dog does n't
5 #### My dog loves this size ball for fetching ( Chocolate lab )
3 #### These are nice but could not stand up to the chewing of my small but obsessive Boston terrier .
5 #### These little guys bounce into next week ........... and beyond ! ! ! My dogs LOVE THEM ! And since I dog sit , it 's great to use them with a " Chuck It " wand since it can toss these balls for much longer and further than I normally would or could ! And they are not as easy to tear apart as some other balls we 've used . Which is good if you have chewing pups around !
3 #### Sadly , they did n't last with my chewer . Loved the size , not the quality . Oh and they did n't squeak , and my boy loves a good squeak toy !
3 #### i thought they would be stronger than they turned out to be . they are thick and heavy but my pitbull broke it IMMEDIATELY . i could see it split where the seam was . probably works for most dogs .
2 #### These are 3 + inches , do n't seem 2.5 ... These are pretty much the same size as regular tennis balls , which I did n't realize . So if a regular tennis ball is too big for your dog , this is n't the ball for you . I agree with what a few other reviewers said ... if you need this size , just buy regular tennis balls for cheaper .
5 #### My dog tears the cheaper balls apart and these actually last awhile and are n't expensive !
5 #### These are slightly larger than an average tennis ball and made to use with the Chuckit ! , which I love using . I do keep this ball aside for that particular use so they have stood up well .
5 #### I and my dog love this thing . My unaided throwing is at best erratic so my collie is especially grateful for the chuck it : ) This is the short one and it throws the ball plenty far in my quarter acre backyard . If you 're playing fetch on a big field , you might need the longer one .
4 #### The 26 m might be a bit better , this took a little getting used to , but can throw further than other products . The hand - grip is less comfortable than the 26 M
5 #### Makes fetch soooo much easier . Flick the ball 100 feet effortlessly ! Equally important u can pick the ball up without bending over much and keep the sliver off your hand ! Really a awesome invention ! * * * I highly recommend chuck it balls . The bounce twice as far and they float . Also they offer a glow version that makes fetch in the dark and snow much better . The dog can see it better . If they ca nt find it you can easily . Just helps to have a flashlight to quickly charge it up with light absorption .
3 #### My dog does nt like to play so we have n't use these all that much . I ended up using them to help with my foot soreness after long runs .
2 #### My Lab busted them in each ball in about 20 minutes by chewing them .
5 #### Nice sturdy balls for my 12 lb . Maltipoo :)
4 #### Nice , but you could probably get regular tennis balls that would work just as well .
4 #### I have the Chuck it and it 's the best investment I have made for my Black Lab . I will continue to buy these balls religiously as I have found normal tennis balls are more expensive and less heavy duty than these fetch specific balls . The size is perfect and they last a decent amount of time . I did knock down to four stars because it would be ideal if they were a bit more heavy duty for my 120 lb lab .
5 #### These are great balls for my dog . He is prone to chewing up everything in a matter of 10 seconds and it takes him at least a few days to get through one of these . I know that dosent seem like a long time but it definately is for him . They are a great deal for the price and he loves them !
5 #### Perfect size balls for my dog , she loves them
5 #### Best for my little dogs . Love it . Do nt leave home without it .
3 #### It 's a nice product , but too small for a German Shepherd . Standard tennis balls are 2.7 in diameter , this is 2 inch . I 'm ordering the 26L with a 3 inch ball .
5 #### I ca nt live without this ! I have a dog who loves to play fetch and a shoulder that hurts after the 100th throw ! This is an arm and life saver . Even my 5 year old can use the chuckit to play with the dog .
5 #### Love this thing . No yucky hands from a drool covered ball ! My German Shepherd did rip the ball open , but this chuckit also guys other balls .
3 #### It is a little loose to hole the ball .
3 #### Price is nice but my 60 lbs Shepard broke the ball on the first day and he 's not aggressive with things .
1 #### I bought this ball at my local pet store . I 've had great luck with Chuckit products , so I figured this would be a good ball that would last my dog a long time . I gave it to my dog when we got in the car at the pet store , then drove 5 miles home . When I got home , my dog had already chewed this ball splitting it in two pieces . This is a nice looking ball , that is no different than a much cheaper tennis ball . A tennis ball , will actually last longer .
1 #### Our dog rips these open almost immediately where as he can not rip apart regular tennis balls . I wasted my money on these - do n't you do the same .
5 #### Most dog tennis balls our husky mix gets through right away . These balls have lasted so long and go perfectly with the 18 M Chuckit . Our dog loves these and they do n't squeak so he does n't try and tear through them as fast as normal ones , in fact they are still fully intact . Love these balls !
4 #### Our dog loves her chuck it , and we love that these add on balls are so affordable . The orange is a great color for visibility , but our heavy chewer can and does break these on a fairly regular basis . They also really hold onto dirt ( and our dog really likes burying them )
5 #### Save your arm and buy this ! Amazing product . I 've read that after long term use the head starts to loosen and not hold balls anymore . If this happens to me , I 'm gon na boil some water in the microwave , dunk the head in it , and then form it around the ball with zip ties / rope / rubber bands / something . It worked in high school for mouth guards , and it should work for this ... just a thought .
5 #### This launcher is durable and works good in the cold . I am used to plastic shattering in the freezing cold . Easily throw the Chuckit ! ball 50 - 100 yards . The ball is very durable , and it is more likely that you loose it than it wearing out . It is more difficult to throw the ball shorter distances , but I believe the launcher comes in shorter models .
1 #### No lasting power at all , each ball destroyed after first use .
4 #### These balls are great for my German Shepherds . They are hard for them to destroy and last a long time .
4 #### Willow is a serious chewer , she 's a small Retriever mix and she 's 9 months old . These balls lasted much longer than the regular balls you 'd find at the pet store . She loves to peel the felt covering from the balls . It seems like she chews them for a while to soften them up and then she begins to pull and peel the covering . Then the regular balls split in half along their seam . These balls are much harder to peel the felt off . It took her over a month to get the skin off of the ball and when she finally did it did n't split in half . The blue rubber stripe that swirls around the ball makes it a very sturdy ball . I highly recommend these tennis balls .
5 #### Great , durable little balls for the pup to chase down . He loves them and they really hold up to the chewing .
5 #### Excellent toy for god to retrieve along with the Chuckit thrower . Chuckit equipment is the best .
3 #### My dog loves these balls and they fit his XL Chuckit but if you have a big dog then they do n't last long . A few bites from my German Shepherd and they 're gone . But he still loves them and that 's all that matters .
2 #### These are great for about 2 - 3 uses . Our german shepherd goes through these like nothing . I need to find a ball that will stand up to her chewing .
5 #### Love these products ... And out chuck - it launcher ... A solid company with solid products ...
5 #### I love these balls for my large dogs , they are about the size of a standard tennis ball and work perfectly with the chuck it ball thrower . They are relatively durable , not to say that they do n't get destroyed after a good amount of fetch , but last much longer than then many other ones I have tried . Amazon price ca nt be beat !
2 #### I have been terribly disappointed in these balls . I have only given two to my year old Jack Russell . He has peeled the cover off both . They do n't bounce as well as a tennis ball and he still prefers the tennis ball for playing . These are just for mutilating , and making a mess for me to clean up . Spend your money on something else . It will be better spent !
4 #### Nice toy . Good size tennis ball for my 15 - lbs dog . The weave of the felt is tight enough that he can not " skin " the ball as quickly as he can other tennis balls . May be too small for any dog larger than ours . Only drawback : they are quite heavy . May be best an as outdoor - only toy , as they seem like they would do damage to indoor spaces .
5 #### I have a 6 mth old black lab and I am a soccer player . I throw nothing . This thing is a life saver . I can play forever with him and finally throw more than 10 feet . Now if I could just train him to bring the ball back .
5 #### This toy makes up for my pitiful throwing arm . I have a GSD and she just wants to run , run , run .
1 #### I 've purchased these quite a few times over the last couple of years . The last two shipments have been a complete waste of money . The balls in the last two shipments have not been of the same quality and they crack open within a day of playing with them . Heck they still look brand new just have a big gaping hole . The chuck it ball that came with the new chuck throwing stick is still going strong . I wo n't be buying these again .
5 #### My dogs love these tennis balls - they seem to last longer than " regular " green tennis balls . Dogs eventually rip covering off , but it takes a lot longer than usual . Easy to find in the backyard since they are orange .
5 #### My dog loooves these ! and so much cheaper than at Pertsmart
5 #### Dogs loved it ! Worked perfect w / my chuckit and easy to see !
5 #### Exactly what is advertised , our boxers love it . Saves the arm and goes a long way , color stands out .
5 #### Saves ur body for repeatedly throwing chuckit balls . Our dogs pretty muxh demand we use it daily - sometimes twice daily .
4 #### Chucker was a bit long for our needs , and dog ripped the skin off the ball pretty quickly , not the most durable toy .
2 #### love the idea of a larger tennis ball that wo n't damage my dogs teeth , but these just did not last like a tennis ball does . disappointed .
3 #### Dog immediately started pulling off the orange fuzz with ease because it was thicker that the original ball that came with the launcher
4 #### My dog is a Golden retriever and he is two years old . I take him to the park often to play fetch and wanted this color that stands out against the fall yellow grass where the yellow tennis balls can easily get lost . I liked them for the color and they go far with the chick it . The thing I do n't like is that my pup eventually has the desire to want to tear the material off the balls . So when I catch him doing that I take the ball away . Also after a few times of fetch I 'll notice I need to throw it away because it begins to break in half at the seam . It 's thick plastic underneath the material and two pieces just glued together . So eventually they are trash . Did n't last as long as I 'd hoped . Plus he loves to swim and they will end up in the pool often . They eventually get water in them and sink to the bottom of the pool because of the weight and no longer float . Then when he retrieved it and brings it back inside there is water coming out of the ball that 's inside it . I will stick with the other plastic chuck it balls that are orange . They bounce better and float and do n't break and my pup has no desire to chew and destroy it . They last forever and are a few more bucks just for one but worth it
5 #### Awesome for my dog in the yard . Ca n't wait for more warm weather to go out and play some more .
5 #### If not for this , I would wear out my arm . So glad these were invented .
5 #### It 's great but I 'm not a pro thrower and would find the shorter handle easier to use .
5 #### IT 'S A BALL ! OH - BOY , IT 'S A BALL , OH - BOY , IT 'S A BALL .... need I say more ?
3 #### Too Expensive and they rip pretty easily compared to tube of dog balls I got at Costco
3 #### Aggressive chew dog destroys it in no time , one to two sessions at most .
3 #### If your dog likes to chew on the balls when playing fetch and has a strong jaw they will have a giant hole in them very quickly . I have a 40 lb . Australian Cattle Dog and after 2 sessions of fetch there will be a big hole in them . Cattle dog 's are bread to bite the ankles of cow 's , to herd them so if your dog has a ' more modest ' bite strength you might have a different experience . This product is basically just a regular tennis ball with a different cover etc .
5 #### This is a great toy . My little Shih Tzu loves chasing it and returning it . It also fits perfectly in her little mouth so she can carry it easily . Great product .
5 #### Great for chucking the ball and not tiring out your arm
5 #### My dog loves this ! Gets a ton of exercise . She 's obsessed with it !
5 #### Mine was the original Orange . Works great and saves my arm
5 #### My dogs LOVE the chuck it balls . Ca nt get enough of them
5 #### great balls- my dog loves them and as long as they do n't linger too long in his mouth- they are durable . He wighs 103 lbs .
4 #### dogs love them . takes them FOREVER to chew through them ( a regular tennis ball is destroyed in an afternoon )
5 #### High quality balls . My dog will only chase a bright colored ball now , so had to buy this set . Easy to spot in all weather / conditions .
5 #### My dog loves this thing ! Good length so I do n't have to bend over to get the ball . I would recommend to anybody with a fetching dog .
5 #### Works so well you may be fetching the ball from your neighbor 's yard ! Happy with function and stands up to kid play as well .
5 #### Helps me throw further and pick up balls without bending over all the way . Thanks for making me lazier . Awesome product .
5 #### No more slobbery , stinky hands ! ! ! This thing is awesome ! ! Launches EXTREMELY far ! ! My Aussie loves it ! Excellent for picking the ball back up without touching it , and you wo n't throw out your shoulder while continuously throwing the ball !
5 #### Our Goldens love these balls . They are larger than most , but they still love them . They are hollow inside and will eventually bust open with enough chewing , but have found the girls love them . Would recommend .
5 #### My dog loves them ! ! ! She is a ball fanatic . They are durable and bright .
4 #### Needed replacements for the thrower . Would be great if the dog did n't feel it was necessary to eat everything .
4 #### This has been a liver saver to throw balls at the park and not have to bend down .
5 #### This thing can buck balls super far with very little effort . Great buy .
5 #### this thing is great , it has a bit of a learning curve with how to throw it but you learn quickly . i use this with my dog at the dog park
1 #### this was too small ... it was n't a full size launcher .
3 #### These last longer than the normal ball but our pitbull puppy ( 1 year old ) is still able to chew them up if we do n't take them away from her after playing fetch . I was hoping for a bit stronger
5 #### My dog loves them ! These fit perfectly in her tiny mouth .
5 #### I dunno why but my dog loves 'em compared to regular tennis balls .. weird
5 #### As described . My dog could ( and does ) play fetch all day and the Chuck - It system saves our rotator cuff from the strain of throwing the ball over and over ! I should note my dog is NOT left alone with these balls to chew on and therefore they last a very long time .
5 #### Good sturdy product which will increase your throwing distance . My dog loves it .
5 #### My small dog learned to chase the ball and bring it back for a return sprint .
4 #### The launcher is nice , and does the job , but the ball is useless if your dog is a chewer .
5 #### LOVE not having to pick up a slimey dog drool covered ball anymore ! ! !
5 #### The dogs love it but I have to admit my arm was very sore after using this toy .
5 #### My dog can play fetch with this launcher for hours !
5 #### My dog loves it He gets really excited anytime he sees the chuck it ! He knows it 's time to RUN FAR ! ! Great way to save my arm from throwing out .
5 #### My only regret is not buying one sooner . I no longer have to pick up slobbery gross balls , and it makes playing with my dog so much more enjoyable . Seriously why are you still reading this review , just buy one already ! You will not regret it !
5 #### Chuckit ca n't get enough of these . Keeps our busy Lab running . We did not get the orange and blue as pictured , but they are the right size and our dog does n't care about the color as long as we keep them coming .
3 #### Not too impressed . I have a 10 lb dachshund and he was able to pop these open like grapes . Not as sturdy as the larger Chuck - it balls at all . If you do n't have a chewer they 're fine
5 #### We keep losing the balls for our chuck it and these are great filler balls .
3 #### Great for puppy but as the puppy grows this product did n't hold up and was easily destroyed .
5 #### This chuck it thing is the best invention for playing fetch with my slobbery Rottweiler 's ! ! of course I will pick up their ball and throw it back .. but not , I HAVE THIS ! ! ! my hand is n't drenched in dirt and slobber- this amazing invention takes care of that ! I absolutely love this
5 #### Buy this for your dog . Definitely a top 5 dog must have .
5 #### This shorter chuckit is our in town chuckit so the ball does nt go across the road . Wonderful .
4 #### I love the Chuckit products , using a tennis ball . The ball that is included pops or unravels in minutes , and the quality of the ball has gotten worse . On the other hand , the handle lasts for years ( unless your Lab gets hold of it ) . I keep one near the front door , and one in each of my vehicles . I contacted Chuckit and they said they would replace the balls . I filled out the paperwork , sent pictures , and they blew me off . ( No customer service . )
5 #### These are really nice for a large dog , like a full grown lab . Nice to have extras for the Chuckit toy .
3 #### These proved to be no more durable than a regular tennis ball . The covering is supposed to be less abrasive to a dogs teeth than a tennis ball . I 'm going to use the Fantastic Foam balls in the launcher because those last . For sling and catch I 'd recommend a 50c tennis ball and do n't let the dog chew on those , or get the foam or Jolly balls for dogs that destroy tennis balls in one second .
2 #### Arrived quickly and as advertised- my dogs destroy these quickly though , the rubber ChuckIt balls last MUCH longer- better investment ....
3 #### Ca n't get my Miniature Pinscher to chase the ball . On a good note , I 'm getting more exercise having to go get the ball .
3 #### This is ok , but I d still rather throw the balls themself . It takes a few tries to get use to it .
5 #### Melvin monster loves it ! Glad we live in the country so we can chuck it that far ! !
5 #### Makes endless ball throwing so much easier and cleaner .
1 #### They come apart in one use , not made like a tennis ball .
5 #### Work great with the Chukit ! Obviously , regular tennis balls will work as well , but these are fine . Durable and priced well .
5 #### Have n't used yet , due to other toys we bought . They seem well made
5 #### Great item at a great price to add on to an order . As an original item it holds up to use . We 've actually worn out the thrower since the plastic breaks down and loses its elasticity . We 've lost a few of the balls in the next door farm field and found them to still be bright in color months later after the weather has gotten to them . Our Australian Shepherd has yet to puncture them . The orange color makes it easier to spot then regular tennis balls .
5 #### Dogs love it ! Chuck it are the best balls for any big dogs . Not as easy to destroy .
5 #### I originally purchased this because I have rheumatoid arthritis , so throwing a ball far enough for my blue heeler is difficult , but I ca n't even put into words how great this is . I bought a second because it helps my dad pick balls up from the ground with his back and knee issues , and he loves it too . Bonus , my mini schnauzer thinks the launcher is a toy , so she loves it too !
5 #### This is such a great idea for older pet owners or those people who ca n't throw the ball far . It works great for my friend 's new puppy !
5 #### Works with any regular sized tennis ball , or similar . My dogs will fetch for hours . Can throw ball twice as far with the chuck it . It is sturdy plastic .
5 #### These are so much cheaper at amazon than at the big box pet shops . They fit perfectly in my chuck it toy . They size works well for my two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels .
5 #### They 're a bit more durable than standard tennis balls , and my dogs love them !
2 #### My French Bulldog LOVES all balls and he loves the Chuckit balls , as well . The only thing is , he can destroy them in one day . He does n't even really chew on them that much . After a full day of fetch , he gives them a good work - out and within two days , he had split two out of three in half . Compared to the Kong balls of the same size that he 's had for months , they ca n't compare in quality . I think he prefers the bright orange color , but the name peels off as soon as it gets wet and they do n't hold up to jaw pressure . I love the Chuckit ! stick , but the tennis balls need to be made of higher quality . They 're too expensive to have to throw away after one day 's use .
5 #### Amazing device . Do n't have to touch slober covered ball and can launch a ball a long , long way . Just be careful because ball will fly like a rocket . The tennis - like ball only lasted 1 minute before Doberman bit it into pieces . Highly recommend going with the rubber balls or whistlers instead .
5 #### tennis ball did not last we have a lab and a shepherd they devour these tennis balls
5 #### My dogs ca n't get enough of this chuck it ! There 's a little bit of an art to using it effectively , but it 's really a fun toy for the dogs .
5 #### The ChuckIt Tennis balls are my Labradoodle 's favorite throw toy and they last a long time ! Definitely recommend these to anyone with a dog that loves to play catch .
5 #### My dog loves tennis balls and so these are exactly like that , just different colors .
3 #### If your dog chews balls , these are not durable
1 #### Bought these balls thinking ... how bad can they be ? Well , other reviewers are right ... they are really bad ! My one year old German Shepherd went through one of them like it was one of those cheap foam ' stress reliever ' balls . I have bought other chuck it products and have been very happy with them . ChuckIt should either stop making this product , or remove their name from it . Stay away from this product .
5 #### Perfect size for my 12 lb dog . He loves them . Good price .
5 #### I got this for my mom and she loves it ! She has a high energy dog and this lets her throw the ball a lot farther for longer . But be careful , you ca n't always tell where the ball will go and she 's slung it out of the fence a lot
1 #### This worked well the first 10 minutes and then the bail quickly deteriorated and broke in half . Amazon generously replaced it and again , in ten minutes , the ball collapsed . The launching stick can only be used with specific sized balls which means that you can not replace the tennis ball with more common sturdier tennis balls . My dog is is a lab mix and is soft mouthed . All play with the ball was supervised .
5 #### Well made and durable . fits regular tennis balls . If your doggo likes to chase tennis balls , consider also getting a Chuckit ! Whistler 2 - Pack ( Medium ) . These are heavy , tennis - ball sized rubber balls with holes placed so that they whistle when thrown . The sound seems to add to my dog 's enjoyment of chasing after them .
4 #### This device holds the Chuckit brand ball perfectly as well as just about any other regular size dog ball . It allows you to toss - rather sling- the ball about twice the distance as you can with just your arm . If you have a dog that will actually bring the ball back to you- I don't- this can provide a great afternoon of play . Lightweight and durable- too bad it 's not made in the USA .
5 #### Does exactly what I need it for and my dogs love it !
5 #### I love this ! I 'm currently pregnant so this is a lifesaver when I play fetch with my dog . I do n't have to bend over too much to get the ball and it is n't strenuous for me to throw . Pup loves it !
1 #### I got these balls my dog loves them but they are no better than any other tennis ball , I got them hoping they would last longer he destroyed 2 in 24 hours I will forever stay away from tennis balls altogether . No my dog is not a giant beast .
5 #### Perfect size for small dogs . Bright color makes it easy to find outdoors .
5 #### Dog approved balls . Super bouncy and survived my destroyer ! I would recommend .
5 #### My dogs favorite ball and Great price for four compared to pet stores ! These are durable for chewers !
2 #### these are very small . Only good for a dog about the size of a chihuahua
5 #### Our dog is a toy beast . He can rip most toys to a useless pile of shreds in under an hour , but not these balls . He has been unable to destroy any of them and he 's chewed on them for hours . I will definitely be getting more of these , as he does seem to lose them rather effectively .
3 #### No a huge fan . My dog tears these balls up pretty quick . No the best quality and they fall apart even faster when they get wet . The lettering on the balls fell off as soon as I took them out of the packaging . Buy the glow in the dark ball instead . More durable and flies so much better .
5 #### Whaaaaaaat ? Four balls for this cheap ? Really I just had fun throwing all 4 on the ground and kept commanding my dog to pick all of them up at once . She tried for a while and it was kinda funny .
5 #### we tried the squeky ones and she tears them apart , they she loves and lasts and lasts
5 #### This is a lifesaver , or arm saver ! ! My dog loves to chase the ball and will do so endlessly , until she drops if I let her . If it was n't for this Chuckit , she would be unhappy or I would have a very unhealthy arm and shoulder . Great dog toy ! !
5 #### Good Quality . Makes ' throwing the ball do much easier and means we can throw his ball without the mess !
5 #### Love this , hard to learn how to throw with it but when you do well worth your money
5 #### I was n't sure how this would work out with the mixed reviews , but I have to say we love it ! I bought this for Christmas 2017 for our one year old lab . We 've only had it for 2 weeks so I ca n't tell yet how it will last , however , we use this every single day to throw anywhere from 25 - 100 balls . There 's no sign of it not being able to take this heavy constant use , hopefully it 'll continue to last . I 'm very uncoordinated , so it took a day or two for me to quit throwing it at the ground 20 ft in front of me ! Once I got the hang of it , I 'm able to launch it 100 + feet . We run our pup in increments of 25 throws ; he gets so excited when he realizes it 's time to go back out to get the balls . Best thing I did when I bought this was to also purchase 3 kong balls . The Chuckit ball did n't last a week ; first it split in half on the seam , that it became chunks of pieces all over my floor . All 3 kong balls are in use and still work and squeak . One has a little bit of a rip where our pup tried to tear a hole into it ; he was n't successful ! Definitely happy with the purchase .
5 #### Wish it came with the actual chuck it ball , not the tennis ball ( which did n't last 5 min ) . Got the smaller size ( 18 M ) because it 's more portable but still throws far enough to tire out my pittie
4 #### Great size for my 13 week old Yorkshire Terrier . He does n't get fetch yet , but he is able to pick them up and carry them around which is a surprise since his mouth is so tiny . Might be dangerous / choke - hazard for non - toy breed dogs .
5 #### Just what I needed for the ChuckIt ! Fit perfectly , heavy duty , dogs loved them !
5 #### Seriously ! These can not be destroyed . I have two large sheepadoodles . They can not destroy these balls ! They love to play with them .
4 #### Dog loves them but wish they were sealed stronger as my dog breaks them by getting them all soggy when catching and then they weaken and crack .
5 #### wow , so easy to throw the balls . and my dog will chase all day as long as you keep throwing it !
5 #### Love this thing ! My dogs LOVE to run and fetch and this thing makes it even more enjoyable . They used to always outrun my throws and now the ball lands before they get halfway there . Totally recommend !
5 #### Simple toy , but if you have a retriever , they 'll love it ... so will your rotator cuff .
4 #### I love it . Great to grab the ball hands - free . Dog loves it . Gives her a heck of a run . BUT ......... Get a different ball . The one that comes with it did n't hold up to our chewy doggie . We have a couple of others that are very tough , rubber ones I got right here on Amazon , and they work great . If the ball that came with it had held up , I would have given five stars .
5 #### I like the longer chuckit more than this shorter one but it still does what its intended to do
5 #### Chuck it ! Is the best fetch product out there ! !
4 #### The 26 M Launcher fits the medium sized balls ( found this out because I bought the wrong size ) and it works perfectly fine . They advertise being able to throw 3 times farther but as an athletic 22 year old I found that with the launcher I can throw about 25 % farther with ease and with a little luck and exertion about 50 % . I think this may be due to the arm of the launcher seemingly more flexible than I thought it would be . Works great for minimizing exertion / throwing out your arm and not having to deal with picking up a slobbery ball .
5 #### Love them . They launch great and you can always find it because it 's so bright .
5 #### I have an entire line of Chuck It Toys for my miniature schnauzer . He loves them . We spend hours playing with these .
3 #### I have 2 boxers and they like to chew on their toys . They rip these balls up within a week or two . I keep ordering them for them because they love them . Shipping and packaging was great !
5 #### Dogs love it ! They have a blast playing with the chuck it and the balls for it . They know when they see the items in hand its time to play and play hard
3 #### You should n't let your dog chew tennis balls , since it can wear away the enamel on their teeth . That said , if you want to play fetch you ca n't really stop them . I was really hoping they 'd last longer than regular tennis balls , given that they 're made specifically for dogs and cost a little more . No such luck .
5 #### After purchasing this toy my dog loves to play fetch this has encouraged her to bring the ball back to me whenever I throw it I love this and so does she .
5 #### Honestly one of the very best toys for my crazy cattle dog . Ca nt leave the house without it .
4 #### I like that it easily throws far and fast , makes the dog go crazy ... I m also surprised how much I like picking the ball up with it . So i will reserve a FIVE STAR review pending the longevity of the device . I would like to get a few years out if its grabability .
5 #### This is an awesome toy . I can play with our boxers without touching all the slobbery nastiness that comes along with playtime ! From a product stand point it 's sturdy and well made . Easy to use . Comes in a variety of pretty colors and is fun to use with little effort .
4 #### I like the longer one a lot better . This one is harder to throw accurately because it 's so short and stiff . Quality stuff , though , and a very nice price .
4 #### Should have read more carefully , this size is tiny . If you 're on the fence and have a dog above 20 pounds , go with a larger size . Ca n't mark it down too much since this mistake was on me , but I wish the product had better pictures for scale . Would have saved me a lot of time .
2 #### Nothing more than expensive bright colored tennis balls . One bite and it splits in half . It is not made up of a durable rubber so when I try to play catch with my dog , she runs with it in her mouth , bites it and it splits in two . :(
2 #### The life cycle of these Chinese manufactured balls has over the past 5 - 6 years been cur in half or even more . Yesterday using my trusty Chuckit Monster Sized Thrower a light chewer broke apart each and every one of these . Just a few years ago with a 135 - plus pound German Sheppard who was a heavy chewer PLUS some they would last at least several days or more apiece . I will be looking for another product to use as I can not afford to buy 4 or 5 packages of 4 - Balls each week ! What was cheapened - up to make a great product such a poor one ? My opinion only of course . Scott
5 #### My beagle loves to chase balls so now I can actually have her run a long way to get the ball . Since I 'm older it makes it much easier for me .
5 #### If your dog loves fetch as much as mine does , this is the best toy ever invented . The launcher is exceptionally good quality and it really works with very little effort ! I bought this so my children could launch the ball a greater distance for our dog , and after a little getting used to it , kids and dog are all very happy . Highly recommended !
5 #### We have ordered these in the past . It is perfect size for the chuckit gadget AND our dog CANNOT chew through these . Very reasonable priced compared to real tennis balls ( which are expensive ) .
3 #### My now 9 month old 35 lbs . part Bulldog/ Belgian Malinois pup chews every toy he ( and my other dogs and cat ) gets . This was no exception . I bought Chuckit Tennis balls in hopes that he would n't be able to rip it apart . He ripped them apart very easily . My 20 lbs . beagle / dachshund mixed dog absolutely adores fetch and retrieve but he started chewing them , too . As any pug owners knows , the pug would n't touch these and does n't retrieve or fetch anything that is not food If you have a chewer , get the Chuck it Fetch it Balls instead of the tennis balls . I have each kind available and love them all and they are all still intact .
5 #### Get this ! These work with the chuck - it ! thrower thing and they are also really nice for general fetch when you 're just throwing the ball yourself . The only thing I would say is that these do tend to get more slobbery than your average tennis ball because they do n't have the fuzz on them ...
4 #### I bought the Chuck It brand in addition to some regular 2.5 " tennis balls for a Chuck It ball launcher to be sure I had some that fit perfectly . These have a low pile coating which may help in the launcher which I have n't used outside yet due to winter .
4 #### But still a solid product , dog loves them , they 're highly visible in water or snow , and are durable . But like all tennis balls , they get a bit icky , and you ca n't really rinse them as well as the Ultras .
3 #### Really just tennis balls . Nothing fancy . If these are cheaper than other tennis balls you can find for your dog , then they are a good purchase . Nothing exciting though .
5 #### I got this one for my daughter Dog . She likes that you can throw the ball further with this sport launcher . She told me it works well . She would recommend this one . I recommend .
5 #### Every dog owner needs this ! ! ! Keeps my dog active and running a lot farther than I can ever throw the ball . Plus I do n't have to pick up the slimy ball which is even more awesome when we 're at the dog park . There 's nothing worse than retrieving our ball that 's been covered in a strange dogs saliva .
5 #### While my dog struggles with the concept of returning the ball to me , she absolutely loves this ! We visit a huge dog park frequently , and this lets me throw a ball far enough that she really gets to run full throttle ! Running is her favorite . Then , she gets to play her second favorite game of " keep away " with the ball . But she will actually let me have the ball back so I can sling it across the park again because she loves running so much . We now spend more time playing fetch than keep away . I could never throw it far enough on my own to keep her interested more than one or two times before getting the launcher . Now , we can spend an hour at the park playing with it . I have one super tired dog when we go home . Tired dog = happy dog = happy dog mom . I also love that I do n't have to pick up the slimy ball with my hands anymore , especially after she drops it in a puddle , because the launcher picks it right up . My dog gets so excited when she sees the launcher that she will bounce back and forth in front of me until I throw the ball . I only regret not buying one of these earlier !
5 #### My dog loves this ! Easy to use ! Can use other balls in replace of the chuckit balls too .
4 #### It does n't throw quite as far as expected , but my dog gets so excited every time I pull it out . I bought it thinking an average tennis ball would fit , but ended up buying a bunch of small balls for the chuckit .
5 #### I would recommend this one over any of the others . Right size for medium to large dog and throws the best of all of their launchers .
4 #### I got these on sale . Can never have too many tennis balls with my lab puppy . I love the orange color if we get distracted and loose a ball .
3 #### do n't last long . I love chuck it and the pole to throw balls with but still have not found the " perfect " ball for my pups :0 )
2 #### These balls are OK but did n't last long with ours . It was cracked after just a few weeks and the one of ours likes to try to remove the fuzz from the service . The regular floating balls work much better and stay cleaner as well . Better off with regular tennis balls than these I think .
4 #### I love the Chuckit ! Let 's me throw a ball MUCH farther , for my fetch - crazy dogs , than I can throw by hand ! Also saves me from having to pick up slimy wet balls , since my dogs will drop them at my feet and I just pop the throwing stick over the ball and heave it again . These replacement balls work perfectly with the throwing stick - my only complaint is that the balls are not as durable as real tennis balls . The balls that came with the original throwing stick split in half under the abuse my Cattle Dog gave them . Now he 's a senior citizen and has no interest in fetching - so maybe these balls will last longer with the other two Aussie - mix dogs .
4 #### Better than regular tennis balls . I do like the all rubber ones better though . They do n't hold the slime as much .
5 #### My dogs LOVE these . They are durable and bright- I do n't lose them in the yard . The price was spectacular . I will be ordering more when my girls wear out the current ones .
5 #### Got this for a friends dog and he LOVES it .
4 #### It does n't throw the balls as far as the big one but it 's great to bring along somewhere . Also , this one fits in my dog 's backpack so I do n't have to carry it . Still throws balls farther than my arm so it 's well worth it .
5 #### Where has this thing been all my life ? My beagle and I equally love the Chuckit ! It saves my arm from getting sore after the many , many , many throws she asks of me and with the different ball designs ( some have hair , some have googly eyes , etc . ) available neither of us gets bored with the same old ball . My only recommendation is that you take the time to check out all the sizes available and you choose the size that 's the best fit for you . The first one I got was a bit too long of a throwing stick and not as comfy for me to manage a slightly smaller version ... however they are all easy to manage and it 's just a matter of personal preference . I highly recommend the Chuckit ! launcher and accessories .
2 #### The ball is a complete piece of junk . My dog was able to rip the fabric off in less than 1 minute , the rubber was gone within a few hours . My dog has a few real tennis balls , not one has been damaged , ever . As far as the launcher , it will not hold the ball since it has no fabric left , it slips right out . To compare to a real tennis ball , I included a picture of the destroyed Chuckit ball next to a Wilson tennis ball she 's had all year long .... So , as far as the Chuckit ball , chuck it right in the trashcan and buy a REAL ball .
5 #### This is perfect for exercising and playing fetch with my mini dachshund . It gives her a work out that is easy on me .
4 #### Lasted a while but my pug has torn the fuzz off and ate it and has smashed both of the balls within 2 months .
5 #### I absolutely love these balls , its small enough for my shihpoo puppy to play with and carry around in her mouth and strong enough to withstand her chewing . Definately will buy these again .
5 #### My small dog loves these things . They are nice and bright so he can see them and the felt material does n't peel off in chunks like the cheap balls do . They hold up alittle better which is nice so I do n't have to replace them as often .
2 #### Our dog will fetch these , but if she catches a glimpse of one of the other types of chuckit balls- the rubbery ones- she will totally lose interest and only wants the rubbery one . Must feel better in her mouth . They also wo n't wear out like this one does- they only ever have to be replaced due to losing them . The tennis ball sheds its fibers and will wear out with time .
5 #### Great ! Works as described . Easy on the back , nombre bending over .
1 #### Although the label ( on crooked ) says chuckit , there were no imprinted name as all of the ones we purchased from chewy or local stores . The jaws seem flimsy , and are actually worse than the worn out one it was to replace . Amazon is Great for most things , but some must be seen in person
5 #### I love this and my dog does too ! I like the size . It is not too long to carry and I can still throw it far . It takes a standard tennis ball size . So glad I have it ! I may have to get another one if this ever wears out . I would definitely recommend this to others for great game with your dog !
4 #### The Chuckit is great - makes throwing the ball for your dog SO much easier , and the ball goes further than we would have thrown it . The only complaint I have is the ball itself that comes with it . My dog ( 50 lb Cattle Dog / Husky mix ) was able to check the ball apart . If you have a strong chewer , throw away the ball and use regular tennis balls .
5 #### This is the 12 inch version which is a little short on throwing range but long on convenience . Easily slips under a belt , through a carabiner , or even into a large pocket for hands - free carry . Chuckits are an indispensable tool for anyone with active dogs and this short model fits a real need .
5 #### Great for throwing balls for my black lab . I could never throw as far just with my arm . Plus I do n't have to touch the slobbery ball during play time .
3 #### The ball is really low quality . Little pup tore it apart in a few days . :(
1 #### My dog loves fetch and I am a huge fan of the Chuckit ! launcher , however the tennis balls only seemed to last about a week tops . The felt disintegrates and then the rubber ball splits into two pieces . I thought this was just how life was going to be : forever buying these balls for our launcher . Then a friend told me that they just use regular tennis balls so I tried it . I bought a pack of 10 cheap - o tennis balls for the same price as I was paying for 2 Chuck it balls and three weeks later we 're still using on our first ball- amazing ! It fits perfectly in the launcher and still has felt and bounce . Thank you , Chuckit ! for making the medium sized launcher a standard tennis ball size . I will happily buy another launcher if my current one ever wears out , but I wo n't waste my money on these tennis balls .
2 #### My dog fetched a few times , bit down on ball and it was broken , came apart at seam , poorly made
5 #### Can not say enough how great this ball is for our dog . He loves to fetch it and then have a good chew on it , before returning to us .
5 #### We have a great dane , so we need extra help to throw balls a long distance . The chuckit handle is great for this and having the balls in a bright orange make them easy to see both for our dog and ourselves .
1 #### Bought Chuckit ball and handle . I have Golden Retriever and after 10 days the ball cracked . It is a heavier ball for distance and thicker rubber ball under cover . It will split real easy after dog has it in mouth . I bought Kong Squeaker 3 inch ball works great ! Save your money !
4 #### I was surprised at how much my small ( 18 pound ) poodle likes this ball . I thought it might be too big for her . She loves to chase it and has picked up enough of the ball fuzz with her front teeth that she carries it by the fuzz . A nice dog toy . It will definitely get slobbery and soaked if a big dog plays with it , or if it goes into water .
5 #### My dog loves chasing balls . It 's a good exercise for both of us .
5 #### Just what I expected . My dog loves it .
1 #### Someone wrote that this is the right size for normal tennis balls , but it seems that normal tennis balls are a little too big and it makes it very hard to use . Not happy with this . I do not like any Chuckit ! product that I have bought so far . They make their products so that you ca n't use any tennis balls except theirs and I wo n't buy another Chuckit ! product .
5 #### What 's not to like about a Chuckit ! ? My dogs would play ball 24/7 if they could ....
5 #### Love NOT getting my hands all wet with slobber !
4 #### Works well for its intended use . My yard was too small , now I only have the launcher without a ball . Fits normal sized tennis balls
5 #### Works Perfect with any Tennis ball size Ball , Quickly Shipped as Well ! Great Seller !
5 #### could not have asked for anything better to take to the dog park .
5 #### good quality product . I got the orange color one . It saves my right arm .
5 #### So far , they 've held up well . Dogs really like them . Their humans like them as they do n't seem to get as slobber slimed as the rubber version .
2 #### I got these along with some other Chuckits for my dog , when they arrived I allowed her one of each type to play with . These were broken open and the outside material was all over the house within an hour . Granted she still wanted to play with them , but she was trying to eat the fuzz so I just pitched them . I will stick with Chuckits other toys because she still has all of those in one piece .
5 #### We have a lab / great dane mix who is obsessed with chewing and chasing balls . Big stong jaws and teeth on that girl [ Abby ] This is about the 10th different ball I have provided her and this is the best . Its been a couple of months and she is still in love with this ball . I think she broke through the ball with her teeth [ which she always does ] but she is keeping it intact . We put all her balls that survive in one pile and she will go and pick this one out for special attention . Bigger than a tennis ball , but not too big . very durable . easy to throw . she ca n't get it as slimy as a regular tennis ball . Its a good deal
4 #### I would say these are good for dogs 30lbs and under . They 're pretty small . My dog has n't destroyed them yet so they 're pretty sturdy !
1 #### DON'T buy them , the furry part of the ball comes off and my dog , a GSD , took the ball apart , broke it into two pieces after maybe a day or two . PLUS HE SWALLOWED THE FURRY PART OF THE BALL AND CHOCKED ! Apparently he likes to pull the skin off of the ball once he got the ball open . Luckily he threw it back out . I bought probably around 20 of these balls ( accidental order ) and after 3 months I have none left . Stick with the gummy balls , they are great , no chocking hazard and they can be thrown pretty far . Good luck
4 #### Great for the price ! My only wish is that the ball was the rubber one instead of the sport type .
5 #### This is the third of its kind . Toby wears them out , I swear that dog would fetch a bowling ball if I threw one with this launcher ! This size ( 26 M ) fits a standard tennis ball . If you 've never used one before you 'll be shocked at how far you can launch a ball with this . Aim it slightly down at first until you get used to it . Otherwise , you 'll be the one fetching the ball , from across the street or from a neighbors yard ! This is a great way to exercise your dog without picking up a disgusting , gooey , slobbery ball . The chuckit picks it up for you !
5 #### Great way to excersise your dog ! Or your cat , kid , husband etc . Not going to judge . It is a great work out for your arm / back . Do n't forget to use your other arm every now and then so you do n't become deformed .
5 #### I give this simple tool for launching tennis balls 5 stars . It 's more fun than shredding squirrels or playing tug - o - war .
5 #### A real arm saver . I still ca nt wear out my Lab , but now I can throw the ball farther and play longer .
5 #### My dog goes crazy for this . This came with the fuzzy tennis ball type but instead I use the rubber chuckit ball . Easier to clean , especially at the muddy park / field . Works great !
5 #### Perfect size for our German Shepherd . Now if only we could get him to drop the ball on command ...
5 #### I ordered three of these and this item is great , I own an 11 week old German Shepherd puppy that loves to chase a tennis ball and she grows bigger every single day . I was afraid that if I got a ball that was ' her ' size that I would not be able to keep it as she grows , but these seem to be just the right size , she can carry it around in her mouth just fine - she was carrying regular ones at 7 weeks ! They float and they also bounce great like a normal tennis ball , just bigger . Only time will tell about the durability , but these seem like the right size for large dog breeds to play fetch with in and out of the water .
5 #### Well how the old story goes , you ca nt get enough of a good thing . After ordering the Chuckit ( which came with only one ( 1 ) ball , I knew that I would need some back up ! Dogs love the game , and in time , I am sure i will figure out how to throw better !
5 #### My Labradoodle love this toy . It 's large enough to he ca n't swallow it and he has n't destroy any part of it yet . Made well .
2 #### I thought since the Chuckit super balls were so durable I 'd give these a try . These are good for 1 - 2 fetch outings each with my Labs . Regular tennis balls are much more durable and can be bought for a fraction on the price per ball .
2 #### These are the tennis - type balls that come with the original Chuckit thrower . They 're OK , but they do n't go the distance or have the " mouth appeal " of the Ultra Chuckit ball . My yard is littered with these balls and none of my dogs will play with them , only the Ultra ball or various Planet Dog balls . Plus , according to The Whole Dog Journal , these colorful tennis balls are laden with chemicals that are n't healthy for your dog . Spend the money on Ultra ChuckIt balls ; They cost more but last longer , fly farther , and are easy to clean . This product has been rated by two young Labs ( brothers ) , a Golden Retriever and a Beagle .
1 #### My dogs ( lab & golden retriever ) destroyed these in a matter of minutes , then I had to take them away for fear of choking . DO NOT ORDER . All of the rubber chuckit ! balls are amazing and my dogs love them !
3 #### Did n't take my dog long to chew these up , she tore off the fuzzy coating and the balls broke in half . They were fun while they lasted , she 's too big now for this small size and I do n't want to buy something that wo n't last 5 minutes . My dog is a Red Heeler . 6mths old now
5 #### Love this fetch stick . I do n't have to pick up the slobbering balls filled with drool ! AMUS only with the Chuck it balls ! Do n't just buy one .... two ...... buy a few and keep them everywhere .
4 #### I have a Lab mix who loves to play fetch ! It was automatically programmed into his DNA and every day he plays fetch . I have used other types of ball launchers and I prefer this one to the others because of the length and sturdiness of the launcher . I can launch a ball farther with this one and that 's a good thing since my dog loves to run . I like the feel of it in my hand and the ease in which it releases the ball . So why the four star rating instead of five ? In comparison to other launchers , this one does not grip the ball as tight so it 's easy to drop the ball before you launch it if you are n't careful . It can also fall out while walking with it . I had a launcher that incorporated storage of a spare ball in the handle so that you could easily travel with a spare ball . I really wish this one had that feature . Often times , we play fetch at night and the ball sometimes gets lost out back until the light of day . With a spare ball easily in tow , we could play for much longer . Now we have to get out a flashlight or stop playing completely until daylight .
5 #### Easier on the arm , and bending over , the launcher helps for picking it up to if your dog lets you . Sturdy and comfortable to use .
5 #### Fabulous ! ! My dog LOVES this toy and we use it every day !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2YYROQSHTE41O " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / D15fG%2BsU31S.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/81W4kFYR7fS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;This was obviously designed by a dog owner that knew the pain of a bad back from bending over and a sore arm from throwing for a dog that has an insatiable appetite for ball chasing :) I wish there was something that would pick up the ball and help to throw it too ... here it is , courtesy of plastic molding . This 26 M version is also the perfect size for griping standard tennis balls as well as the included Chuckit ball and the deluxe rubberized Chuckit ! ball , which is resistant to water . After a few practice throws , I was heaving balls down the beach 40 or 50 years with ease . Watch my demonstration video .
4 #### This thing REALLY launches the ball . Saves me from having to bend over . Picks up standard tennis balls . Beware bc when I use it in my yard I often throw it over the fence with no effort at all !
5 #### I m sure this is great for big dogs , but not for my lil 4 lb fur baby
5 #### I have a dog that could play fetch for hours , so this comes in handy . It fits regular sized tennis balls , so its worth the investment .
5 #### Fun to use , and I do n't have to touch the balls when I pick them up in the dog park :)
5 #### Perfect for my energetic pups and sometimes they have trouble with " drop it " but they get really excited when I pull this out to play outdoors .
5 #### my dog loves to play catch ... and i ca n't throw , so this has changed my life ! I just love these . I keep an extra because i have accidentally broken a couple in the last 9 years ... but they do last a long , long , long time !
5 #### I needed a replacement chuckit and my favorite size is the medium - length one . My only critique is that I had a really difficult time figuring out which chuckit to purchase to get a medium length for regular sized tennis balls .
5 #### Great toy , I do n't have to exert too much arm power to get the ball far .
5 #### Best thing I have ever purchased for my ball crazy Boston Terrier . The ball can get really gross with dirt and slobber and is a great product to have . Great color too !
3 #### Do the job at a good price but ..... Not the same quality as older models . This is not made out of the same material as older models . New material is softer and more playable . Does not hold the ball as well or throw as far . Durability is now in question . Glad I still have an older one . Would I buy again ? Maybe ...
5 #### My puppy would be so unhappy without our Chuckit Launcher ! We go to the beach almost daily and use the Chuckit Launcher and Chuckit Rubber Balls the whole time . I had two launchers ( in case I lost one ) and , sure enough , one of my launchers disappeared . So I bought another one as our back up .
2 #### Make sure you look at the size of this launcher before ordering . Based on photo I assumed it was for large dogs . It was n't ! Too small for our lab :(
5 #### Better than expected . I can launch the ball much easier and farther than I can throw it !
5 #### Inexpensive ball chucker that will save your arm when your pup wants to play ball for hours .
4 #### It does not launch the ball that far but it does work .
5 #### Works great , was the shorter of the models than I thought . Keeps my dogs excessive amounts of goo off my hands during playtime .
5 #### Now I can throw the ball far enough to allow my Lab to go the distance .
5 #### Great item . Keeps my hands clean while playing fetch . Less bending over and effortless throwing . Also , great customer service . Right after receiving this item I dropped it on the sidewalk . The end broke into 3 pieces . I contacted the seller to see if there was anything they could do . Without hesitation they sent me a new one . I highly recommend this item and seller .
5 #### We love not having to pick up slimy balls and you can throw so much further so it tires the little darlings out
5 #### I just bought this , and left it at the park one night by accident . Someone took it so had to order a new one . Both times they sent orange which is okay but the blue looks pretty . It really puts some distance on the ball .
3 #### This probably works well if you have a really large yard . But with a normal - sized yard , it flips the ball way too far .
5 #### We have two of these ! Dog loves it . My favorite part is that you do n't have to touch the slobbery ball .
5 #### Makes play time TONS of fun . Great design , fits easy in the handle and picks up the balls no problem .
5 #### Quite heavy and really sends the ball far . Great item !
5 #### Best thing you can buy for your dog :) I love it .
5 #### This is a great device . Even a child can use this to chuck a regular sized tennis ball a great distance at a park or field . The package warning says it 's only for supervised play , and that 's got to be from the power this device adds to a thrown ball . Our dogs learned about this device in a few throws , and now just the sight of it gets them excited and hopeful that ball play could be next . I bought the Sport 18 M ' medium ball ' version that works with regulation size 2.5 " ( 64 mm ) tennis balls , and that 's a good size in my opinion . The device ' ball grip ' can easily be used to pick up the ball once it is retrieved ... avoiding direct contact with dog slobber and field dirt that gets on the ball . UPC : 6 - 60048 - 06900 - 6 Throwing device is made in U.S.A. It came with one tennis ball that the package says was made in China .
5 #### Works just like a chuck it product should ... launches the all and makes it easy to pick up . Good product with super fast shipment .
5 #### Be sure to notice that the number before the letter ( 12 m ) means the length in inches . I did n't know this and was disappointed in the size . They gave me a refund though with no hassle even though it was my error , really . This made me very happy
5 #### works well with the chuck it glow in the dark balls , no complaints !
5 #### Love this thing , no more touching slimy tennis balls for me .
5 #### I really like this chuckit launcher . The dogs ( three of them ) have fun chasing the balls and it is much easier for me to pick up the balls and throw them . I 've had this for a few months now and it is holding up well . Although they have managed to chew a lot of the fuzz off of the balls .
2 #### The launcher was nice but unfortunately my dog destroyed the ball on the first throw .... I 'm super bummed . I thought that this product was supposed to be pretty durable .
4 #### This chick it is longer than the orange one . Tough on wrist but lobs farther
4 #### Good product . I did n't realize I ordered the short launcher but I can still ' chuckit ' pretty far .
5 #### Awesome product and fabulous price ! Great to save you from bending repeatedly to pick up a slimy tennis ball . Saves your hand from the slime as well :) The ball goes 3x as far with this than my kids or I can throw it so that 's a plus when you have a super energetic hound to tire out !
5 #### I got this for my daughters dog . He loves this toy ! And my daughter loves this because it does n't break her back having to pick the ball up over and over again ! Best dog toy / exerciser ever
5 #### If you really like dog slobber all over your hands then this is n't the tool for you . However for the rest of us , this thing works GREAT . No more touching that slimy dog ball then trying to find something to wipe your hands on . The dog stays happy and so do you . It also gives you great leverage and saves ones shoulder / arm from overuse . You can really throw the ball a long way if you want to . The only downer is that this comes with a fuzzy tennis ball which are n't particularly good for dogs . Get the ChuckIt whistler balls instead . they are smooth rubber and make noise as they fly through the air , making your dog go even more nuts . Well worth it !
5 #### I can throw 4 times farther and my arm never hurts . My retrievers get way more exercise this way .
5 #### My dog is absolutely obsessed with tennis balls and fetch , so I knew this was a must try for me . Both my dog and I have been loving it . It allows me to throw the ball very far with very little effort or " oomph " on my part . I can throw the ball MUCH further than I would be able to on my own without this device . Having a 90 - lb dog , this provides fantastic and much - needed exercise for her . I also love that it allows me to scoop up and throw the ball without touching it , as balls tend to get filthy at the dog park . My dog is already great at bringing the ball back and dropping it at my feet , so now I 'm teaching her to put it in the ChuckIt when she brings it back . Overall we 've been having a blast with it . If you have a tennis ball or fetch loving dog , I highly recommend this product !
5 #### I am not a strong ball thrower so got this to help with distance . Man , a little throw goes a long distance ! I have to back off or else it goes where it should n't . Very nice launcher .
5 #### Greatest thing ever ! My dog brings me the ball and drops it at my feet , I can then pick it up without having to touch it . No more drool all over my hands . WIN !
1 #### first website description not clear about the ball size , very clear about the length it lasted 5 seconds in a Yorkie 's mouth , ready for garbage and now not usable with a regular tennis ball
4 #### Works great ! ! But Balls got destroyed quickly by my Pitt !
5 #### Great toy to tire out your high energy puppers .
5 #### A must for Hours of fun at the park !
5 #### My dog told me to write a review saying this is fun because he can run farther than if I threw the ball by hand . He said he also likes being able to carry his own toy to the dog park . I liked the price .
4 #### Great toy to throw balls for the dog . He loves it . It is a bit stiff which makes it great for throwing long distances but more challenging to throw short distances . Still does the job . It 's better than bending down to pick up the ball and touch it .
5 #### Dog wants to chew on the launcher , not the ball . Not product 's fault . I 've seen other dogs get SO excited when this toy comes out at their houses , I still have hopes .
5 #### Petco sells this thing for 14.99 . Amazon sells this thing for 4 bucks . Buy it here . Great quality and picks up balls .
5 #### Chuckit toys are pretty durable , and this is no exception . I use this when I take my dog out to the lake so that I do n't have to pick up her slobbery wet ball . The design of it saves my shoulder from the pain of having to throw the ball constantly since it flies further with much less effort with this thing . This is definitely a great purchase if you have a dog that loves fetch !
5 #### Great product to assist me with my ball catching and Frisbee loving dogs .
5 #### I have two labs I could n't manage if I did n't have this great tennis ball launcher ! They get plenty of exercises chasing after the balls and it 's a joy to watch them . The launcher allows me to throw the ball about 10x as far as I can without ( I 'm a girl with a short sissy arm ) . The longer - handled chuck - it works better for my spouse .
3 #### I 'm such a dope , I got the short handled one . It works fine , and it is n't expensive , so I can just buy a replacement . This launcher seems as sturdy as the other ones I have . we will see how it holds up .
5 #### I like this shorter version because I can stick it in my bag and it does n't fall out or stick out too far . Almost everyone at our dog parks are now equipped with a Chuckit . The ball goes further with the longer version , but this one gets the job done .
2 #### I order the 26L. The chucker is great and saves the arm a bunch of energy ( hence the 2 stars not 1 ) . However , the ball was done within 5 minutes . Punctured on the fourth fetch , torn in half by the tenth . I like the idea , but the ball needs to be stronger to hold up to the strong clamping jaws of my beloved pits . The dogs never played with the ball by themselves , it was only during play with me that they punctured the ball . VERY disappointed in ball quality . If you have a weak jawed dog this might be good for you ;)
5 #### We just moved into a house with a huge fenced in back yard . My dog is obsessed with playing fetch for HOURS . Some times he is a little sassy and puts the ball just out of reach and this comes in handy . Also comes in handy for hours of throwing . We own two ! !
5 #### Our dog loves this toy . Purchased one for my mom as well . Great product , and saves the arm .
5 #### One of the best toys we have ever bought ! Our dog loves playing fetch with it . The only thing that could make it better would be a hole in the handle to hang on a belt loop or carabiner .
5 #### Handy gismo . Particularly for those folks with poor shoulder blades / sockets ! ! ! ! All it takes is a flick of the wrist ... not like throwing baseballs to home plate .
5 #### Great product and excellent price ( got it as add - on ) ! Now , if only I can get my dog to play fetch ...
4 #### unless your dog fetches everytime , you will be doing a lot of walking , since this thing throws a ball about 100 yards
5 #### For years I avoided buying one of these . What 's wrong with using my arm instead of one of these dadgum fancy contraptions ? I wondered . Well , this is TONS better . No more gross hands ! You can just pick up the ball with this thing . Also , my throwing arm is n't actually that good , so now I can throw it clear across the field for my dog . Be sure to buy the correct size for your dog-- I have a standard Goldendoodle so he needs a large , not a medium .
5 #### I saw this at a dog park and I thought WOW this is awesome . I heard people payed a decent amount of money on this too , so I was thrilled to see this as an add on item and pay almost nothing for it . This is a great buy and my dog can not get enough . I just need to find a large enough area to really take advantage of the distance this can throw the ball ! NO more dog saliva on my hands , this rocks ! ! !
5 #### This is such a neat and inexpensive aid for throwing balls . I have a large breed that loves to slobber and is also aggressive when playing ball . This keeps the ball away from my hands and they never have to touch the nasty balls . It also makes it easy for people to throw long distances , regardless of any athletic ability . It is great for people with shoulder issues , can still chuck the ball long distances without any effort .
5 #### My dogs love this toy , especially my smallest ! It turns out she is the fastest when it comes to ball retrieving . She is a riot - totally obsessed ! This toy makes it possible for me to throw the ball further and for a longer period of time . I wish I had bought it sooner !
5 #### Great item if you own a pup that Loves to chase the ball . I have a bad back and this is easier to pick up the ball and Chuck it for your pup . Love the colors .
5 #### THE best for active athletes ! :) Our border collies are mad about these ! :) LOL A must have for any active breed ! But immediately replace the furry tennis ball with the Chuckit Ultra Ball ( rubber)- the fuzzy balls ( and tennis balls ) are extremely unhealthy for dogs ' teeth , they wear the teeth down eventually ! So I recommend only using the Ultra Balls which are rubber and do n't affect their teeth .
5 #### all I got to do is sit in my chair and wait on our dog to bring the ball back ... I LOVE IT ! !
5 #### My pup is obsessed with this thing ! ! ! ! Chuckit 's are her crack . This totally helps in not having to grab her ball when its all slimy/ slippery ( i use the ultra ball with squeaker ) . I can finally throw the ball far for my baby and not having it slip out of my hand in mid throw ! lol
5 #### Use this every day . Dogs love it and so does my back .
5 #### Lola is our baby German Shepherd and boy does she have energy and boy do my shoulders pay for it . This toy had her tuckered out in a matter of 20 minutes . Thanks for a quality product !
5 #### I throw like a woman , well after all I am a woman but this chuckit makes me throw like a super woman . My dogs can actually cover some ground before bringing the ball back .
5 #### Bought this because of tennis elbow and rotator cuff problems . Always loved these and this one is no exception .
5 #### Love this toy ! ! ! Throws the ball way farther than I 'm able to on my on , tiring my pup out all the faster . Highly recommend !
5 #### Awesome ! Throws longer , tiring out the pup quicker ! Great !
5 #### Great product and saved my arm since my dog can fetch for quite a distance !
4 #### We were looking for the longer chuckit and did n't notice this one is a sort one with a small ball for a smaller dog . It is n't worth sending it back so we are giving it to a neighbor that has a small dog .
5 #### my shoulder is injured and I can not throw the tennis balls to the dogs . This is great . I am small and injured and I can really throw the ball far with this thing .
5 #### This is such a great invention . no more having to bend down to pick up the ball . just scoop the ball up and make sure its inside the cradle part .
5 #### My dog runs fast , she can run faster and farther than I can throw normally , with this she 's pushing it . Love it .
1 #### I can throw a ball farther than this launcher .. I can throw a whole lot straighter too . Total waste of money . If you want a launcher that does n't throw far , than this would be perfect . I use it in my small backyard when I do n't want to bend over to pick up a ball , nor do I want it thrown over the fence ; not what was intended , but did n't want to completely waste my money .
4 #### Got this for my son so he can play with our dog . The ball rips easy , but it 's still able to be used . Will have to see if regular tennis balls will work as a replacement .
5 #### awesome product .... lets me throw a mile so i can wear my Shepherd out !
1 #### I thought I was getting the classic ( tennis ball size ) it was huge ! The ball broke in 10 days or less
5 #### Great deal and easy to use , you can also use wiffle balls !
5 #### works like it should . and best price i could find
5 #### My dog absolutely loves the long runs she gets with this throwing stick . It is still working perfectly after 6 months .
5 #### I love it . I am short so I have better control over where the ball will go .
5 #### I was having a good time playing with my dogs with this what 's really funny is one dog loves to bite the handle that holds the ball and the other dog likes the ball so it 's a win - win these are fun
5 #### Very nice and sturdy . I do n't have to touch the wet ball my puppy brings anymore .
5 #### I absolutely LOVE the Chuckit ! I love this shorter one because I throw the ball for my dogs in my backyard and I feel like with this one I throw just the right distance . With the longer one , I throw farther so I like this one for that reason . Plus , I feel like I have more control over my throws with this length . Regardless of the size you get , these are great because you do n't have to pick up the slobbery balls to throw them for your dogs and I ca n't throw very far with just my hand so my dog gets more exercise when I use the Chuckit ! I got this for around $ 6 as an add on item and it also came with a standard tennis ball style Chuckit ! ball . You CANNOT beat this price in stores ANYWHERE ! Amazon for the WIN !
5 #### A great buy ! The best Chuckit you can get as far as size , no matter how short or tall you are .
5 #### We have bought about 5 of these throwers because they keep breaking , not a fault of the product our puppy is a chewer . And considering we are still going to buy these , you should know its a lifesaver .
5 #### This is the best way to play with my dog . She absolutely loves it when we get out the launcher . Even if you have a regular or small yard , you can still control how far you throw it . Plus , you would have it on hand for the dog park days - it can throw far ! I 'm not the best at a regular throw , but I can still launch this nearly as far as my husband ( who is good at throwing ) . Any medium sized Chuck - It balls will fit in here ( including just regular tennis balls ) . Even the whistle balls or Max Glow balls are a great fit . It 's a great price , and we will be using it for a long time !
5 #### So much fun ! And I do n't have to touch a slimy tennis ball !
5 #### My Queensland Heeler goes bonkers for this toy ! He actually brings the ball back and throws it at me . I love that my hand is safe from being bitten off when picking up the ball when he is overly excited and not being cautious .
5 #### Great size for my 7.5 lb Chihuahua / Schnauzer mix , she loves it !
4 #### Invaluable for tiring out my canine boarders , and save my throwing arm / shoulder- the " chuck it " brand ball that came with it , fell apart almost immediately- clearly not a proper , quality ball like you should expect , but a cheap knockoff ball
5 #### I love this product ! I can throw the ball across the park with hardly any effort .
5 #### We use this a lot it is very durable .
5 #### good one , does n't throw too far which is good as my backyard is big but I do n't want to loose the balls into my nieghbors .
5 #### Great fetch toy . Balls are durable and throwing mechanism is ideal for throwing ball far distances and not throwing out your arm .
4 #### The chuck it works great for my Labrador who loves to play fetch . No more picking up slimy balls . I like the harder rubber balls better than the ones that come with the chuck it . I have purchased them separately and the price is still a bargain for both .
5 #### While I think this is a great product that works well and is designed properly , it 's no fun if your dog wo n't return the ball !
5 #### This is a great toy , our Labrador just loves playing fetch , and this keeps us from having to touch the grunchee ball . We have taught her to place the ball right in where it goes !
5 #### Love the Chuckit ! brand and we use this size thrower for our Border Collie . I 've had this one for about a month . We use it daily , at least twice a day . I thought the ball that came with it would be dead by now but I 'm pleased that it 's still in one piece ( we only play with it with the non - destructive dog , but occasionally the English Bulldog has gotten a hold of it ) . It 's been through it all -- mud , bodies of water , the English Bulldog 's slobbery and destructive jaws . The thrower has also been through a bit , as our teacup poodle likes to grab the Chuckit ! by the " neck " and " kill it " whenever we 're grabbing the ball off the ground . It carries on .
5 #### Dog loves this as do I. You can really chuck the tennis ball effortlessly . Saves wear and tear on your arm .
5 #### My dog was adopted when she was older and has no idea what to do with toys . I actually bought this to exercise my neighbor 's Visla ... Once he 's tired , it 's easier to walk him ... This works great and does n't strain my shoulder or elbow . I get much more distance with each throw . Wish I had bought it earlier ...
5 #### Great way to have your pet go fetch ! Must have for seniors !
5 #### Kokomo LOVES the chuckit , but wishes it came with a mommy who would throw the ball more often , like non stop !
5 #### I have n't used it yet , but for this price it is well worth it . I could have bought a couple more for the price it is selling for at the pet stores I 've been to .
5 #### Save your shoulder and wear out you dog instead . These are great tennis ball launchers . If your dog likes to fetch , you got ta get a Chuckit~ !
5 #### I love Chuck - It 's products , and this mini ChuckIt is great because it fits in my smaller bag but still throws normal - size tennis balls .
5 #### This is great ! We think this size is great and it fits regular tennis balls . The orange ball it came with broke within a couple weeks , but we expected that to happen .
5 #### Our pug learned from watching other dogs to play fetch while we were traveling . So we realized she needed a ball of her own . We bought the two pack of supplemental balls that are smooth and easy to clean , and the ball that comes with this ( more like a tennis ball ) has become her indoor ball . The Chuck It handle is great for launching the ball , and the shorter handle means it wo n't launch too far for her to run . IF yoou have a dog who loves to fetch , this is a great toy to have . We literally have to show her that we put it away or else she will obsess about it , because she loves it so much . We used to think food was her favorite thing , but a promise of going out and throwing the ball is her greatest joy besides the ocean .
5 #### Sturdy , well made and my dog loves it as do I. No sloppy balls to pick up off the ground with my hand and you can easily throw it really far without huge effort . He chews on the ball a lot but we 're still using the same one that came with the launcher although I bought extra balls assuming that was n't going to be the case . I have purchased these for a couple of friends and they 're saying the same thing ...
5 #### Not much can be said that has n't already been said . I was literally wearing out my shoulder throwing the ball for my high - energy dog . The dog now wears out before I do . And I do n't have to touch a slimy slobber soaked ball . Wish I would have had one years ago for my Lab . This is the second one I 've purchased . The first one got left outside too much and extended UV exposure made it brittle . and finally it broke . Unless you 've got a place where you can throw the ball 200 ft , I 'd recommend one of the smaller models . Hard to keep the ball inside my 50 ft yard when we 're not playing in the open field .
5 #### If your dog likes to play fetch , this is an item you must have ! It throws the ball very far without the effort . My dog gets ecstatic every time I pick this up .
5 #### Just arrived to replace an old one . My dog loves when we play with this thing !
4 #### Shipping and packaging were great . My only issue is that we quickly broke the launcher - I think it hit the ground after a solid throw and the cup part broke off .
4 #### Wish it held the bigger kong squeaker tennis balls , but this thing really chucks it . Just need to find squeakers this size
5 #### My dog loves her ChuckIt . We actually saw other people using them at the dog park and she would always chase them around until they played with the ChuckIt with her , so I had to buy her one . Amazon offers this for half the price that pet stores do , so it 's a great value . The launcher sends the ball pretty far , and picks up balls easily so you do n't have to touch them . I 'm thinking of buying a few more to have on hand .
5 #### I bought this for my mom and her black lab , both of them love this thing ! ! Easier on your arm to throw and ball go 's a lot farther .
5 #### Love the shorter version . I only wish the manufacturer would make the shorter launcher to accommodate a large size ball
5 #### My son , or dog all you normal pet owners , loves this . He is a huge Doberman Lab mix and he loves to play ball and loves to run ! I 'm very petite , 108lbs , and I have a very hard time throwing a normal ball as far as he would like and this thing launches incredibly far . Easy to pick up too
5 #### Pup pup loves this ! If your dog is normal and drools at all , you 'll be glad you can grab the ball with the Chuckit ! instead of using your fingers ! The different sizes are great for varying lengths you would throw it ! We love this so much ! It 's far better on your shoulder to throw with this !
5 #### Love it . Bought one for niece and her new puppy as well . Way cheaper here then in local stores .
4 #### Product is exactly as described . Great price . Just wish it were a little bit longer so I do n't have to bend over . it would be nice if the neck were a little more sturdy and had less give when picking up the ball .
5 #### I LOVE THIS product ! I was in a bad accident just over five years ago and it limited my physical abilities . The ChuckIT launcher has given me the ability to play fetch with my dog again ! No need to bend down all the way to the ground anymore and it helps me launch it further than I could with my arm alone . I recommend this for everyone - especially those with physical limitations . My dog and I have a daily routine with the ChuckIT and I have purchased some of their balls as well . The glow in the dark ball is my current favorite that allows us to play every night after work as well . The squeaker ball is one of the dogs favorites too . One of the most affordable and fun products ever !
5 #### Arm saver ... As I 've gotten older my shoulders will not allow me to throw very far ... this is a great product .
5 #### Oh my gosh our dog loves this so much . Great price compared to some local stores and great quality . If you have a dog that enjoys to fetch then this must be a staple for you .
5 #### Our dog loves it and he is having fun and I do not have to throw that far this launcher helps me to throw that far . haha ....
5 #### Love these . I can throw the ball about 60 yards now and not have to touch the slobber when my dog brings back the ball .
5 #### My dog loves to chase the ball . It gives her goo exercise .
5 #### My border collie never tires from chasing the ball usually my arm would but no longer is that the case . This chuck it thrower is a modern day atl - atl created by native Americans for hunting boars and now helps me throw a tennis ball . It 's great that it works on regular sized tennis balls or medium sized chuckit balls ( I have the orange ball that came with and the glow in the dark ball that whistles ) . Needless to say my border collie gets tired before I ever do now . Never knew that was possible .
5 #### My dog and I love this ! My arm does not get tired from throwing a ball and the ball is thrown much further than I can throw it ! It would be nice if these product came with an extra ball for free because the ball gets dirty quickly .
5 #### Cause chuck its are awesome . My dog did destroy the ball that comes with it , but we get some of the little rubber ones that whistle and she loves those .
5 #### Chuckit ! simply makes the best toys for dogs . They are colorful , creative and incredibly well made . Best of all , my dog loves them all , never tiring of any of them - and he has many .
2 #### The ball feels heavier than a tennis ball but my dog broke it the first time he played with it . The launcher is fine .
5 #### My shoulder does n't throw half as far as this does - LOVE IT and so does my dog . Very little effort expelled to chuck a tennis ball across the yard - 150 ft - ish or so . Heavier balls will easily go further with really just a flick of the wrist .
5 #### LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT ! My young doberman needs a LOT of exercise and this toy really helps . I can throw the ball at least 3 times farther and he love racing after it full speed . There is the added benefit of being able to scoop the ball off the ground ( I taught him to " Drop it " ) and not have to pick up muddy , slimy , icy balls with my hand . On these dark winter days I can get close to wearing him out in just 20 minutes . We may have to invest in one of the glow - in - the - dark versions . Well worth the money !
5 #### This is fantastic ! I take my dog to open areas and let her rip around ! The chuckit always make for a tired pooch and not a tired arm . I 'm a relatively small female but am able to throw the ball with the chuckit a good 150 ' . My husband can get even more distance ! It 's effortless ! Also , the bell it comes with smell amazing ( like marshmallow and fresh cookie ) so that 's a win !
5 #### Makes throwing so much easier . My dog gets a work out and i do n't have to
5 #### Talk about making fetch easy and fun . Our dog gets so much exercise with this , which means less crazy puppy in the house .
5 #### It 's a Chuckit , you ca n't go wrong with this item . If you have n't used one of these you are missing out ! I have a Malinois which means I have a dog with ENDLESS energy . I simply can not throw a tennis ball far enough for long enough to tire this animal out . Enter the Chuckit , and all is well in the universe again . I can easily launch a tennis ball 50 yards with this tool with zero stress on my shoulder . The dog and myself are very appreciative o of this item .
5 #### Save your arm . It seemed like these things were up to $ 25 for years , but for $ 7 or $ 8 this is a no brainer . As my puppy went longer and farther with fetching the ball , I was starting to hurt my arm . This is a nice , simple product and easy to use . I think Fergus would only give it 3 stars because she just was n't ready for it , but she 'll come around .
2 #### This is the large size . A normal tennis ball is too small for this launcher and falls out easily .
4 #### These Chuckit ! Sport Launcher toy by Canine Hardware are awesome for any dog who likes to run and loves to fetch . These make throwing long distances easy and gives your pet a long distance to run . Super fun and interactive toy for you and your pet , however I wish that they would make the ball a bit higher quality . We did not have any issues while playing fetch , however my dog is a chewer . While not playing he still loves to chew on his ball , and he chewed through this large 3 inch ChuckIt ball like it was butter . Lasted less than a day before it was cracked in half and destroyed . Our dog is a pit / shepherd mix and so he is fairly rough with toys . I wish they made these balls more solid so they would be more durable . It was an easy fix though , and we just bought a solid rubber 3 inch ball and use that instead now . Definitely worth the money though . We went looking for one of these in our local pet store and they were selling them for three times the price ! Wow ! Worth the wait to order it on here . ~Thanx~
5 #### We love this and loved the price ! We have a couple now and makes for a lot of fun for the whole family outside in the nice weather !
5 #### Throw farther , save the old arm , no dog slobber , less bending , Toby gives the ball up without wanting to play keep - a - way he is loving it . Me too . Just make sure you buy the right one for the ball size for your dog .
2 #### Throws at downward angle ca nt get much distance so my dog is getting fatter . I can throw farther free hand
5 #### I never go to the dog park without this !
5 #### I exercise a pack of German Shepherds with this . They love it . The tennis like ball that came with it lasted about5 throws before they had it chewed in half but the chuckit balls that fit it ( I use large size ) seem like they will last as long as anything does with those big teeth . I can give the dogs quite a work out throwing the balls about a hundred yards up a steep hill , in rapid fire if you have enough balls and the dogs are trained to drop them when they return . So easy and effective and no more dog slime ( well , I do have to hose off the launcher and chuckit balls ) . Just make sure you get balls to big for your dog to swallow . I have two friends who each lost a GSD to swallowing a too small ball . Price is very competitive with pet stores in my area .
5 #### I have had this chuck it for four years , and today it is pretty cold and I threw the chuck it on the porch with no ball ( that should tell you how well I take care of this thing ) . The part the holds the ball cracked because of the cold and the impact of throwing it . Looks like I 'm out six dollars for not being slightly careful . I have used this thing almost every day for the last four years . I got it when my lab was a puppy , and it made such a difference when he was really young and full of energy . Now when I let him out , he runs straight to where the chuck it hangs and stares at it . My brothers dogs do the same thing .
5 #### This is the first Chuckit ! I 've ever used , so I ca n't compare the quality of earlier versions . I love this thing , it grabs normal tennis balls , so I do n't have to get my hands coated in slobber & dirt . The distance you can launch the ball is incredible . Whenever I took my dog to the dog park , my shoulder would be sore for days , but now with chuckit , I never have a thrown out arm / shoulder . For the price this thing ca n't be beat .
5 #### This is great for not having to pick up slimy tennis balls but I would recommend buying the more durable rubber chuck - it balls with this if your dog likes to chew on the ball , they last for a really long time !
5 #### Came in the mail today and MAX ( my German Shepherd ) was like a kid on Christmas . I was skeptical at first , thinking why do I need this , but this thing for at least the first day is amazing ! No more touching the ball and throwing the ball with this thing was a breeze and it went at least 250 feet when I chucked it . I am not sure how long it will last but I will buy another one if it ever breaks . Now Max just stares at it and wants to go fetch all day long .
5 #### Great for those of us who ca n't " launch " a ball on our on ! This will definitely get your dog running because it flings the ball a LONG way .
5 #### For those looking to throw a ball far with minimal effort , and repeatedly we are talking about dogs with a lot of energy here , this thing works great ! Can be used with Chuckit , KONG , or just standard tennis balls depending on the sizing .
5 #### This is a great toy for my ball crazy Chihuahua ! I can throw the ball a lot further with this product and I do n't have to pick up an dirty , wet stinky ball after she has drooled all over it :) It is well made and we have had a ton of fun with it . You definitely need a good bit of room to really use this as it throws the ball far !
5 #### We love it ! No slobbery hands now . Most of all our pup loves it too . The ball can go further than I can pitch it free - handed . ( price is great ) I had purchase one and saw this deal . Wow !
5 #### My big pooch loves this bigger sized ball and the launcher helps me to throw it a long way to keep him running . I also really like that I can pick up the ball with the launcher from the ground and do n't have to bend over or tough a yucky dirty ball .
5 #### this longer launcher really sends the ball sailing ... My BC is super fast , so this ball actually out runs her ! ! ! LOVE It
5 #### Perfect for wearing your dog out . This launcher can easily throw a ball 50 + meters . Works with regular tennis balls too .
5 #### What an arm and shoulder saver ! Much easier to play with pups this way . I had read where the provided ball had some issues so we 've just been using regular tennis balls .
5 #### an arm saver at the dog park ! If you have a retriever , you must get one of these !
5 #### Dogs love to chase the ball . No more hurting my arm throwing
5 #### I really love this toy . I use it a lot when playing fetch with my dog . He much more interested in playing fetch when I use this . I think it 's because using this launcher , the ball goes much farther . I also got some small Chuckit ! balls on Amazon and they fit it perfectly !
5 #### so much easier to throw ball farther for the dogs . and no slime !
5 #### I can not stress enough how this is the best $ 4 I have ever spent . I have a pitbull who lives to play fetch and I 've never been able to tire her out . she gets ten times the exercise me using this thrower than she would if I were throwing the ball myself . I did buy some of the small sized Kong balls as she 's a little rough on balls and it works great with those however the ball that it came with is still intact after two weeks of every day play .
5 #### My German Shepherd LOVES the larger Chuckit rubber ball and this makes it so i do not have to pickup a slobbery ball .
3 #### Wished it came with a rubber chuck it ball instead of the tennis ball . My GSD destroyed the ball the first day . I ordered the rubber chuck it ball and it is great ! ! Last a long time ! ! !
5 #### Good product . Saves my arm from wear & tear . This product gets used several times a day . We have two active dogs .
5 #### This thing has made my life SO MUCH easier . We have a ladradoodle who LOVES to run and this launcher makes the ball go so much further ! AND I do n't have to bend down to pick up the ball , or handle a ball that might be wet . Ca n't recommend this thing enough ! ! !
5 #### My husband discovered and purchased this launcher for me , and it 's fantastic ! Our Border Collie pup loves playing fetch , but he would get a running start . . . and run farther than I could throw the ball . Ha ! This launcher has made all the difference ( for me ) , and it also makes it easier on the throwing arm .
5 #### Great product . Can throw a tennis ball nearly 250 feet I believe .
1 #### This launcher did n't work as well as the 25 m launcher . Probably handler area but the 25 m launcher worked much better for me .
4 #### It 's a bit flimsy compared to the older model but works . I 'm gon na buy the 12 " one , it 's just to long for me .
5 #### It was a lot bigger than I thought , which makes me super happy
5 #### This is a must have for every labrador owner ! It makes hours of fetch effortless for the thrower !
5 #### These are so fun with your pup ! The prices is right !
5 #### This + Chuckit ! Whistler balls = endless fun for the puppers . She 's always unimpressed with my whimpy human - like ability to throw tennis balls , but she is satisfied by the Chuckit 's ability to launch them into outer space for her to retrieve -- and I , of course , am satisfied by how exhausted she becomes after bounding into outer space after these balls .
5 #### My dogs love to plat fetch , but they also drool a ton . This allows me to play without my hands being covered in slobber . Such a great price ! We ordered 3 and donated 2 to our Local shelter .
5 #### Not sure they could mess up this product . Works great , durable and does it 's job .
5 #### Love the chuckit . We lost one at the park and I bought the longer version this time around . I use it with regular tennis balls and appreciate that I do n't have to touch the slimy ball to throw it again .
5 #### I love being able to throw a tennis ball longer distances with this launcher ! My dog absolutely loves it !
4 #### Not as long as I anticipated , but as described . Takes practice but will throw long distance .
5 #### I love it and my dog loves it too . I bought it for $ 4 . I think that is pretty good for a ball and a plastic stick . For some reason my dog likes fetching the ball when I use the chuck it ... I 'm guessing she thinks I will throw the stick and she gets extra exited .
5 #### Thank you for saving my arm Chuckit ! Works like a charm ! Both dogs ( Labs ) absolutely love it ! As soon as I pick it up , they are on the hunt for their tennis ball !
5 #### My dogs favorite toy . I just wish she did n't want to chew the plastic !
4 #### Wonderful invention ! This is my fourth , but only because the narrow neck does n't hold up to the dog grabbing it with enthusiasm .
5 #### It has taken me years to be able to throw a chuckit , I am a dog trainer and throw a lot of balls . I used the small pro 18 for my yard . There are several weights of this toy , I can only handle the basic , lightweight model , I am not strong enough in the forearm and hand to handle the bigger version of this ( ultra grip ) . I bought this to replace the heavy ( utlra grip ) one I keep on my bike . ( dogs and I bike then throw ball ) if you have small hands , buy the light weight one , i ca n't get a comfortable throw on the ultra grip price was fantastic , 4 $ not 15 like petco .
1 #### I purchased the 14S launcher , the one used with the small balls . It is worthless . It holds onto the ball so tightly that the ball can not be thrown . Even the ball that came with the launcher can not be launched .
5 #### my arm loves it and so do my dogs !
5 #### It 's great because you can throw any tennis ball a pretty good distant . My dog , who can run for hours , loves chasing after the balls .
5 #### This is a must have for any dog owner with dogs who love to fetch . This is always my # 1 toy recommendation for new dog owners . It is the best $ 5 investment you can make for your dog- it is my Golden Retrievers ' favorite toy . Since it is n't a chew toy , the launcher will last forever , unless you lose it :) . All standard tennis balls ( 2.5 inch ) fit in the launcher , so you can replace the ball with any tennis ball or other chuckit ! ball . Personally , we love putting the chuckit ! whistler in the launcher . The sport launcher is the perfect size- it is small enough to toss in a bag and light enough that your arm does n't get tired after throwing for extended periods of time . I have tried larger sizes and found them to be too heavy and they do n't throw much further than the sport . Personally , I have 4 of these- I keep them in a dog bag we take to the park , one outside , one in the car and one in our kitchen . Since they are cheap , its easy to stock up ! Also , it makes a great gift to new dog owners . On a side note , one of my neighbors bought an off brand launcher from Amazon . It did not work nearly as well- it did not grip the ball well or launch nearly as far . Make sure to get the chuckit ! brand- there is a reason for all the positive reviews .
3 #### Puppy now a year old not interested ... also did n't want fuzzy balls or balks easy to chew and tear . She is a Papillion ... do worry about her safety with the balls .
5 #### Love the chuck it , especially since I do n't have to touch the slobbery ball and can easily keep my pupper running . Highly recommend this product which was recommended to me by a friend who has 3 GSD 's .
5 #### A classic that 's always appreciated by both the pooch ( he gets to run a heck of a lot further than I could possibly throw ) , and me ( slimy , slobbery ball : yuck ! ) . Always great , highly recommend .
5 #### I love this launcher ( 14S ) because it is the perfect size to throw the smaller balls for my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel . She loves it because it can throw farther than I can with my arm , so it is more challenging for her , and she gets more exercise . Best reason to have this launcher is definitely so I do n't have to touch the dirty and slimy ball she brings back ! LOL !

3 #### I 've had several chuck it sticks in the past , partly because my dog loves to chew them . When this one arrived , it was bent very far back . I know this item is supposed to be curved , but this one is either poor quality control , or the handling was messed up . It had plenty of room in the box it was shipped in , so I feel like it had to have been messed up to begin with .
5 #### We love the Chuckit ! We purchased the Medium sized one to use with our puppy in the field . We like the medium one because we can use most normal sized balls with it which is fantastic . Our puppy is always loosing or trading balls with other dogs so it is very useful to be inter changeable ! I would definitely recommend this !
5 #### Excellent tool / toy for keeping that puppy running after balls ... Typical throw is 100 feet but if one perfects it you can throw farther and high too ... give em pause before it bounces . I do recommend more than one ball , pick up is very easy ...
5 #### Love it . I 'm not a baseball player so this is awesome ! Main plus to me is that I do n't have to touch the dirty balls and it can be used with any regular sized tennis ball .
5 #### I thought these were a stupid idea . I thought " just pick the ball up and throw it . " But then we had a guest dog come stay here and he had one of these . So I learned that it is a great tool to keep the slobber off your hands . Love it !
5 #### Zoey loves it , & I also like it as in my later age the dog can run a lot faster than I can . This is my 3rd one only due to the 4Yr . & 6Yr old grandchildren using them to chop grass & rocks .
5 #### Easy to use and throws far easily ! It also lasts a long time and can be used with any chuckit ! Balls tennis balls !
5 #### Works well , but compared to my smaller one , this one throws much higher in the air compared to farther .
5 #### Perfect for those of us with an awful arm that get the disappointed look from our dogs when we do n't throw the ball far enough .
5 #### These are such a great invention - makes giving my dog a workout much easier !
5 #### I 've got bad joints , hurts to throw , but this allows me to give my dog the ball chasing he loves and for me to not hurt .
5 #### All of our neighbors with large dogs have this product , I finally caved and I 'm glad I did ! I have a 6 month old Golden Retriever and I was able to run him quickly since I was able to throw so much further . We will be buying again . Great price too , same product at my local Walmart is $ 11 . The tennis ball it comes with has a great bounce , I do n't plan on letting my dog keep the ball when we are n't using the launcher , I 'm sure he would shred it quickly !
5 #### saves my arm ..... I love playing with our Shepard pup , but I not having sore shoulders . this is AWESOME great control .
5 #### My pup loves to retrieve . I ca n't throw the ball as far as I would like and this chucker gives my dog and often his buddies a good workout . It is important to note that this chucker is for larger balls , not the regular tennis ball size balls . Now I have to find a way to use it in the snow and be able to find the ball !
5 #### Still trying to teach our dog how to fetch but this works great !
5 #### my dog loves this he played more with the stick in chewing it then the ball
5 #### Boy howdy can you launch a ball with this thing ! ! ! We have a six month old black lab puppy and he absolutely loves chasing tennis balls ! Thankfully he brings it right back to us so we do n't have to chase him down in order to throw another one . Getting my dog his daily exercise has never been easier ! I did buy a bag of regular tennis balls because inevitably summer going to get lost or chewed up . It is so nice that the regular size tennis balls work with this and they do n't require their own special size ball . I would absolutely recommend this to anyone with a high energy dog that loves to chase balls . Make sure your dog likes to chase balls though , because long ago , when our last dog was a puppy , we bought one of these not realizing that she was not a fan of balls but instead we found out she was a stick dog . So we ended up giving that one to my brother , and that ended up being his dogs favorite toy . Such a simple toy that produces endless fun for both dog and owner ! I hope my review is somewhat helpful for you !
5 #### wow , so this really works . I am able to throw this ball really really far and my dog loves running after it . The stick prevents me from bending down or touching the ball with my dogs saliva . I wish i would 've know they had something like this long time ago . Now , every morning i throw this ball for 20 minutes outside with my dog . This is worth your money . Any dog owner that require a lot of exercise should buy this . A great investment .
4 #### Almost a home run . They lazily put a glorified tennis ball in the package . My dog destroyed that on 2 outtings .
4 #### My dog absolutely LOVES this invention . Hell , who am I kidding , I love this invention ! The only reason I gave this 4 stars , is because my dog destroyed the Chuck - It ball within the first week - or - so of having it . Bright side was~ the KONG brand indestructible balls fit the Large Chuck - Its , so now I use the two together ! ! It 's perfect !
5 #### This is the cutest n most fun dog tog ever
4 #### Very cool but kind of needs to be stiffer for bigger , stronger folk as it flexes too much on the throw . It floats , even the glow balls they say do n't float , float .. yay .
1 #### Poor Quality Ball , it split in half at the seam in less than 2 hrs . use . Had it as a back up toy and did not use it right away . When finally used it failed right off , but was out or warranty . Bad purchase .
5 #### My dog , Zoey , fully approves and appreciates this launcher . I can throw the ball even farther for her now and that is a winner in her book .
5 #### I wish i could give this thing 6 or 7 or 8 stars ! The chuckits are absolutely life saving . I have three border collies , THREE incredibly energetic and destructive little devils . They will destroy anything within sight unless i wear them out . Playing / walking with them for 3 hours a day is n't an option and I own an auto repair shop with 10 acres of land so having my customers play with the dogs with the chuckit has been a life changing thing . They play with the dogs and have a good time at our shop , our dogs get their exercise and when we go home they lay down and calm down for the night . its perfect ! This saves your shoulders from tossing that ball for hours , its easy to clean . keeps your hands off those icky slobber balls and it took over a year of my little puppy chewing on it to destroy the first one . the second one i 've had for 2 years now ( we keep it out of the dogs reach when not in use ) and it looks almost brand new . I would HIGHLY recommend this product .
4 #### not as nice as the one with the grip on it , but I certainly love not having to pick up a slobbery ball covered in dirt . Also , can throw further and straighter than with my not - so - coordinated hands alone . Pupper loves it .
2 #### I bought this chuckit after reading the description presuming the medium ultra balls would fit but they did not . The launcher is a bit more flimsy than the current chuckit we use to play fetch .
5 #### If you 're dog loves to fetch and you have room to toss a ball really far , then this is the product to save your arm / shoulder . You can really tire your high - energy dog with this while beign easy on your joints and muscles .
5 #### Works well , but keep in mind that it 's huge . You may want to get the next size down .
2 #### This product appears to be a knock - off . It is lesser quality than the Chuck - it products we have bought from Petco , and the branding on it looks noticeably different , and it is made in China . It does not hold Chuck - It balls as well as a regular Chuck - it . After a few days my husband gave up on this , went to Petco , and bought a real Chuck - it . We did n't return this since we had already used it . It 's now an emergency back - up in case the real one breaks . It basically just gathers dust . Better than nothing but if you 're going to spend money on a product like this , buy the real thing .
5 #### My dog is super active and loves chasing the ball . This makes it much easier to throw the ball farther without wearing out before my dog does . Well made , nice plastic , decent ball . We love it !
4 #### " It 's all in the wrist " once you get it down the launcher is so easy to use . My 9 lb terrier is obsessed with catch and he approves . I took one star off because it can be a little tricky to use at first
5 #### Throw easily twice as far , is better by far than I expected .
5 #### works ! when you get older you find you ca n't throw like you used to , this works great .
5 #### This is amazing . Works amazing . I highly recommend it ! Must need !
5 #### This works perfectly for helping me play with the dogs because I absolutely hate picking up drooly balls ! ! ! Just be careful you do n't fling it too far or else the ball can get away from you - I 've lost a couple balls over the fence already !
5 #### My german shepherd dog would do ANYTHING for me to break out the Chuckit ! and take him to the park . He 's highly energetic and needs regular exercise ... but my arm would wear out before he would . Then I discovered this beauty and now we have a happy puppy AND a happy owner !
5 #### Very handy and great to throw the ball far without much force
5 #### Took our Pup out twice this past weekend to the park . I can throw the balls a long way which he loves . I like that I do n't have to bend over to get the balls , I can just snatch it up . Tennis balls work with it just as well . Would recommend highly for someone wanting to play ball with their dogs .
5 #### Absolutely love this thing ! Now I can play Fetch with my dogs without getting my hand slimy !
5 #### This is great for my dog , even my 6 year old granddaughter could use it to throw the ball very far .
1 #### Was hopeful I could use this , but my disability makes it impossible .. didn't realize you need a lot of might to use it .
5 #### Fabulous device ! I love that I can throw the ball so far with this . The dogs love to chase the balls , plus you can use it to pick up the balls . Love it !
5 #### Works great like it was suppose to . Much cheaper than buying at a store . Thank you
5 #### This is amazing ! I can throw a Chuckit ! or tennis ball further and higher than I can naturally . This product is highly recommended . You will be amazed at how far and high you can get the ball to go before it hits the ground . My arm never gets tired .
5 #### works well . makes the balls go far . my dog loves balls .
5 #### Excellent quality , same as our previous one that we somehow lost . Dog loves playing catch . We 've had no problems with this at all . Even our kids love throwing the ball with this !
5 #### My jack russel loves to play ball and this item saves my arm from getting so tired .
5 #### This is my dog 's favorite toy , by far . She likes food , but gets even more excited when I pull out this toy . The handle is very comfortable and easy to use , and makes it easy to pick up the dirty , slimy ball without getting my hands dirty . It works with standard tennis balls as well . The squeaking ball is an added bonus ( and non - abrasive to teeth and gums ) , and has kept it 's ability to squeak longer than expected . This is a well - designed product , that is a pleasure to use , both for the human and canine . Much love !
5 #### My Siberian husky loves this and so does my shoulder
5 #### An absolute life saver for tiring out our dog . Launches balls 2x what I could throw on my own . The ChuckIt balls are great , too ! Bounce further and do n't get ripped apart like a tennis ball by our German Shepherd .
5 #### My aussie - mix adores this - she 's a veracious ball player , and I have a terrible arm . This allows me to satiate her ball - playing needs and give her the exercise she deserves !
4 #### I like the short ball launcher . Just wish it came with a rubber ball instead of the tennis type ball . The chuckit Tennis balls do not last long . I love Chuckit rubber balls for my girls . They get lost before they break .
5 #### This thing is great . Even with my shoulder problems I can now throw far enough to make to " playing " worthwhile . The fuzzy tennis ball did n't last 5 minutes but I also bought the rubber glow ball that fits the Chuckit . The glow ball has outlasted every single other toy .... and my doberman goes through toys like kibble . literally . The glow ball works awesome , hold it under a light for a minute and you can see it fly through the air in the dark for about half an hour . Chuckit plus Glow Ball - I can throw it and it 's lasts !
5 #### I enjoy throwing the ball around in the backyard for my dog , but I 'm not a professional baseball player . To catapult tennis balls 70 + yards is amazing , and gets my mutt tired out quick . Also a great tool for retrieving lost laundry from behind your washing machine . I think they should advertise that .
3 #### I m no weakling but i find it kind of difficult to launch the ball w this big monster . Plus it requires the Large sized ball which i did n't realize . I prefer the mediun launcher . Its easier and i can get it to go just as far and works w regular tennis balls
5 #### dogs get excercise , but it wears me out to . lol
5 #### My dog loves this ... I can actually throw the ball far enough to give her exercise !
5 #### This will save your arm ! My 8 month golden goes crazy when she sees it . A must for every active dog !
5 #### I overthrew this the first few times because it 's so easy to launch the ball a long distance . I like this for launching the ball uphill to give my dog a workout during fetch without dislocating my arm by manual throwing . I have n't tried using this with a regular tennis ball as I do n't like the dye used in those , so I do n't know if they do or do n't fit . I like that I can get the ball into the launcher using the Chuckit without having to touch the slobbery mess . Good toy !
5 #### One of the must haves if your dog likes to play fetch . I have the 18 and the 25 M , I thought the 18 was a little too short so I got the 25 . After comparing both , I would recommend sticking with the 18 . I can throw the ball just as far as the 25 , and the 25 seems a bit awkward to throw than the 18 . 18 FTW !
5 #### Love the Chuckit . A real arm saver if you 're in an wide open area . You can probably use it for smaller areas if you choke up on the chuckit . Love it .
5 #### Classic toy all dog owner must have . Great price also .
4 #### My puppy loves the chuckit ! A few months ago we were at a dog park and another owner had a ChuckIt with the glow in the dark ball in the launcher . After observing the other dogs he quickly caught on . Our puppy has a hard time giving the ball up in the past . But when he sees a Chuckit , something comes over him and he brings it back and drops the ball right in front of us ! The Chuckit comes with a tennis ball already inside , which I find more bouncy than a regular tennis ball . If your dog loves fetch get this !
5 #### Our Corgi loves this ball thrower and so do we , now that we do n't have to touch wet , slobbery tennis balls .
5 #### Perfect for daily use . It is easy to use even for weak throwers .
5 #### This is the greatest thing that 's happened to my mom who loves our dog but hates the slobber ! It 's easy to pick up and chuck without having to touch the ball . And it 's fun shape makes it interesting for our dog . She gets really excited every time we 've brought it out so far . We found this product because we met a stranger at the dog beach using it and told us about getting it here . Buying it here saved us a couple of cents than buying it at the store ( walmart , target , etc ) . We got a medium sized one for our 16 pound Dachshund mix and its the perfect size . It would be too big for a Chihuahua and too small for a adult lab . ( I 've attached an image to compare sizes to my 13 " Macbook Pro of which I 'm currently writing my review from haha )
5 #### I 'm a girl , and I throw like a girl . this takes up less room than a tennis racket and I do n't have to touch the slobbery ball . My older Lab really likes to take the ball into the flower bed , toss it , drop it and roll it around . The result is a ball that 's not just covered in slobber , but also dirt and mulch . I do n't have to touch it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Puppies enjoy chewing on it as much as any other stick
5 #### Best toy invention for humans ! My hands no longer are full of slime & dirt . LOL
5 #### My dog loves this because she gets to run more than if I throw the ball , plus there is less stress on my shoulder using this . Win , win :)
5 #### So much fun and the short handle helps with better control .
5 #### Works great for those of us without the ability to throw the ball far . It 's all in the wrist .
5 #### Chuck Its are great at getting my puppy to run faster to chase a far - thrown ball . Perfect for helping her e pens that puppy energy !
5 #### It 's wonderful . I have rheumatoid arthritis and so playing with Bella can be a challenge . This is so great because with little effort I can throw far , or some times high , lol . She actually gets tired out when playing it .
5 #### Came in bright orange which is just fine with me . Came with one ball , similar to a tennis ball . I have n't taken it out to a big field yet , but I can tell it 'll really chuck the ball . About four bucks cheaper than I saw at the store .
4 #### I love the Chuckit ! but if you have a dog that 's tough on toys , I recommend buying the extra Chuckit ! balls . They 're mad of orange rubber , and about $ 10 for two , but definitely worth it . My dog destroyed the ball that came with the Chuckit ! after 2 - 3 throws , just by chewing on the ball a bit between throws . Otherwise , great dog toy !
5 #### Great product . I recently lost my other one ( that had a gripping handle ) and ca n't go hiking without it , or my dog pouts . I would buy this one again over the gripping handle one , not worth the upgraded price .
5 #### Love it ! I love everything about it but I 'm going to focus on just the fact that this product would be great for the elderly , those w certain disabilities , what have you , because one needs to use very , very little strength and the ball will travel AT LEAST 50 feet ( so yes , on the flip side , if you use a LOT of strength , the ball will travel very far distances ) ; also , you need n't bend all the way over to pick up the ball- in fact , if you 're on the short side , like me , you hardly need to bend over at all ! lol- so it 's easier on the back or for those who are less flexible as well . In fact , you can even remain seated majority of the time while playing with this , especially if you 've trained your dog to bring the ball right back to you . As I said , I just wanted to focus on that angle , but overall , this is a great product for anyone who loves playing fetch with their dog ! And any dog who loves fetching will adore this product ! My dog even kisses it when I take it out ! Also , any tennis - sized ball can be used with the throwing - device ( for lack of a name for it haha)- not just the ball that comes with it . So if it gets lost or too old , you do n't have to especially order those ... any tennis ball , or ball of equal size / shape , will work just as well ! Enjoy !
5 #### I bought this launcher with the chuckit rubber tennis balls and my dog is one happy puppy . This launcher can easily throw the distance of our backyard ( roughly 150 ft ) so I have to be careful not to over throw the fence . I 'd love to test this out when we have even more space to see how far it really can go . Regardless my dog is getting in so much more running now that we are able to throw the tennis ball 2 - 3x further than we were before . More running means a tired puppy . And we all know that a tired puppy is a good puppy :) My dog actually stopped playing fetch and took a rest - that has NEVER happened before ! My husband questioned our need for this . When he was able to relax an read a book without the puppy climbing all over him he was sold on our need for this chuck it . I also highly recommend the rubber balls .
5 #### This makes it easy to pick up the ball since it gently snaps into the launcher and keeps my hands from constantly touching dog saliva , An added bonus is that the ball goes farther when I throw it .(I'm nor very good thrower ) . It comes with a tennis ball but I like the medium sized chuck- it balls better .
1 #### The particular launcher I received did not hold the tennis balls very well . I have had a few of since my dog tends to chew them up when she can .... and this is the only chuckit brand thrower I had issues with .
5 #### puppy loves anything related to a ball . sure saves my arm
4 #### This is great ! No more slobber balls and I can throw the ball far and fast !
5 #### Great price and works great ! Perfect for throwing tennis balls .. my dog is very happy .
5 #### Love this ! My dog chewed the smaller one up but the larger blue Chuckit survived . I injured my shoulder years ago playing softball so this really helps with throwing at the dog park ; bonus that I can throw a long distance which tires out my over - active dog ! The balls are expensive so I opt for used tennis balls from the local school .
5 #### Pup loves it Could throw all day with this gadget
5 #### Our dog lives for the ball . It 's strong , durable and takes the strain off your arm . If your dog chews tennis balls , consider buying the rubber balls that fit this launcher .
5 #### I love it ! ! ! It was small but great for my puppy
5 #### really lets you whip the ball . I can wear out my dog twice as fast now !
5 #### this is the best dog toy we have had this is our 3rd one ! If you have a dog you need to wear out you need one of these in your arsenal !
5 #### I have a 10 month old pit bull . He weighs 65lbs . Everything we give him he destroys in seconds . This is the only thing he has n't been able to destroy . There are amazing
5 #### works nicely and does n't launch the ball to far for my small backyard .
5 #### I love that I can play ball without picking up the slobber covered ball . It also allows me to throw the ball a lot further than I normally can .
5 #### I suffered from frozen shoulder and my dogs were getting super annoyed at how weak my throwing abilities had become . I swear I even saw them roll their eyes at me when the tennis ball landed five feet from me . The Chuckit Launcher solves that problem , because with minimal effort , you can get a tennis ball to sail across a field . It 's also great in that you never actually have to touch a slobberly ball , but can pick it up and throw it without ever having to touch it . My girls get super excited whenever they see me pick this up , as they know they 're in for some great exercise ! Standard tennis balls , Kong balls and Chuck It balls all easily fit within the launcher .
5 #### Great ball toss aid for the paw park if you have a dog who likes to chase balls . It works with a regular tennis ball as well as the medium sized specialty balls that Chuckit makes .
5 #### My dog loves this Chuckit ! She is a very high energy dog who loves to run and LOVES chasing tennis balls . This thing is great because we can really launch the ball to great distances and our dog gets way more exercise and fun out of our play time . This works with both the Chuckit branded " medium " ball and regulation sized tennis balls . I 've seen some other similar toys ( not sure if they 're also this brand ) that have a shorter more flimsy looking arm , this one is great because the length allows for great leverage and it 's a very solid piece of plastic .
5 #### Great price ! My dog really gets a workout when I use the launcher
5 #### Wanted a small chuck it for our Ball Manic Lab . This does the trick . We take this on our hikes and keeps our Puppy in top shape chasing the ball and no yuck pickup . Fits perfect in my basic back pack as well .
5 #### Chuckit makes a great product . I bought the short launcher as I just planned on using it in my yard for my GSD . This is perfect ! My yard is approx . 120 ' long and I can make it from one end to the other without having to " chuckit " too hard . If you are going to use it in a field or dog park and want distance , get the longer launcher .
5 #### took a few throws to get the release point right . but when I did this thing flies ! very handy for a pocket or backpack .
5 #### So glad we finally got this ! We have seen folks a the dog park with them and just never got around to ordering ... I love this ! It sure saves the old arm with throwing the ball and it goes much farther===happy pup and happy shoulder !
5 #### Hi , my name is Ginger . I 'm a six year old Golden / Border Collie mix , and I am so happy my owner bought this for our times at the park . I get great exercise chasing the ball .
4 #### The launcher stick is awesome , but you might want to replace the tennis ball it comes with to one of their rubber balls . My dog bit the tennis ball in half the first day we had it . The rubber ones are much more durable .
5 #### Great for those who do n't have a strong pitching arm . As advertised , it about triples the distance the ball travels without any extra effort or wear on your arm . The tennis style ball that comes with it will be promptly popped by strong chewers . That said,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/ChuckIt - Medium - Ultra - Balls-2 - 5 - Inch-2 - Pack / dp / B000F4AVPA / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">ChuckIt ! Medium Ultra Balls 2.5 - Inch , 2 - Pack</a>&nbsp;fit perfectly and are much hardier . The combination ca n't be beat .
5 #### Great tool to save your arm from throwing the ball a thousand times to please your pup ! It can be used for short distance and long distance throws which is very convenient ! It also will pick up the ball from the ground so you do n't have to bend over and put the ball in the device everytime which also saves my back ! If you do n't care for the Chuckit ! brand balls , tennis balls also fit !
5 #### Item worked great ; however , my husband let the dog play with the ball and she destroyed it . Gon na go buy a few more balls and train my husband not to let the dog play with the new balls
5 #### One of the best fetch toys out there for the following reasons : - Exercises your dog without you running out of breath - Launches the ball far effortlessly - Allows pick up the slimy ball without touching - Launcher extends the arm so the dog sees better when the ball has actually been thrown - Orange ball is easily spotted from the surrounding by dogs and humans - A variety of other balls to buy for different personalities ( swimmers , squeakers , etc ) - Light weight - Good for windy conditions ( unlike a frisbee ) My 8 year old boxer who is an obsessive compulsive fetcher absolutely loves chasing after the Chuckit ball .
5 #### My dog is obsessed with playing fetch . This product makes throwing the ball around at the beach a breeze for us and my dog loves it .
5 #### This is a great product and I will be purchasing it again .
4 #### It is a great toy for playing fetch IF you only use it with the tennis type balls . I wanted it for the Chuckit Rubber Balls which both my dog and I prefer . They fit but stick in the launcher most of the time . I found it helps some to only partially put the rubber ball in the launcher but wish it could be redesigned to work with both ball types .
5 #### My medium size male yorkie absolutely loves it ! I never seen him so happy lol , just make sure u use it on big open spaces
4 #### I saw the trainers at the dog park with these and decided to get one . It 's a fun toy for my dog that likes to play fetch , but I do n't know how much different it really is than just throwing it . A nice feature is that you can pick up the ball without bending all the way down . And you can use a tennis ball which is good because the ball that came with it apparently is very tasty and is just about down to the bare rubber after a couple of days .
5 #### My little corgi cross dog had a similar one of these in Australia .... just not as good quality as this one and longer . when we moved to Greenville early this year we knew we needed one as she loves to play ball .... and I for one ca n't stand picking up a disgusting wet slobbering ball .... so it was a must we get a ball launcher . One of my criteria was longevity .... I wanted something that was going to last and this one so far has fit the bill nicely . It is small , compact enough to take on day trips and will fit into a large backpack nicely . It is large enough to pick up the wet balls from the ground without breaking your back . Another feature I was looking for was to be able to use any ball with this launcher .... and I am happy to report that you can . My dog does n't like tennis balls and chews through any light hallow ball . It was important that it fit our solid heavy semi - cricket ball .... and it does nicely . This same ball was purchased nearly a year ago ... that is how long it has lasted ... This launcher is fantastic , very long wearing and solid .. both my husband and I rave about it all the time and plan to buy another one before we head back to Australia next year .... we are raving fans .... can't recommend it enough ... just love it ... use it at least twice a day .
5 #### can now get some distance will hold a kong extreme large
5 #### I do n't know why I waited so long to purchase one of these ! I have a very active Lab and we walk and swim for about 1.5 hours a day . That is a lot of ball throwing ! i developed tennis elbow from all the ball tossing . I bought one of these and now it is little effort to throw the ball 3 times farther than it goes when you throw it . * * * * * If you find this review helpful please indicate on the review so I know all this detail helps people .
5 #### Great launcher ! No more slimy hands ! The launcher is great but the ball it comes with split within a few tosses . We bought the Chuckit Medium Ultra Balls to replace the ball it came with and they have survived a lot of tosses but do not have enough bounce for our high flier so we bought high bounce balls and even though they are smaller we can still scoop them up with the launcher and send them flying . The high bounce balls are the best ever for our high flying Australian Cattle/ Jack Russell mix breed and this launcher keeps our hands free of slobber and sends the ball a good distance so that we can wear his hyper self out ! ! ! Woot WOOT ! ! !
5 #### It throws a tennis ball better than my worn out arm does . It 's simple and effective to tire out my fetch happy dog .
5 #### First chunkit ! for my blue heeler . So far the rubber balls are holding up . Had to hide the tennis ball that came with it or it would have been destroyed . So far we have had a lot of fun playing with it .
5 #### Compact ball launcher for when you do n't want to carry the big one around . It is 12 inches so it sticks out of my fanny pack a bit , but does the job nicely .
4 #### Once I figured out the right way to use it it works really well . Would be great in a large field since it can go really far .
5 #### This is the most important dog toy for any retriever breed or retriever mixed breed . I use this toy to help supplement my dog 's daily walks and it really helps to keep him satiated and happy , especially during busy workweek days . For daily exercise to satisfy my dog 's running needs , Chuck it is the arm saver I 'd long wished for . By far the best toy I have ever bought my dog . He adores it . Best ten bucks spent on a dog toy ever .
4 #### After 1.5 years of use this is a 3rd replacement launch . The scoops no longer grip the ball well . One reviewer noted that this used to not be the case when they were originally manufactured . How sad that I am contributing to plastic waste ( perhaps they could make one out of recyclable material ) ? Other than that issue , the handle is fine and this is one of the greatest inventions of all time .
5 #### Be prepared to chuck it pretty far ! ! I " chuckit " right into my neighbors yard
5 #### It 's a ball thrower . It throws balls pretty far . It is my lab 's favorite toy . I love this length too and now own one for every car and an additional couple with the old handle that I 've picked up at garage sales . The new handle is much more comfortable . It fits regular tennis balls which we buy in bulk at Costco . Did I mention that my lab LOVES tennis balls . It fits perfectly in my day pack and allows me to throw balls comfortably almost as long as my lab is willing to fetch them . ( That last statement is probably not true , she will fetch forever . )
2 #### The launcher works well . But the ball is off bad quality . There are lots of stuff coming out from the ball easily . My dog keeps trying to bit these stuff off and eat them . I need to constantly clean the ball in order to prevent him from swallowing the materials , which is aweful .
5 #### Ball goes much further with less effort , no more slimy hands from constantly chucking slobbery balls .
5 #### Works great . Dog loves playing fetch . Not much else to say .
5 #### Exactly as described . Saves me from bending over all the time !
5 #### throws twice as far with the flick of the wrist !
5 #### Tennis balls fit well , handle gives my throw some distance .
5 #### Sends the ball flying ! Our three German Shepherd Dogs(GSD ) love it !
5 #### This dog toy is great . I able to chuck the ball pretty far for our dog who loves to run and play . She has endless energy and this toy is perfect .... Seems to be well made and yellow tennis ball fits perfectly .
5 #### Throw faster and longer without killing your arm ... love this ! ! ! I can finally wear my dog out before she wears me out lol . Works great , would recommend .
2 #### The plastic handle is hard to grip , and uncomfortable . I prefer the Pro 18 with rubber grip .
4 #### Great for taking on walks to the park , although I wish it was retractable . Does n't have the range of the larger size , but with practice you and get some distance . Anything is better than picking up a slimy ball !
4 #### Loved it until bf left it within dog 's reach and she chewed it up . It still works but not as good . But my crazy dog is not the products fault , so I would recommend !
5 #### Great product goes best with hollow balls , and is excellent with the Whistler !
5 #### Saved my shoulder and has made it so much easier to tire my pup out !
5 #### Easy to use & direct the flight of the ball . The numerical info . is confusing - one for size of ball , other for distance . We use this one for but best for one size larger than tennis balls - but tennis - sized can be scooped & launched too .
5 #### I love it . It is a must for each dog owner !
5 #### This is a great toy ! It sends balls flying effortlessly !
5 #### This is my 1 year old labs favorite he know when he sees this launcher it 's time to run & play . We have spent hours playing ball with this thing . As we all know a tired dog is a happy dog :-) ( and a very happy mama ;-)
5 #### Just as many others have already stated , this is a great invention . I have no problem throwing a ball but after bending over 100 plus times to pick them up , gets old . No more bending over HaHa And if you can throw a ball this will shock you how far you can throw a ball - - way out there :)
5 #### More than just getting in a good throw , this product is great so you do n't have to pick up really nasty , muddy balls at the dog park : ) It 's a great price and a great size
5 #### This product arrived very quickly . Our dog loves that our little one can throw the ball a bit further now and apparently it 's also the perfect size for cuties ( the little oranges ) as well .
5 #### Love this ! The longer one really works well for the heavier chuckit balls . PERFECT
5 #### Finally , something that helps me wear out my Belgian Malinois who is like the Energizer Bunny ! My favorite dog toy on the market .
1 #### This is not the one for standard size tennis ball . It uses an overly large ball that costs more to replace than the thrower itself . I thought I was getting one for standard size tennis ball . I am severely disappointed , as this thing is almost as useful to me as a breast on a boar hog .
5 #### Way use your arm ? ? ? This thing is awesome . Works great with the Flashing Glowing Dog Ball at night , and when they burn out , I just use them during the day .
5 #### Good price and what dog would not love play time with this launcher :)
5 #### It makes playing with my dog much easier as I have a bad shoulder and this operates with a mere flick of the wrist .
5 #### stronger plastic then my other 2 and works well and i do n't have to bend down .
5 #### Great product for a child to play ball with their dog ! And all of the chuck it rubber balls I purchased fit perfectly in the ball launcher . I would definitely recommend product .
5 #### Perfect size for throwing in your purse / bag and going to the park ! You will need to bend down further to pick up the ball with this Chuckit compared to the longer ones , of course , but for me it 's not a problem . Personally , I think the smaller ones are less likely to break because they are a little less bendy than the long ones . This size has the right amount of give so you can throw a ball a good distance , but not so much that you think it 's going to break easily if throwing too hard or if it gets bent in your car en route ! Another nice touch is that this Chuckit fits regular sized tennis balls , does not require a special size or brand .
5 #### I love the chuck it . This allows me to throw the ball so much further than I normally could . My lab loves running the longer distances to retrieve his ball . This chuck it holds the larger ball which is ideal for labs .
5 #### My doggie love this , the ball size is just right for a small dog .
5 #### Within five minutes I managed to launch the ball over my fence into oblivion . Works fantastic unfortunately I need to purchase more balls .
5 #### We have the large launcher and the junior size . Our lab loves to chase the balls non - stop and having the choice of launcher size is a must ! We lost so many balls over the fence before we bought the junior size . The large launcher is great for the dog park , the lake , and huge fields . The junior is great for the back yard or smaller parks .
5 #### Love this chuck it is great for larger dogs that could easily choke on a regular tennis ball . I also purchased the Ultra balls that do not have the fuzzy coating like the tennis balls . Ultra chuck it balls are slick on the outside and work great with this thrower . Just about any 3 " ball can be used as a replacement . I have to have 2 - 3 balls when playing with my German Shepherd .
5 #### These ball tossers are the best . They save wear and tear on my aging shoulder and make throwing the ball for a compulsive Doodle a breeze . I got one for each car !
5 #### I bought this for the dog at the Country Club where I worked so we could play in the morning before work . He 's a " goose chaser " dog . Yes , they spent 22k dollars on a dog to chase geese when my dog would have done it for free , but whatever . Should have rescued a dog . Little did I know that this would reignite Jock 's lovely little quirk where he likes to steal golf balls after people have hit them and then they wonder why they ca n't find him and there goes a 22k dollar border collie running far , far away from them and they never see their ball again . Sorry , not sorry . I bought a glow in the dark ball to go with this because it 's still dark in the AM and Jock can see it . But , we had to stop playing because he relapsed and started stealing a plethora of balls again . I do n't regret it .
5 #### My shoulder gets thrown out pretty easy , so this makes playing ball with my dogs much more fun for us both .
5 #### Our doggie absolutely LOVES this toy ! ! He 's a high - energy Boxer and this really helps him get the exercise he needs without totally exhausting ME , haha ! :)
5 #### This set is very good . Its very easy to throw it very far . Its easy to throw long distance . I love that I did n't get my hands dirty with slobber . The ball released easily . I almost threw it over the fence when I first threw it because it was so easy to throw . The ball is pretty bouncy but not too bouncy . The tennis ball is destroyed pretty easily by my dog who is a pitbull . I really like that the stick is interchangeable with other large balls . I like that the stick is longer which makes it easier to pick up and throw the ball without reaching or bending more . Disclosure I paid for this at full price .
5 #### Great price for what I would find at PetSmart for 3 times the cost . It has a very short handle , which you would think might lessen the length of the throw , but no , it throws long distances just fine . My 7 year old loves to play fetch with the dog now .
5 #### This one is better for the Kong 's , and they sail !
4 #### My dog loves these launchers ! I wish they came with more sturdy balls that wold withstand a dogs chew but I just buy my own balls and use the launcher with it . i have a small dog- 18 pounds and he easily broke through the ball within about 10 minutes- so just be sure you have backups !
4 #### Did n't realize it was a bigger than standard tennis ball , but the dog loves it .
3 #### dog destroyed ball in less than 3 minutes . he bit down on it to chew and it just popped in his mouth . :( there goes another one .
5 #### Great little launcher . Need to use wrist action . Small - fits anywhere .
5 #### CHUCKIT is an amazing dog toy . I can throw the balll so far with this thing , its great . my dog loves it . as soon as we bring the chuckit out from the closet he goes nuts because he knows he gets to run and chase his ball down
5 #### Our dog was never really interested in chasing balls until someone else at the dog park had one of these and she loved it ! We purchased this one and went to the park the next day . She is not the best at fetch , but she brings the ball back most of the time .
5 #### Our mini Labradoodle loves this and he did n't even know how to fetch when we first started using it .
5 #### This is the size that flings standard tennis balls . Bonnie Border Collie is so very happy when we pick up this toy to play with her ! You can also get a glow - in - the - dark ball that fits into the business end for night - time Fetch . I do n't have to handle slobbery balls and can give her a good runout . If your dogs loves Fetch , you need one of these !
5 #### This is THE tennis ball launcher . It shoots them far enough that our Australian Shepherd gets a good workout fairly quickly . I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who plays fetch with their dog .
5 #### My dog loves playing catch and I do not have a good arm . This helps out tremendously and wares my dog out fast .
5 #### I like this shorter Chuckit - works very well for me . The longer Chuckit stresses my shoulder more . If I did n't already have some problems with my shoulder , then the longer one would probably be fine .
5 #### We have one for each car , and a couple for the home ! This allows us to throw tennis size balls further than by hand . I like the Kong Ball Medium , which is tennis ball size . The Kong balls last much longer and also seem to have more " BOUNCE " to them , get greater distance . The best part is you can pick up and re - throw the ball without getting your hands covered with dog slobber and dirt using this toy .
5 #### great for the price until my dog ate it
5 #### Exactly what I wanted . Perfect for way less than in the stores .
2 #### Oops ... purchase the wrong size ball . My dogs old jaw does n't care for it . I would return it but ethics does n't allow me to return something I have used .
3 #### Really a big fan of how this product works and certainly my dogs being in phenomenal shape is testimony to this fact . However , as I prepare to buy a replacement Chuckit ! Classic 26 M after only 2 years I really wish the longevity was there . My Chuckit ! has peeling plastic all over ! Peeling off the scoop where the ball goes , peeling off the handle where I grip . Just yuck factor # 9 for sure . Am I buying a new one ? You betcha I am , it 's a great product and flings tennis balls 100ft+ , I just wish they lasted longer .
5 #### I avoided getting a ball launcher for my dog because I figured I needed the arm exercise . But , my dog was n't getting enough exercise from my throws ... she'd pass up the ball before it landed . The Chuckit allows me to give her more of a challenge since I can throw the ball 3 times as far with it ! So , my dog gets more exercise , which is the end goal ! :)
4 #### Works pretty well with the pup . Really can launch it with chuck it . If only my dog could fetch ; /
4 #### great price , but not as strong feeling as the ones in stores or the one I already had
5 #### My Labrador ( 8 months ) would rather play this than eat ! He loves food but Ivan say ball and he runs to get the chuck it ! We play 3 - 4 times a day and seeing the joy this simple launcher gives him is the best ! I tried several other launchers but none one close to this one ! We also love the boomerang ( ! , the paraflight works better than any disc ever!!)we have almost all the things chuck it makes so I can tell you the orange ultimate balls work best my lab prefers then regular size ( not the XL ( I have the XL launcher too but always use the reg 18 " pro launcher ! The difference in the " pro " is the handle has a nice grip that does n't slip in rainy weather etc ! I like the 26 too but the 18 " is my favorite ) Update - this add on was very cheap but pay attention!!- this is a small not a normal med ( the " s " means the smallest ball ) I had to give it away bc my dog is 90 lbs and it 's a choking hazard for him ( the above review is based on another launcher same length I have in medium was trying to get an extra as an add on
5 #### Best way to play ball with your dog . I have to keep this hidden or he wants to play all day . Long !
5 #### My mom ca n't throw very well so she never played with my dog while I 'm at work . Now she does it every day . Thanks so much
2 #### Bought it bc it was smaller and more compact / easier to carry around in the park , etc . However , is more difficult to throw / launch the ball from it than the regular sized chuckit . In the end , I barely use it and instead use the longer handled chuckit .
5 #### If your dog likes to fetch and you do n't have one of these yet .... GET ONE . Best invention ever . Not only can you throw a ball out of the dog park if you sling too hard ( it 's amazing ) but you do n't have to touch the slimy ball when they bring it back . As soon as they drop it , just pop it over the ball and huck away . I LOVE this thing .
5 #### My black lab loves this ! ! What I love most is a standard tennis ball can also fit ! Big hit at our house and no more throwing slobbery tennis balls
5 #### This smallest Chuckit is Amazing ! It works great for my 4 year old and 18 mo old grandsons . At first we would pull the ball out so it was barely gripped by this 12 " Little chuckit . Then as the boys got the hang of it they could loosen the grip on the ball themselves and finally -- all in the same day and same few hours -- they were chucking the balls for my Aussie full speed and laughing and giggling like crazy . The other awesome feature of this tiny but great working mini Chuck - it is that it truly will fit in my purse or backpack so much easier than the medium or long range chuck its I have for home and dog park use . Yippee . Best of all , no grabbing that slobbery ball . Plus my dog has learned that when I tap the chuckit on the ground or floor that means drop it where I tap , which he loves because he knows it means more throws . When we go home I will take both of these with me so my roommate and I can throw at the same time for both our dogs in the house ! They love chasing balls and even when the balls start bouncing around like pinballs !
1 #### The ball did n't last five minutes however we still have the stick .
5 #### Bought the 26 M for our german shepherd , and we love it . Allows us to throw a tennis ball 2 - 3 times further , with less effort . You can also pick up the ball using the toy , so less bending over if that is important to you . In some cases could make it easier to get the ball away from your dog maybe .
2 #### works good be he wants me to throw the launcher
5 #### Perfect size for taking on a hike . Works great !
5 #### This chuckit is a great tool especially for those challenged with throwing . It helps me throw the ball farther & more accurately than I could ever do on my on . & all that with very little stress on my arm or shoulder . The length of the launcher also makes it perfect to pick up the ball without bending over after my little buddy ( pit bull ) comes back with the ball & drops it . It allows him to really get a work out fetching long fly balls . He loves it ! ! !
5 #### replacement for old ones that gave up the ghost . our dog loves going long to get the ball !
5 #### I 've always liked Chuck it products . This was a little smaller than I like but the plastic is strong and the ball it comes with is n't cheaply made .
4 #### Great toy ... don't get large one unless u have a big dog .
5 #### We used one with our neighbors dog and loved it . Ca n't wait till our puppy is big enough to take out and use .
5 #### It works great to help my daughter straighten out her softball swing ... Who would have thought ?
5 #### Love it . Do n't have to touch slobbery ball when my dog brings it back .
5 #### I have two dogs . One could n't care less about fetch , but the other seriously ca nt get enough . I bought this because my girlfriend ca nt stand touching dog slobber , but this thing has definitely saved my shoulder from falling off in the long run . Takes some getting used to , but it actually made fetch fun again and gives my dog 3x the workout with only 1/3rd the effort on my part .
3 #### 12 " is too short for a decent throw . Go with an 18 " ( 18 M ) one .
5 #### or border collie loves it , he never tires of me throw the ball , but i do tire , lol
4 #### My dog loves this and so do I. It is easy to throw the ball further and if your dog slobbers like mine , it keeps your hands clean ! The only reason I gave it four starts is my dog busted the ball in the first week . It still throws good . Just does n't have the bounce .
3 #### like that it throws easier but the handle is too short . Better for a child .
5 #### Best dog product I 've purchased for my golden retriever who loves to fetch .
5 #### Great toy for energetic puppy ! ( And I LOVE that I do n't have to chuck the slobbered ball by hand ! )
5 #### great product . we live on property and this has made playing catch with our labs so much more fun !
5 #### This is a great product , and I was excited to get it at a sale price on Amazon ! They sell for $ 12 - 20 at pet stores , but I got mine for $ 5 on an Amazon sale . My dog loves the toy , and I like that I can throw the ball farther , and that my hands do n't get wet or slobbery from touching the ball .
5 #### So much easier to play fetch with my lab with this ! Instead of having touch the wet and dirty ball just snap it in and throw again . I can also get the ball to go farther with this vs just hand tossing it .
5 #### I just have to get the nack to flick my wrist correctly to get the ball to go pretty far . Certainly easier to toss the ball further and our puppy needs the running . Now if I could just get directions on how to get your dog to give you back the ball ! ! ! !
4 #### Next time I think I 'm going to get the longer one ( 25 m ) . This 18 M is the perfect size to use from my wheelchair without having to bend over very much . But , if I 'm having a good day and am standing , I will need the longer one to reach the ground without bending over as much .
3 #### This is somewhat hard to aim . But still gets the job done
5 #### As expected but for me it 's too short to get the ball very far . Could be operator error .
5 #### Definitely recommend if you have a high energy dog . My shoulder no longer aches after several throws . Plus the launcher tosses the ball further and faster than me .
5 #### A couple of years ago , I adopted a bullmastiff puppy from a local shelter , expecting her adorable - but - exhausting boisterousness to mellow out into relative couch potato - dom once she grew up . Instead , she turned out to be a mastiff - boxer mix who has , if anything , grown more energetic and will probably always be bouncing around at warp speed , breaking my stuff with her zest for life . I take her to the baseball diamond at the local park to run off some steam . But despite this daily practice , I still had n't turned into Josh Reddick and was regularly embarrassing myself in front of the dog , who got pretty bored fetching a ball that had flown thirty feet before sputtering into the dirt . Enter the Chuckit . She now shoots gleefully around the diamond and the outfield , jowls and spit flying everywhere , chasing this bright orange miracle until she gets so tired she refuses to bring it back . And then she goes home and she sleeps . All . Day . It 's beautiful .
5 #### My dog loves it . Have to get a new one after he wore out his old one . He can play with this all day .
5 #### This toy is a life saver for your arm and shoulder ! My dog absolutely loves it and begins jumping up and down as soon as someone touches it ! I would highly recommend this for any dog owner !
5 #### It 's from Chuck It , what else can I say ? ! I recommended getting the rubber balls to go with it though because the last longer and bounce further . This keep our 2 year old rottie busy and tired out .
3 #### Did n't realize that the handle is too short . Still have to bend down when I use it .
5 #### Easy to use and collect the ball from the ground . This will also help you throw a ball much farther than you could normally . Great product .
2 #### I must need lessons on throwing this because it just hits the ground . I should have ordered smaller ball for my 18 lb dog
3 #### It 's a Chickit ! Works good , just wished I had seen the ( Colors Vary ) text before I purchased and gone to the store and picked out a color I like .
5 #### Makes playing outside with my dog so much more enjoyable ! Great product !
5 #### Absolutely love it ! My dog goes insane for this ! I love that I do n't have to bend over , or touch , a slobbery ball ! Can " chuck " the heck out of a ball !
5 #### I love these . Dogs love it . You do n't have to pick up ball with your hand and I can throw far .
5 #### My dog and arm loves this . I get great distance and decent accuracy .
5 #### My dogs love this . Really throws the tennis balls FAR . Great fun and exercise ! !
5 #### nice and short so you will have to bend over to get the ball .
4 #### The ball that comes with it sucks , but the thrower is the best .
5 #### My dog loves it and I do n't throw my shoulder out every time I take him to the park to play fetch ! Money well spent .
5 #### If you got a dog that is high energy , loves to fetch , or likes to run after things that are thrown , then look no further . You can hurl balls a really good distance without even trying . My GSD juvenile was burnt out at the end of the day . I hurl it down the street for now to help to keep his toenails from becoming eagle talons , and the ball goes really far even after the balls flight .
5 #### Until you have one , you wo n't know much you needed it . When I first saw people using them at the dog park , I thought they were ridiculous . But now ? I do n't leave home without it . No more slobbery , disgusting balls , and I can throw them much farther . Simple as that .
5 #### My dog likes , nice in compact so I can put it in a small bag and carry it
5 #### Saw a guy at the dog park using one of these at the dog park and had to have one . It 's works great and keeps from getting slobber all over my hands . Also I can throw the ball for hours and not get a sore shoulder .
5 #### Our Labs will chase the ball for hours . This saves the arm AND throws the ball further giving them more of a workout . Love it highly recommend
5 #### Both the pup and I love it ; Makes my life easier considering the amount of energy he requires to tire . IN addition to adding distance to the throw , also easier t pick up the drool covered ball from the ground without bending over or touching it Works great with standard tennis balls as well as the special chuck - it orange balls
2 #### This is probably my fourth chuck it , maybe my third , in the past 8 years I 've had my dog . Between loosing them , or the dog chewing on them as a puppy , I replace mine ever few years or so . This was the first time I bought one from Amazon , and there 's something different about this one . I 've stuck with this exact " Chuckit ! " brand the entire 8 years , but this is the first time I 've had a hard time getting the ball to launch out properly . I 'm not sure if this is made at a different facility , or what . But ... it 's hard to say no to Amazon 's low , competitive prices .
5 #### Love the chuckit . I can throw the ball so far with this product also , the medium size is perfect for my boarder collie .
5 #### What to toss a tennis ball a zillion miles ? This does the trick . And with a little bit of practice you can use it to pick up the ball and be slobber free . Nicely made . Just be careful you do n't toss it tooo far ;)
5 #### If you have a ball - chasing dog , you have to get one of these .
5 #### You need this - not only because it means you do n't have to get your hands dirty from picking up dirty balls over and over again - but , well actually , that 's really the sole reason why you should get it .
5 #### Great , easy to use and easy to store . Ball did n't last long though .
4 #### good product , my arm does nt get tired and the dogs get to run further ....
5 #### Using this to throw with your dog helps everyone out --- the dog gets more exercise , you do n't have to handle a nasty , spit - covered ball , and you 're not throwing out your shoulder and screaming cuss words if your dog requires a substantial amount of throwing time . I actually much prefer using regular tennis balls as opposed to the one that comes with this item ; furthermore , that very same ball does n't float well in water ( it sank quickly in the river and had n't even begun to endure the toll a typical tennis ball gets from my dog ) . At first , the launcher might grip the ball a little too tightly and cause your throws to require a little more " zest " to get it to leave the little ball - holding part of the item ... but once you 've given it hell a few times and let the plastic fold out a little , you 'll be good to go and your dog will love you and sing dog songs in your honor ( probably ) . It 's also an incredible tool if you 've got young kids and dogs : You can teach the kids to throw w/ the launcher and make a game out of who can throw the farthest , and the dog gets to play fetch . BAM !
4 #### Excellent . Unfortunately , my dog also thought it to be delicious ... still works but does n't look that great .
5 #### Great thrower ! Love it ! Use it every day ! Durable , throws far , saves your arm !
5 #### Took me a little bit to figure out how to get the best throws but I bring this to the dog park and all the dogs love when I bring it because it can throw the ball quite far . The best part is I do n't have to touch all the gross tennis balls the different dogs bring me at the park .
5 #### We love chuckit and so do our puppies . Only thing that would be better would be for it to throw the balls without my help . ! ! ! !
4 #### Nice and handy size when I take the dog for a walk .
5 #### Best dog to ever ! It she just come the the ultra balls though .
5 #### Our furbie loves it ! He 's even tried to put the ball back into it rather than drop it on the ground . We do not have a lot of space where we live so we have to throw it a bit lighter as this throws the ball pretty far but it is wonderful that I no longer have to mess with the dirty muddy slobber covered ball . I am also disabled so it makes picking up the ball a lot easier . We plan on getting one of the longer ones next spring / summer ( this one is only about a foot , give or take a couple of inches , in length ) .
5 #### I 'm a dog sitter . I thought this would be a great idea , only the dogs are smarter than me . They go chase the ball , then leave it . So after I throw a dozen or so tennis balls around the yard , I have to go pick them up . Still , it gets them running out some of their energy and it 's not like I do n't need the exercise .
5 #### If you have a dog that loves to play fetch then get this and you wo n't regret it ! It makes it so easy to throw the ball long distances without wearing out your arm so the dog is the one tired when you are done and you can still move your arm the next day . Plus you do n't have to touch the drool covered ball or bend over to pick it up !
2 #### Ball is garbage . The ball That comes with the thrower is similar to a large tennis ball but less durable . Would recommend getting the rubber ball which seems to hold up well to dog abuse . Also , the three in ball is quite a bit heavier and harder to throw than he smaller ball ( and I am quite fit ) .
5 #### I originally bought the medium sized launcher , but I felt the balls were a bit too small for my German Shepherds and worried they 'd accidentally swallow one while running with it , so I upgraded to the large . Not only are the large balls the perfect size for my dogs ( although they are quite a bit more expensive than the medium size ! ) , the large launcher also works with the medium sized Cuz dog toys , which is awesome because those are not only difficult to throw , they get really gross and slimy because of the material . Very useful ball launcher , I use it almost every day .
5 #### No more picking up wet , gross balls . These items are amazing . Would buy again if lost or broken .
5 #### i am not sure who loves this more- Grace the minature labradoodle who ostensibly benefits from this things range , or myself who loves the fright that it generates at our local park . This thing is amazing . It saves my arm , and in doing so gets Grace a ton more exercise as they 're running 100 yards to track down the ball . More importantly , it creates absolute chaos when our local park in zurich switzerland gets over run with tourists . The ball travel at such a high speed that you can hear them traveling through the air , sending many tourists scurrying even before the rather forceful impact . What 's truly surprising though is that the aim is fantastic . It takes a bit of getting used to , but after a while you do feel in control of the distance , height and velocity . Grace goes nuts when we leave the house with this - I ca n't recommend it highly enough .
5 #### If you have a dog that loves chasing balls and you hate picking up slobbery balls , this is a great item . They last forever and really help with tiring out high energy dogs .
4 #### My dog loves this ! She 's a dalmation / lab mix who is all about chasing frisbees and balls . Shortly after I bought this I sprained my wrist on my dominant hand , but I can still " chuck " the ball for her using my non - dominant hand with this so she can still get her exercise ( it 's difficult to walk my dogs on a leash with only one hand- and I ca n't pooper scoop ! ) I will say though , that I was hestitant about using the orange tennis ball that comes with it since it is made in China . Ultimately the orange ball is easier to see and find than a standard green tennis ball , but it fell apart after just a few weeks .
5 #### Greatest way for dog exercise and owners arm . Small size allows to keep in pocket .
5 #### Our Lab Ioves to play fetch , but she lives to play tug and chew on stuff . This thing worked great , but she loved chewing on it , so I finally just gave in .
5 #### I have a big back yard , double lot size , so my pup has lots of room to run . I 'm able to get the ball almost from one end of the lot to the other with very little effort . This thing is saving my shoulder , which is important to me , and sending the ball further and faster , which is important to my large energy - filled pup . Glad I ordered extra balls because my pup was able to split the included ball after a month of hard daily play , but then little escapes destruction when she puts her mind and jaws to the task .
5 #### worth the money ! works great with tennis balls and chuck it balls . I love the longer handle b / c you do n't have to bend as low to pick up balls .
5 #### Works great . Gives the dog the exercise she needs and travels a long distance easily .
5 #### Got this for my friend 's large dog . Their son and the dog play with it a lot . Gives both of them something to do ! ! ! Recommend .
4 #### My dog loved this I thought at first that this was just plain lazy after all who ca n't throw a ball ! But this chuckit allows you to throw the ball three times as far so my chubby golden has to run farther ! Plus she loves it , she even knows the word chuckit now .
5 #### I do n't have the strength to throw a tennis ball far but with the Chuckit I 'm able to give my little dog a good run . And you pick it up with the pocket of it . So glad I bought in .
5 #### This thing is wonderful ! This allows me to " throw " the ball three times further and gives my dog a great work - out in half the time ! I HIGHLY recommend this for dogs that love to play ball and need to burn off some extra energy !
5 #### This makes playtime so much easier on me and my husband ! No more bending and squatting 200 times to get the ball !
5 #### This small size is perfect for my 3 year old . He can pick up and throw the ball easily with this without hurling it over the neighbor 's fence or whacking himself , his baby sister , or the dog with it in the process . I was worried that the medium sized balls might be a bit on the small size for our Lab but he does n't seem to have any trouble with them . What could be better than a Labrador and a toddler that are too happy and tired to get in to trouble ?
5 #### this is my dogs favorite toy ! If you are good at it , you can launch a ball very far ! ! I use it as a way to grab the ball from my puppy so he does n't nip my hand to get it on accident !
5 #### Saves my arm and keeps my lab entertained for hours . Works great this plain old tennis balls too .
5 #### Perfect for the lazy dog owner . I sit in a comfy lawn chair and the dog gets loads of exercise . Ca n't argue with that ! This is a pretty classic toy , and I"m happy to report that it seems as well made as ever . Nothing complicated , but effective and easy to use .
4 #### Sore shoulders after a game of fetch ? This is the answer .
4 #### My black lab loves to play catch . This really increased the distance I could throw the ball . Unfortunately he liked it so much he chewed . May order another but will definitely also be trying a tennis racket for the same job .
5 #### I have used mine for 7 months every single day and my dog loves it ! ! It 's easy to use and quite sturdy ( we 've had a few big dogs at the dog park take it from me and chew on me , still held up ) . I 'll definitely buy another one when this one breaks , but it looks like it 'll last quite some time .
4 #### there was a chipped piece with sharp edge when I just opened the plastic cover . they need to check their products before shipping out . Love the product tho !
1 #### What the hell is wrong with these things lately . I bought three new Chuckits in different price ranges , and I 've had problems with them all . My old dog chewed beat up one works great . All my new ones , when I " chuck it " , the ball gets driven into the ground . I 've used my old one for years , the new one , I just smacked my poor six month old German Shepherd right in the eye , poor thing . I had to hold an ice bag on his eye . I HATE these new ones . I do n't recall having to " break in " any new chuckits before . I 'm so fed up with these things right now I vow not to ever buy this brand again .
4 #### Chuckits are classic dog toys . The plastic is tough so the throwers last . The tennis balls they make DO NOT last , so I always recommend their rubber balls to be used with the throwers because those are fairly indestructible .
5 #### I LOVE this toy for my dogs . I can use this with my hand / wrist that is healing from having surgery .
1 #### Did n't realize that the L stood for LARGE ball ... sort of defeats the purpose ... you ca n't use a regular tennis ball once you lose the original .
5 #### My dog looses focus if you throw the ball super far . This throws it far enough and saves your shoulder .
5 #### This has saved my arm ! I use it almost daily for my pittbull who has endless energy . Where we would go in because my arm was starting to hurt , we now go in when she ca n't get up , lol . Love this ! The handle has held up well and so has the ball . I was worried based on other reviews about her tearing it up so I bought a plastic ball from Chuckit in case that happened . However , we are still on the original ball . I do put it " up " when not in use so that she ca n't tear it up playing around the house with it . LOVE this thing ! I even showed it to my neighbor when I had to run into his fenced in back yard b / c I threw it soooo far . It did take a little getting used to since you really can " chuckit " .
4 #### My dog loves playing fetch and the Chuckit has saved my shoulder and arm from almost certain injury if I had to throw the ball without it .
5 #### a perfect pair . Every " ball " dog needs one ! So does his owner !
5 #### Seriously a life saver if you have a lab that 's obsessed with balls . She will run herself to death and I would be sore from throwing before we got our chuck it . This is our second one as our first one got left out and chewed in half by our golden retriever ... So , apparently it 's easy to chew through ( not a manufacturing problem , just a forgetful owner problem ) but it will save your arm !
5 #### WANT a pooper - scooper that ACTUALLY works ? This is IT ! For a small dog around 10 Pounds feed premium food ( the higher quality the food the smaller the poo ) you wo n't be disappointed ! I take my puppy poo three times a day , and wash it with hot water and soap in - between . ( Currently , I 'm using plastic shopping bags . ) IF it starts to smell or once a week , which ever comes first , I soak it overnight in pure , white vinegar to disinfect it , and take away any stench of dog poo . WHY : Did I buy this ( dog toy ) to use as a pooper - scooper ? When I used to have a Smooth Miniature Dachshund puppy as a child in the 90 's , there was a plastic pooper - scooper that was shaped like a cup at the end of a long plastic handle . They do not seem to make it anymore , but this dog toy comes pretty darn close . ( Except for : the little edges that hold the ball to throw it . ) Because it is NOT exactly the same , cleaning , and disinfecting it does take a little more time , but compared to ANY , and ALL other pooper - scooters for sale now , it works SO much better . It takes minutes to clean . One tip : If your dog 's " mess " is runny , let it dry out before scooping it so it wo n't stick to the plastic . If you ca n't : CLEAN - UP is still quicker , and easier than with ANY other pooper - scooper , but the poo may stick . ( Just a warning . )
5 #### If you have a high energy dog you need this product ! It allows you to throw the ball far with minimal effort . I think it would be especially helpful if you had an shoulder concerns . Wears my dog out in half the time !
5 #### Had the 26L for 9yrs now . It 's an arm saver , especially when trying to tire out a high energy Labrador Retriever pup . I use the orange colored ultra ball during the day , and the glow in the dark one at dusk or night . Eventually , every good human gets great at throwing the ball with differing techniques ... from the high , arching lob with serious hang - time , to the side arm line drive water skipper ; and not to be outdone by the over the dogs shoulder one - bouncer mid - air catch ( just like an NFL QB to a wide receiver ) . These make life with your pet that much better ! I highly recommend Chuck - It brand .
5 #### So much fun to work my 65 lb pittie with . He loves the Chuckit so much !
4 #### Thrower weakens and breaks , but use for 1 - 2 hours of throwing per day , last a month or more . The chuck - it balls are lousy , so do n't buy extra , just use old tennis balls . Have purchased at least 6 Chuckits , the last batch seem thinner and lighter , still worth the money it your dog loves to fetch . Will save your arm / shoulder because you can really launch the ball without much effort
5 #### This is just great when you do n't want to pick up that slobbery ball
1 #### I 'm not sure what compelled the manufacturer to change the Chuckit stick the way they did but it is now complete garbage . It 's totally flimsy , hard to throw , and hard to grab the ball from the ground . The old design it a million times better . If you are a returning customer thinking that you 're getting the old Chuckit stick that 's sturdy and has that nice rubber grip , DO NOT BUY THIS . This feels like a cheap knock - off but the sad thing is that it IS a Chuckit product . Just save yourself the aggravation and walk away .
2 #### I bought this , the smallest chuckit , for it 's portability , but it 's size completely ruins the purpose of a chuckit . This is no better than just chucking the stupid ball with my arm . And I do n't pretend to understand the physics behind it , but it takes a lot of user effort to get the ball to leave the holder . You have to be a master of the wrist flick , which is n't a problem with the bigger chuckits which create enough inertia to force the ball out with a little flick of the wrist .
5 #### the launcher is great . the balls are cardboard they split in half in one day
5 #### Whoever invented this was a genius . LOVE IT ! ! Our dog fetches the ball for hours and it helps me get some distance and i do n't even have to touch the grimy ball to pick it up . Great price for a great product .
4 #### My lab loved this kept her chasing the ball for hours
3 #### This is a good product , my rating is because I ended up buying the longer on because it 's easier to throw farther
5 #### I bought this to give it a try and was impressed how easy it is to throw the ball . I have bad shoulders so really ca n't throw far at all and then pay for it later with pain . This solves that issue and I can throw the ball further than I could when I did n't have a bad shoulder . Well worth the money .
5 #### Love this Jr M size . I have been using these for my dogs for almost 20 years . I like this short version better than the standard length . This size DOES use regular tennis balls . Any of the Chuck it products that say M use the standard tennis balls . I bought 5 at the add on item price to donate to a dog shelter .
5 #### Awesome to have a small one to hide from a puppy
5 #### Ca n't beat it . Arm never gets sore or tires , and do n't have to touch the slobbery ball !
5 #### If your dog likes to play fetch , he / she will love this thing . It makes it a lot easier for you to throw farther so it will definitely give your arm a break if yours is like mine and has a ton of energy to play for hours !
5 #### Revolutionizes my wife 's dog walking . She loves not having to touch the slobbery ball and it gives her great range .
5 #### We use ours to death ... it 's a must have for our trips to the dog park and beach
5 #### I honestly love this because I do n't have to bend down to get the ball . Plus it can launch the ball so far . It actually makes my pup tired after playing fetch . Win win !
5 #### Our dog loves this and it is easy on the arm .
5 #### I am an elderly person with a spunky year old Lab mix . My dog loves it and so do I !
5 #### This is a great tool for throwing balls . I can throw them a lot farther so our Aussie and Border Collie get more exercise ! ! ! It really does work ! ! !
5 #### This makes it much easier to throw and retrieve balls for a dog who loves to chase them . My older dog loves her large , Ultimate Kong Toy ( black ) , but I get tired of picking it up and trying to throw it far enough to give her a workout . The Chuckit is perfect for a good workout . I do n't know how the balls would stand up to a GSD 's teeth , so I put the Chuckit away and give the Kong back when she 's done enough running .
5 #### These are great for playing fetch and keeping your hands clean
5 #### I have always disliked playing fetch with my dogs because I get nauseous when I touch the spit / dirt covered ball . I saw this and I thought it was so silly . But I decided to order it after it sitting in my cart for a month and I LOVE it . It easily picks up the ball without even having to touch it , and it helps me to throw it far . I am a terrible pitcher and my dog loves that she can run more than 10 feet away to get it . I really recommend this . As a bonus , my new puppy LOVES chewing on it , especially the funny shaped ball end of it . Great for his teething . This thing is not just a gimmick or for lazy people , it really improves fetch - playing .
4 #### I like this shorter style for walks . It 's light weight and easy to carry along . I find that I ca n't throw the ball as far as with the longer one but it still does the job .
5 #### Saved my shoulder and arm . My dog can fetch all day , but my arm ca n't throw all day . This is great . I chose this one because it uses regular sized tennis balls . Perfect !
5 #### This is the perfect length ! The longer ones do n't give you as much control over where the ball is going . This is really easy to use and keeps me from wearing out my arm when I 'm trying to tire out my dog at the dog park . I also like that I do n't have to touch a gross slobbery ball . This lets me pick it up without touching it . Also good for if your dog gets a little mouthy when you try to get the ball from them .
5 #### The dog loses his mind when he sees this thing . His happiness is my happiness . Throws the ball farther than I ever could , an incredible invention .
5 #### Best dog toy invention ever ! I do n't gave a great throwing arm and this doubles the distance-- it 's awesome ! ! ! And no more slimy balls ! I love it and am going to order another one ... Just in case ...
3 #### The throwing device works well and makes this worth the price of purchase . Definitely eases the wear and tear on the arm and shoulder . The ball is cheaply made and my dog destroyed it after only two sessions . While the ball looks like an oversize tennis ball , it is much less durable than the standard tennis ball . Admittedly , my dog is 80 pounds and tough on his toys but I have a number of other balls that have held up to his rough play .
5 #### good price and our golden loves this thing ( so do i because i can sit to throw the ball )
5 #### Definitely give it a try ! ! I have a 100 pound ( all muscle ) Labrador that is ball - crazy ! This lets you throw the ball really far ! You do n't even have to touch the slobbery ball , pick it up with the launcher . This lets you throw the ball further than the product the canine cannon , but they are both the same idea . After using it for awhile , I got a kink in my shoulder . Nothing bad to say about this . If your dog likes balls , it is a great thing to add to your doggie toy box .
2 #### We had the same size Chuckit ! launcher , but our puppy got a hold of it so we had to get a new one . This one looks the same , but it does n't quite throw the same . Not sure if this is an older version , but there 's something different about it that makes it different to throw and we do n't really like it . We may try to buy another one from the local pet store to see if that 's like the one we had before .
5 #### It 's so small and cute ! Perfect for travel or smaller kids trying to lob a ball for the dog .
5 #### 5 stars after modification - 1 star before modification . Ball would stick and it was difficult to get ball to release , when it did there was no telling where it would go . Solution : cut off .5 inch of the front / top portion of the cup , ball now easily releases with desired accuracy and easily picks up ball to throw again .
5 #### great price dog loves it especially with the rubber balls I buy separately
4 #### It was n't clear to me how big this is . Works well for small breeds .
3 #### I was under the impression that this ball was a regular size . This is my fault . The ball for this is much smaller . My dogs tore it up the second they got to it . I decided not to buy more balls for this ball thrower . They do n't break regular sized tennis balls .
5 #### These are wonderful ! Especially for some of us old folks that ca n't get any distance on the ball !
4 #### Love the launcher , but the ball was destroyed in 20 minutes of chewing .
5 #### great product , much easier on the wrists , Cali loves it too
5 #### Our dog loves to chase tennis balls or rubber balls , and with this launcher even our 4 yr old can throw them a good distance for him . I like the pocket size even better than the first longer one we had bought . Only caution is that the launcher is plastic and strong chewers can put nicks all over it ( why we had to get a 2nd one ) so we keep ours out of reach of the puppy now .
5 #### Honestly a must have for dog owners whose dog likes to play fetch . No more touching the gross slobbery balls anymore !
5 #### My dog loves it . Summer wants to play ball all day .
5 #### Fun , fun and fun ! Our dog loves to run after the ball , now to get her to bring it back !
5 #### I love this product and ca n't imagine my life without Chuck it . We play fetch for 2 hours every night to get my lab to calm down . I would n't have shoulders of it was n't for Chuck it . This thing can throw a ball the size of a football field of you throw it right . Making it a extremely efficient way to get rid of extra energy and give your dog the exercise they need . All without wearing you down after a long day .
4 #### Works great , but the cup that holds the ball tends to widen a bit after a lot of use . So , the ball wo n't stay in the handle .
5 #### Helps my 3 year old daughter get some distance on her throw when playing with the dog . Also its nice not to touch a slimy ball or frisbee .
5 #### These are great ! Needed a new one to replace the old one I 've been using , and which has been out in the sun forever . Saves your shoulder ... Recommended !
4 #### The longer launcher takes less effort to throw and is more accurate when using it inside . I use the medium launcher for the small Chuckit balls and it also fits racket balls loosely . The balls just come out of the launcher a lot easier and more accurately using the smaller balls . Especially when throwing the balls around in the house .
2 #### The launcher is great but the ball that came with it ( orange ) did n't even last 24 hours . Tore up really easily and was of a very poor quality .
5 #### This has been great for my lab mix : he will play fetch until he can barely stand , so the 26 M launcher makes it much easier for me to wear him out within a reasonable amount of time . I also sincerely appreciate not having to touch drooly tennis balls with my hands .
5 #### Fun little toy that saves my arm . Goes considerably farther and gives her a better work out than my whimpy arm ever would .
4 #### We had the Chuckit 18 M Pro model before we bought this one and we loved it , but our dog got a hold of it and chewed it up , so we bought this one to replace it because it was a bit cheaper than the pro model . The one we received is a fun green color and fits all chuck it balls and tennis balls in it just fine . This one does the job , but the handle is shaped a bit different , so you have to get used to throwing it a bit differently than the Pro style . The only thing I really do n't like about it is that the handle feels flimsy compared to the Pro model . It bends really easily , especially when picking up the ball and I 'm worried it 's going to break in half . Other than that , it works just fine . I like the length of the 18 M styles ; the length is perfect and can go a really good distance . If you have the extra bucks to get the 18 M Pro , I probably would , but if you need to save a few bucks , this one would do just fine .
5 #### Our schnauzer is addicted to ball , and we 've gone thru just 3 of these throwers in her 10 - year - old life thus far . They past for years !
5 #### Best thing I could 've purchased for our GSD . She lives to run and play ball . Really a nice item and must have ! ! !
5 #### Our 80 pound beast LOVES this ! Great toy and keeps them busy for hours ! !
5 #### Love this line of toys ! Nice long handle , so you do n't have to bend over too much to scoop up the ball . Love that it comes with a bright orange ball ! I was surprised at the range of this thing and actually threw the ball over the fence the first time I used it .
4 #### Love the Chuckit ! line ! I like that it came with a ball already , and the orange color is great - seems to make the dogs more interested in playing ! I would n't get this size again , unless it was for a child to use , though , as it 's shorter than expected .
4 #### It 's okay ... But I find it 's hard to find solace large enough to truly utilize it and . It 's not quite as ray to pick up the tennis balls as I though ... But in the right situation and for the right dog this thing will really let the balls FLY !
5 #### Great toy to wear the dog out . I use this for a small field across my house . It is a more short range chuckit . On average it throws 50 - 60 ft . My dog loves it !
5 #### I must with a border collie . I throw like a girl who can not throw and this thing allows me to give the dog enough exercise . Is a MUST if you have a ball obsessed border collie as we do .
5 #### Love this product ! ! No more grabbing slobbery balls with your hands . Everyone is happy .
5 #### 2 replacements for the 2 i have these have better handles ( nicer grip ) love you do n't have to touch slimmy balls . Also trained our shepherds to drop the ball straight into a bucket . The chuck it brand has always been a favourite for me and our shepherds , very hard wearing .
5 #### I use it every time I play with my dog . Supposedly , the 26 M Launcher throws it farther , but I really want to keep my dog within sight anyway ( I live in a big city ) . This is useful for picking up other balls too . Does n't have to be this exact ball . I use it for a squishy one that 's way bigger , when we play with 2 balls . So I make her drop 1 ball before releasing the other , while she fetches , I pick up the ball that 's been released . That way , they come back and I do n't have to walk a long distance for the balls ( which is the whole point anyway , so I can stay lazy ;)
4 #### This handle is bigger than the other styles I 've used . I never thought I had little hands until trying to grip this . If I want to get any distance , I have to use both hands .
5 #### Ca n't believe we got this as an add on for such a great price . Our husky puppy has been slowly getting into finally playing fetch at the dogpark and with this , we can make him span the whole length and make him sleepy much faster . He loves this thing ! ! He does n't understand not to try and chew the launcher when I pick up the ball but he has improved in fetch game immensely . He can tell where the ball will go and he is so fast that this saves my arm so much pain after a round of fetch with our wolf ( husky / german shepherd mix ) . Such a great item . Would suggest probably a longer one as sometimes I suck with this thing , but so worth it . Ca n't believe I waited until he was 14 months old to get this . IF YOU ARE QUESTIONING IT , JUST BUY IT YOU WON'T BE SORRY .
5 #### Exactly as described . Easy to throw and pickup ball . Added distance to the throw .
5 #### We carry this smaller one in the RV and the Lab just loves it . Now if she would only let go of the ball .
5 #### Compact model . Perfect size . Can use a regular tennis ball .
5 #### This 26L Chuckit ! Launcher came w / one ball ... a little bigger than a regular tennis ball . I can now ' launch ' a ball quite far and it also can be used to pick up the ball with a snap upon return ... great ! I tried using it with a regular size tennis ball it will throw it OK but not as good . Also it does n't really grab a hold of it to pick one as easily . We go through lots of balls so wanted to check that out . So for now I bring that ball back inside when we are done with the launcher . I must say I really needed this ... before my dog would either get hit by the thrown ball ( he ran faster than I could throw ) or would have to come back to where it landed ... hehe . We have much more fun now !
5 #### Used these for years , classic product with a simple design that just works . If you do n't have one of these you need one .
4 #### I like it but prefer a better grip . This one is all plastic . I have another brand stick like this with silicone grip and it works so much better .
3 #### Ball is small and cheap . Does not hold up to chewing . Splits easily . Only meant for small dogs . The chuckit tool is well made , though .
5 #### Great ! My dog loves this and will play forever
5 #### Great gift for my sister in law 's dog and she loves it
2 #### Handle is extremely uncomfortable . Nothing like the Chuck it stick I already have . I wanted one to leave at the lake to exercise the dog , but I really hate the handle . It does not throw as far as my other one either . Get the one with the molded handle .
5 #### Good for lazy people who do n't want to walk the dog . Just get 2 to 3 balls . As soon as you throw one ball , get the 2nd ball ready to throw when the dog brings back the 1st ball . Do n't do this for more than 15 minutes . You do n't want to give your dog a heart attack :-)
5 #### Due to shoulder weakness I ca n't throw a ball : the ball ends up 10 - 15 feet and some 90 degrees away from my target spot . With this one I can throw at least 4 - 5 times farther out and within 2 feet of my target spot . I have about a 60 ft open space indoors and with this I can get my dog running indoors any time , so he gets exercise regardless of weather outside .
5 #### Our dog LOVES it ! ! Really saves our arms / shoulders and makes it a lot more fun for her ! We ordered the Medium ball size , which will fit standard tennis balls . Thinking about getting a Whistle ball soon !
5 #### Now I do n't have to pick up the dirty ball with my hands at the dog park ! Love it
5 #### Cool toy for the dog that loves to fetch balls . It really launches the ball and the dog gets more exercise .
5 #### I had to hide this because my dog would not stop bringing me the ball to throw . This might possibly be her favorite toy ever , and possibly one of my least favorite . It works really well though !
5 #### This is , hands down , the best thing ever invented for someone with an energetic puppy / dog . Make sure you buy extra balls .
5 #### These are one of the best devices ever invented to use while playing with your dog . Durable , easy to use , inexpensive and fun . What a great combination . Any tennis ball works in these throwers so garb a ball and head out with your best friends .
5 #### Simple , sturdy . My dog wants to play with the stock more than he does the ball ! Excellent if you 've got a good size bit of land to work in . Advice to users : if you go to the dog park with this , keep an eye out on unfamiliar dogs . I 've seen plenty of people surprised as dog have lept high in the air to get at a stick held over the shoulder . Seen a bit of broken skin , as well .
5 #### Works great ! I got it so I did n't have to pick up the wet and slimy tennis balls with my hands . Can throw it pretty far too . Dog loves it ! Shipped fast too with prime !
5 #### Love it . Be careful not to use near brush . This worked so well I ended up tossing a ball into brush on the edge of our yard that I did n't think would be in range and we ended up with mosquito bites and prickers in our skin when we tried to dig it out . I ca n't wait to go to our local dog park and let our german shepherd really get a good workout with this launcher . Even though this fits regular tennis balls i read that regular tennis balls are not safe for dogs . the microfiber erodes the enamel on their teeth and the balls can collapse and pose a choking hazard . Just a bit of info I picked up recently so I thought I 'd pass it on in case you are n't aware . So stick to the ball that comes with the launcher or something made especially for dogs . I bought a planet dog glow for good 2.5 " ball and it fits this launcher perfectly and will not collapse or pose a choking hazard . What a great toy .
5 #### Still using after a number of years . Needs balls that fit . ChuckIt balls work better than the pseudo or real tennis balls . For your obsessive pup .
4 #### I love this ! My hands do n't get full of slober when I play fetch with my dogs !
5 #### Hours of fun and takes regular size tennis balls This comes in very handy at the dog park where there are strange balls that you do n't want to pick up your hand
5 #### I 'd been wanting one of these for a while and was not disappointed ! My pup usually runs out farther than I can throw and then has to turn around to come back for the ball .. Fetch is a lot more fun with the chucker , love it
5 #### My mini aussie loves this ! ( & so does my arm ) Def worth buying . Kids enjoying using it too .
4 #### Definitely worth it if you have a dog that loves chasing balls . This thing will save your arm and will throw 2 - 3 times as far . The one I received was a little rough around the edges on the part where the balls goes . It does n't seem to have affected the performance however .
5 #### This is the perfect size ( length ) to throw a standard tennis ball .
5 #### Love these . My dog gets twice as much exercise because the ball goes so far . We have recommended them for years
5 #### Quick shipping . Great product , and much cheaper than at a big chain pet store . My pup loves it , and I do n't have to touch disgusting , drool soaked covered in dirt tennis balls .
5 #### Never ever go without one of these . Takes all the work out of throwing a ball ; throws it much further than I could humanly manage . AND it 's lightweight and very durable . We always have at least one in the house as our Standards love to fetch !
5 #### Dogs gets so excited when he sees me get it out !
4 #### I 'd give this five stars if the " mini " which was suppose to be 20.5 inches long had arrived . Instead we received the 14s which is 14 inches long . The package says 14s but the Amazon stocking label on it says " mini " . We returned the first one and reordered the mini but got the same thing again so Amazon must have a whole bin of 14s launchers labelled as " mini " so we just decided to keep it . The advantage of the mini is that for taller people , you do n't have to lean over so far to scoop the ball up when your dog returns it to you ( husband has back issues so the extra few inches in length would have been nice ) . We 'll wait a few months before ordering again to see if we actually can get the mini through Amazon . By the way we use this with the 2 " Kong squeaky balls we purchase on Amazon and it works just fine . You can really throw the ball much further with this thing . Allows us to help our dog get a lot of exercise in the backyard .
5 #### Easy to use , launches the ball so far that I have to go get the ball because the dogs lost site of it . I now throw the ball side - arm style across the ground . Works great and my hands are slobber free .
4 #### this is a great toy for a dog that likes to fetch it really needs to be a little longer though you have a tendency to throw it straight down but if you can learn how to use it your dog will love you forever
4 #### Got lime green , dog loves it but ours arrived damaged Amazon made right though
5 #### Mu dog 's favorite and and good exercise for us both
5 #### Love this thing ... 2nd purchase great price ! Tires out my little pit bull angel
5 #### I thought when I first saw these it was a dumb idea . Why not just throw the darn ball . Boy was I wrong , it really wings it out there . No way I could ever throw the ball that far . I love it , Reggie loves it and Oliver loves it !
5 #### This is our second purchase of a Chuckit since I threw the old one in high grass and could not find it ! Our Redbone Lab dog 's energy mandates a launcher of this caliber . It is a great purchase if you have an energetic dog . I buy regular tennis balls since one ball only lasts for few days .
3 #### I do n't get my puppy for another 6 weeks so I do n't go out and use it yet , however iI feel it will be stuffed into my back pack on all adventures . My breed can retrieve 8 hours a day and still want more . I need to save my shoulder for competitive tennis and this may help that concern .
5 #### This is a durable and inexpensive toy that both of my dogs enjoy playing with their dog friends at the dog park . It allows you to throw balls great distances with little effort . I just have to work better at my aim . I have been known to accidentally hit a person ( or dog ) or two . To my defense , so have others . This would also make a great gift . Match it with the balls that whistle too .
5 #### If you have a dog that likes to chase balls , this is the only way to do it . I 've seen people in parks with these for years and when I got a new puppy this was one his first purchases . Once you get the hang of it , it 's shocking how far the ball will travel . I also use underhand for areas with lots of trees ( though that takes a lot more practice ) . Highly recommended .
5 #### We purchased this as a welcome puppy gift for a friend recently . Our Lab absolutely loves her XL Chuckit ! ! She insists on taking it out with us every time we go out the door . Saves your shoulder and arm while able to give your dog a good fun play time ! ! I Highly reccomend this you will get Great ball distance with little effort on your part and your dog will love you for it !
5 #### This is the best invention to get my dog to exercise . The plastic is good quality and it even comes with a ball . My retriever loves to play fetch and this was the perfect tool to keep my arm from falling off .
5 #### There is a reason that this is the one that everyone else tries to copy . It is easy to use , you can pick up the ball with the catcher so you never hav to grab slobber , it holds the ball well , throwing is a cinch and you can finally outlast your pooch . They are not chew resistant . That is why I had to buy this one ( to replace my old one ) .
3 #### The stick is too long . I would prefer if it was a bit shorter .
3 #### I love chuckit launchers , I have 5 of them . However my point for this review is the following : the Mini is not , like the description says , 20.5 inches . It is the standard 14S. I was looking for something longer for the 2 in ball , but it seems the 14 inches is the only available . I returned the Mini since I already have the 14S. I hope they will update the description for the Mini to match what it actually is .
5 #### It 's super small so it 's easy to carry but still provides plenty of power for throwing the ball quite far . Have only had it a few weeks so ca n't comment on its longevity but it feels as strong as other full - size Chuckit 's I 've had that have lasted years .
5 #### How can anyone who has a dog not have one of these ? I 've had one for years and wanted to have another to keep in my car . Saves lots of bending over and sore arms ... Plus my wife throws like a girl ( thank God ) !
5 #### Love our Chuckit ! Saves the arm from throwing and even my 9 year old can wing the ball far for the dogs to chase . Great item and would recommend to anyone who has a ball chasing pet !
5 #### this has been so much fun to use with my German Shepherd puppy . He loves running and this goes very far and he has created a huge muscle mass on his rear end from running so much . Every large breed owner should have one of these and a 140 foot leash to go along with it it 's perfect .
4 #### I really like this because I do n't have to touch Misty 's slimy tennis ball , it doensnt throw as far as the normal sized one though .
5 #### My dog is obsessed with this ball ! He loves , loves loves it ! So much easier for me . Keeps my hands clear and not dirty from picking up the ball , but you have to get your dog drop it first ! Mine do n't want to let go .
5 #### Perfectly affordable ! Beats the pet stores in cost segnificanty , and I 'd highly recommend it for an active dog at the park , or beach ! Do n't forget to get one of the special balls that glow in the dark , or make sounds while in the air to keep you dog 's attention while playing
5 #### Love the launcher , not so much the orange balls . My dog likes yellow , wo n't retrieve any other color . Not sure why that is , but he 's pretty strict about it . The launcher however is a blessing and an arm saver ! !
5 #### Best tool for tiring out your fast runner/ high energy dog
5 #### I throw like a girl . lol . This gives my throwing arm some oomph . My dog appreciates being able to run a bit further for the ball .
3 #### I bought the larger version , but the tennis balls are a bit big for my little Pom . I love the mini Chuckit ! balls , but the launcher is small than I expected and the short length makes it difficult to use . I usually end up chucking it into the ground in front of me , but I 'm starting to get the hang if it . I would suggest going with the larger one , easier to use and launches farther .
4 #### This is good for your decent size backyard . For parks I would recommend the larger one . Easy for adults to use . Any ages under 10 and they may have problems getting the ball out when throwing .
5 #### Great fetch tool . Saves your arm and shoulder and increases distance ! This size is for smaller dogs which the smaller sized balls are even harder to throw . A must have !
5 #### Great price , I can definitely throw it further with the longer handle .
5 #### This launcher will really get the distance you need to tire our your pup ! Also takes a lot of stress off the arm .
5 #### I got this to exercise my lab in a way that appeases her natural instinct to retrieve . After several months of use , the launcher is still going on a daily basis . She ( the lab ) does n't like the fabric ball as much as the whistler ball we ended up buying her and using with this launcher , but it is still an excellent product to prevent touching the ball . In the winter it helps preventing my hands from freezing , and it consistently prevents me from touching a slobbery and dirty ball . We have a fairly large - sized back yard for a suburban neighborhood and the junior launcher was a perfect fit for our throwing needs ( e.g. meaning that I did n't need the larger size as it would fly into my neighbors yard ) . The launcher is about a foot and a half and has withstood being lightly chewed on . Should I ever get a bigger or smaller yard , I will buy another Chuckit ! to use for that yard .
5 #### This is a great little tool for my very active Whippet . She loves to chase a ball in our backyard , but my old shoulder was beginning to ache all the time . The Chuckit is letting me throw for a longer time and my shoulder is beginning to feel better . A tired Whippet is a well - behaved Whippet .
5 #### Best dog toy ever for a dog who LOVES to chase balls ! Heavy duty and works great . Takes a bit to get used to for throwing balls but once you have the knack ... its the best ! It can launch balls like nothing else !
4 #### Great toy and really helps to get that ball much further . I have 20 lb terrier mix and at first she did n't get why I had a big stick lol but now she is use to it and enjoys it . I like it cause I do n't have to wear out my arm tossing the ball for her . The only complaint I have is that there were some jagged edges on the " scoop ' part . It was only on one side and can easily be grinded down so its not really a huge issue just appeared the cut was not very clean . Overall a nice sturdy and useful toy . We look forward to purchasing some more Chuck It balls soon . Also for the price man what a steal ! !
3 #### It does what its supposed to I guess but I can throw the ball further than it can . If your dog slobbers all over the ball then this would save you having to pick it up or bend down as far . So there 's that . Good quality construction too .
1 #### I got this to make playing ball with the dogs easier . However , it takes more strength to use this thing than it does for me to just throw the darn ball ! The ball wo n't come out of the holder thingy unless I stop the Chuckit abruptly , and forcefully at the top of the arc ( using much more than arm muscles ) , and even then the ball goes about 10 feet straight toward the ground . I use it to pick up the tennis balls before the lawn gets mowed .
5 #### Great ! Uses regular tennis ball - sized balls which is helpful .
5 #### We got this chuck - it for my parents ' back yard . It is the perfect size to be able to throw the ball without worrying about it going too far . Picks up any ball that is tennis ball sized .
5 #### My dogs love the Chuckit ! I ca n't throw the ball even half as far without it . It seems very sturdy and though at first I felt it was a bit large , I quickly learned how to manage it . Now I take it with me to the park all the time and my dogs ca n't get enough of racing after the ball .
5 #### I have two fetching machines , and I 'm not baseball player ... This helps immensely ! It takes my little pittie at least 10 minutes to get out to wherever the ball has landed and by the time she gets back I could have had a drink or eaten some chips . Nice to take to the lake and launch her off the docks with ! I prefer the longer one with the larger ball for my German though , because frankly ... it 's not that the balls are cheap . It 's just that some dogs have bigger teeth and stronger jaws , and a greater desire to eat things ! That said , I do like this one because I can buy 99 cent tennis balls anywhere if we lose one ( yes , I can throw them that far with this " small " version ) or it gets eaten ( yes , dogs like to chew , and tennis balls happen to be very tasty , I guess ) .
5 #### So happy with this purchase ! This product could n't be designed any better . No mess pickup , EXTREME distance , and sturdy quality ... all for an outstanding value ! My pup loves it !
5 #### I was skeptical about using the Chuckit ! , but I figured the return option was available . The physics work and the catapult type action really magnifies your throwing distance 3 - 5 times depending on if myself or my kids are using it . Great device for working the dogs and just having fun .
1 #### The ball breaks so easily and so fast , not as good as the previous version .
4 #### i m to lazy to throw with my hand and broke the last one . the ball probably goes 40 - 50 years at times
5 #### I can definitely chuck farther and pickup the ball will less effort without getting my hands dirty .
5 #### Very pleased with product and price . Dogs love the extra distance ball is now thrown .
5 #### Love the small size chuck it . It fits in my backpack and in my back pocket . So much easier to carry around .
5 #### Just the right size and feels right - the longer one does n't feel as right to me . This one I can park in my back pocket under my coat when we 're done and/or I do n't want the park warden to see it and know I 've been letting the dogs off the leash ! I use it with the Ultraballs which fit it perfectly and bounce well , and are easy on the dogs ' teeth ( grit does n't accumulate in the felt and grind on their teeth ) . Happy dogs !
3 #### This has a really thick and inflexible handle . We have had several chuck - it ball throwers but something about this one is different . Maybe because it is the longest one ? It just feels uncomfortable in my hand .
5 #### I love this size Chuckit ! It 's great for back yard play , and I think it 's actually easier to use than the original , longer version .
5 #### Save your shoulder while getting your high energy dog some great exercise .
5 #### for those of you that are in the states inundated with snow over the last few months ... Invest in a couple of these and shock the neighbors kids at how well you can not only make a great snowball but launch it too ! Unfortunately I thought of this too late for me ! I have however used this in the past with the dog I had and she loved it ! The ball is a little too big for my Egyptian Mau though ... They do play fetch ... But with the balls that have bells in them etc .... 24/7 if they had it their way .
5 #### I like using this and my dog loves it !
5 #### Never thought I needed a launcher , but it 's actually been a great buy . Our pup is tireless , but my shoulder 's not . I can throw far for an hour & do n't need advil when I get home ! Do n't need to worry about picking up muddy or slobbered on tennis balls either . Remember length does n't just help you throw further ; you wo n't need to bend as much to pick up the ball .
4 #### New length did take a few minutes to get used to but I love the longer stick .
5 #### no more slimey balls . works best with the chuck it balls , which are indestructible
1 #### My dog hated this & was afraid to fetch the ball from this product . She prefers me to throw a ball & always retrieves it when I throw a ball .
4 #### Just as advertised , only handle does not have any rubber as someone said .
5 #### My dog loves to play catch and this helps tremendously . As a puppy it was ok that my throws did n't go too far , but now that she 's older , she enjoys the run . This helps relieve some of the strain I put on my arm and now it takes a bit of time for my dog to fetch and return . By the end of our session she is a tired and happy dog--- I get a bit of peace and quiet until she re - energizes . My only drawback-- which i hope will depress with use ... Its a bit hard to get the ball into the cup thing .
5 #### I have been using this for about 2 years and it is still chucking tennis balls . It has held up well . I like using it because you do n't have to get slobber on your hands , no bending over , and I can throw the ball farther with it than I can by hand . The technique takes a few minutes to get down , but it is easy to master .
2 #### Balls were ripped through in a couple throws . Still have stick for other balls though .
5 #### We have a large back yard for our community and our pup leaps and bounds across it when she 's outside . This Chuckit ! launcher gives me the ability to launch the ball all the way across the yard , rather than my measly throws on my own . The ball is easy to pick back up , granted the dog will let you pick it up , and the medium ball is perfect for my 43 lb doodle . My only complaint is the ball that comes standard with it is like a tennis ball , and my dog ate the fuzz off it ... Luckily enough I had purchased a non - fuzzy Chuckit ! glow ball to go with this toy .
5 #### My dogs are OBSESSED with chasing thrown balls ! ! ! I would honestly be lost without this ! I have purchased several of these due to leaving them at the park or loosing them . This is definitely a necessity for my fur babies . Very durable and I am able to launch this to give my dogs plenty of exercise . Would buy again if I loose this or leave it somewhere .
5 #### This product has been around for a long time . Milo , my dog loves it . No complaints here .
5 #### Just great . Give the man a Nobel Prize who invented this thing . Dog goes all day with it - and it 's very easy on the owner . Love it .
4 #### Item shipped quickly , was high quality , and works nicely . I guess the reason I did n't give it 5 stars may be my own fault . This does n't fit with a standard tennis ball . I was looking for a ball launcher that would be a bit more universal .
5 #### I used to throw the ball to my lab by hand , but his chuck it sails the ball much farther with a little effort . I use the chuck it every morning and my wife uses it every evening , it 's just as much funfor us as it is for the dog so remember to order the right size for your dog .
5 #### Awesome for being able to toss the ball that much further . I do n't like the smaller size but med & larger work great .
5 #### I have a year old German Shepherd with more energy than he knows what to do with . This is a perfect toy for the dog park ... after about 20 - 30 minutes of all out running and chasing , he is toast . Perfect way to not only wear him out , but keep the other dogs at the park engaged . Best couple of bucks I 've spent recently .
3 #### Does " toss " nearly as easily as regular sized version .
5 #### I really love this .. We have greyhounds .. A regular throw just does n't cut it .. With this , I can launch any tennis ball sized ball at least a football fields length .
5 #### I no longer have to use all my strength to play fetch with my goldendoodle . Definitely a must for a super active dog .
5 #### I did not know there was the smaller size chuck it . This is great for my nieces when they come to visit and want to play with the dogs but do n't like the fact that they have to hold a slimy ball when they play fetch .
3 #### wish it was made with durable material bc he chewed it up !
3 #### Good quality but hard to throw without hitting the ground directly in front of me . I attribute that to my weakened arm strength from long illness I had a couple years ago . I 'm not as strong as I used to be . This thrower causes just enough force during the throwing arc that I ca n't stop my arm at the point at which it would Be required to cause the correct trajectory . Instead , it ends up smacking the tennis ball into the ground about 5 or 6 yards in front of me at such velocity that it causes a wicked ricochet effect . Annoying . I went out and purchased the short version and that works perfectly for my strength level .
4 #### Dogs love to go after balls , this helps me put some distance on the ball which makes the dogs really work - out .
5 #### My 30 lbs doodle LOVES this ! And I love it to because I can " chuck it " much further and it saves my arm . We can both get our exercise . I 'm buying one for all the granddogs . :)
5 #### My puppy loves to play fetch and this makes it so easy to play with him for a longer time . Its easy to throw and uses the right size of balls for him . I purchased the 3 variety pack of Chuckit ! balls as well and they work perfectly with this .
5 #### I did n't want this stupid thing because I can throw a ball for my dog ... boy was I wrong , this thing is AWESOME ! With little effort , I 'm throwing tennis balls like a MLB pitcher out here . Here 's the best part ... I just pick up the slobbery ball with this fantastic tool !
5 #### Worked well , fits a standard tennis ball in case the original gets destroyed . My wife sues it to throw with our gods at the dog park . For her make an obvious difference in throwing range , compared to just a arm throw . Has n't snapped or broke so the quality is great .
1 #### too stif do n't fly as well as a old one i got long time ago it is thiner and bends easer .
5 #### My dog loves to chase the ball . This tool saves wear and tear on my shoulders ! I have perfected my pitch and the dog is so happy to run and fetch the bright colored ball .
5 #### These things are awesome . Allows you to play with your dog with ease .
5 #### So easy to throw the ball 100 + yards with a flick of the wrist . Love using with my dogs .
5 #### Did n't know how long 18 M was and was trying to match the one I broke . ( not the launchers fault ) This one is shorter than I wanted but works well .
5 #### Everyone knows these things are fantastic , right ? If you do n't know , get one . Trust me . The ONLY negative I can say about a Chuckit is that my dog mistakes the throwing arm for a chew toy . LOL
5 #### Dog loves it goes really far if wanted to
5 #### Now if only there was a Chuckit ! Robot to throw the ball all.day.long .
4 #### Good ball flinger . This works well and it fits regular tennis balls . Great way to exercise my dogs at the dog park . I like this product but the longer one might be easier to use .
5 #### I thought this was the dumbest idea until I used it for the first time . You can throw the ball further , you do n't have to bend down all the way , and you do n't have to touch a gross slobbery tennis ball . My dog sees me grabbing this and knows we are headed to the dog park . Works with standard tennis balls .
5 #### Awesome toy for a border collie . You can easily get 50 + yards of launch with little effort . The plastic is pretty strong , I have n't had any issues with warping or snapping . The orange ball is very high contrast with most surfaces , especially grass and makes it easy to see . Especially for us red / green colorblind folk .
5 #### Probably the best dog toy invention in the last 10 years , I keep two of these around in case I misplace one !
5 #### I have n't had a dog yet that has n't had a blast with these launchers . Smaller launchers for the smaller dogs of course and saves slobber hands goo and keeps the afternoon of fun and exercise .
1 #### I had a Chuck it for the past ( seems like for ever ) 7ears and it finally broke , , so order these two and I am so disappointed , my first throw nearly hit me ( it actually went backwards ) , then kept trying it and the ball went every where but straight,,then tried the second one same problem can not get either one of these to go straight , , then my son tried also , , thought I was doing something wrong , , he had the same problem .... do n't forget I have thrown the chuck it for years , , , what is going on , , ,
5 #### Ball goes on the end , you move your arm , the ball goes flying , the dog goes running after the ball ... and 1 out of 5 times the dog actually returns the ball .... not sure if the ball is faulty or my dog does n't get the idea of ' fetch ' .
5 #### Tennis balls for a German Shepherd are worthless . Get the rubber Chuck n It ball that Chuck it makes and have a blast . This toy is a sought after one in this house . Great exercise tool . But , confused the tennis ball for a big and Drivey dog as mine is because in just one throw the tennis ball is destroyed by my dogs powered up jaw .
5 #### Dog loves this . Able to throw farther and longer .
5 #### Throw the ball 5x further . Use the chuck it glowball for great bouncing on grassy fields day or night . The best way to exercise my German shepherd .
5 #### Durable and throws a tennis ball a mile . Great tool for a hyper dog .
5 #### I noticed a lot of people at the dog park using these . Truly great for keeping dog slobber off your hands . Very easy to use . Hold onto the handle and pretend you are throwing overhand , but stop short and the ball sails out . Maybe obvious to you and I , but I have seen a few folks looking sheepish when they could n't make it work right off - My dog loves to chase and retrieve , and this keeps my arm from getting sore .
4 #### Do n't like the grips . Like it when it did n't have grips . That 's my gripe about the grips .
5 #### Our Border Collie loves this so much , she chewed the handle down before it was completely out of the box !
5 #### It is very reliable durable product . It throws the ball very far . If should lasts decades if the family dog does not chew it . I do n't let her chew it .
2 #### It was not as long as was stated in the description . I have a small dog who loves to chase a ball , this Chuckit does not allow to trow the ball too far ! I was specifically looking for a longer version for small balls , I am not sure why it is so hard to find ?
5 #### If they sold these things in 5 packs I would buy them and hand them out to friends and family . Whenever people see us using it they always make the comment that they need one . We always seem to leave one somewhere so having an extra one on hand is a must . The only thing I 've notice with the Sport model is that a standard tennis ball fits a little more snugly and can sometimes be harder to pick up if the ball is muddy . Next time we will stick with the Classic model .
3 #### I 've gone through several Chuckit 's over the years . The launchers are all good quality and usually only succumb to dog teeth if they get hold of it for a chew session . The rubber surfaced balls are also usually good quality although the one 's with holes sink .. duh . The balls that are like tennis balls are generally poor quality . We just bought the XL launcher and ball and the ball did n't last a day before it was cracked and useless . Now we have a launcher that is useless without buying a new chuckit ball since regular tennis balls do n't fit it .
5 #### This is the best toy anybody with a labrador can buy . Many hours of entertainment ( and peace and quiet afterwards ) have been had .
5 #### My favorite dog accessory ! I absolutely suck at throwing tennis balls for my dogs . I do n't know why my dogs even enjoyed playing fetch before I bought one of these Chuck - It arms . Now I can play fetch for hours without my arm getting tired , and the ball soars through the air like never before . Everyone who sees me with this thing wants one of their own after watching how awesome it is .
5 #### so much cheaper online and the best tool if you ca n't throw a ball
4 #### Got a green one . Definitely a must - have at the dog park for any dog that is remotely interested in a ball .
5 #### Love this little launcher ! If your dogs are anything like mine they will play fetch for hours on end and their ball gets disgusting ! This thing is great because you will never have to touch that slobbery ball again and it can launch really far .
5 #### I felt like superman pitching the ball most of the way across a soccer field for my puppy last week . Unfortunately , I learned he does n't fully understand the fetch thing with tennis balls so I ended up walking to get it . It is awesome though and picks up easily if you tap a slobbery ball . Works with any other tennis ball , too .
5 #### Gigantic Lab loves this toy . I like that the ball is larger than a tennis ball , and that you can buy extra balls . If you practice , you do n't even have to touch the slobbery ball . Everyone is happy .
5 #### I have the larger version for outside and recently purchased this small launcher for inside . I love it ! It 's great not having to touch gross balls and it really does launch the ball a good distance . It 's great for days when it 's too muddy outside to play fetch . Sometimes I 'll even open the door to my garage for a really far launch from the other side of the living room .
5 #### We use it all the time for the big dog , he loves to chase the ball .
5 #### Throws the ball far and works great with the bouncy chuck in balls
5 #### A must buy for doggie along with the balls .
5 #### I held off on getting one of these because I thought it was just another cheap toy that would break or not function as advertised . I was pleasantly surprised at how well the item is made . Very strong and will last a long time . Our Dog ( a GSP ) LOVES it ! Get some extra tennis balls , you 'll probably need them .
5 #### I always thought these things were kinda gimicky ... until I got a dog that loves to fetch . This is the ultimate retrieval - based dog toy .
5 #### What can I say , what ball loving dog does n't like this ? :)
4 #### Yes , it throws the ball very far , and it saves my arm , but the balls get destroyed quickly , and it can be dangerous for dogs to choke on tennis balls anyway . I 'd suggest a solid ball that ca n't collapse when chewed then re pop - out in the throat .
5 #### No offense meant :) , but my two little girls love to use this with our dog , and I do too , for it transforms my descent throws into genuine energy shedding opportunities . It 's also nice that you can pick the ball up and minimize the slobbering and dirt that are byproducts of such fun .
5 #### Our Australian Cattle dog Rocket is OBSESSED with ball catching . We have a long ball launcher at home which we use several times a day . I ordered this shorter launcher to bring it in my bag for off - leash dog park . When Rocket starts to herd other dogs or bark excessivly , I whip out the launcher and assign him the job of getting the ball . It solved all the dog behavior problem . Great product , very sturdy . Yes I do have to bend over a bit but it 's short enough to hide in my bag .
5 #### My dog is very ball driven and loves with toy . He sees this toy and gets very excited , awaiting a ball to be thrown . It helps save my arm because my dog likes to play for an hour at a time and can run as quick as a deer .
5 #### If you have a dog that likes to chase tennis balls you must get this ! No more slobbery hands , you can pick them up with this and you 'll be able to throw the balls way farther than even with the slingshots they sell . I highly recommend this !
5 #### The best thing ever for my 9 month old GSD and my weak throwing arm . I finally have a way of tiring him out . This is by far his most favorite toy ( and he has alot )
5 #### easy and effort less tosses up to ~100 yards . can sneak up on a dog 's defenses and you do n't have to touch the ball with your hands . LPT : the glow in the dark balls can be thrown further than pup or man may see .
4 #### Shattered one in the frigid and frozen VT Winter , bought another . :)
5 #### Got it so the girlfriends hand wo n't get slobbery !
5 #### Our dog gets so excited every time we get this toy out . Even the little ones can throw the ball far once they get the hang of this launcher . Works well and is very durable - no complaints !
5 #### With this simple device I have become the center of my dog 's universe ! It works as advertised and throws the ball a LONG way . Since it holds the ball fairly tightly , likely by design , it can be a bit of a trick to throw the ball shorter distances when you do n't want to grab the sloppy ball that 's been gratefully returned to you by your dog . It 's a great exercise tool for the dog and would certainly buy another , would have to buy another , if something were to happen to the current model .
5 #### This ball thrower is absolutely terrific . It will save my shoulder -- and the ball flies twice as far as I can throw one .
5 #### My dog and my arm thank you for this ! Our dog goes crazy when she even sees this coming out of the cabinet ! We used to have to throw throw throw with our arms tiring out soooo quickly . Now , she s the one who gets tired quickly ! We have purchased several to make sure we have them for travel / friends houses and they are definitely worth the investment , the ball included is also much stronger than a tennis ball so our dog does nt destroy them within an hour like normal tennis balls either !
5 #### My 35 pound Australian cattle dog loves the 2 " balls . This picks them up and launches them well . Wo n't throw as far as a 18 or 26 model for 2.5 inch balls but they do n't make those for 2 " balls .
5 #### The Chuck - It launcher comes in handy when my Lab wants to play her never - ending game of fetch and it prevents me from having to touch the drooly / dirty ball with my bare hands . 5 stars from me !
5 #### I have one already its a green one and have had it for 6 or so years it is in the picture but needed a backup for our trailer for trips . Love this but my dog loves it even more ! ! We call it Chuck . I say where is Chuck and she runs to the garage where we keep it and then the game is on . Have had several of the balls too like the orange ball that whistles real loud the best ..
5 #### I ca n't say enough good things about the chuckit launcher . Dogs at the dog park come up to me because they know I 'm going to throw it for my dog . She loves how far it goes . People that love their dogs should buy this ! ! !
5 #### My dog gets so excited when anyone has a Chuckit . We pull into a big open field and when I open the door he immediate stats running because he knows it is Chuckit Time ! This is a great way to wear a high energy dog out when you are too tired to walk your furry friend . :) If your dog does n't fetch the ball and bring it back to you I do n't recommend this product because you will be have to walk quite a ways the get the ball !
3 #### awkward throw compared to the reg tennis ball sized launcher . Does not travel as far as the standard size
5 #### I 'm very happy with this launcher ! I do wish they made one with a longer handle though ! My puppy has a ton of energy and I would love to be able to throw even farther .
4 #### This 12 inch launcher is much thinner than the other Chuck - its , but it 's great for travel . Very light weight and compact . Does n't seem to launch as far as the longer ones , and is n't as " ergonomic " so my wrist tires more easily , but for what it 's made for , it does the trick .
3 #### I love the mini balls as the regular size are too big for my dog . I just wish this launcher was longer . At only 14 " you ca n't get the throw that the larger launcher gets .
4 #### Good to throw Chuckit ! ball so dog can go after long distance . Sometimes ball sticks in launcher and does n't come out when I use it ... maybe my arm is weak .
5 #### I have the original sized 26 M , and a 13 lb shi tzu poodle mix . This size works well for both small and large dogs . When we go to the park , the big dogs love this also . I can launch the ball pretty far , and I also do n't have to touch the ball to pick it up which is great because of the dog saliva .
5 #### Works great in open fields . To easy to throw it too far in the back yard .
3 #### I wanted the smaller length launcher for regular sized " tennis " type balls . The 'S ' after the number means small sized ball . What I wanted was the 14 M where the ' M ' means medium or the 2.5 inch standard size tennis type balls . So I had to send this one back and reorder , which is a breeze with Amazon :) I read and re - read the item description and did n't see any distinction mentioned between the M and the S. Hopefully this review will clear that up for another customer .
5 #### My young Standard Poodle really enjoys this Chuckit ! . He looks forward to fetching each time I use it . It provides good exercise and teaches retrieval skills . With this size , it is easy to toss a ball 150 to 200 feet . An added advantage is that you can use a regular tennis ball with this launcher as well as many balls made for it by Chuckit ! including glow in the dark and floating ones .
4 #### You 'll need plenty of space and a strong shoulder to handle this . It 'll launch a heavy ball nearly 100yds and its hard to not throw at least 30 - 40 yards . We have great park space nearby , so its great for us .
5 #### chuck - it as we know it but a shorter version . It 's easier to carry around and fit in bags , etc .
5 #### Great , Chucks far ! Easy to use , and saves the shoulder . Had bought a different brand launcher once , and it works no where near as nice .
4 #### You can get great distance with this chuckit ! My only complaint is that the ball fell apart pretty quickly ( within an hour of opening the package ) .
5 #### I love it ! Now just train my dog to return the ball once he fetches it ! :)
5 #### Best toy ever for my dogs . I ca n't throw worth a darn and this chuckit is awesome . I am my dog 's hero at playing ball now . We love it so much that I bought an extra one in case something happens to this one . Definitely recommend this toy .
5 #### works great . Throw far without making your arm soar .
5 #### good for small areas . also good enough for the park . If your dog loves to chase balls like mine , this will be good for you .
5 #### I have the 18 inch classic launcher , the very first launcher that Chuckit made and got the smaller sport 14S for my toy and miniature poodles . For a small ball launcher it goes pretty far , much further than I 'd ever be able to throw a ball . My dogs go crazy when they see this launcher because they know it means " play time " . The sport 14S launcher works with the smaller 2 inch balls which is a great size for smaller dogs .
5 #### Man this thing is great , really launches it without very much effort , built sturdy and most importantly my dog absolutely loves it , all I got ta do is say " Chuck it " and he bounces up of the floor and knows its time to play .
3 #### My dog bit through the last regular Chuckit so I bought this for the thicker neck ( just before the scoop . ) Well , it is definitely thicker . But that makes it harder to use . I 'm not really happy with it . It works but takes more effort for me to throw the ball . The good news- so far he has n't bitten through it .
5 #### We already had the other sized chuckit , and so we knew we 'd like this one too . No more bending over to pick up a slimed gooby tennis ball . No more sore elbows and shoulders . Nothing but tired dogs ! Perfect .
5 #### Chuckits are great . Now I can tire my Lab out before she tires me out . This size also works great with tennis balls .
5 #### Had one for years until I ran over it with my tractor
5 #### It is a very good product . It is cheap but durable . It allows me to throw the ball much farther away that if I am using my arms .
3 #### I like my traditional launcher . I purchased this one as the original is aging . This one 's handle tapers significantly at the base , while the original expanded . The taper makes this one more difficult to control , and reduces my range . Others may find advantages to the design , but I do n't . My use is launching as far as I can on the beach for my speeding Brittany to catch on the bounce and return . I need to make long straight shots in sometimes windy conditions , avoiding people and some of the ocean . This one stays home . The old , worn one makes every trip to the beach .
5 #### I do n't own this , but I used it for the first time yesterday with my 60 pound , 1.5 year old Chesapeake Lab Mix . It has to be the greatest toy ever . Not only do I not have to pick up slobbery tennis balls anymore , but I 'm not throwing my arm out either trying to throw it far enough for her to actually get some exercise . I 'm considering purchasing one just so I can save my arm in the future and also because I ca n't throw that far .
5 #### Love these Chuckit 's . If you got a dog that loves to play ball these are a must have !
5 #### Oh yeah this is the only way I can get the ball out into the lake where my dog likes it . Unbelievable distance . Highly highly recommend this . Forget the special dog tennis balls , go get some regular tennis balls though .
5 #### My dog and the other greedy pushy dogs at the park love this . I 'm no ball player so when I throw a ball for those furry moochers it does n't go far then they give me those sad eyes so I got this little pistol . Ha , I rule those poop monsters now . I will say if you use this a lot in one day , your arm is gon na flipping hate you the next day ( and the day after that as well ) but the dogs will love you .
2 #### There is a learning curve on using this . I have a 14 " and this is totally different . There is a lot more tool to stabilize and the swing is different . I have n't decided whether I like it or not .
4 #### Dogs love it . I did n't realize that the ball was so big but my lab does n't mind at all . So much nicer than touching a slobber cover ball !
5 #### Great product for throwing Chuck it and regular tennis balls .
3 #### We tried this toy in our backyard with our two corgis . They just watched us fling the ball and did nothing . It was quite humorous ! We just play normal " fetch " with them like before and would not buy this toy for our dogs again . It probably works better with other breeds .
5 #### Standard poodle loves this . Careful that ball does not bounce completely away !
5 #### If you 're like me you have a bum shoulder from years of baseball . After taking some time to adjust to throwing with the ChuckIt , I am now able to throw balls three times further than without . I accidentally left it somewhere for a few days and my ball throwing went from herculean to meager , and my shoulder ached constantly . Money well spent . This launcher works with standard tennis balls .
5 #### We just tried it with our 40 pound dog at the beach and she LOVED it . Best dog toy we have purchased . It can use regular tennis balls ; we ordered the chuck - it balls , but that was not necessary . I am a poor thrower so this gives extra punch and sends the ball flying .
5 #### Helps me throw much farther and Teddy loves racing after the ball . He gets excited when he sees me pick this up because he loves chasing balls and I love that it 's interactive play . I would also recommend getting the whistle ball in addition to the regular balls ( I think Chuckit makes one , but I got the Planet Dog one , which does fit in the Chuckit ) ; I do n't know if it makes a difference to Teddy , but it amuses me . I would definitely recommend this item and would buy again if needed .
3 #### I get that the balls that come with it are smaller , but why is the handle for the thrower so short ? ? Why not just make the ball catcher part smaller ? It kind of sucks to have to basically bend to the floor to get it anyways .
5 #### A win win for the big dogs who love to play ball
5 #### Great toy ! I bought this so I could the ball to travel farther when playing fetch . Ever since the first use my dog has been addicted . She knows which tennis ball ( of the 5 ) is the chuckit ball and carries it everywhere and even drops it on me when I 'm not paying attention to her . She would run herself sick if I do n't stop playing when I see she 's tired . Wanna ' up ' the fun ? Buy a chuckit max glow ball and play at night ! My dog loves this one as well . And it 's fun to watch a glowing orb bob around since trying to see a chocolate lab in pitch black dark is kids hard .
5 #### I have 3 chuckits , two of the same 26 M in different colors and one of the smaller size . I have had these for YEARS and they are still going strong . My 7 year old golden retriever is obsessed with catching tennis balls , and the chuckit makes is so much more fun for her ( as I can not throw very far ) . Whenever I get the chuckit out as we get ready for a walk she goes crazy jumping up and down and pawing at the end that holds the tennis ball . It is by far the best dog accessory I own , I ca n't imagine not having one ! If your dog loves fetch , do n't hesitate , this thing is amazing !
5 #### i m very pleased with this chuckit . I own several others and this short one is good to keep in the car to always have one around . if you have a fetch crazy dog , you 'll understand why i 'd want that .
5 #### My four legged nephew introduced me to the Chuckit . What an awesome product . Got one for our OCD Doberman and not only does he love it , but we love it even more .... save yourself from doggie slobber and purchase this product ... you'll never throw a ball with your hand again ! !
5 #### Dogs go nuts when I bring this out . Its awesome for chucking those balls far enough to tire your dog out before your arm . And you do n't have to pick up slobbery balls !
5 #### No more dirty , slobbery hands ! Plus it throws better than I could ever throw !
3 #### Great for small dogs and easy to travel with . The size of the stick is a little shorter than I would have liked for reaching for the ball another 6 inches would have been great . The size of the ball is great for small dogs , however I wish the ball was a little more durable within 2 days the ball was broken . I thought it would be more durable like a tennis ball but it is not
5 #### Does the job to launch tennis balls , my puppy loved it .
5 #### this product works great for a 10 lb dog that loves to fetch balls . Easy to pick up the balls with the scoop , and this saves your arm from getting sore .
5 #### Showed up fast and dog loves it . Saves my arm as the lab can go all day chasing the ball .
5 #### Works great , and I need it because I ca n't throw well enough to give my dog a good run . She is much happier with my purchase .
3 #### to long i should have ordered the shorter version ,
5 #### Very long but great . Too long for my yard which is 70x70 . My dogs kinda lazy but atleast this gets him moving !
5 #### Great to pick up balls avoiding the slobber / sand build up and gives you more distance if you are not a ball thrower .
5 #### I can throw much farther with this thing . I got the 25 M and am quite happy with it .
4 #### Works well . Bought the Classic 26 M and works well but I have to hold it with two hands when throwing because the ball would n't release with me holding by just one hand . The grip was too strong , so by having two hands , it stops the motion abruptly , which cause the ball to fling out of the holder . But I ca n't complain . It does what it should do .. :) Maybe I 'm just lazy by wanting to only use one hand to do the work . My dog loves playing fetch !
5 #### I love this smaller size chuckit because I can carry it with me on my walks to the dog park . It fits in my bag , unlike the longer ones . While perhaps it ca n't throw as far as the longer ones , I find that it is plenty far for an urban dog park .
5 #### I have both the large and the med Chuckit , both work great , and easy on the arm .
4 #### Built for labradors and the people who love them . Woof .
5 #### My lab loves this . When I get it out and my Lab sees it he goes crazy . It really goes a long way and arm does n't get tired
5 #### We are 50 - 60 years old and this is wonderful ! We have a Border Collie that needs the ball thrown farther than we could possibly throw without . We can throw it 20 - 40 yards - use it everyday ! ! ! Does not hurt your arm when throwing - major plus !
5 #### Our dogs love it , and we love it more ... who wants to pick up a slobbery ball ? Not us ! ! :D
5 #### My Boston adores a game of fetch . If you buy this , make certain to also get the 3 - pack of extra balls . The ball that comes with this launcher is similar to a tennis ball . It was destroyed very quickly . The 3 - pack of rubber balls are much more durable . I like this launcher for many reasons : 1 ) I do n't have to touch the slimy balls 2 ) You do n't have to bend down to retrieve the ball 3 ) the ball goes farther when tossed with this launcher 4 ) it can be dicey trying to grab the ball away from an excited dog . Training tip : When you 're teaching your dog to fetch , take two toys / balls . They always seem to want what they do n't have , and it makes it easier to get them to drop the toy .
5 #### The dog approves ! The ball this came with did n't last very long , but luckily it works with regular tennis balls .
3 #### Positive is that you do n't have to reach down much to pick up a ball . It is really hard on the wrist because of the leverage on your wrist , especially with carpal tunnel . Does n't throw much farther then the 18 " version
5 #### Perfect size for carry / on the go . Nice light feel on the wrist . I only recommend the 12 M or the 18 M , any longer then 18 " and it is just too hard on the wrist , especially with carpal tunnel . Perfect fit for kids . Only down side is that you have to reach down more to get the ball . Throws about pass half the distance as the 25M.
2 #### Cracked within the 10th time of using it . Not sure why . We used these launchers regularly .
5 #### Always a staple for any fun dog play session .
5 #### The best size very easy to use . I have all three and this is my favorite
5 #### Product is great ! Exactly as described ! Great quality ! Great price ! Arrived quickly !
5 #### Exactly what it says it is . Simply a must have for anyone with a retriever .
4 #### I have a Yorkie who thinks she 's a Lab ( I have one of those too ! ) I have a the regular Chuckit for Lillie and the small one for Josie , the Yorkie and Ball Tyrant . The Chuckits have saved my arm as I spend close to 2 hours a day outside with my fur babies . The only improvement I would like to see would be rubber grips on the handles as if they get wet , they get slippery . Now , I just keep paper towels with me and wrap one of two around the handles . If you have dogs who are ball - crazy and you do n't want to end up having surgery for a torn rotator cuff , these are essential !
5 #### This little device has saved a lot of strain on my arm and shoulder ! My little retriever mix takes her name to heart and will retrieve a ball until she ca n't take another step . It 's much easier for me to play with her using the Chuckit ! Launcher . And I do n't have to pick up a soggy ball with my bare hand .
5 #### Since the ball is the same size as a tennis ball it can be replaced easily without paying the premium for a Chuckit ball .
5 #### Love this . The ball goes at least twice as far as I can throw it and our little pooch goes tearing after it . Great exercise for him . Also love that I never have to touch the slimy ball .
5 #### Fantastic throwing device ! I received this 26 M Chuckit in great condition and on time . The first time I used it I almost threw the ball over the trees into the horse pasture next door . It is easy to throw the tennis ball close to 75 yards . This thing really launches the ball with very little effort . Great for these light weight tennis balls which always seem to bother my elbow when I throw them . I may actually order the shorter version to reduce overthrown balls . Works great to pick the ball up also . The ball snaps right into place just as advertised .
5 #### Great for a large back yard this thing will make a ball fly far .
5 #### Dog loves it . I like it because my lab has to run further to catch ball and it tires him out quicker
5 #### I wil never throw a ball again . These are the best ! Whoever created theseapplause goes to you ! My dog goes crazy when he sees me pick this up . I ca n't throw very far to begin with but this is just perfect .
5 #### My German Sheperd LOVES this ! ! He is crazy about playing ball and the Chuck it ! makes me happy to play . No more slobbery balls to throw . Your dog drops the ball at your feet ( hopefully ) and all you need to do is slap the Chuck It on the ball and toss again ! Care must be taken if using in a fenced enclosure -- the ball can travel quite a distance when " chucked " . I have gone into neighbors yards several times to retrieve an overthrown ball . This is a great toy for man and beast ! ! The rubber balls that are used with the Chuck It are sturdy and have stood up to the chomping of my dog 's jaws -- which have reduced other balls to rubble . The white ball actually does glow in the dark if you have a dog who is in to night time play .
5 #### Makes it so much easier to fling that ball a long ways . No arm pain ! ! Me & dogs love it .
5 #### My Marley loves to go after the balls from Chuckit launcher and never gets tired of doing it ... definitely a Golden Retriever .
5 #### My dog can chase a ball for hours , but unfortunately the family does n't last that long . I was originally skeptical about this , but I had seen someone at the park with one and thought I would give it a try . It does take a few times to figure out the ideal launch , but after that this works like a charm . My young children are able to join in the fun now too . The added bonus is how the launcher will retrieve the slimy ball without my having to touch it .
5 #### Love it . Ca n't throw a tennis ball without it . Took a few times to figure out how to launch but it 's great to get your dog to run far . Great exerciser . The balls that come with it are great too . Bright and easy to launch
5 #### My dog loves ChuckIts , and this is no exception . The shorter length works best in smaller yards and indoors . If used indoors , I recommend using a softer ball to prevent property damage . I use this with the rubber ChuckIt , rather than the conventional tennis ball .
5 #### What can I say , this is the famous chuckit for a reason . We love it and it lives up to all it 's claimed to be .
5 #### I like the product but I think it would work better with a slightly longer handle . It works but there is a learning curve on where to stop the snaping of the arm and wrist .
5 #### Boy does thing thing fling a ball . I do n't have much of a pitching arm and my Rottweiler pup needs more exercise then she can got from my short distance throws . This Chuck It launcher really helps tire her out . I really love that I can pick up the ball without having to touch it too , nothing grosser then a slobbery tennis ball , eww . If your dog loves chasing a ball , get one of these !
5 #### This is a great toy for my labrador retriever . It slings it the perfect distance ; I think the larger one must be for people with a REALLY big area !
5 #### I bought one of these and ended up using it for the neighbor dogs more than my own because of the fact that he would not bring it back to me to throw again . Recently , at the age of 2 he has now realized the point of fetch and loves how far I can throw the ball with this . He plays until he can barely catch his breath , so I have stop and give him breaks , otherwise he would just keep going . Also keeps the slober off you and on the ball where it belongs .
4 #### My dog destroyed the included ball within a span of a few months . It was split open and then jest sort of flattened . The plastic launcher though is excellent ! It is very nice not having to pick up the slobbery ball with my hands . This also really gets the ball launched too . I really like it . I know Chuckit sells more solid balls , but it does n't come with this toy .
5 #### Works well , you can throw much farther without tiring you arm . They do wear out after a while , the plastic gets flexible .
3 #### Make sure you get medium if you want to use Tennis balls . I prefer the longer handle one , which I use just about every day . The smaller handle one is around if I ca n't find the other one .
5 #### I have the shorter version too . This length of handle and M size is perfect for tossing and picking up Chuckit balls AS WELL AS regular ole tennis balls . We use this one just about every day .
5 #### I 've been told I ' throw a ball like a girl . ' It must be true , because when I throw a ball it does n't go very far ( by the way I 'm a woman , not a man ) . I ca n't throw very far with this launcher , either , but I know they work well because I watch my neighbor use his Chuck It Ball Launcher for his retriever - type dog and he can the ball to go REALLY far . I 'm up to about 30 ' myself with the Chuckit , which I admit is n't very far . But then again , my dog does n't really ' retrieve ' balls anyway , she just runs around with them in her mouth until I go and take the ball from her , so it 's just as well . But whatever , this launcher makes my ball - throwing time with my dog more fun .
5 #### What more can you say , this launch is amazing for the price and durable . The Chuckit ! allows you to effortlessly throw a ball easily 75 yards or more with minimal effort . This is great for those dogs who love to run far to retrieve and humans who do n't have a Nolan Ryan throwing arm .
5 #### Normal sized tennis balls fit nicely in this dog toy . Our Border Collie has boundless energy and this thing tosses the ball quite a ways and gives him a good run . Love it !
5 #### Great toy but I ordered the large by mistake . I will have to order a small one . I have given the large one to my daughter who has two labs .
4 #### Product is exactly as described , but I wish I had purchased the one with a handle one size longer . When seated on a bench , if the dog brings back the ball and drops it as much as one foot away , I ca n't reach it without practically falling out of my seat . But as I 'm too lazy to actually stand up and pick it up , the dog is slowly learning to drop the ball closer .
5 #### I love these so does my Dog ! Lost my first one then bought a cheap knockoff lasted less then a week so went back to this very good product .
5 #### Wears the dog out 3x faster . The dog is a husky so of course he is full of energy to the point of where I need to throw this ball a billion times but now I just need to throw it a few million times .
5 #### My dogs love this toy and I love the fact it launches far without me over stressing my shoulder which is important .
5 #### my dog loves this thing . i do n't have to touch the gross ball and i can throw it really far for him
5 #### My German Shepherd loves playing fetch . I hate picking up the gross , saliva soaked ball so this launcher is perfect for us . And it throws the ball really far compared to how far I can throw it . I would definitely buy another one .
5 #### I 'm using this with the Kong squeaky tennis balls , although it seems to work with just about any of the balls my dog brings me at the park . I have a bad shoulder , so I was hoping this would allow me to throw the ball without pain . No luck there , but what it DOES allow me to do is to throw the ball a lot farther , and to pick it up off the ground more easily . I 've gone from being only barely able to play with my dog to being the ' fun mommy ' at the dog park . It 's really improved my relationship with my dog , and I 'm very grateful for that . It 's also pretty durable : I 've dropped it several times and even dropped things onto it , and it still works perfectly . Definitely worth the price .
5 #### Orange stick . Lola loves the rubber ball , much preferred over the tennis ball though its the same size . Really makes it easy for these old bones to toss long throws .
5 #### This works really well ! Sadly , my dog has no interest in playing fetch ... but we 're working on it with him . This holds the ball tight , making it so you can shove the ball in and take it to wherever you 're playing the game without much worry , and it throws it pretty far ! Would recommend , but would suggest teaching your dog to fetch first .
4 #### Great toy to excersise your dog . She would play hours if my arm did n't get tired of throwing for her
5 #### Perfect for playing fetch with my dog . I do n't have to bend my back to pick up the balls after my dog retrieves it . It is the authentic quality .
5 #### I love this Chuckit ! , and appreciate that I 'm able to throw the ball a LONG distance . More importantly , my ADHD puppy loves this gadget !
5 #### A very long , cold winter was hard on me and my lab puppy . She wanted to run around and burn energy in the snow for hours at a time and I would freeze and get cold . I bought this in early March and wish I had it all along . She runs and chases the ball . I would have tired her out playing fetch much faster than I did just throwing the ball or frisbee to her in the snow . This is so easy to use and really a natural throwing motion but it goes SO much farther with very little effort . I can also control where it goes and avoid the trees in our yard . The best toy ! Since we bought this one , we also bought the larger version and we think that it goes just as far using the small one as it does the large one . The large one has a higher arch so it stays in the air longer , but it comes down about the same spot . The large one also feels a lot less natural . I love this little toy and my dog does too ! We took it with us to the dog park and another dog saw the toy and was so excited because they have one at home too . We we played fetch with him too . :)
4 #### I started with the smaller chuckit and my dog fell in love with that toy ! We took it to the dog park and another dog ran up to us so excited b / c he loves playing fetch too and recognized the toy . We have a very large yard and the small one let us throw it about 3/4 of the way . I wanted to run my lab puppy even more so I bought this one and it is probably because I started with the smaller one , but I feel like it is awkward to use the bigger one and I can still only throw it 3/4 of the way down our yard . It flies a lot higher and gives my dog more time to run down to where it will land before it bounces , but I prefer the small version of this toy . But , it works as intended and my dog does n't care which one I use , she loves the game .
5 #### My dog loves this and so do I ! It allows you to throw the ball super far but my favorite thing is that I no longer have to touch the ball after it gets all slobbery . This one holds a standard size tennis ball .
3 #### I purchased a Chuckit ! back in 2007 from the store . The basic red model . This one seems cheaper , lighter weight and more flimsywhen you use your hand to flick the ball it feels much less in control .
5 #### I ca n't believe every dog owner is n't handed one of these with their 1st leash ! ! ! Goodbye slobber , goodbye getting up to grab the ball that rolls just out of reach , and the Sport 25 M uses regular tennis balls ( because the ball that is included did n't last more than a day with my dog ) . I can just sit on a lawn chair , not having to bend over or get up at all , just wait for the ball to be dropped on the ground , roll where it may , I whack it on the end of the Chuckit , it fits snugly in there , I toss it , & drink my coffee ... no grass & dirt & slobber on me at all ! ! ! Every dog owner needs this !
5 #### I got the one in the photo , what an awesome price for this ! Its not a knock off , its the real chuck it ! My pups love it .
5 #### I have 2 Australian Cattle Dogs who love to have us throw this for them . I have have trouble throwing a ball and picking it up over and over and over again . The ChuckIt ! Ball Launcher solves both those problems . It 's so easy to toss the ball a long distance and pick it up and repeat . One of my dogs LOVES this toy . He will chase the ball & bring it back to me until he drops the ball , lies down on top of it and rests until he 's ready to go again . I loved this Chuckit ! Ball Launcher so much that I recently purchased a Chuckit ! 24 " . It uses the same size Medium ball and it can really send the ball flying a long distance . All the Chuckit ! Ball Launchers come with Fabric Tennis Ball . Do yourself a favor - order a pack of the Medium size Fetch or Rebounce balls made of rubber . The tennis ball lasts about 15 minutes of play before the ball is snapped in 2 and the fabric is coming off .
4 #### This is great ! I no longer have sticky , drippy , smelly dog spit on my hands . The Chuckit launcher provides a way to play with my dog without having to touch the ball with my hands . Fits a standard tennis ball . I 've been using it almost daily for about a month now and the only negative thing I have to say is that over time , the long handle tends to curve more as a result of pressing the " hand " onto the tennis balls to pick them up . Otherwise , this is probably one of the best investments I 've made for my dog .
5 #### Love these ! On our fourth one . Dog has chewed the others up ... blame the humans for leaving them where the puppy can get them . They DO save your arm though and are easy to use . Chucks a ball nice and far ... hours of entertainment for our lab puppy !
5 #### My dog LIVES for this toy . He will leap around just on the walk to the park knowing that toy is coming along . Great energy burner
5 #### I 'm not the strongest thrower in the world , but with this I can really send a ball flying for my dogs to chase . This is a lot of fun , and our German Shepherd in particular practically does backflips when he sees me grab the Chuckit . We use this every day and have a ton of fun with it .
4 #### We were having a grand time with this toy , and my dog enjoyed running the extra distance . That was until I handed it over to my boyfriend who " Chucked it " as hard as he could and our tennis ball was lost forever ... Ok , so that 's not really a problem since you can put whatever kind of tennis ball you want in there , but buyer beware : You must understand physics to avoid losing your dog 's favorite tennis ball or possibly chucking a ball into a passing car . It really depends on where you live .
5 #### I have gotten products like this before and they were terrible . This one actually picks up the balls and man can you launch those balls . My dog loves it
5 #### This is an awesome product . Our dog gets more exercise now that we can throw the ball twice as far , plus we 're not having to touch the gross ball after it 's rolled through the mud and water .
4 #### Convenient size , I can sip in my jacket collar to free my hands for his collar , and my walking stick .
4 #### We 've added the 12 M launcher to our collection ( also have the 26 M & three 18 M launchers ) . My hubby likes the 12 M basically for the size ( fits very nicely in the utility pocket of his carpenter pants ) . No matter what size , these launchers are a lifesaver for the person with a sore shoulder , etc .
3 #### Works great , but so disappointing to find one in the Dollar store a week after buying this one . So I bought that one too and am saving this expensive one for when the cheap one breaks ... a lot of use and still going great . Feel a bit foolish for spending so much here .
5 #### I love this launcher ! My shoulders are not aching any longer and my rambunctious lab gets a lot of exercise since I manage to throw his ball very far . I should have bought this product earlier , I recommend it without any reservation . It is solid , looks good and delivers !
5 #### I 've seen something like this on the beaches of SC when folks with their dogs play together . We have a very over active puppy who needs to be worn out 3x a day . I can chuck the tennis ball about 50yds 10 times so my pup is worn out . A tired pup is a happy pup . The product is strong and will last , ca n't ask for more than that .
5 #### My dog is thrilled that I got this toy for him . Now it 's just my job to make sure he does n't run himself ragged !
5 #### This is the second " Chuckit Classic " I have purchased because it is such a good buy ! I have a pit bull and he now thinks I 'm Tom Brady !
4 #### The only thing I did n't like is the ball that came with it . We upgraded and got the ultra balls and are much happier and the dog ca n't destroy them as fast .
5 #### My dog loves this toy and it 's so much easier for me to throw her tennis balls now ! Also , it 's a much bigger toy ( handle ) then I expected ! Great buy !
3 #### I love the compactness of these units for packing especially for longer trips but in the end the poor distance limits will make me go back to buying the next size up and will live with the longer size . It will however be very useful say for people with backyards who do not want to be breaking a lot of their neighbors windows and most especially for those in the world who may be a bit more on the frail side physically . I would recommend it to a friend BUT with those limitations explained first . Scott
5 #### I bought this for my very enthusiastic lab who was OBSESSED with chasing balls . She LIVED to chase a ball . This one was more economical , I did n't have to pay shipping due to Amazon Prime and it was quick delivery . Unfortunately , Maggie passed away at the age of 3 in her prime . She passed due to complications delivering puppies . The breeder offered me another dog . We will be going to get her on Saturday . She will be enjoying it in Maggie 's memory . Our new dog wo n't replace Maggie but she 'll fill a hole . God Bless you Maggie !
5 #### This is one of my dogs favorite toys . She loves to chase balls . I would advise buying extra balls . I have difficulty bending over and I make her drop the ball she just chased before I throw another . I would have no problem buying this again . It is great for people with mobility problems who still want to play with their dog .
5 #### I have a Labrador that insists on playing Chuckit ! daily . We are still using the first one we purchased years ago . I bought this smaller one for my child to have a child sized version . Works as well as the full size Chuckit .
5 #### The dog loves it . Easy to use and easy to throw the ball . The Chuckit can give your dog good exercise . My dogs loves it and he loves to chase and bring back the ball . Good quality .
5 #### This is a cool tool ! It might take you a few minutes to get the hang of it , but once you do , you will be slinging tennis balls like a pro ! :-) This model ( 26L ) works well with tennis balls . They are a little smaller than the ball that comes with this launcher , but they work fine .
5 #### Needed something to launch the ball a good distance for my shepherd , this does the trick ( had to learn to send it in the right direction but that went quickly ) . And my dog has learned to put the ball in the cup so I do n't have to wrestle him for it or handle a slimy ball too much , nice bonus .
5 #### How did I ever live with my labrador retriever before the Chuckit ! ? ? ? This thing is awesome . No more touching slobbery , nasty balls and I can launch the ball further than I could ever throw . My lab is constantly wanting to play fetch -- she know where I keep the Chuckit ! now and will pester me to get it out anytime we go outside . This is a must have if your dog loves fetch . The only down side is that the balls seem to break quickly for strong chewers -- she chomps it on the way back . I recommend purchasing a large Ultimate ball also and those are a bit more indestructable .
5 #### I love this ! I can throw the ball a good distance which I was unable to do before . I do n't have to worry about injuring my shoulder - it works great ! I do love the glow in the dark ball I ordered with it .
3 #### It takes a bit to get the hang of using this but once you do it does work . The glo ball you can get to go with it was not so durable .
5 #### I am so glad I got this ! I 'm not a very good throwing artiste for my puppy and she likes to runand runand run . Honestly , she could do it all day . The thing that made me get this was after one weekend , I got a pretty sore shoulder and felt like I just was n't getting far enough runs in for my dog . After this - and it is even the short one - she 's got a really great run in but not too far to lose us . Very highly recommended .
5 #### Have been using a size smaller and my dog is wearing me out . Moved to this larger size so that I can throw the ball farther . Very nice .
5 #### Loved this product . It was so easy to use my 3 year old could use it . I ca n't throw very far and this added more distance for my dog to run .
5 #### If you have a LAB , this is a must ! We had our last one for over 5 years before the head broke off . This makes playing ball with the lab fun and easy .
5 #### I have a Labrador Retriever that LIVES to retrieve . If I did n't have this Chuck It I would never be able to use up his energy . My dog sprints about 100 meters a time on his retrieves because of the Chuck It . He has built up his endurance and can go for close to an hour everyday now . When we started it was 15 minutes every third day . I have the Chuck It glow in the dark ball and agility ball and both are amazing products . The stand up to heavy chewing and allow us to play even when the sun goes down .
5 #### The inventor of the chuck it is amazing - this is a great product and the craftsmanship is well designed . I love how I do n't need to touch a slobbery tennis ball , it picks it up perfectly . Great product for a dog that loves to play catch for hours .
5 #### My German Shepherd loves this , by far his favorite toy . It is ideal for large breed dogs , since there is the potential choke hazard with the medium sized Chuckit , especially if the ball is wet from damp conditions .
5 #### Before I bought the Chuckit , my 50 + shoulder had a hard time throwing the ball very far . This toy really enables me to fling it so much farther than I imagined possible . And , it keeps the dog slobber off my hands too .
5 #### As a gay man who has been cursed with the sterotypical inability to throw a ball , this is a true turning point for play fetch with my dog . We both love it ! ( Just hang in there like the package says , it takes about 30 throws to get down right . )
3 #### First dog toy I bought and did not realize it was the small size . It does n't throw as far . You want this only for a little dog . For regular dogs or any size of dogs that run a lot , buy the normal size one .
5 #### Easy to use etc etc . Recommend you buy the plastic balls that do n't come with this launcher . Much cleaner and more durable .
5 #### It 's a good toy , the dog loves having the ball go so far , and we like it because we do n't throw out our rotator cuffs !
5 #### LAUNCH ! ! ! man this chuckit fires em off good .. maybe on a good chuck the ball will go 70 yards .. my labs are in love with it ! ! !
4 #### It launches the ball like no other ... my dog loves it ! I also enjoy the fact that I do n't need to touch his slobbery ball , I just use the launcher to pick it up and go again ! Great for hyper dogs !
4 #### upgraded to the pro . the Pro 25 m was cheper and has a soft grip and more flex . this one is good , but not as good .
4 #### Its great , but have to be careful how the ball is flung . The dogs only have a 150 ft radius from the house , so easy to put the ball out of their area . ( I own 10 acres but can not find a better wireless fence . ) Had a smaller one in the city , and the ball went into the back yard of the neighbors 5 housed down .
5 #### now i can throw the ball far without hurting my arm ! my husband loves it too . also we do n't have t touch the gross bals at dog park !
4 #### With this , I can really get good distance on our fetch game . My dog is pretty fit and throwing short distances gets tiring for my arm because the dog brings the ball back so quickly . This gives my arm a break and the dog a longer run . Love it !
5 #### I have the bigger version of the Chuckit but the smaller version is easier to carry around . Keeps your hands away from slobber . I also use the end of the handler to wiggle the ball away from my dogs mouth .
5 #### I am not able to throw a ball very far and this product is wonderful . It is surprisingly sturdy and I am very please with it . Well worth the money .
5 #### We use this launcher at a field next to our apartment complex . Our Pembroke Welsh Corgi has a lot of energy and this really helps us throw the tennis ball multiple times really far without throwing out our arms in the process . With minimal effort , you can throw a ball 15 ft or so . With a good amount of effort , it will fly as far as 50 ft easily . We also like that we can pick up the tennis ball with this Chuckit without having to bend over , as well as getting our fingers all slobbered up . I highly recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog that loves to play fetch and has the space to really run .
5 #### These are fabulous . They pick up the ball so easily that kids can use them . The 12 m can throw the ball about 15 - 20 feet so it is fine for most yards .
5 #### We have three corgis and now three chuck its . Those little guys go crazy now , when we pick it up , since they love retrieving so much . Excellent product for my purposes .
4 #### I love this small Chuckit launcher . I have a larger one we use in the yard , but we like to take the dogs to the lake and the Weimaraner loves nothing more than to retrieve balls thrown in the water , especially if he has to swim to get them . I throw like a girl , for the obvious reasons , and the ball did n't go nearly as far as Roscoe would like . Once I got this little gem I can throw the ball way out there . The reward is a tired / happy dog . This one is nice and small and is easy to bring on a walk . It holds standard size tennis balls , so you do n't need to buy a special size or anything .
5 #### Our dog loves to play fetch so a chuck it is great . It allows for long throws and easy pick ups . It fits regular tennis size balls . We received the green which is easy to find in a pile of pet stuff . It 's made of hard yet flexible plastic that does n't crack when used when frozen We have used one of these for years . We only replaced it because our dog slightly chewed up the ball end of the last one . It still works but I wanted a ' clean ' one .
5 #### I have a crazy lab mix that is obsessed with tennis balls . We had a smaller version of the Chuckit , which worked great until we lost it . We recently replaced it with a larger version and BOY can this one really launch my balls ! ! Its great cuz now that she 's gotten older she 's faster at chasing them down . I really like how it is sized for tennis balls too because my balls are constantly getting destroyed . But , ahh , such is life ...
3 #### My dog was totally uninterested in the Chuckit balls , so this did not get used a lot . He does like to fetch his squeaky balls and his crunchy balls , but something about the Chuckit balls ( I had 4 different kinds ) left him bored . When I did use it , I could not get the balls to fly far like I 've seen others . I 'm guessing it was me , not the Launcher . My dog did , ultimately , like the Chuckit Launcher . One day , when I was n't looking , he chewed it up . It is now one of his favorite chew toys . Given how long it is lasting , it was n't such a bad deal .
5 #### I have a large Airedale terrier which is a dog with a very high energy level that requires more exercise than most dogs . The Chuckit is the best invention ever because with this I can throw the ball so much further than I could without it . My dog loves this toy so much and I am able to wear him out on a walk ( which is the goal ) . I would recommend this product and I would buy this product again !
4 #### Durable and well made , this launcher is great ! Comes with a tennis ball so you 're all set to go . If I could make one change I would have bought a larger one . I did n't pay attention to the size and was surprised when it came that it was so small . I 'd recommend this product to anyone !
5 #### Bought some of these to use with the larger ball and the shelter dogs love to chase balls ! ! These make it a lot easier to play for extended periods of time without getting a sore arm . Also , they are long which makes retrieving a ball from the ground much easier .
5 #### Saves a lot of wear and tear on throwing and retrieving the ball from the ground . ( Most shelter dogs have n't learned ' fetch and leave it ' , LOL ! !
5 #### Small , useful , fun , easy ... it is the size I would recommend . You do n't need to throw the ball that far so this is perfect !
4 #### SAVES A LOT OF WEAR AND TEAR ON YOUR ARM , PLUS GIVES YOUR PUP A GOOD WORK OUT . THE ONLY THING IT 'S NOT NEARLY AS ' STURDY ' AS THE OLD ONE I HAD , A BIT MORE DELICATE .
5 #### I can throw my dog 's ball way farther using this , wearing her out way faster , and I never have to pick up a gross slobbery ball . What more could you want . Get one .
4 #### This is a great accessory for any dog family . Just stock up on tennis balls cause this think chucks them far . What s nice is you can use anykind of tennis ball not just the chuck it brand ones .
5 #### I do not know what I had to do to wear out my pit mix before I found the chuckit . This is a great product and truly gives your dog a good exercise !
1 #### I have arthritis so I thought this might help me throw the ball for our ball crazy lab . Do n't recommend this one period . its too long if you actually need a thrower and length made it awkward to handle and reload . If you have to use a thrower recommend shorter one . This says classic but it is longer than the ones I have seen at 3 pet stores .
5 #### great for that tired arm , gives plenty of exercise and the pups love it , well made and seems durable , should provide many years of play
5 #### My french bulldog loves this . It 's the perfect size for little guys who don't / can't run to far . I do think the purchase of the rubber chuckit balls are a must too !
5 #### I have nothing but great things to say about Chuckit in general . It works great for throwing balls , and using the launcher means I do n't have to touch that disgusting ball . Of all of the Chuckits I prefer this size . With the larger Chuckits it seems like I can throw the ball a mile , at which point my dog looks at me and says , " you go get it . " I can better control the distance I throw with this size , and , of course , with the smaller size it stores much more easily .
5 #### My Dobie loves this toy and so does my arm ! Easy to use and takes regular tennis balls too . Keeps my dog busy for quiet a while !
4 #### Good for easy long throws . My high drive Malinois needs the exercise . I use&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Chuckit - Medium - Max - Glow - Ball-2 - 5 - Inch-1 - Pack / dp / B001B4TV2W / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Chuckit ! Medium Max Glow Ball 2.5 - Inch , 1 - Pack</a>&nbsp;which not only hold their glow in the dark , but are indestructible " just right " for holding and chewing . Cool and fun&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Planet - Dog - Orbee - Tuff - Whistle - Ball - Dog - Toy / dp / B003WJRGA8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Planet Dog Orbee - Tuff Whistle Ball Dog Toy</a>&nbsp;works too , but not for chewing . The colored " tennis " balls are made of toxic materials ( which is ingested ) and the fur grinds down teeth .
2 #### Awkward to use for petite women . It 's only good use is retrieving the ball from the ground even then most basic tennis balls have a hard time fitting in the grip . The balls normally get stuck inside the thing and I have to wiggle it out a little before slinging it . Once I sling it the ball does not really go that far and looks ridiculous . I would n't purchase another toy like this .
5 #### sure , i like to strengthen my arm like a pro pitcher but this just makes things so much easier(and cleaner ) ! ! this contraption throws the ball so much farther than I can ! Which means my doggie can run much farther too ! Which means she gets tired faster ! and goes to sleep sooner ! ! this is the best thing ever created ! ! ! ! and when she sees me pick it up(i mean i could just be moving it out of the way ) she goes insane ! ! it also doubles as a water bowl . one day we were outside playing fetch and it was pretty hot . I had my camelbak on but i did n't bring her water bottle . I put the water from my camelbak into the hollow in the launcher and she just drank the water out of that . pretty nifty , eh ?
5 #### We LOVE our Chuckit ! We make sure to always have a few around .. we have broken a few by banging them on the deck or by using them in BITTER ( below 0 ) temperature .. but for us they are a MUST HAVE when playing with our dogs
5 #### these are the greatest ball throwers we have found .. we think the 18 inch one handles the best for distance and height !
4 #### Doggie gives it only 4 stars as it is not automatic ... it requires a human and her human is a little lazy .
5 #### This is great - especially for big dogs . If you have should issues or limited mobility , this will allow you to play with your furry friends .
3 #### The launcher is too long . The shorter one is much easier to use and will throw almost just as far . The product itself is what they say it is , I just do not find it as easy to throw with .
5 #### I actually bought this to toss fly balls to my son . My arm is just not able to throw the long high ones anymore . This works great . I can toss towering pop flys and have him run back to the fence for them . Fit 's a regulation hardball .
5 #### These are the absolute greatest . Launcher will last forever if your dog does n't eat it . The set comes with the tennis - type ball . My dog chews the cover off the ball pretty quickly but he is very perseverant . Replace with the Ultra Ball . I would n't like to see the dog that can destroy one of those .
5 #### We love this product . I can not throw worth beans so this really does the trick when I play with our ball loving Airedale . I recommend the shorter handle for better control ... like this one that I purchased .
5 #### Best thing we 've purchase to play fetch with our 3 Labrador Retrievers ! ! They get the exercise they need ! Thanks ChuckIt !
5 #### This thing is great . I 'm not very good at throwing the ball far for my dog . With the Chuck It , it goes all the way across the yard with ease ! We 've even lost a few balls from inadvertently chucking too hard !
5 #### Most comfortable Chuckit we have owned , easy on the hands , balls launch easily and travel far enough to give big dogs a workout
5 #### Have a lab . This item is a necessity for her as she is ball fixated as are most retrievers and her mouth leaves balls very slimy . Great way to keep hands clean .
5 #### A total must have if your dog likes to play fetch . The adults and 12 year old son use the longer Chuckit and my 8 year old daughter prefers the 12 M size . I 'm a terrible thrower and playing fetch with my fetch crazed dogs would be an exercise in frustration without the Chuckit . I find it much easier to control my aim using this . Did I mention I 'm a terrible thrower ? I 'm actually pretty decent when I use the Chuckit . They 're awesome .
5 #### So much nicer than picking up slimy balls and it throughs the balls a nice distance . Works with regular tennis balls which is great . My dog always gets excited when he sees me get it out .
5 #### The Chuckit Launcher is a necessity if you have a dog that enjoys the game of fetch . I have always known about this product but considered it for the lazy man . My yellow lab has enough energy to make a game of fetch feel like pitching nine innings in the big leagues . It would get to the point where I would have to ice my shoulder . I eventually invested in one of these and now use it regularly . Once you get the hang of the throwing motion you can launch the ball incredible distances with very little effort . It came with a fuzzy tennis ball which I eventually replaced with a Chuck glow ball . This rubber ball is much better then any tennis ball and glows in the dark so I can use it at night . I gave this 5 stars because it has now become an essential tool to deal with my dogs energy . Keeping her exercised makes life a lot easier in the house .
5 #### Love this invention ! Saves my arm and provides my puppy with a lot of exercise . I highly recommend of you have a dog that fetches that you invest in one of these . We bought the medium sized one , it might be time for the larger one as well .
5 #### I have bought 5 of these - I have 2 German Shepherds Dogs and they love to chew on them ! I am older and ca n't throw well now so this has come in very handy . Throws several hundred feet with ease .
5 #### Great match for the large chuckit ball . Our long hair GSD love to fetch and this is the perfect tool to grab and throw the slobbery ball and be ready with treats at the same time .
5 #### This thing is great . I have a Great Dane that is a runner . Only he likes to run after other dogs ' balls . Our solution , a Chuckit so other dogs could try and steal his ball . He loves this thing . He does not like bringing the ball back but that 's another story . I used to play high school softball and I no longer have that amazing outfield arm but with this , it does n't matter . I only wish I had gotten the bigger one because the park we visit does n't cut the grass as regularly as one would hope , and the ball easily gets lost in just the smallest bit of overgrowth . Yes , even the bright orange one in green grass . I bought this one because I was thinking that if I lost the Chuckit balls I could just throw a regular old tennis ball in there ( since my dog does n't do the whole " retrieve " thing ) . The problem is that I have lost all but one of the damn balls because you ca n't find them in the grass . Do n't get me wrong , it is n't the Amazon ( hee hee ) out there , just like a couple inches . At a few bucks a ball , for the nicer ones , it adds up fast . Just something to keep in mind if you have a dum dum like me that likes you to play fetch more than them ;)
5 #### Works great ! no more sore shoulder , or slimy hands since the Chuckit easily scoops up the ball from the ground and with a firm arm / wrist flick easily launched the ball 80 feet or more . We also bought the larger 26 M Chuckit , which works great for our large 1 acre backyard . This 18 M model is better for smaller yards or smaller dogs .
5 #### Works great ! no more sore shoulder , or slimy hands since the Chuckit easily scoops up the ball from the ground and with a firm arm / wrist flick easily launched the ball 100 feet or more .
5 #### Love these things ! They are just as much fun for the humans as they are for the pups . We have been using ours with the rubber glow ball that Chuck It makes and its lots of fun in the dark winter evenings , and help the pups get their exercise when we do n't go on walks . Do nt buy a Chuck It at a pet store , buy it here , its so much less expensive . The 26 M was a perfect size for our Pittie Mix , and another Pittie that lives in our building .
4 #### Great for a small dog . I wish it collapsed , though , like competing brands do . My 7.2 lb toy poodle is too small for the small chuckit balls . She is very hardy and tenacious but we use smaller squeak balls that are kind of squishy , and fit into the Chuckit launcher . I 'm disappointed that they do n't make squishy / smaller Chuckit balls . Tiny dogs like chasing balls far , too !
3 #### No that great ad much easier just hand thrwing the ball , So save your time and moey and just get the balls , Hands work better
5 #### I think it 's great but only if I can get my dog to fetch the ball back to me when we are outdoors ! But at least I do n't have to pick up slimy balls with my hands !
5 #### These are my dogs ' favorite toy ... chuck it balls are more important to them than food . The launcher help me throw the ball farther , and keeps my hands from getting super slimmy
5 #### My pup is in love with this . I had never seen the small launchers in stores however I had the balls so I looked it up online and found this . It is more difficult then it looks and it takes a bit to get use to throwing the ball with this but my pooch is happy now that I can throw his ball much much farther . I was never a good pitcher . Whenever he sees his chuck it he gets excited and starts whining . In fact ... He gets excited if he sees anyone 's chuck it at the dog park , and that person , has earned a new 7 lb shadow . Brody was more of a keep away dog he would never drop the ball for me easily . So I 'd launch the ball with this and feed him a treat in the chuck it launcher itself . Now he gives the ball up every time I have it up for a seamless game of fetch .
4 #### My Australian sheep dog loses her mind when she sees our regular sized ball launcher . This makes it very difficult to take the launcher along with us for walks . This one is short enough to keep out of sight . It 's a little bit more difficult to throw the ball long distances but it 's still very effective .
4 #### I like this length for the back yard . I 'm less likely to throw it over the fence . The longer launchers allow more range at the beach or dog park .
5 #### Fun for dog owner to use . Standard tennis ball can be used . Now if we could just get the puppy to bring the ball back !
5 #### My dogs thank you ... they love this new toy ... works really good to throw the ball into the ocean for them ...
5 #### My cattledog loves the Chuck - it . It has become her favorite toy . Whenever we venture outdoors she drops the ball at my feet and drags the chuck - it to me . It 's an excellent way to provide exercise for an active dog . It 's also been a lifesaver for my arm .
5 #### I love this product , and so does my 7 month old puppy . She loves to run and chase the balls . Now if only I can her to bring them back to me .
5 #### My dog loves to play ball , but my shoulder would start to give out after 10 hard throws and I can only throw so far ; until I came across this ball launcher . I can easily throw a ball a good 100plus feet with no real effort and it does n't kill my shoulder within 10minutes . I barely feel any stress in my arm at all by using this launcher . It 's very strong plastic and will last for years to come if you take care of it . It holds all the 2.5inch Chuckit ! Balls and normal Tennis balls . I love this launcher , it 's so much more fun playing with my ball addicted dog . The best thing about this is that I can easily pick up the ball with this launcher without having to touch slobbery balls anymore ! If you have any questions about this product , feel free to ask . I will get back to you .
5 #### Just like my older chuckits . They work great ! Just do n't lay them down for the dog to pick up to chew on ! They 'll last almost forever .
5 #### Simple design and easy to use . I love that it helps me throw the ball much further than I could on my own .
5 #### This has been on my " puppy wishlist " for almost 6 months . I 've hesitated to buy it for who knows what reason . It 's not expensive . My dog loves to play fetch . This takes fetch to a whole new level . I can throw pretty far , but get tired out . This can throw twice as far and my dog goes nuts when I bring it out . I got the whistle balls too , which make him even nuttier . We played with this today until he could fetch no more . That 's never happened before . It has a compact size , but can throw quite a distance . I have n't completely got the skill of using it down yet , but it 's still pretty effective . If you are thinking about buying this , stop . Add to your cart , get a couple extra balls , and check out .
5 #### How could this not get 5 stars . You know why you are buying it . Wish my dog did n't like to chew on them if I leave him in the yard unattended . :)
4 #### This is exactly what I expected . Makes throwing the ball way easier ! ! The dogs get excited when they see me pull this out !
5 #### It 's hard for me to tire my dogs out , but this certainly helps ! Paired with the whistle balls it keeps them busy for a loooooong time . I have a big yard so I need one of these to throw the ball all the way across it . I 've also taken it to my local dog park where I can get some serious distance .
5 #### He 's about 3 years old and sweet as can be . But he still tears every toy apart . He loves to retrieve tennis balls but I never thought an arm substitute would a worthwhile investment . After all these launchers are for old folks , right ? Boy was I wrong . Can a Chuckit launcher be more fun than a barrel of monkeys ? Unfortunately , I have no basis for comparison but I CAN say it is the most fun ( or funest if you liked the intentional title gaff ) both the dog and I have ever had . He can go full speed retrieving long throws for 10 or 15 minutes before the " all done " command is issued and , rather than returning , he flops down in some shade . But , like Chinese food , in two hours he is back begging for more ! And it has two benefits I did not anticipate : no more handling slobbery , gooey tennis balls . And the Ultra balls I got with the launcher are 100 % indestructible ! I 've even given into letting him have one in the house as a chew toy . The first one has been a month already and there 's not one dig or cut in it . Great product , highly recommended .
4 #### I wanted a second Chuckit ! , so I saw this deal & ordered one . It 's longer than the one we already had & it sends the ball further . The dogs really get a good work - out .
5 #### Excellent launcher . With a bit of practice an adult can use this to chuck the ball about 50 - 60 yards ; newer balls fly a bit better . After a few months it 's still going strong despite fact that dog loves to chew on the Chuck It as much as the balls . You 'll want a few replacement balls too .
5 #### I have a torn Rotator Cuff AND a Golden Retriever who loves to play ball . Before the ChuckIt ! I could barely throw that ball 20 feet . Now just a flick of my wrist send the ball sailing . Be sure to get " The Whistler Balls " with it . They bounce better than any ball I 've ever used and my Golden LOVES chewing on them . They must feel great in his mouth and they seem to be pretty indestructible ! ! !
5 #### What better way to keep your dog active ? The Chuckit makes YOUR life easier in that you can throw the ball farther and not have to bend over so far to get it once ( or if ) your dog brings it back . Also , you do n't have to grab a goopy tennis ball - bonus !
3 #### Chuckit is a great concept but the ball is too small . Sometimes my dog ca n't find it . I would like the ball to be tennis ball size . That way I could have a few extras to toss and have easy replacements .
5 #### Keeps your hands from getting slobbery or muddy from the ball , greatly reduced bending for the ball , and throws it farther than I could without assistance . As far as this particular product , it works like it 's supposed to and is durable . No complaints .
5 #### great toy my chesapeake bay retriever loves me more than ever . I wish i would got one sooner its so much fun
5 #### Just wish I could have picked the color . Anyway , this is a must have product for exercising your dog ... as long the dog brings the ball back to you . It can be a LONG walk to retrieve it !
5 #### The chuck it is a great product . We have a golden and he will retrieve all day long this product makes it possible for me to throw his ball with out getting my hands slobbery
4 #### We are on our third one now not because of the quality but because our dog things it 's a chew toy . I 'm able to throw a ball pretty far with this and keeps my dog entertained
5 #### Great size for someone with a smaller dog and perhaps a smaller stature . I would n't recommend this amended size for a tall person .
5 #### Classic - the large size lets you launch the ball far . Sturdy construction . Our dog park has one for all to share and sure saves on the arm for throwing .
3 #### I love the Chuckit ! The only problem is it came with a tennis ball that my dog " popped " in less than 20 minutes . I 've had to purchase a better ball in order to keep playing with him .
5 #### Great tool . The new grip is comfortable . The length is perfect . The ball does is average but any tennis ball works fine .
4 #### Not bad but having now had both in my hands , when this one wears out i 'll be opting for the Classic 26 M instead of this version . the grip on the 26 feels better to me .
5 #### This product is easy to use and , of course , most dogs love to fetch . The pick - up and throw is not perfect but it is very good and we like to use it . Would recommend it .
5 #### I bought the Chuckit to use indoors to fling paperwads and Savvy Tabby mylar balls for a cat , and it works great .
5 #### I use this everyday with my dog when I take him to the park and love it for the extra distance I can get with it .
3 #### With this thrower I was able to get a few extra feet compared to just throwing with my arm and I ended up getting the 25 M instead that gave much better distance . This is good if do n't want to pick up a slobbery ball and do n't care about the distance .
5 #### My dog destroys a tennis ball in 30 minutes . My dog has been abusing the Chuckit balls for 3 + months .
5 #### My daughter says her dog , just loves this item , as she can not throw the ball that far but the CHUCKIT does the job .
5 #### This is sturdy and chucks really well . Fits normal tennis balls - Now if only my dog was interested in it ..
5 #### Wow , this thing can hurl the tennis ball and the other chuckit products far ! Dogs love it , I love it bc no more slimy tennis balls or bending over to pick them up .
5 #### If you have a dog that loves tennis balls - you MUST have this chuckit . Trows the ball further and with less stress on shoulders and elbows trying to " chuckit " by hand !
3 #### Because the large glow chuckit ball that I bought this launcher to use with is just a little smaller than the cup of this launcher , there is n't a good fit . Makes it harder for me to launch the large ball because the ball is loose in the " cup . " Also , the large glow chuckit ball does n't really bounce as well after launching , maybe cause it 's heavier . But I do like to use the glow chuckit balls because they are much easier to find in the playground , especially at sundown or nighttime . I guess I 'll go back to my medium chuckit glow ball and medium launcher . In all fairness , my Golden loves all of the chuckit products .
5 #### This works almost too well . I have retrieved several balls from the other side of the fence . My dog and kids love it .
5 #### My dogs ca n't thank me enough for buying this for them ! They love their " chuck it " all the chuck it products I have purchased are incredible .
5 #### For such a simple concept and design , it 's a wonderful product ! I easily double the distance that I throw the ball with this and my german shepherd gets much more exercise ! She 's pooped in under 15 minutes !
5 #### There 's something about the Chuckit that drives my dog nuts . She 'll bark at anyone holding it who does n't throw the ball immediately . Plus , if you get the end of an empty Chuckit near her mouth , it 's a chew toy . So , it 's a Chuckit and a Chewit . This thing can keep her entertained for hours . The Jr ( now called 18 M ) is perfect for active small dogs or medium dogs , and when you lose the ball that came with it ( and you will when another dog runs off with the ball ) , the Jr will fit regular tennis balls .
5 #### This keeps your shoulder from hurting when you are playing ball with a dog that will never give up . It helps throw a good distance with out hurting yourself . You just need a big yard or dog park to play with this . This comes with the chuckit ! tennis ball but I prefer to use the chuckit ! rubber balls they last longer and bounce higher and goes in different directions . I have tried other ball launchers and by far this is the best one to wear out your dog and keep you from not working to hard or hurting yourself .
5 #### I have a dog that loves to run and play ball . With this product unlike others that say they do the same thing I can throw the ball at least 500 feet and it gives my Vizsla a good work out . We still play ball for a long time but this saves your shoulder from pain and your hands from the saliva ball . I am thankful for the friend that turned us on to Chuckit Products . Also you do not have to have the chuckit balls to throw you can use regular tennis balls . However if you want the longevity of the ball I would by the rubber chuck it ball to keep launching .
5 #### 1 . Throw ( much ) farther . 2 . Do so without tiring your arm . 3 . No longer bend over to retrieve a wet , slobbery ball . Single best dog ' toy ' ever . Mind blown .
5 #### Allows you to throw a long way without throwing your arm out . My dogs get a lot more exercise and I enjoy it now .
5 #### Some years ago I crushed my shoulder in a motorcycle accident . The Chuckit makes it easy for me to keep my dog in shape and is easy on the shoulder .
5 #### My dog 's all - time favorite pastime is her small ChuckIt ! ball . She always knows exactly where it is and makes plenty of opportunities for me to toss it for her . After a while though , it gets slippery , so when I saw this Launcher I was n't sure it would work for me but decided to give it a try . Well , it does work ! It takes a small effort to get it to snap onto the ball , and then toss the ball with a flick of your wrist and the ball will fly much further than tossing it with your hand . Terrific little gadget for making playtime fun for you and your dog . Be sure to get the appropriate size for your dog 's mouth . This comes in several sizes . Make sure the ball is not small enough for the dog to accidentally get it lodged in the throat , or so large that the dog strains the jaws trying to hold on to it .
5 #### like not having to touch the slobbering balls . you have to practice throwing b / c when you throw it , the balls will go far . best for big yards .
4 #### I thought this would be fun to play with my 126 # dog outside ... But unfortunately he is also a couch potato . Hates going outside ... LOL
5 #### Why did I wait so long to get one of these ? I blew out my elbow and my shoulder throwing tennis balls over the years . This .... is magic ! I can toss the ball WAY high up in the air so even the old dead ones bounce . The only downside is I have to be careful not to fling the ball so far that it goes over the fence .
5 #### the release and hold allows you to control the length of throw without worrying about the ball falling out or not releasing ! i use with my puppy for short distances to work on eye focus !
2 #### we thought that the ball would be smooth like our neighbor 's ( which our dog loves ) , but is just a tennis ball . Check around and get another Chuckit instead .
5 #### There is nothing worse than touching a slobbery ball . This works great and lets you throw a ball a long distance so your dog gets a good workout . I highly recommend buying the rubber chuck - it balls . They last longer and bounce better .
5 #### I have a large black lab who is only 1 1/2 yrs old . He has quite a bit of energy . He loves this ball as much as I do . He picks it up and carries it back with no problem at all so I do n't have to keep bending over for a little ball . I recommend this for everyone . It is great .
5 #### My dog loves it . I would suggest getting the whistling balls because they are the best balls offered by chuck it .
3 #### I have both the longer and shorter lengths of Chuckit ! While the longer one is okay , I found it more difficult to control the direction of the ball when it releases as opposed to the shorter handled one . Although both of them help those of us who ca n't throw a tennis ball very far to throw them farther and give my dogs a better workout .
5 #### I have dogs that love to fetch . After a while my arm would get tired , way before any of them would . This is a great solution . We can now play until THEY get tired instead of my arm . LOVE IT !
5 #### My dog loves it also . Works great . Tennis balls work with it also . I can really control the distance with how much energy I put into the throw .
3 #### I used it only a few times be cause I had hard time to release the ball . It seemed to grabbed the ball a little too tight . I bought one size smaller version which works great !
5 #### I 've bought a LOT of toys on amazon for my pup & let me just say - I should have started with a ChuckIt . I used to see everyone with one so I finally gave in to see what all the hype was about . BEST INVESTMENT EVER ! ! ! Saves your shoulder , my dog loves it , and you can throw the ball very far . Great for the dog park or dog beach . No complaints . Would definitely recommend .
2 #### so she will bring the ball back and drop the ball . then try to grab at the launcher as i try to pick up the ball with it . sometimes you have to really work to get this thing to release the ball . half the time when i swing it the ball stays in the cup . needs to have some sort of trigger you can use to open the cup when you swing it
5 #### My dog LOVESS THE CHUCK IT ! , great product and it really flings the ball for her , theo nly thing is after a while the bal does n't stick it in as well as it used to , only downfal .
5 #### I absolutely love this product . Our dog can play fetch for hours and the ball gets nasty ! With this , I never have to touch the ball and I can launch it much further than normally !
5 #### If I could I 'd give this system another star I would . An active border collie and a 50 year old shoulder do not make for hours of fun . With a flick of her wrist our 10 year old daughter can launch a ball far enough to make it a lot of fun . And because it also accepts a regular tennis ball we 're never out of play time . ( Personal note : I appreciate the fact that the manufacturer did not make a proprietary ball size . I would probably NOT buy it if they did . Because we can use any ball I will recommend it to so many more people they 'll receive a hundredfold more sales )
4 #### I like the medium chucker . Use it every day at the dog park and it is the perfect size for me .
5 #### Do explain why you liked or disliked this product . Do compare to similar products and share how long you 've used this product . Do identify specific attributes ( e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera ) and whether they met your
5 #### I had several regular sized Chuckit that I like , but as my lab grew up ... I worried more and more about the size of the ball and the larger size of his mouth ... and he loves to jump up and catch a ball in the air . THIS MEGA Ball size is perfect for my dog ... it 's definitely too large to slip down his throat by mistake when he is super excited playing ball . However , it 's not too large of a ball either .... he can still catch it in mid air .
5 #### Arrived early and works great . I can get the dogs way more exercise and not have to pick up the slobbery tennis ball when they bring it back , gross !
5 #### the short handle makes it the best choice for carrying in hand out to a field ... we keep a longer handle in the car ... just take some throw / wrist action adjustments to get it right .
5 #### Not sure how far but enough to get my highly active pitbull plenty of running exercise . Easy to carry , pack due to smaller size . No need or desire for larger , more expensive models . Works perfect with chuck it balls ... durable orange and blue two packs . Came with regular tennis ball .... colored orange ... not a durable chuck it ball . Be aware .
5 #### Found out my Jack Russell loves tennis balls . After a week of throwing balls every night for a week , I could n't move my shoulder . So we got the Chuckit ! This size will move the ball 50 yards with little effort . I can throw the ball for an hour and my shoulder is good . Yes , my Jack will go for an hour . He slows down , but does n't stop . Thanks Chuckit ! !
5 #### This thing is great . You can grab the ball from the ground in almost any circumstance . My only problem was learning to aim with it . Many trips were made to the neighbors yard .. haha .
5 #### absolutely amazing . i 've had this for over a year now and it 's the best $ 10 I 've spent . I never have to touch a slobbery ball and it makes playing fetch so much more fun ! highly recommended !
5 #### This is small enough to fit in my backpack , fits several brands of small tennis balls ( including the squeaky Kong ones ) and REALLY gets some distance on the ball .
1 #### The ball is heavier for distance throwing and the rubber is thicker . Any dog with strong bite will split the ball . Highly recommend the Kong Squeaker 3 inch tennis ball as replacement . Goes as far and is Alot stronger ! Too bad can not buy launcher only - ball is a waste of money
5 #### we had to replace our old chuckit cause we lost it and did n't realize how much we and our dog missed it . best purchase ever !
5 #### My dog can not live without playing fetch , and this is the perfect helper . I had shoulder surgery a year ago , and this makes it so much easier to throw the ball without hurting myself or getting worn out too quickly . Really gets good distance , and I do n't have to get yuck on my hands picking up a slobbery ball .
5 #### Awesome product . Both my husband and I have had multiple surgeries on our dominant shoulders leaving it difficult to throw a ball as well as a sorry distance for our pup to play . This thing is amazing and so painless .
5 #### While this will send a ball flying with little effort it 's worth the money to not have to directly handle the nasty tennis balls at my local dog park . It handles standard tennis balls just as well as the ball that comes with it ( which of course got lost in a bush on day one ) .
5 #### Item arrived as expected ... Great toy for those dogs that love to fetch ... and it saves your shoulder and arm :) My Border Collie loves this item , and yes I can wear him out now before he wears me out . :)
5 #### Cheap nice and works with old tennis balls you might have lying around . MY LAB GOES INSANE when I pick it up ... you should too ... and remember if you loose the included balls - a regular tennis ball fits and works great ... NICE IDEA GREAT FOLLOW THROUGH - THANKS !
5 #### Save my shoulders , keep my dog happy , I do n't have to touch slimey balls and I can use it as a weapon to keep other unruly dogs at bay . Amazon shipped quick , a lot of packaging for one small item but you ca n't win them all .
5 #### If you have a dog that chases balls you need this . I have a larger one but need a smaller one to accommodate a smaller yard . We kept launching the balls over the fence .
5 #### This is the real deal . It works like a charm . It took a couple dozen throws for the clamp to loosen up . Now it 's perfect .
5 #### This is my 4th Chuckit or so . We use them until they break or one of the dogs eats it . I like them a lot and wish I had the patent . This is made out of a softer plastic than the others . I prefer the previous ones , but still it is a wonderful item .
5 #### I first saw the Chuckit line when working at a pet store during high school . I dismissed it as simply a gimmick for people who did n't want to bend over to pick up a ball , and/or had no idea how to throw a ball . Nearly a decade later , I finally decided to give one a try . I have no problem throwing a ball a fair distance with my arm , but the Chuckit allows me to throw it even further , with significantly less effort . Though regular tennis balls work fine , I 'd recommend using the Fetch balls that Chuckit sells . Compared to tennis balls , they 're easier to clean , I do n't have to worry about my dog chewing them ( since there is no fuzz for her to rip off ) , and they bounce a lot better ( even on grass ) . I also have the Erratic ball , but do n't recommend it as much . It certainly lives up to its name when it bounces around , but its awkward shape makes it more difficult to fit snugly into the Chuckit , which makes it more difficult to throw , meaning it does n't travel nearly as far .
4 #### At first it 's a little tricky to throw properly , but then maybe I 'm a little spazzy . My 4.5 lb Yorkie loves to play fetch . The further the ball flies the more she likes it . If she 's happy , I 'm happy . Overall I like the product .
5 #### We have a mixed lab , 75 lbs . I wanted to get something for the winter time when the ball gets too muddy to keep throwing by hand . This is also fun for kids to use . Mine arrived in orange . I also wanted something compatible with tennis balls since we have so many , I was worried when I read the other reviews but took a chance . Ours does work with tennis balls , kind of a snug fit but works fine .
4 #### I really like this launcher . It works really well , but I 'm thinking of someday buying the longer one . I opted on this one as the long one indicated it threw farther . I did n't want to launch it so far I 'd lose the ball or end up chasing my dog to get him to come back , so for the length of the throw is perfect and it 's very easy to snatch the ball up for continued throwing . My significant other is 6'1 " so he has to do some bending to pick up the balls which is okay for him , but the intention had been to make it easier for him . One thing I 've noticed is that this does not put the stress on my shoulder that thowing by hand thowing does . This makes our dog , Diego , very happy because he can play and play and play .
5 #### LOVE having a Chuckit around . My dachshund loves to fetch for hours , literally . I love that I just bend down to pick the ball up with this . Also , saves you from arm pain of constantly throwing the ball as hard and far as possible . With little effort this Chuckit launches the balls quite far . Can be used with other tennis balls .
5 #### I have three Border Collies who love to play Frisbee and ball . I got tired of bending over to pick up the ball , this solves that problem . I can also lob it farther for them or make it bounce extremely high .
5 #### I purchased this when I purchased the medium max glow ball . I love it because not only does it enhance my wimpy throwing , but it saves my gloves when I 'm playing with my dog in our super muddy backyard . I would n't purchase it for a super small space because I have to be careful not to throw it over our fence . The ball really does go a long way when you use this . I definitely recommend using it if you have enough room .
5 #### Does throw long ways . Our big dog has always loved playing " fetch the ball " but he is getting a little old and Chuckit throws it so far that my poor baby gets really tired after a few throws only ... He loves it and recognizes as soon as he sees it . We love the fact that you do n't have to pick up the yucky , slimy , muddy ball ... as long as the dog drops it of course .
5 #### We own a dog daycare and use Chuckits every day . Easy to use on 2 acres . The dogs get a great workout .
5 #### My dog Buster loves chasing balls and this enables me to toss a regular tennis ball the distance of about half a football field . Great idea ! Prefer this the longer version , since I do n't have to reach down so far to pick up the ball .
5 #### This launcher has saved my arm . My lab could play fetch all day and the launcher allows me to pick up the ball without touching it and throw it farther than just my arm can manage . It 's also short enough to hide inside my jacket when it 's time to stop playing . Kudos for the launcher !
5 #### Had I known how long the launcher was for this I probably would have ordered a smaller one . My dog loves this , but we have to replace the balls every so often because she can chomp right through the big ones with no effort . Def worth it though
5 #### This little launcher is great for dogs fetching in the backyard . Just do n't leave it where the pup can get it unsupervised ... apparently they taste good . Ha !
5 #### Works well in the back yard . You do n't have to handle the wet ball . For larger areas like a park or playground consider a larger chuckit . If you have an active dog you will love this product . Saves the arm . The dog will tire out before you do
5 #### This is great for playing fetch without having to touch drooly , dirty balls . Plus , I can launch the balls extra far and tire out my pup more quickly !
4 #### My lab loves to play fetch and its very hard to tire him out . With the Chuck it I can throw it really far without feeling like my arm is going to fall out of its socket and my lab is tired in 15 minutes or less . His behavior is better afterwards too . I wish the ball was better quality but for the price its well worth it . I might invest in a longer chuck it in a little while but all in all , its a great buy .
5 #### This is a variation of the prehistoric spear thrower for balls , allowing you to throw your dog 's ball farther . Best of all , you can pop the throwing end onto the dog slimy ball without you having to touch it with your hand . Even better , use it with the chuckit glow in the dark ball . Your dog will love you even more .
5 #### This is probably one of the best inventions for playing fetch , especially with larger dogs that love to run . It 's really easy to learn how to use and works great for throwing the ball much farther than I could ever throw it by hand . The plastic grip is durable and has survived my dogs chewing . And the ball is durable .
5 #### My dog is really active and I call this my " life savor " because when I have it she will do practically anything to get me to chuck it too her . As a girl I never learned how to throw a ball far enough for the dog to get a good run out of it . Of course it 's a natural for a golden or lab retriever , they seem to go on automatic !
5 #### My dogs love this and so do I , it is so much better than picking up a ball soaked in dog saliva . It was a really good purchase . Highly recommend this product .
5 #### If you happen to have a dog that loves fetch , but are n't blessed with the strong arm muscles / coordination needed to throw the ball as far as your dog would like , this toy is for you ! I can launch the ball probably 50 yards with this thing ( I wo n't embarrass myself with my distance without the chuck - it ) , and this one is small enough ( the sport one ) that it is easy to hide from the dog inside your jacket .
5 #### As much as I love to play fetch with my rescued dog , i can not stand the fact that holding a slobbering ball is not my cup of tea . This saves your hands from a slobbering ball .
5 #### Chuckit is the best invention for dog lovers EVER ! ! ! You will never have to touch another slimy , dirty ball again thanks to Chuckit . You can also throw the ball about three times as far with Chuckit . I would suggest buying the Chuckit Ultra Balls to go with it . They are the best balls ever , virtually indestructible .
5 #### This allows me throw my dogs ' favorite balls faster and farther then with my own arm . The only problem is that one of my dogs thinks this is also a chew toy and chewed it up partially so I must be carefully to keep it our of reach when not in use . I does take some force to release the ball when throwing it so my PK daughter is not able to use it even though she really wants to . I still highly recommend this product .
5 #### Bought this for my two dogs and it has worked out well . Received it on time and product was as expected
5 #### My wife 's shoulder tires out before our dogs are tired from chasing their ball , so I bought her this thrower for when its her time to take the dogs out . For being the small chuckit thrower it easily throws out to 100yds . Very good investment
5 #### This Chuckit ! launcher toy feels very well made . It has a large comfortable grip section and the plastic feels very durable . I personally did n't achieve " far " throwing results but my lab did n't complain . He was happy I was playing fetch and I am very happy not to have to get my hands all slobbery in the process since I use the Chuckit to pick up the toy as well as throw it . My boyfriend was able to launch the ball 250 feet with little effort . He says it works just like a skeet thrower . I 'd also like to add that we purchased separately a whistle ball and glow - in - the - dark ball ( by the same company ) which are both hits with our lab . We recommend this product for anyone wanting to play fetch with their dog , but we highly suggest that children are supervised because it 's more difficult to control where the ball goes with the launcher rather than just throwing it by hand .
5 #### This has the same advantages as the other Chuckits in that it throws a long way and you do n't have to handle a dirty wet ball . But it really throws a long way so you 'll need a big dog that likes to run and a lot of space
5 #### As the other reviewers noted , you can throw a ball a long way with minimal effort and you do n't have to pick up a slobbery dirty ball in your hand . The dog wore out before I did !
4 #### This is a smaller version of the more popular / larger Chuckits I see around , but I wanted one I could carry with me easily while walking my dog . I can fit this in my coat pocket and not have to worry about holding onto it , and the leash . It does n't throw nearly as far , but it does throw the ball much further than I can . The dog has no complaints either .
5 #### This really saves my arm when out playing with the dogs . They love it too ! Be warned though that the ball will go FAR and that the smaller version may be more appropriate if you have a smaller yard .
5 #### This product arrived on time and was exactly as described Well made and lightweight Works really well . OK OK ok
5 #### Use it with the Nite Ize MTLP-08 - 07 MeteorLight K-9 Led dog ball , Disc - O and it works great ! I can throw way farther with less effort and keeps you from having to pick up dirty tennis balls or other
5 #### More robust then knock off 's from big - box stores , hands never get wet from the dog slobber ... worth the cash . Will buy again when it gets worn out .
5 #### I can easily throw the ball up to 10 times farther than without this thing , which makes my dog very happy . She gets to run further and gets more exercise , making the whole house happier :)
5 #### With this ball launcher , it is easy to really get our lab to run . The ball easily goes 200 + feet . Even the kids can get the ball to go 100 + feet . And it is so nice not having to pick up the slobery ball . The tennis style ball that comes with it is not that long lasting ( at least with a strong dog like we have ) , but the solid rubber balls that they sell work GREAT .
5 #### My family adopted a Golden Retriever who loves to fetch . Problem is she 's a slobbery mess , and I hated touching the balls . I also ca n't throw very far when compared to how fast she runs , so games were short , and she was n't exercising her full potential . Not any more ! I can probably throw the ball 250 feet now , and my dog is huffing and puffing in a few minutes ! I usually play with two balls , one she is fetching , and the other is ready to go when she comes back . She was n't very fond of the tennis ball that comes with the launcher , however I ordered some of the orange chuck - it balls and she 's doing well with those . You 'll definitely need a large open area to use this though ! Definitely worth the money .
3 #### When my husband and I bought a house , I immediately purchased a ton of " backyard " toys for the then dog , now dogs . I swore this chuckit would make playing fetch more fun - less slobbery balls in my hand , further throwing for more tired dogs , etc . But I find that I never use this .
3 #### A tired dog is a good dog . Chuck it launchers will save your arm and prevent your hands from getting all slimey . My dog loves to play catch and this is a must have . Combine this with a glow in the dark ball and you 're good to go -- regardless of the time of day ( or night ) .
4 #### This is a great product if you have shoulder issue and ca n't throw too far like me . It will throw a ball pretty far without using much energy . I recommend getting the Medium Ultra Ball rather than the tennis balls because it will stay cleaner and last longer because it is a rubber ball .
5 #### I had a chuck it and never used it for several years . I just bought a new one as we have an Australian Shepherd who is a " ball hound . " I read the instructions / tips for throwing well and discovered that its " all about the follow through . " In order to throw successfully , i need to be standing up and follow through . It works great . I 'm buying some more balls ( including one that glows in the dark ) to keep my dog well exercised . I highly recommend this item .
5 #### The service from this company was excellent . The item was what I wanted and my dog is very happy . I highly recommend this company , definitely .
2 #### When I bought my first such launcher about three years ago ( and a second one a year later ) the handle was 20 inches . It does n't seem like a big difference , but it really is . Now the handle is a fairly useless 14 inches . The entire reason I bought this was so that I would n't have to bend all the way down 100 times a day . I miss the old version of this product - I wish they 'd bring it back . It is also REALLY hard to throw well / far with the short handle . There is very little give in the short version .
5 #### My 20 lb terrier loves to chase these small tennis balls and this ball launcher helps me to keep playing without making my arm sore . You can sit on a bench , pick the ball up , and throw it quite a ways without ever getting up . This would be a good gift for a senior dog lover or someone with limited mobility . Also good for someone who is n't a great thrower , like me !
5 #### My 3 year old Springer is a tennis ball nut ! There 's nothing she loves more than her tennis balls except maybe chasing them - practice for catching the squirrels on our property ! This Chuckit is easy to use and once you get the hang of it you can pitch a ball a long distance saving on elbows and shoulders . Any tennis ball will work in the head of the device . The best way to lob a ball a goodly distance is to NOT insert the ball all the way into the head . Place the ball about half way in , just enough so it does n't fall out , take a standing or sitting position , and swing your arm up from a ground pointing position to just head level and let fly ! Pretend you are a kid again and swing your arm like a windmill . Just stop the motion when your arm is pointing straight towards the heavens . The ball will launch at least 50 - 80 feet in an arch . Great invention and I love it and my dog loves it . In all fairness to anyone who is n't finding it easy to use , well , neither has my husband been overly successful at using it either but then he 's not very coordinated , LOL ! Such a simple device and I only wish I had thought of it . Buy it and your dog will love you forever and you wo n't suffer any more shoulder pain pitching those balls for that slobbering ball of fur you own . Enjoy !
4 #### My dog loves to play fetch and this works great ! The only think I did n't like about the smaller one is that it has a shorter handle . I wish it was still the full length so it is easier to get off the ground .
5 #### I have 2 dogs and one of them just LOVES to play fetch , especially with balls . She gets excited just seeing this because she knows it means play time . I also bought a variety of balls . Her favorite is the whistling ball . This size also works for a standard tennis ball , which I use if I might loose the ball since I have lots of these . I would recommend this for anyone who has a dog who likes to fetch balls .
5 #### Nothing can beat a chuckit in quality and ease . The balls fit perfectly . I 'd highly recommend the rebound blue rubber balls . Enjoy !
5 #### It took me a while to jump on the Chuckit ! band wagon , however I 'm SO glad I finally did ! ! As a female who throws like a " girl " , this product has enabled me to play fetch at long distances with my hyper yellow lab . Not only that , it 's great not having to handle a slobbery ball , e [ ... ] I have yet to purchase a Chuckit brand ball replacement , but have purchased a basic yellow tennis ball . The Wilson tennis ball must be slightly larger than the Chuckit ball , as it does n't release from the thrower as easily . Regardless , I love this product and wish that all the dogs in the world could own one ! !
5 #### I was introduced to Chuck It through a client . I now carry one with me at all dog visits . It saves my arm lots of wear and flings the ball far . GREAT PRODUCT ! !
5 #### Besides the Kong , that is ! If you have a dog that loves to play fetch , buy this ! Everytime it comes out of the closet my dog goes nuts and she ca n't stop fetching until I make her and put it up high and away ! Can not beat the exercise you give your dog with this , either .
5 #### My dog is obsessed with balls and playing fetch . She is also a really tough chewer . The tennis ball that comes with it held up as well as any other tennis ball ; not at all . I also purchased the Chuckit ! glow ball which glows super bright and holds up to her tough chewing . Zoe has trouble dropping the ball for us but has much more confidence in letting her ball go to the Chuckit ! so we do n't fight her as much for the ball which was a unexpected but major benefit . Other than that , it works as described ; it picks up the balls easy and goes really far . I wish I had gotten one years ago . The price on Amazon is fantastic and the free two day Prime shipping got it here as promised . Best investment ever !
5 #### I do n't know why I waited so long , but I 'm so very happy with this Chuckit product . I have the " pro " version too . With a 6 month old German Shepherd who needs tons of exercise , this product has saved my throwing arm from soreness and possibly throwing out my shoulder . Just do n't lay it down , cuz the pup will chew it up quick ... I saved mine from total destruction , and it 's still usable . Makes playing more fun .
5 #### Our poodle mix looves this product . She loves a reason to run and the Chuck - It will give her a good reason to sprint down the park . The Chuck - It helps you throw much farther that humanly possible with minimal effort . Just a simple overhand swing sends the ball flying . The version we have accepts any standard size tennis ball which is great in case you lose the included ball . I think it 's possibly also a great product for older dog owners . No need to bend over to pick up the tennis ball . You can pick up the tennis ball off the ground with the Chuck It without having to hunch over . If you have back problems , this product may change your fetching experience . Highly recommended !
2 #### I recently bought this to replace an older version . It is too flimsy and I ca n't throw the ball nearly as far . Bummed .
5 #### Sadly , my dog is n't into chasing things and I had hoped this toy would get her excited about it but no such luck ( that 's a " manufacturing issue " with my dog moreso than this product ! ) . The chuck - it ! works exactly as advertised , no complaints there !
5 #### This is a great idea for anyone with a dog who loves to fetch . The medium size allows you to throw a standard tennis ball as well as any of the other medium balls from Chuckit . You can throw the balls very far with little effort and without getting your hands slimy form dog drool after a long day of fetch . You do n't even have to stoop to pick up the ball . My dogs drop their balls on command ( most of the time ) so I just pick it up and re - Chuckit ! It 's easy to use and very fun . I 've only had it for about a week so I 'm not sure how it 's going to hold up , but it seems pretty sturdy .
4 #### This was a great little gadget for playing fetch with my dog . The only reason I gave it four stars is that the tennis ball that came with it was destroyed within two throws ... it simply broke in half upon landing . But I purchased more tennis balls from the local pet supply store that are sturdier and they work just as well with the launcher . The chuckit it is definitely a back & arm saver ! No bending to get the ball and throws quite a distance with out blowing out the muscles in your arms !
5 #### Awesome product . I would recommend it . If your dog loves to chase the ball . I would buy an extra ball or two .
3 #### I had this item in my cart when I realized it might not be the length handle I was looking for . I read the current reviews and did an online search and scrolled through several pages looking at various websites and found out the 18 " handle on the small ball launcher was a 2007 model that has been discontinued , only the 14 " handle is available . I have one small ball launcher w / an 18 " handle and I 'm going to guard it very carefully ! I agree w / the other reviews that the shorter handle in the small ball launcher is harder to throw and harder to control and not in the " fun " category . On the other hand the 18 " handle for the small balls is completely indispensible ! The manufacturer is Canine Hardware and I suggest we send them lots of emails requesting they return the small ball launcher w / the 18 " handle . The reviews are correct , the 18 " handle is no longer made and ALL small ball launchers are 14 " handles .
5 #### Good price on amazon . I have n't seen the " pocket sized " Chuck - Its in pet stores I frequent either . My dog loves this . She will play fetch for hours at the park , and this helps launch the ball an extra distance . If you do n't throw it fast enough , she will actually bring the Chuck - It to you . Some dogs may chew on it , so do n't leave it around when you 're not playing fetch .
5 #### I use this launcher with Chuckit 's Ultra Ball . The launcher comes with a large tennis ball and the dog likes it but the Mega Ball Launcher with the Ultra Ball is a hit with my dog . I can throw the ball a long way , the dog gets a good run , and it 's easy on my old arm . I am older with a puppy ; the launcher prevents a sore arm .
5 #### I love these Throwers , which I get for the use at my local Dog Park . They are durable and well made and after the original ball is ruined by slobbering dogs , chewing and crunching on the balls , the nice thing is that they can be used with regular tennis balls .
4 #### These are the best made Ball Throwers ..... I wanted the one for the Standard Tennis Ball , but was not paying attention , and ordered these by mistake . Since I purchased them for my local dog park , where there are dogs of all sizes , I decided to keep these and ordered new ones . As for the product , they are the best of the ones they make and since they are being used in a dog park where people are using them non stop , they have to be durable and lasting . Great product and Kudos to the person who created the product . I have since ordered four more of the Standard Throwers for the Dog Park ... By the way , these were a great bargain ..
5 #### We 've got a golden retriever and a pug russel mix and both of them are crazy for playing fetch . Unfortunately I have a pretty pathetic pitch . I have to give it everything I 've got to get any distance so after just a few throws my shoulder hurts , my hands are slimy and the dogs are still rearing to go . Which is why I LOVE THIS TOY ! ! I can send it so much farther without having to put in so much effort . My favorite part is having clean hands and tired dogs ! The product comes with one " Chuckit " ball but also works with standard tennis balls ( which I recommend ) . The Chuckit balls are n't very durable and it seemed like the dogs were having a harder time seeing the darker colors in the grass and water .
5 #### We have had a ton of these . They are great for big dogs with lots of energy . It takes zero effort to launch the ball 50 + yards . The BEST part is you do n't ever have to touch a slimey ball . Have the dog drop it , and then the chuck it just " clicks " right over the ball and you are ready to go . That feature might be even better than my dog being tired after 10 or so throws !
5 #### I have searched for almost a year for the smaller , shorter Chuck - It and could not find it in any retail stores . Then I thought of Amazon.com , and , sure enough , it was there . I love it because it is easier to carry and to use . And , of course , my dog loves it too !
5 #### This is a great toy for dogs who love chasing balls . I have four of them , I keep one in the car , one in the backyard and I always have a spare !
5 #### My dog absolutely loves this toy and I am grateful that I no longer have to pick up soggy tennis balls . The best money spent ! !
5 #### I bought this item because others at the local dog park made it look so easy ! Load , toss , dogs run ! Fun right ? Well there s a little more to it . it takes a quick snap , and lost of practice to get the hang of this thing , once you do , both you and your dog / s will love it . Better buy extra balls ! This thing is gon na become part of the family !
5 #### If you do not want to get dog slobber all over your hands , or if you prefer not to bend down to pick the ball off the ground each time , then this is an excellent product for you . Would recommend to owner of any dog that likes chasing after tennis balls .
5 #### This is the smallest Catch - it I 've ever seen but it works just as well as the longer ones -- but is WAYYYY more portable to the dog park , etc . Fits in a string gym bag and is a FANTASTIC purchase
3 #### I prefer the smaller chuck it ... this one is to big for me . I ca n't get any leverage on it . Probably better for a male . Either the small or this size , I would suggest buying through amazon because it saves you money- and that is always a good thing !
5 #### I can not say enough good things about this ! I have a hyper active , super energetic 8 - month lab retriever and no matter how much I do in a day to exhaust him , it 's not enough . Enter Chuck - it , which is like a godsend . It helps that he loves fetch but if your dog is n't ball obsessed , this may not be for you . But mine is , thankfully . It was nice to have a ball come with the ball launcher and it is a nice bright orange , which makes it easy to spot . The ball launcher has an intuitive design and fits my hand perfectly . It took me a while to understand how to use it properly and for the first few days , I could n't achieve the distance I would have liked to . But once you get how to use it , it 's easy ! The ball goes pretty far out and that makes the dog run , run , run ... and tire himself out . This makes him come home and pass out and that is very good news for me . I would 've liked to get the Chuck - it ball , instead of the tennis ball version that came with it but it will do for now . My dog loves this and this may be the best decision I may have made when it comes to getting him toys !
4 #### I got the for my puppy thinking it was normal sized . Whelp , I was wrong ... this ball is bigger than her head . Will have to wait awhile to use it but it does seem high quality so looking forward to that !
4 #### It 's a Chuckit but you can stuff it in a bag or even stick it in your pocket easily . It throws perfectly far enough for my needs so it suits me fine . The handle feels comfortable as well and your hand does n't get dirty . I absolutely love the throwing device . The only bad thing I can say is the ball that comes with this is OK . It 's a ball , yes , but it hardly bounces at all . Every tennis ball I 've ever used seems to be better than this ball . After a couple of throws I immediately got rid of this and used the rubber blue and orange ball they have which works way better with this . Please ditch the crappy ball . I 'd like an option to have no ball at all or come with a better ball for a little more . The weakness of the product ? Well , I 've bought two now because I stuck my first one in my pocket and it must have fallen out at some point during our walk back from the park near my parent 's house . This is all my fault so I 'm just warning you guys . My 4 star rating is based on the horrible ball that comes with it .
5 #### What a great product , had the smaller one that takes tennis ball size ( balls ) but our German shepherd needs the bigger size ball . This combined with the ultra ball - large , is great no more slobery dirty hands from picking the ball up to throw for him and no more sore shoulder from throwing . In fact i have to be carefull not to fling it too hard or the ball lands miles away . I ordered 2 so that when my husband comes out with us we do n't have to keep swapping launcher . Made of plastic so we rinse it the same time as we wash the mega ball . Would recommend this to anyone whose dog loves to chase the ball .
5 #### Both of my Pit Bulls adore this toy . It 's a little shorter than the regular one , but still goes a good distance . It holds regular tennis balls and anything that size . When I first started bringing my new dog to the dog park , the Chuck - It was my way to get his attention , and for him to follow me to the exit to leave so I did n't have to chase him down . It 's like it hypnotizes my dogs . Gives them fabulous exercise too !
2 #### We bought this to use in our backyard as it said it was a smaller version to throw the balls a shorter distance . They were n't kidding . We have a full - size chuckit and this junior version and this really does n't throw nearly as far . I 'd say the average adult could throw just as far as this , so we 've kind of rotated this out of usage and just use the full - size if going to a park and simply throw the ball by hand if we 're in the backyard . This was a waste of money as you can just use the full - size for shorter distances too and simply not throw the ball as far .
5 #### My dog loves playing fetch and does n't tire quickly so this was a life saver for my arm . I definitely recommend !
5 #### I had an old " chuckit " and after many years it finally cracked from years of use and outdoor elements . So glad I was able to find a replacement online . I have limited mobility in my right arm and this product allows me the ability to toss a ball for my dogs with very little effort . I can throw pretty good distances which would be impossible without the Chuckit . I love it ! ! !
5 #### We have a standard poodle with a ball fetish . She loves ( and this is not a strong enough word ) tennis balls or anything that can be thrown and returned . We have a large backyard but when I throw the tennis ball ( without the Chuckit ) , she just looks at me with an exasperated , " Really ? " The Chuckit allows me to throw the ball clear across our ( did I mention large ? ) yard . I can throw it for a long time without ever getting a sore shoulder or arm and the BEST PART is that I never have to touch a slobbery , muddy ball . Picking the ball up with the Chuckit is very easy , as long as the dog is n't attacking the ball while I 'm trying to get it off the ground . This is a highly recommended product . We 've had three ( ours stay outside and get chewed on and bent by the kids at some point ) . And I will continue to buy them as others wear out .
3 #### Slightly disappointed with the short range this throws the ball . I purchased to use with my golden retriever and was n't much of a challenge for him because it did n't launch the ball far enough . I 've used the standard size chuckers in the past and they have much better range . This one might be better suited for a small dog where long distance is n't the priority .
5 #### I like this product for playing with the pup in water ( me on shore / pup in water ) . I can throw the ball clear across the lake if I wanted to - but losing the ball is n't the intention . :) It 's also good if you have a large grassy area to play fetch in . You do n't need to use any force when throwing , the stick does all the work . I 'd actually feel sorry for a dog that had to retrieve the ball if you were genuinely trying to throw it as far as you could - I have no idea how far it could really fly if you hefted it . It takes a few tries to learn how to throw / fling / release , but once you 've got it , it 's easy as pie . Highly recommended for a retriever or any pup that 's constantly dropping tennis balls in your lap . Also - my pup has had a lot of Chuck - it products and has really liked every single one . The rubber tennis ball ( that fits in this arm or can be used alone ) is her favorite .
5 #### This is my second Chuck it and I am even more pleased with my second purchase . I originally purchased the Chuck It Junior but sadly left it at the park . So I bought this large one and it is even better . You get so much more momentum that the ball flies easier and farther than any human or dog could ask for . I highly recommend this product to work out your dogs ... plus my hands stay drool free ! ! !
4 #### This is the perfect sized Chuckit for my Maltese puppy . He can fit the balls in his mouth which he can not do with most because of their size . Even though it 's a " mini launcher " it still sends the ball a fair ways , especially for a small dog .
5 #### The Pocket Chuckit is great . Much easier to launch the ball compared to the original Chuckit . Found that the original Chuckit can strain your wrist and elbow if you have a needy dog and you use it too much . The Pocket Chuckit was the answer .
5 #### I use the Chuckit Mega ball launcher with regular tennis balls . I do n't use the ball that came with it . I have been using the pressureless tennis balls mostly with the Chuckit Mega ball launcher . It is much easier to throw with greater force the tennis balls with this laucher . My puppy likes to chase after the balls ; but holds in his mouth the first ball that I throw out . He has fun with it .
4 #### I would have given this 5 stars if the ball that came with it was more sturdy . I have a ball crazy lab mix and she bit through the ball in a day . She absolutely loves this thing though . If she sees me holding it she gets very excited . I use the 3 " glow balls now . They work great .
5 #### We have had this for over 4 years , and this is my Dogs favorite activity each day ! So much that know what it means when I spell F E T C H .... They ca n't get enough ! Know I do n't have touch the yucky ball , it is alot more fun for me too , and your arm never gets tired .
5 #### The ball launcher is a must for an old lady like me . I can not throw very far and the launcher helps me to get the ball out there . It helps to keep your hands free of saliva . The dog is happier because I can throw the ball further . The launcher is light and easy to use . I recommend this toy to anyone with a dog that fetches . I bought this thru Amazon .
5 #### This toy is great and keeps you from tiring out your arm before tiring out your dog . My Jack Russell mix gets so excited when he sees me get this small Chuck it out for play time . Worth every penny .
5 #### My husband and I love seeing who can launch the ball the farthest for our springer spaniel . I can barely get the ball from the pitching mound to home plate , so this thing saves my arm from having to repeatedly throw the ball short distances for the energetic dog . Some people said that they have trouble with how the ball releases from the launcher . I never had this problem -- it always released at just the right time for a perfect distance . My husband , however , has trouble with it releasing to LATE ( some people had problems with it releasing too early ) . I guess it varies from person to person !
5 #### Fits the normal size ( medium ) balls . Very compact and throws well . Need to put a little extra muscle into it if you want to throw it far , but overall a great buy and has lasted a long time . For the lazy thrower this would not be ideal because you need to bend down to pick up the ball since the reach is n't as long as the normal size .. so there is a little more work involved . If this is an issue for you , get the next size up .
5 #### Your hands can be slobber - free and your dog will chase for hours with minimal effort on your part ( if he / she brings the balls back ) . This is the perfect size for my 7 lb . poodle .
4 #### This ball launcher is good and is suitable for use with Planet Dog orbee Medium size ball . The ball that comes with it is useless though . It broker within 1 minute with my dog
3 #### thr large size was too stiff for me . the medium size is perfect for me;i do not have much arm strenght and my dog is a real jock . he loves to run and jump and this product does it for us . he gets a real workout dispite my " weak throw " by my using this launcher .
5 #### Very nice performance . Can easily chuck a tennis ball over half length of a football field . Wish there was a way to specify the color during ordering .
5 #### I have an 8 - pound toy poodle whose passion is fetching balls . Her mouth is so small she could not get the regular chuckit ball in her mouth and carry it very far . I ordered this mini - chuckit and though the ball is a little bigger than her very small balls , it works fine and she catches it in her mouth as it 's heading toward earth . I have noticed that this mini - chuckit hurles the ball much farther than the regular , which is great because she loves to go far to fetch it . We use this launcher several times a day and we never get tired of it . The ball it came with got trashed within a month so I bought Tuff Balls to replace it . We absolutely love this launcher . It 's fabulous for the beach . You ca n't go wrong with this if your little toy dog loves fetching .
5 #### I wish I would have bought this a year ago . I used to walk past this in the store and think , " Wow I should try that ! " But the 20.00 price tag always turned me away . I already had toys to play fetch with and my dog loved the frisbee so I was n't sure if he would take to the ball the same way . I saw this on amazon and had to buy it . 10.00 was a steal . Now that I have tried it I would spend the 20.00 that the big stores ask for this . I am very happy with my purchase and it shipped very fast !
5 #### Great product ! ! The dogs and I both love it . I 'm glad that I received the lime green color because I can spot it quicker if it gets left in the yard . It helps the dogs get their exercise and does n't hurt my arm or shoulder . We all get to exercise and that 's we need to be doing .
5 #### I have a Jack Russell who loves to fetch . My arm was always tired from throwing ... not any more ! And this can throw it even farther , which is a plus when I 'm trying to wear out my dog . Love it !
5 #### Easily fits in my pocket and is wonderful for getting my chubby dogs some exercise . I 'm very happy that I picked the smaller version . I slip it into my pocket while we 're walking down to the park and it is quite comfortable to carry along with me .
5 #### I bought this for my new grandpuppy as a shower gift . Her dad loved it and has already been playing fetch with her using the Chuckit . She is only 8 weeks old but already gets very excited when she sees someone getting it out of the closet . The ball that came with it is good for her age since it has a tennis ball type covering and she can easily grab it and bring it back . I also bought the smooth rubber balls which will work better for her when she is a little older.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Chuckit - Ball - Launcher - Colors - Vary / dp / B00006IX59 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Chuckit ! Ball Launcher ( Colors Vary)</a >
5 #### My Golden fits 2 balls in her mouth so she does n't have to give any back for me to chuck again . With this she can fit 2 but the front one keeps falling out and give me a chance to pick up and chuck again . Great size and so sturdy .
5 #### My dogs love this toy ! I can throw it much farther and I do n't have to bend down each time to pick up a wet , sloppy ball ! ! ! !
5 #### Our golden loves to run , and chase , these are good and easy to find in the snow . Also with my Arthritus I do n't have to bend over to pick up ....
5 #### Our Yorkie lives for her toys She will chase her ball all day if you let her . We take her to the beach a lot so her tennis balls get pretty wet and sandy YUCK . The chuckit ball is fantastic for the beach , you can throw it in the water or on the beach and it stays clean . I also love that it comes in smaller sizes for little dogs . We 've bought the smaller tennis balls for her but they get chewed up to quickly . She ca n't chew up and destroy the chuckit ball : ) and I love that . Also its amazing to me how little effort it takes to throw the ball so far . My favorite ball is the glow in the dark ball . We use that every morning since we go to work at 3 am and when I walk her that early she does n't lose track of the ball This is really the best toy / product that we 've ever gotten for our dog
5 #### Top quality material , workmanship and design . Gives you a lot of bang for your buck , ca n't hide on you with its bright orange color and the balls work perfect and are tuff or shall I say ruff ? Whoever designed this must have a few ' labs ' . I purchased extra balls also and am glad I did .
5 #### My dog Max is a ball - lover . As soon as we go outside he 's dropping a ball at your feet and will give you the death stare , or puppy dog eyes stare . So when we bought this for Max to avoid the drooly ball and bending over to pick it up , it was perfect ! He absolutely loves this thing . Once he sees our hand near it , he stands as still as a statue with one leg up , posing - ready to chase that ball . It works great , gives you an option to throw very far , pop it up , or for short throws . I recommend the shorter one for a smaller backyard or shorter throw . Fits regular sized tennis balls . Do n't bother with the ones it comes with , the bounce is n't too great . Great invention and perfect for any ball loving dog !
5 #### WATCH THOSE TENNIS BALLS CLOSELY PLEASE OUR DOBERMANS TUMMY WAS OBSTRUCTED . SHE NEEDED SURGERY . TURNED OUT SHE INGESTED A CHEWED UP PIECE OF TENNIS BALL AND THE BACTERIA SURROUNDING THE PIECE ACTUALLY CAUSED HER DEATH . SO , I BUY VERY STURDY TENNIS BALLS , WILSON BRAND IN LARGE QUANTITES AND THE MINUTE THERE IS A SMALL PUNCTURE OR TEAR I THROW IT AWAY . ALL OF MY DOG WALKING FRIENDS DO THE SAME THING . SEE MY LAB LOVES TO FETCH TENNIS BALLS , ESPECIALY WHEN THROWN WITH THE CHUCKIT ON TO THE GARAGE ROOF OR PATIO ROOF . HE RUNS ALL AROUND THE GARAGE WATCHING FOR WHICH SIDE THE BALL WILL COME DOWN AND BECAUSE HE IS TRULY A RETRIEVER FOLKS HE CATCHES IT AND BRINGS IT BACK TO ME HE GETS EXERCISE I GET FRESH AIR BUT NOT MORE EXERCISE THAN I CAN HANDLE SMILE IT 'S A WIN WIN SITUATION BUT PLEASE DO BE CAREFUL AND EXAMINE THOSE BALLS
5 #### We go to the dog park everyday . Dog owners use their regular size chuckit to launch their tennis balls . My minature poodle 's mouth is too small for a tennis ball . My dog and I watch as the larger dogs chase the tennis balls . I searched and searched in local pet stores and could not find a smaller size . Walmart had the smaller tennis balls , but no mini chuckit . Thank you MyHooves and Paws and Amazon for carrying the mini chuckit . My poodle and I are getting more exercise , and we love the mini chuckit .
5 #### We also have the Pocket launcher which is great for our back yard , with little effort I can toss the ball over 100 feet with the pocket launcher . We have a mini - Schnoodle that is crazy about playing fetch , he could keep going until my arm fell off . * In larger spaces I prefer the longer Jr. Launcher which I have no problem hitting the outfield fence from the pitchers mound of our local little league field so I can only imagine what the full size launcher can do ! My daughter and I both appreciate the fact we do n't have to handle the slobber covered and wet tennis balls . * As a side note ... My dog is hard on balls and the solid Chuck - it Ultra - ball stands up best to his rough play and chewing , also there is no fuzz like the standard tennis balls on the Ultra ball which is a huge advantage in the humid dew covered mornings of the North East . As far as I am concerned the Ultra Balls are worth the $ .
5 #### Love the Chuck - it products , Have the larger Chuck - it Jr as well . The Pocket launcher is great for our back yard , with little effort I can toss the ball over 100 feet . We have a mini - Schnoodle that is crazy about playing fetch , he could keep going until my arm fell off . In larger spaces I prefer the longer Jr. Launcher which I have no problem hitting the outfield fence from the pitchers mound of our local little league field so I can only imagine what the full size launcher can do ! My daughter and I both appreciate the fact we do n't have to handle the slobber covered and wet tennis balls . For smaller spaces the pocket launcher is all you need . My dog is hard on balls and the solid Ultra - ball stands up best to his rough play and chewing , also there is no fuzz like the standard tennis balls on the Ultra ball which is a huge advantage in the humid dew covered mornings of the north east .
3 #### Shipping time was excessive , taking about two weeks to receive from Little Family Members . The product arrived in good condition . I ordered the " mega " size as I hoped it would be too large for our three year old , black lab dog to fit entirely in his mouth so he would n't be able to chew on it as much between throws thereby lengthening the toy 's lifespan . Tennis balls do n't live very long and unfortunately the mega size did n't stay intact through day two . After only two play sessions , he managed to bust the seal of the two halves of the ball , though the external material has kept the two pieces connected . I was curious whether the mega size would also increase the throwing distance ; it did not . In hindsight , now that a local WalMart is selling the regular tennis ball size Chuckit for a dollar cheaper than retailers on Amazon.com , I think I will just invest in that one and continue to buy regular tennis balls at three for a dollar . Despite the balls ' short life span , the Chuckit launcher is a great way to enjoy the prey game with our dogs , saving us from ' slobbery ball syndrome ' .
5 #### This toy really lauches the ball with little effort- so if you have a small backyard , it may not be right for you unless you can control the throw . Awesome for dog parks and large backyards . The best aspect- I do n't have to touch the soggy ball .
4 #### This is a great thing to use to play ball with your dog and I highly recommend it . I gave it only 4 stars because I have a toy poodle who is an avid ball retreiver but her mouth is so small that she drops the regular chuckit ball several times before she gets back with it . It 's painful to watch her struggle but she is so determined . This is her most favorite thing to do . I have stopped using the chuckit but wish they had a small one for the XS Kong tennis ball , which is her favorite and fits her mouth perfect . I also have a miniature poodle , whose not into retrieving a ball , but the ball for the regular chuckit is the perfect size for him . It 's a great product for anything over a small toy dog and has many benefits to playing ball with a larger dog . So hey chuckit , how about making a small one for those little toy dogs .
5 #### We have a 8 month old male Doberman that needs lots of exercise and likes to chase a ball unless he gets distracted by a pretty little Boxer , Dalmatian or whatever other female is within 500 feet of him . We have a huge dog park that opened recently near our home and this has been a activity for us to enjoy there . This size might be overkill because you can really send the ball flying but with a little practice it works great and gives you plenty of options . My wife sends the ball about 50 yards and she is petite . I like the fact that I do n't have to pick up a ball with slobber all over it anymore . On a side note I recommend using the Chuckit medium Ultra Balls because they are easy to clean and last longer than the fuzzy balls .
4 #### Speedy delivery . In new condition . As advertised . Last week I went to Petco and tried out the longest Ultra Grip Chuckit ! , but it decided against it because it seemed just too long and the grip was n't comfortable . The 18 M Ball Launcher appears to be just right for our medium sized Vizsla ! Not to sound too nit picky - but it would be great if the launcher had a wrist strap near the handle .
5 #### This is the greatest invention since the ball . Anyone can throw the ball major distances with little effort . Saves the old arm muscles . Our Lab , Belle , loves it . She loves to play ball and could go for hours . We get tired long before she does . But with the chuck it we can keep up with her . ( well almost ) . Great product , sturdy , easy to use , fair price . I would definitely recommend this product if you have a dog that loves to play fetch .
5 #### Are you sick and tired of picking up slobbery , wet , drool dripping tennis balls ? Then the answer to your problems is in the Chuck It . I can spend hours at the part with this toy playing with me dog . It 's very sturdy and easily grabs the ball from the ground . It did take some time to be able to adjust how I threw the ball with it so that it did n't just fly into the ground ( I put too much arm swing into it ) . This toy helps you throw the ball farther than with just your arm and keeps your hands clean . The Chuck It does come in a few different sizes also , depending on the size of your dog . It also comes in a variety of colors . Something else that I like about this dog toy is that the balls come in BRIGHT colors so I never loose them ! If you have a dog that likes to play fetch with tennis balls , or a dog full of energy this is the toy for you !
5 #### My wife picked this up locally and our dog loves it , as do we . He tears the little ones up too quick and this size takes a little longer . Purchased locally the balls cost too much . Glad I found them here .
5 #### I prefer the pocket launcher over the full - sized one as I can throw it in my back - pack or even put it in my jeans pockets when we go places . If your dog is just a back - yard dog , you may not need the smaller size , but for an active adventure dog , this is a GREAT product . I use it with racquet balls a lot for my medium sized dog , since tennis balls are like sand paper for your dog 's teeth . Less dirt / sand swallowing , less saliva , higher bounce . I just wish you could pick the color . Who in the world would ever go and knowingly purchase that ugly green ? ! ? ! ? ? !
4 #### This works good for throwing tennis balls . The ball included works good too , but the ball does n't bounce very good . I also have the Chuckit Junior which is shorter . I prefer the Junior because it throws almost as far and is easier on the wrist .
5 #### Awesome lil ball thrower . Bought it not expecting much , but really suprised . My dog will run till she drops chasing balls and my arms get tired- this is a gem of a relief on me . If you have a retriever- buy one of these- will save your back not bending over to pick up ball . Well made will buy more of them
5 #### Chuckit Power Ball Launcher is small enough to take on outings and still make tossing easier on the arm and scooping up a slobbery ball acceptable . If you want something that will launch really far go for the larger model . This one works good for us because fetch is not a favorite activity for our labrador retriever and because we tend to frequent smaller areas .
5 #### My mixed breed medium size dog is very energetic . I walk him and his same sized female sidekick faithfully each day . She is relaxed most of the time , but he still has a great deal of energy . I 'm using the chuckit to give him more active playtime and it seems to be working very well . I walked him after a chuckit session and he was very well behaved , not pulling on the leash as much as he usually does . He 's having fun and I enjoy the game also .
5 #### Very easy to use and saves the ol' back , not to mention shoulder . My dog loves the throwing and getting the ball , working on the return to me part . So , for good exercise for your dog that 's not labor intensive for you , the Chuckit ! Jr. Ball Launcher is the ticket .
3 #### I love these things . They keep your hands from being covered with dirt and saliva ( especially when using those nasty dog park balls ) . I give this one three stars because the handle is a lot shorter than many others I have seen since buying this one . That means I have to bend over farther to reach the balls .
5 #### My ball - crazy dogs love this product because it flings balls so much farther than can be hand - tossed ! And I like it because it saves my arm from getting over - tired , and it 's easy to use with either arm .
5 #### This is a great item for us especially because our dog park has no grass , only dirt , and the combination of slobber and dirt creates a disgusting ball pretty quickly . Using my chuckit , I do n't have to touch the ball and I can throw it way farther than I can just by throwing . My dog is completely obsessed with playing fetch and this launcher has worked out really great for us . The only quibble I have is that it 's really hard to find 2 " replacement balls . As far as I can tell , only chuckit makes balls in that exact size and they 're really hard to find in stores near me .
4 #### I love this product ! I can exercise my dog for an hour throwing balls in the field and not wear myself out ! The only complaint I have is it is a bit bulky to carry on my walk to the park , maybe a folding or collapsible model ? But other than that It has held up to cold weather ( 10 degrees ) , many drops onto concrete and daily use for the past two months . I use it with the rubberized balls , they seem to last longer and I get better distance than the " tennis " type balls .
4 #### Anything that gets your dog exercise and time with you is something I support ! For an excellent online dog training and behavioral resource check out : [ ... ]
4 #### Purchased the chuckit for my 3 dogs . The lab looooves it . One of the others thinks it 's a giant chew toy so we have to keep it out of her reach . :) Would recommend it for any dog that is a fetching machine .
5 #### I 've had mine for 7 years now and found it is the by far the best way to exercise my tireless , ball - obsessed German Shepherd as well as my goofy , fetch - loving Lab mix puppy . When she was younger , I would take my Shepherd for daily 5 mile walks that would barely begin to drain her energy . This is the only thing I 've found that would truly tire her out ( without knocking myself out in the process ) . And even now at 7 , she 's like a puppy again every time she sees the Chuck - it come out . I had surgery on both hands this year and had a hard time throwing balls at all , never mind far enough for them to get any exercise . With this , I could still play ball with them , despite limited use of my hands . Best of all , as most other reviewers have already stated , you 'll never have to touch a slimy grass - covered ball again . Kudos to the genius who created this toy !
4 #### First Impression : Someone gave me the Chuckit Ball Launcher as a gift . It seems to be for lazy humans . Fetch is not my favorite game , so we do n't use this toy very often . However even Mom can make the ball go pretty far with the device . For the most part I just look at her like " Why did you throw the ball way over there ? " then she goes and gets it for me . Do n't get me wrong I like to chew on the ball ... But why should I retrieve it ? I 'm not a retriever ! Conclusion : If you like to fetch , this is a great device for your parents to buy . They will be able to throw the ball farther , and they wo n't wear out as quickly . Plus if they are " old " they do n't even have to bend over to pickup the ball ! They can use the Launcher as a handle and press the cup onto the ball . Nifty . 3 out of 4 stars because Rottie 's are not big on fetch .

5 #### I bought this for my best friend since she has a couple of yellow labs and she was looking for an easier way to throw a ball for them to chase . The fact that you do not have to touch the slimy ball once they bring it back is a MAJOR bonus ! ! I bought her both the regular size and the Jr. Breeze now lets my best friend know when it is time to play with the Chuck It . What a great idea / toy ! !
5 #### Ca n't have a dog that chases the ball and not own this . It is very durable , throws the ball way futher than I could manage with my arm , and best of all you do n't have to touch the ball when it is all slobbery and covered with mud and grass . I love this thing !
5 #### This is the BEST thing I could have purchased for our 2 Chesapeake Bay Retriever Puppies ! This thing wears them out ! I bought a couple , thinking that it would break eventually and I DON'T want to be without one ! Definately worth the $ $ $
5 #### I purchased this item about six months ago for my golden retriever . He loves it and so do I. No more slime ! It 's very easy to use . You obviously need a place for your dog to run , so you wo n't be using this inside the house . But it 's perfect for the back yard or the dog park .
5 #### We used to have an electric griddle that was stolen when our home was broken into . Since then I had wanted to get another one and happened to spot this one at Target . It was a differend so I was a little worried , but I figured I 'd give it a shot . All I can say is WOW ! This is too cool ! Food cooks so easily on this it does n't even feel like I 'm cooking ! Bacon , eggs , sausage , pancakes , french toast .. almost anything breakfast can be cooked on here . Omelettes are perfect , even heating and so much room . We cook hamburgers , steaks , hot sandwiches , the possibilites are nearly endless . My hubby can even use it ! The grease runs away from the food and into a removable tray so food is healthier than food sitting in a pool of grease in a skillet or fry pan . The non - stick surface works wonderfully so you do n't have to add any grease whatsoever and clean up is so simple . Just run it under water and wipe with a soapy dishrag or sponge . The only complaint is that the backstop is too short . I 've lost a slice or two of bacon that slid away from me ( VERY non - stick surface ! ) while trying to flip it ! But other than that , I could n't live without this griddle and I highly recommend it . Especially for busy families with little time to cook .
1 #### Poor quality , looks like heavy duty neoprene in picture but is actually the like a cheap thin rain coat .
1 #### .... thank goodness I looked at the customer pictures before I bought it , huge difference between the product photos & what it actually is . The product photos make it look almost neoprene & padded but its really just like the rest of the other dog seat covers .
3 #### did not fit the back seat of my f150 . had to return but did without difficulty
5 #### It looks great ! Better than I thought it would be . I like all the different configurations . I m actually ordering another one for my moms car right now !
4 #### Really like it so far . Got a brand new Subaru Forester and wanted to keep the dog hair off the backseat . So far works great .
3 #### Thought it would a great fit for my Camry but not so much . If the headrests were adjustable it might fit better but since mine are stationary I am unable to pull the seatbelt ends through making it difficult to secure the pooch in the back of the car . If you own a smaller car like Nissan Sentra or Corolla this will fit perfectly .
5 #### These are PERFECT with my new Paraffin Bath . I ordered this and the Paraffin Bath from the same seller . I am really pleased with my purchases .
5 #### I liked this as soon as I took it out of the box . This is like no other seat cover I have seen . This is extremely thick with thick rubber coating . It is rugged , waterproof , and will hold up to anything a 100 pound dog can do to it . It does not wrinkle up in a ball and pull off the seat when the dog moves around . You can dump a few quarts of water on it and your seat will stay dry . The ' lip ' around the edge of the cover prevents any dirt or water to run over onto the seat or floor . You can clean this by simply giving it a shake , wiping it off with a washcloth , sweep it with a whisk broom , or rinse it off in the hose . This is going to outlast any other seat cover . If you have a large dog , or even a small dog that is active and loves dirt , this is the right cover for them .
5 #### I decided to treat myself to new hangers and these are great . Tired of plastic ones breaking .
5 #### Great security bulb . I have the outside Zenith security lights with separate detector . They have only lasted a few years , then the detector stops working . This resulted in replacing the entire Zenith unit . These bulbs do not need that type of unit . Detector built in the bulb . It has outlasted the Zenith product . If it does fail . Just put a new bulb in .
4 #### The Velcro on the inside can be a bit scratchy and I wish there was a strap on the outside but these did the job and help insulate during paraffin wax treatments .
5 #### This is the best tray and does n't waste any space . Feels like good quality too .
5 #### Worked like a charm and did n't scratch the pan at all ! ! the design is really nice and allows for long - term whisking without my forearm begging for mercy . :) I did n't know what to think when I first saw it .. seemed cheap hard plastic , but it 's really great .
5 #### These mitts are just perfect to cover up my tiered hands while I have paraffin on after a long typing on computer day at work . They keep heat for an hour or so and feet perfectly and secure . Velcro works incredible as well to secure them by not moving around . Fabric is on softer side and lining would keep these mitts last me forever . You got to get these , plus price from this company is very reasonable compare to other sellers . Would buy from them again .
5 #### These work great for cutting hair & beard . Sharp & comfortable . A good length for me . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Queentools - Professional - Barber - Scissors - Shears - Kit - with - Straight - Shears - and - Thinning - Shears - Pack - of-2 / dp / B01823USD0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Queentools Professional Barber Scissors Shears Kit with Straight Shears and Thinning Shears , Pack of 2</a >
5 #### I purchased it for my sister and she liked it a lot .
5 #### I use these for keeping my wax - dipped hands warm . I found that they work best if I put my hands in a ziplock bag first and then put the mitt on . Otherwise the wax sticks to the inside of the mitt and is not easy to get off .
3 #### Disappointed that this does n't keep my decaf coffee very hot . Maybe for an hour , but that 's about it . I do like how large it is , as I really like to guzzle my coffee !
5 #### This is a bit pricey , but once bought , you should n't need to replace it . I found one at a thrift store for a quarter , but liked it so much that I bought one at full price for my daughter . These are gentle on the pan , and really get out all of the clumps . Mine has held up for years .
5 #### These mitts retain the heat from the paraffin longer than ay others I 've tried . I have arthritis and paraffin dips for my hands and feet help tremendously . Only problem , you need help putting them on if you want to dip both hands . Expensive - yes . Worth the price - I would say so if you want paraffin therapy for arthritis .
5 #### This one is a great organizer for item for TV . Will hold multiple remotes , ink pens , I use the drawer for nail items , clippers , files , etc . Bought 2 , one for living room and one for the bedroom .
1 #### Too bulky and could n't figure out how to use . It came with no instructions for so many straps .
5 #### High quality . Great organization options . Looks nice to boot .
5 #### I finally found the perfect grinder ! ! ! Super sleek design , perfect for herbs and works like a beast ! ! ! ! ! Love it and should the need arise in yhe future ( which .. let 's be real .. will totally happen ) I will absolutely buy again !
5 #### Very nice , well made , heavy weight , I love it !
5 #### My cat was getting far too smart about sensing when his pill was wrapped in a Pill Pocket or other soft treat , so I turned to this mortar and pestle . It works great ! I can easily grind the pill into powder , which I mix into wet cat food .
5 #### Good product . I 've had this for awhile and it seems to be holding up fine and it had good storage space for what it i s.
5 #### My fianc loves this blanket . I can find him any given night cocooned in it on the couch or in bed . Now that it is winter in NC the cocooning has increased and it is if he and the blanket have become one . He plans on purchasing another one for camping .
4 #### Nice . High Powered compared to other models I have seen . Beware as per the posting these do not have protective layer so do n't touch ! Some lighter current models for smaller bugs do have a protective layer .
5 #### In love ! So much better than using my straighter every day !
5 #### Best little whisk I have ever used and it works on non stick pans with no fear of scratching .
5 #### So far it 's perfect . I bought a 1 cup bottle of whipping cream . I cleaned the canister and dried it thoroughly . Then I put the canister in the fridge over night . The next day , I put the cream in a measuring cup , added 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar and a splash of vanilla . I stirred slowly for a minute , let it sit for a few minutes and then stirred slowly a little more to ensure the sugar was all dissolved . I then poured the mixture into the canister , put the cap on , put the cartridge in it 's metal holder and screwed it on . You can hear the hissing as the gas in the cartridge is released into the canister . I then let it sit for a minute or two . Then I shook it , until it felt like there was no more sloshing . I counted 10 shakes , but I counted , 1 up , 1 down , not 1 up then down . I then put the dispensing nozzle on , turned it upside down and pushed the lever over a small paper plate . Voila ! Whipped cream just like my mother used to make with a stand mixer , a metal bowl kept in the freezer overnight , and admonition a to various daughters to not screw it up and make butter . I ca n't wait to try various flavors of whipped cream .
5 #### Really , stunningly beautiful lamp ...... hard to believe that it does n't cost thousands of dollars . Everyone who has seen it has been stunned by its beauty . It is bright , too ..... it has so many colors -- greens , golds , reds , whites , ambers ( no blues ! ) that it would go in any room . Highly worth the money and a very good investment ! Also , it was shipped promptly and was very easy to assemble . The details are amazing on this too ... lots of textures and even the amber globe of glass adds to its elegance !
5 #### These are beautifully designed hangers . They are sturdy and have excellent clips for securing one 's garments .
5 #### I needed to replace the one I left behind in a divorce . Delighted to find it in RED ! Ought to come with the gold plated filter basket .
4 #### Item came as pictured and described with the exception of the cover . The cover I received was of less quality than I expected . The cover is not critical to its function , but is nice to have in certain applications , hence the rating of 4 rather than 5 .
5 #### These are a really neat way to store some dry items , only improvement is for them to make the opening slightly larger . I would love to fit some cereal in here without crushing it . Otherwise a great high quality product !
5 #### My 2 year old granddaughter loves it and so does my daughter . No spills which makes this perfect for car travel
5 #### I love the quality of these glasses ! The color is wonderful , they are solid ( not too thick , not too thin ) , and I just love the tiny bubbles in the glasses themselves . I originally thought the glass was clear , and the bottom was turquoise , but there is a blue hue overall . The bottom of it is just a deeper hue .
5 #### These far exceeded my expectations . They are awesome for keeping just about anything . I have used them for beverages ( no leaking ) and I have also used them for storage of dried goods in my pantry ( cheezits , trail mix , M&M 's ) . Nice display and you can see what irks in there crystal clear ! ! I am ordering more ! ! ! !
5 #### Great mugs - last forever and got a new one for me !
5 #### cool shower hangers , love them ! Hard to find shower hooks with decorations like this .
5 #### On time and as advertised . Perfect for what I need .
5 #### Works perfect on my desk . It has a big enough drawer to hold note paper and stamps etc , but still does n't take up too much room .
5 #### I own so many of these mugs . Keeps my coffee hot all day and I can just throw it in my bag . Never leaks !
5 #### I love this thing . I did n't know there were so many things I could do with a whipped cream dispenser . Mouses , flavored whipped creams , non - sugar /alternatively sweetened whipped creams , savory cream garnishes , low - carb treats . This dispenser is well - made and a perfect size for a refrigerator door shelf . It does n't take up too much room . I am also looking forward to using it to make carbonated beverages .
5 #### I sooooo love this mug . Fill this baby up and you already included your refill . No need to bring two mugs in the car anymore if you 're out running errands . One BIG mug is all I need ! ! Love it . The white color is really nice too . You bet I recommend this mug .
5 #### Great to use to retain heat while paraffin is on your hands .
5 #### Look great - washed up nice - grouped them on the counter .
5 #### Bought for my mom . She uses it on her night stand and keeps her controllers in there and her bills , checkbook , some of her meds , pens and alot more . She loves it
3 #### Pan is nice but my lid came broken twice . Returning and buying a tfal set
3 #### the lids craked the very first time e took the off after just one use
5 #### This product is awesome . The company owners are awesome ( mine got delivered to a neighbor and we think the notice he stuck to my door blew away ...... so I did n't know it had been left with the neighbor ) . The owners called me directly when I emailed to ask where my saw was . Lovely people , very helpful ....... and gave me a follow - up call too . Getting back to this product . I am a woman in my 50 's and find using this saw SO easy and I actually enjoy having to use it . I have palm trees and this cuts the dead fronds through like they are butter ! Then the little hook at the end pulls the fronds down from the tree . Some of the trees are about 20 feet high . No problem with the extension , I can easily reach . It 's easy to put together too ( when the extension part is needed ) . My husband too is amazed at the quality and ease of use of this pole saw and the price is exceptional . I love this thing .
5 #### I 'm not baking cupcakes with them at all , but using them as dividers inside my tiffin , a compartmentalized metal lunch pail of Asian Indian origin ( sort of like the Japanese bento boxes ) . Bento culture has lots of clever accessories to divide and section foods . One can mail off to get them from Japan , but these cupcake molds work too . For instance , I just set up a lunch with figs , cucumber slices and grapes in the same compartment , each nested in one of these baking cups within the larger compartment . I like these because they seem sturdy , flexible enough to squash into the overall tiffin shape , but not flimsy -- that is , they appear to be strong enough to hold up to repeated washing .
5 #### How did I ever cook before I had this thermometer ? This is fast , easy to ready , easier to use , and easy to keep clean . Super simple , very accurate , and could n't be any easier . I LOVE this item and truly ca n't imagine cooking meat , chicken , or so many other things without it . When it says heat to 150 now you can confidently heat it to exactly 150 and remove it before it overcooks but yet be confident it is cooked enough . I was sold because of the great reviews and now I am happy to leave a review of my own letting people know how good this product is .
5 #### Great Water Bottle keeps ice for a long time . Liked it so much I bought one for my sister .
4 #### Works on wine and olive oil . May pop off on fizzy products
3 #### Hmmm ... these 24 reviews for the pasta drying rack have a lot in common . All are 5 stars , many written on the same day , and not a single one is grammatically correct English . Not sure if I 'll be purchasing this .
5 #### Very practical . I use it to go to the pool . It helps to keep everything in order . Good size . Main compartment fits the bath towel . Pockets are big enough for regular bottles of shampoo , cream and shower gel . Not an elegant thing , but very useful and seems well done for now .
5 #### Very expensive for a lightbulb but has exceeded my expectations . I waited until it was in use for over a month before posting this review to make sure it kept working . It has . I 'm using it for my front porch which has a high ceiling ( about 11 ' ) with a recessed can fixture . This really fit the bill as I did n't have any other option with that kind of fixture for motion sensing operation . I live in Michigan & we 've had an early cold snap which did n't affect its operation at all . My son parks in the drive & comes in from work every night & it 's worked flawlessly ! It 's really nice because it comes on when anyone gets within about 8 ' of the porch then stays on for about 3 minutes as promised . Was pleasantly surprised that we do n't trigger the lamp from inside the house . I 've got a large transom window above the front door & two side light windows . We can walk past the door & thankfully , the light does n't come on . All I can hope is that it 's got longevity . Works great in conjunction with my Ring Video Doorbell&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Ring - Wi - Fi - Enabled - Video - Doorbell / dp / B00N2ZDXW2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Ring Wi - Fi Enabled Video Doorbell</a >
5 #### Love LOVE love it ! I use this item everyday . Put two Velcro dots on it , then two other on dashboard , so it CHARGES in the sun while I 'm driving around , but does n't slide across the dash . Wish they came back in stock , because I want to buy a couple MORE ! I drive for a living , often at night , so being able to open my driver 's side window and FLASH light on street signs-- ESPECIALLY when it 's raining-- is WONDERFUL . THANKS !
5 #### My husband and I always get a Chuck Norris Calendar every year , I do n't know who comes up with these sayings but they are very creative ! We enjoy this calendar year round and we will always buy a chuck norris calendar as long as my husband is around . You will enjoy this calendar I guarantee it !
5 #### Excellent , high volume 13 - 1/2 " tall faucet . Easy install but would prefer wider sink flange for added stability . If you want a tall faucet , this is a great price , value and construction . If you want this for dispensing filtered water the flow may seem low due to resistance at the filter , but it works well with half inch or larger supply.to filter .
5 #### Good mix of blades for use on the job site
5 #### These are so different with the bubbly texture -- love them !
5 #### I really love these 18 oz bubble glasses . They have a wonderful feel in your hand and a quality thickness when you drink from them . The aqua color is pretty much the same as shown and I will buy more as needed . All arrived in perfect condition on time . I just wish Amazon would offer the matching aqua pitcher .
5 #### I love these glasses . They are quite sturdy . The texture combined with the color gives these a unique look and they work well as a casual glass or dressed up !
5 #### These are the best bags for me . I wo n't ever have something inside come out snagged . Also , items with hooks and eyes do n't get caught in the bag . The best !
5 #### Absolutely ! My mixer can now sit on my counter without me having to worry about any scratches .
5 #### I think these pegs are better than the standard ones that come with the machine !
5 #### This pan is affordable AND durable . I 'm so pleased with this purchase .
5 #### These work great for beer as well as wine and they clean really easily . Great price after doing much research for the type that was the most versatile . Love the bright colors .
5 #### My last name is Pessolano , is italian . My family makes all kinds of pastas , we love pasta , in every sizes or what ever way you can make the pasta . My favorite pasta are linguine , fettuccine and spaghetti . My father bought this Pasta Drying Rack because we prepare our own pastas at home . And we needed something for dry the pasta . This one is pretty good because the wood have not chemical products .
5 #### This was used for the first time over the mothers ' day weekend when I made fettuccine for the family . It 's big enough to dry pasta for 8 people and a huge help to ensure pasta does not get tangled . I have made fettuccine previously without this and believe me , it was very difficult to air dry what I had made . Fabulous product . You will use this for years to come .
5 #### This thermometer works great . So far , I 've used it for grilling . It has ensured that I get perfect grill marks on my ribeyes .
4 #### These are great at getting insects inside or outside your house . It is not a toy but is fun to use on the bugs . Got one for a neighbor , but the zapping sound bothers his dogs .
5 #### These are adorable , and a change from yellow corn holders . I tried some other shapes ( cows as an example ) but they got stuck during corn rotation when applying butter in a corn holder . These do not get stuck , and my kids enjoyed them . They are easy to clean , and are only sharp where the tines secure the corn . These seem to be dishwasher safe , are well made , and comfortable to hold .
4 #### No more forgetting to bring items to the shower . This is very cool , I just pack it with all of my products and carry it with me into the bathroom . I have everything that I need to look good from head to toe . I wish it was a little larger . I received this product at a discount price for my honest review .
5 #### These work really well and are a lot of fun ! Makes swatting Mosquitos a lot easier . Going to get some of these for fun gifts with a purpose
5 #### Works great ! Heats up fast ! I have thick hair and it does an excellent job on it !
5 #### Now , I was n't sure what I was getting when I ordered this . I stumbled on a discount code and thought I could always use another bag right ? This bag is made entirely of that fantastically heavy mesh and has sooo many pockets all the way around I almost drooled . I 'm an artsy person and am often packing art supplies , especially stained glass stuff . This bag is Tote is advertised as a shower thing , but OMG NO .... Crafters need this ! Why ? It 's super easy to organize stuff in , clean up is a snap on it , and its just the perfect size for most art disciplines . It 's not round like the pictures kinda imply . Honestly the seller has horrible pictures of this item . In person , this bag is soooo much neater ! It 's square , very sturdy , and super cool . I 'd recommend this to anyone who remotely loves bags like this . It would even work WONDERS for beach going ( sand slides through the mesh ! ) or someone dragging a lot of camera lenses around etc . It 's worth every penny they want for it . The only thing I could suggest was offering it in more colors . The blue is nice though . The silver is almost reflective and really makes it look high end . I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review .
4 #### I got this for the gym to keep in my locker and be able to grab all at once for the shower . It is a great bag , but I wish the explanation of it was better . It has a total of 8 outside pockets . As you go around it there are 2 large , 2 medium , 2 large and 2 medium pockets . Then there is the very large area in the middle ( they show a towel in it if I remember correctly ) . My only ' con ' for it is that there is not a small sleeve to hold a toothbrush and it could use a ' pocket ' in the middle area for small items ( place to put my earrings while I swim ) . It does hold quite a bit and the pockets are plenty big enough to hold full size bottles of shampoo etc . Handles are nice and sturdy ; easy to carry . Sorry ; I made a mistake . There are only 6 pockets . Two are large ; four are a bit smaller . Also has nice , sturdy handles .
5 #### Adding a little Disney Magic to my day is a GOOD thing . This is adorable !
5 #### Fits great ! Works just right . Good price . Received promptly w / no excess packaging .
5 #### I 'm really enjoying this product . Unlike desk one 's i 've bought here before this is clearly good quality paper and I really like the little dotted lines in the days so that I can keep things neat looking . I 'll definitely look for this brand again in the future .
4 #### I have been getting this calendar since the mid 1990 's . Never fails to entertain and just when life at work gets truly unbearable - there is a cartoon that fits the bill so well that I make copies and sneakily spread them around ..... ;)
4 #### Stunning addition to my collection - its really pretty and love the dimmer ! !
3 #### The price is high , but I would expect that if it was a lot better . This is just an average wet stone grinder with a few mediocre attachments . I sent mine back and bought the Easy Wood carbide tools . My turning has not been better ( nor easier ) .
5 #### Loved the design on each page . The bottom corners allow you to mark special dates for each month at the beginning of the year without having to tear the calendar apart . Very strudy and hangs well .
4 #### Cute ! Very cute ... my only concern , the top glass does n't seem to be of much quality and is sturdy , not specifically shaped for the lamp . Fingers crossed it will last me a long while :-)
5 #### This gets the most stubborn wounds to close up and heal . It is stinky but worth using anyway . Might be offensive near the face ...
5 #### Perfect for experimenting with different cocktails . Easy to care for .
5 #### Gave as a Christmas gift . The girls flipped out over it . The box it comes in is as nice as the tea set.cup is a little on the small size but not a problem .
5 #### This is a quality product at a very reasonable cost . It 's attractive and heavy and just as pictured . I gave it as a gift and was happy with purchase . Would purchase again .
5 #### Very cute - purchased another set for our daughter and son - in - law .
5 #### Great stocking stuffer for Christmas ! My husband gets this every year and we all get to enjoy the funny cartoons throughout the year .
5 #### I bought this as a gift & opened it to be sure it was n't broken . The box is VERY cute and can be used for " something else " later . ( It has a ribbon on the side of the box too . ) The cup and saucer are VERY cute . I am very pleased . I would n't hesitate to buy another one .
5 #### Fits well , does n't get dirty easily , has really protected my phone when I drop it . Has a pretty shimmer to it as well .
5 #### Love these baking cups . One of my favorite items to purchase - especially in fun colors . These are high quality .
5 #### This item does keep water cold and ice is still in the bottle at the end of the day . I do n't drink hot drinks so I ca n't say if it work the same for hot .
5 #### I love love love the bag fasteners . I use them for everything , I have them on bags of walnuts , almonds , loaves of bread , chocolate that I use for making Buckeyes they are absolutely wonderful and so easy to use . I ordered a set of larger fasteners from QVC and then I found them here on Amazon . These are smaller than my original orders and I find I use them much more . This fan , is my second set . By getting them Amazon I am saving approximately . The price of the fasteners is a touch lower than QVC + I have free shipping with Amazon . The total cost from qvc would be approximately 30 dollars . I think that is a big savings . As the saying goes , tried these and you will like them.actually the saying is try it and you 'll like it but it does n't fit my description here .
4 #### While these corn holders do n't offer the best grip ever , they are a little bigger and sturdier than the standard cheap holders that I had previously . They 've also been put through the dishwasher in the cutlery bin without incident , which is critical to me for easy clean up .
4 #### I like it but it 's an odd configuration . Right now i 'm questioning the durability of the attachment that holds the two green poles together . Time will tell . Only used once so the jury is still out . If it fails I 'll update .
5 #### I needed a " masher " that was a lot smaller than a potato masher , in order to mash my dogs food and soften it . I know these are meant to be used for cocktail purposes but this set is perfect for any " mini mashing " you might need to do . They are made of a very hard plastic material that is actually pretty heavy and almost feels like wood . But they are plastic and it makes them very easy to clean also . If you have a need for a mini - masher , these 3 masher 's should take care of any of your mini - mashing needs !
5 #### This is beautiful . And it is quite large . I use it on my dining room table . Every night when it turns on it makes me happy . I am easily entertained . I love it !
5 #### Great price and quality . Perfect for any disney lover .
5 #### Makes pretty spiral curls and beach wave hairstyles super easy . I 've had my Ribbon curler for a while and it still looks brand new . The quality is good , heats up fast , and makes curls that last all day long . LOVE IT ! !
4 #### These are a good solid muddlers . One solid piece of plastic . Our one comment is we wish the head if the muddler were a bit bigger . They fit inside of the glass just a bit small . Still feel like they were a good buy .
5 #### I love this ice chest ! It holds snacks , sodas , and ice for a canoe trip or a picnic . Easy to transport and weighs nothing when empty . It does n't leak and it a good size . I own this one and a smaller personal one and a larger one , it 's a nice medium size . The only thing is I wish it came in a lighter color so it does n't absorb all the heat from the sun .
5 #### This awesome looks perfect above the fire place . Love the timer on the lantern , and it brings a warm glow . Very stylish , arrived quicker than what was said , so it was a surprise !
5 #### My son thought this was the best Seder plate ever : very easy to see the foods with both their names . Perfect for families with elementary school age children .
4 #### You have to have a plug in that is high enough of the floor to keep the dogs tail from knocking the glass off . ( That 's if you have a dog like I do ) Otherwise , it 's awesome , pretty bright though , can almost be used as a lamp to light up a whole room . You sure this is on a 30W ? It lights up my laundry room like a 50 watt bulb would .
5 #### These napkins are Very cute And sturdy . Definitely quality . Enjoyed having them for our party and will purchase again for the next
5 #### These are in my Paris theme 2nd bath , and they are adorable . They have a vintage look to them . Recommend !
5 #### Guess I must have read the dimensions wrong , this was much bigger than expected for these money paid . Appears to be well made . Very happy so far , this was bought as a gift hopefully they will be just as pleased .
5 #### Great for a dog 's first birthday party ! Fun and festive and would recommend . Good quality and basic napkins . Nice , large size .
5 #### SURPAHS Super - Thin Digital Kitchen Scale is a one great food scale . I got this scale and it is just as advertised . All I had to do was pull it out of the box and it was ready to go . The scale is super thin and very accurate . You never know when you will need a scale till you need one . This scale is good for holiday meals when you need to be precise with your measurements on particular meals . This scale maybe also be good for people who are on a diet and have to weigh food in order to stay within the perimeters of their diet . I can not speak highly enough about this scale , I love it . Thank you for reading my review . I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation .
5 #### This is a good flashlight . It has three settings : high , low , and strobe . It is compact and bright . The flashlight is built well . This is a quality buy for the value and cost .
5 #### Fabulous gift for my son - in - law who teaches stage combat . I am always looking for something related and these Corn Skewers are perfect . They look sturdy and fit nicely in the hand .
4 #### I ordered and used used these napkins for my pup 's first birthday . Several owners and their dogs meet most Saturday and sometimes on Sundays in the morning . The dogs have a blast . So I threw a " paw - Ty " for my pup . The napkins are standard in quality but added to the " dog theme " . By the way the dogs did n't use them , the humans did with the refreshments I made for the owners . Enough said ....
4 #### These are well made party napkins . The colors are brighter than the photo , the paper is as good as any party napkin .
5 #### If you 've never tried the ratchet system , you do n't know what you 're missing ! It may sound too good to be true , but this lopper enables me to cut branches that would otherwise be too hard for me to do . The ratchet system really saves strain on the tendons , muscles and joints . Bought my first one about 20 years ago ( they last forever ! ) , and I would NEVER go back to the old type of loppers ! Let the ratchet do the work for you ( read the directions so you understand the process ; otherwise , you might be overriding the system that does all the work for you ) . Would also recommend the mini - loppers ; however , if you can only afford one set of loppers , get this one because it will handle the small stuff but also tackle the really thick branches . Absolutely love it !
5 #### I was very happy with the ratcheting design and the tool 's ability to cut through thick branches . It will earn its keep around our place pruning low limbs and cutting kindling wood .
4 #### Unlike most cars and trucks , this is a huggable stuffed toy which a baby who always stops for fire trucks would like . But " Bronx Toys " is in name only . The company is in Long Island and the toy is " hand made in China " , which , considering how cheap it is , raises concerns about how little the hand - makers are being paid .
5 #### loved this curling iron that I bought one more ! it makes beautiful curls and they last very long . Highly recommended
5 #### I bought this boot for a college guy . He loved it . The seller states that it is the one from the movie , but actually the foot part is a little smaller than the movies boot . But it was as close as I could find . He had no complaints !
5 #### I purchased this clock to go on my fireplace mantel . The wood grain and face of clock makes it look expensive . I love the 6 Hi - Fi melodies that play on the hour . The clock has a volume control in the back and can be turned down or turned off at night . This clock is exquisite as far as wood grain texture and over all gives that expensive cost look . For $ 99.00 is was well worth the purchase .
5 #### I developed a wound on my right leg 4 years ago that put me in the hospital for 6 days . They had no clue what was wrong with me even with cultures of the wound .. they called the CDC from St. Louis and even they were stymied ! After 8 months of antibiotics and pain my leg got a little better but the infection stayed . Recently it began to open a new wound and I used this awesome product Zim 's Wound Care and it is healing so well and granulating in . This is worth gold ! AWESOME product and kudos to Zim 's !
5 #### Gave it to her for Christmas and she loved it - she made me gain 250 pounds in two months from eating pancakes ;)
4 #### First Impression : Nutri - Vet heard about my website ! They decided to send me a bag of their Peanut Butter flavored biscuits . Well what dog does n't love peanut butter ? ? ? Right now my hips are fine , but I 'm a young pup at a mere 13 months . I 'm sure as time progresses I 'll run into some sore joints , just like all large breed dogs do . So I 'm happy to know that there is something out there that can help , and tastes as good as this ! Conclusion : Tastes great , no animal bi - products , resealable bag , and it tastes like PB !
5 #### Our older dogs needed some extra help and we tried these , along with high quality food with added glucosamine and chondroitin .... our dogs love these and help by giving them that extra boost . Used just like any dog treat , they eat them right up . Highly recommend these for any dog with hip issues from getting older . Definitely help .
5 #### My dog lets me know when it 's time for her bone . Hope it 's helping her joint pain .
5 #### One dog liked these and another did not . I have a picky dog and a not so picky dog . My dog who enjoyed them has shown some improvement in a very short amount of time . I d say two weeks or so . My other dog does nt have hip issues but is a German shepherd so I wanted to try and give her a preventative . I have to smash the treats up and mix them with wet food for her .
1 #### My pups , who will literally gobble anything edible ( anything being the operative word ) can not be enticed to eat these supplements / bones no matter what I smear on it .
5 #### all of my dogs love these , though I ca n't say for sure if it 's helping with joints
5 #### My dogs love them and run around like puppies .
5 #### my german shepherd loves these ! He 's only 1 , so he has n't developed any hip / joint problems yet so I 've been using these as a preventative . Good sized bones , and the bag is HUGE . directions are " Give half a bone twice a day for every 40lbs of body weight " , so if your dog is less than 40lbs these probably are n't for you .
5 #### Our three Bullmastiffs really like these ! Our vet had been after me to give glucosamine and chondroitin to our older two , but I could not find any form of pills or treats that they would take . I tried these cookies and they love them ! At least I know they are getting a good amount of glucosamine now with these treats .
4 #### I have been giving this , along with Cosequin D I have been giving this , along with Cosequin DS , to my 13 year old Lab and she is still able to jump up on our bed and go up and down the stairs . Do n't know if this alone is responsible , or a combination of the two , but I would definitely recommend trying it .
5 #### These biscuits are very hard , so we saw them in half for our small dogs . They love the flavor , and get lots of chewing exercise . An easy way to administer glucosamine .
4 #### Very large . Not too great if you have a small dog . A Great Dane or German shepherd would love them . They work , though , for my neighbor 's dog ; he loves them !
5 #### I always have 2 bags in the house , one as back up so I do n't run out . The dogs love them . They are a good size for their morning snack .
5 #### I have an aging border collie that started limping about a month ago . We took him into the vet and had an X - ray done , nothing that they could find other than minimal arthritis . The vet said it would n't help to give him a supplement because the damage was already done , but for $ 12 a bag it was worth a shot . I bought two 4 pound bags from my local tractor supply store and have been giving him 2 a day since we started . I have seen a 100 % turn around and rarely see him limp anymore , if any at all . His muscles are starting to come back and overall he seems a lot happier . I am hooked and bought the smaller bones for my schnauzer too . He 's only a puppy , but it 's good to start now ! They 're both picky eaters and jump for joy when they hear the bag crinkle .
5 #### Our 8 y / o lab mix loves these treats ! ! It is so much easier to give these than glucosamine tablets .
5 #### My dog has one biscuit every day after his morning walk . He loves the biscuits and they are good for him .
5 #### These have to be my dog 's favorite treats . Will turn down other treats including jerky for these peanut - butter crunchies . And it 's good for them on top of it ! Yes , it 's expensive especially when you have 4 dogs like I do but they need their glucosamine and I want healthy and happy dogs so this is the ticket .
3 #### These treats are huge . This was not stated in the description
5 #### BEST stuff for a large dog with arthritic joints . Our dog got to the point she would not even get up and walk to her food . The same ingredients in this bone were in her $ 60 pills from the vet ; however the pills just did n't work . After one night on these bones , she was up and walking . Within three days she was chasing squirrels and has not looked back since . Its a miracle !
5 #### My dogs love these . They are much bigger than I expected but I just break them in half . I strive to provide honest and non - biased reviews , If you found my review helpful please feel free to use the vote buttons below . If there is anything you would like to know or feel I may have left please feel free to leave a comment . Thanks !
5 #### Chubby old Beagle seems to be much more comfortable with her afternoon cookie . She 's been eating baby bunnies again because she can finally catch them like the good ol days .
3 #### I have bought these multiple times and really liked the results but this time the dogs wo n't take them , and they 're never picky
5 #### Our old puppies love it . takes a while to take effect .
4 #### I give this to our older dog who has issues with his hips . He seems to eat them OK .
5 #### My pug , yes a pug with 17 teeth removed , loves his daily bone . I usually break it in half which is easy to do with one hand . I have noticed that at the age of 12 he has a little more pep in his step .
5 #### My dogs love em ! AND they are approved by the National Animal Supplement Council . That 's important since many pet supplements do not contain the actual amount of the active ingredient that they list and the NASC is an independent organization that confirms the labels . The FDA does n't regulate pet supplements at all . Quite a lot do n't meet their label 's claims . These biscuits probably do actually contain 500 mg of glucosamine each . The dosage labeling on the back of the bag is NOT correct . Ask your vet before starting your dog on a glucosamine regiment ! Dogs ' systems have to be primed before glucosamine can enter their system and help them . That involves a doubled dose for a week or so before dropping to the regular dose . I 'm not a veterinarian- all I have is info on my own dogs . Please ask your vet to give you dosage instructions that are specific to your pet before you start giving them these !
5 #### These are great treats . My dog does n't LOVE them but for the price and quality he 'll learn to . ;) He eats them and they 're good for him and that 's all that matters . I 've done a lot of research for hip and joint treats . The amount of good stuff they out in here and the price and the size you get can not be beat . I will buy again and again .
3 #### My dog liked these treats , but they were too big ( we 're trying to watch his weight ) and hard to break in half . Did not buy again .
2 #### My dog hates these . They arrived and they are ridiculous huge . They are also pretty darn hard
5 #### Arrived quickly ! My dog loves these treats and they are good for his older joints , especially with the colder weather coming on .
5 #### Beagle likes them and seem to really improve his hips . If your dog is limping or struggles with hip - joint get some glucosamine treats and you 'll be amazed at how much improvement you 'll see .
5 #### These are always in great shape and a great price ! The pup loves them . Stores do n't carry them anymore .
5 #### My dogs really like these and as they are passed their prime , I like the glucosamine in them . I feel these are healthier than milk bones and more substantial .
5 #### My dog really really likes these . At 15 years old , she still moves around well so perhaps these are part of the reason why .
1 #### My dog did not like these and had to throw them out .
5 #### These are great . They are very big and hard to break for smaller dogs , but one large one for my golden every morning and she loves them
5 #### My Greyhound loves these . We do n't allow him too many treats but he 's getting old and these make him feel a little better and pretty much make his day . He just turned 11 and I had to start getting him more serious joint supplements because he 's getting really stiff and these are n't strong enough anymore on their own , but I 'll probably keep buying them to have safe treats on hand that have good stuff for him in them .
5 #### Works great . Finally something my dog will eat . He 's now playing more than he did as a puppy . I swear he even has a smile on his face .
5 #### My dogs love these treats . I have been a buyer now for 8 months and will continue to do so as long as the price is affordable ..
5 #### Our neighbor 's 3 dogs love these , and wait for them eagerly every morning !
5 #### I use half a bone a day on 5 lb Chinese crested powder puff with a floating patella and she is so much more mobile and her back hips are not popping out anymore
5 #### Welove these and so do our dogs ! Haha , just kidding but our dogs love them and its great to get glucosamine for them .
5 #### My Dog Loves These ! Break into pieces for training treats . My dog is a bit slower than he used to be . But he has no specific pain problems yet . He gets these in a dose less than the full amount on a rotating basis with other types of treats . It is a great way to get proactive in avoiding problems as he ages . Sometimes I use pieces of these for training , to mix with a meal , or for a treat during a walk .
4 #### Our dogs love these , they 're a great little snack for them to munch on and having the glucosamine in them is a bonus .
5 #### Barkley loves these , and I think they are helping his hips and joints .
5 #### My pooch loves these ! He 's over 100lbs and needs lot of glucosamine . So glad we found these .
5 #### Before I started giving my dogs the treats , my oldest gal Nikki , was very sluggish and rarely active . Now it 's like she 's 5 years younger . She comes over when I fixing the dogs meals . She waits for her treat at night . She has even jumped up on the couch which I have n't seen her do in over a year . I will be buying more in the future ...
5 #### my hips are getting better day by day -- sweet dreams have i at beddy bed time
5 #### Not sure if they help because I give my 14 year old Pup additional glucosamine as well but he loves them so I keep buying them ! ! !
4 #### My dogs really like these bones . However , I can not say if they actually help their joints or not , have not seen any change in that aspect . But , I ordered more , I hear it takes time .
5 #### These biscuits are a great way to get glucosamine into our yellow lab . She loves them ! And these large bags are economical .
4 #### Great deal . I break them in half and feed to my pups as a treat .
5 #### Both my 10 - year old American Eskimo and 12 - year old diabetic Miniature Pinscher really loves these treats . Their limps have decreased since I 've been giving them these chews .
3 #### i do n't know why i thought this was gana be healthier dog treat , or all natural . so when i got the bag it came in a huge box with 4 or 5 of those big air bubbles . just way over done and a waste of material . anyways my dog seems to dig the treats so that s all that matters , just with it was healthier for her , no wheat or soy crap in um . when your buying joint and hip items you do n't want to give them gluten type food because it does the opposite effect . all in all its a regular dog bone . did n't need to go on amazon tho , could of found something like this in my local store . when i m on amazon i m looking for products that are hard to find in my area
5 #### These biscuits are crunchy and must be tasty as my dogs did enjoy them . They were not easy to break up to use as training treats , but they did enjoy the biscuits .
5 #### I bought these because the other treats I had purchased jumped up in price . Knowing my dog loves peanut butter flavor , I hoped , and she does like them ! ! I think the Glucosamine really does help her hip ( a congenital problem ) arthritis & I plan on continuing her getting treats like this in hopes to help her with any pain issues . She is happy with them , so we are too ! ! !
5 #### 3 of my dogs are very , very picky but they loved these biscuits . I will be ordering more in the very near future ...
3 #### Waiting for her to finish the other suppliments before giving her anymore of these . She does like the taste and I have no problem with her eating them like I do with the ones I have been giving her .
5 #### If u have dogs this is the biscuit . It is peanut butter flavored and they just love them . I have 2 older dogs that this is so great for their joints . I give to the younger one also .
5 #### my pup loved this product ! of coarse you have to buy this for a while to see if it actually works
5 #### my dog loves these biscuits and with the glucosamine in it he has less joint problems i also give the nutri vet hip and joint level 3 to him also . I would recommend these to anyone with an arthritic dog as a treat but one that helps the joints .
5 #### Seems to work ... my formerly lame dog now runs ! And he eagerly eats these , too . " six more words required , blah , blah "
1 #### did not like them , hiding them all over the place , so not going to do this with the nutty dog . he did not like them
3 #### The feeding instructions for these biscuits are two / day for 30 # dogs . While it says for " Small and Medium Dogs " , it 's strictly for medium dogs ; I have two 10 # dogs , which means I had to break these into thirds . And when I tried to break these , these did n't break clean and tended to crumble . So while they seem to help my dog with her knee issues , I would NOT recommend for small dogs . If you have a 15 # dog , you can break these in half . Great product for a 30 # dog , but not for 10 # dogs .
4 #### I have noticed that these do help my yorkie with his knees . He has n't limped since I started giving him these . My " niece " , a husky has this brand also and they help her a lot as well . My only complaint is that they say they are for small dogs , but they are too large for my yorkie . He just wants to hide them . So I have to break them up . Other than that , great product !
4 #### My 12 year old Collie loves these bones ! Our morning routine is to wake up , get me some food and then she waits by the lazy susan for hers . By the time I start rolling through the shelf , she starts to lick her lips and then when she has it , she goes to her spot on the carpet and devours it . It has made some improvement in her mobility , although she was n't too bad off to begin with . I will definitely be buying more of these when we run out . This is a great product at a great price .
5 #### My dogs love these treats and are good for them . They have 500 mg of glucosomine . One of my dogs has bad arthritis and it seems to help
4 #### Great for my dogs but too large for my small dogs ( 3 - 10 lbs ) . Thought I was ordering the appropriate size . Either I did not read the product close enough or the description was lacking . The wafers themselves are excellent .
5 #### I have two Great Danes that love to rough and tumble play , therefore , a supplement like this is important . These dogs also age quickly . They seem to enjoy these biscuits . I use them to lure them into their crates and they look forward to getting them . They were priced slightly lower than the local pet store too !
5 #### I wholeheartedly recommend these dog treats ! We were looking for a yummy Glucosamine dog treat for our 2 - year - old dog , and these are a great value for the money ! Our pup loves the peanut butter flavor and does not have to be coaxed into eating them . Also , I LOVE that they are Made in the USA . Highly recommend . These treats are great !
4 #### I have two bichon dogs ages 7 and 5 . My five year old has clicking joints and I thought I 'd try these . So far they 're still clicking but both dogs LOVE these treats . I think I 'll have to get joint food as well as the treats . Treats worked before alone . For the price and how the dogs like these I plan on reordering them . I break them in half most of the time since they are nice size even with the " small " size .
5 #### I have a 13 yr old Husky that has gotten so picky about her food that she only eats something like Fresh Pet or dried meats ( mainly chicken ) . She turns her nose up at most treats and wo n't eat pill pockets . So I was thrilled to find these because she loves them . She actually begs for them . And they seem to do the trick since she is a very 13 yr old with no noticeable joint pain .
5 #### My dogs love these . They were shipped out quickly and the dogs and I could n't be happier . Thank you . I 'll be back to buy more .
4 #### Dog likes them , but not really sure if the glucosamine does much , or if there is even enough to make a difference . My dog is not exactly old and limping around so I 'm not sure you would see much of a difference . He is getting a little older and I just want to get him a healthy snack .
4 #### My two younger , three year old dogs absolutely love these and it is much easier to get them to take than the pills . My eight year old however , ca n't chew them because they are hard on his teeth . I have to break them up into much smaller pieces for him to eat . Great value for the money . I would recommend them to other dog owners .
5 #### We love our pet chime . It took a little time to train our dog on it but now it 's the only thing he uses to tell us he wants to go out . It 's also a great conversation piece when company is over . We 've had ours for over 1 year and changed the batteries in the receiver once and have n't had any problems . We 're getting an extra paw !
1 #### PIECE OF CRAP . DO NOT BUY THIS . IT TOOK A WHILE TO TRAIN MY DOG , BUT HE STARTED USING IT . WE WERE VERY HAPPY . THEN AFTER ABOUT TWO MONTHS WHEN HE WOULD STEP ON IT THE UNIT WOULD RING UNTIL I REMOVED THE BATTERY . PUT IT BACK AND IT HAPPENED AGAIN IN A WEEK . I HAD ANOTHER PAW SO I REPLACED THE BAD ONE . ABOUT SIX WEEKS LATER SAME PROBLEM . I CHECKED THE REVIEWS AND I FOUND SOME OTHER PEOPLE HAD THE PROBLEM .
2 #### First the chime worked really well . My dog learned to use it in 2 days , I was so happy about that success . After three weeks the chime was malfunctioning , it went off all the time without reason . Big disappointment ! ! ! !
4 #### I have a two and a half year old Havapoo ( half Havanese , half Poodle ) . She learned how to press the paw on command in about two days . It 's a great device but I wish the area that gives out the sound was a bit bigger and a bit more touch sensitive . There were times when she pressed the side or she would n't press hard enough , and she would wonder why she was not getting rewarded . It took her a few days to learn how to press it using the right pressure . Anyway , overall , it 's a neat product . She is now pressing it proactively to get us to take her outside for potty .
3 #### I bought one set of chime and paw , and an additional paw for the back door . I placed the chime in a middle location so that both paws would n't have issues reaching and so that we could hear it from both doors . The chime is not far from either one of the paws , in fact it 's about 30 ' from both and a straight shot as the radio signal flys , but only one paw would work ! I disassembled the one paw and talk about cheap , it was n't worth more than 10 dollars at the most , probably less . I did find one potentiometer that I could adjust so I took a crack at it and sure enough it now transmits ( barely ) the 30 ' to the receiver . Oh , and after 2 weeks the dog still does n't have a clue how to use it . It 's not bad , but could be better quality .
4 #### Great little tool . Very easy to train the dog -- assuming you have easily trainable dogs . Have n't had any problems as some reviews have noted , but it 's pretty new for us .
1 #### This is a product that works fine for its purpose and then also works when it wants to on its own . When I read on other reviews that the chime started to ring on its own , I assumed that they simply did n't replace the batteries on a timely basis . However , my new chime started spontaneously and magically ringing on its own during the first week I had it in place by the door . I put it on my dresser , and now every once in a while for no apparent reason it chimes . I plan to return it . Who wants a doorbell in the house that rings when the dog is n't anywhere near the door ?
2 #### It worked good for about a week then the chime started going off on its own once in a while . It then became more frequently until we finally pulled the battery and said forget it . Should have returned it but we did n't .
5 #### This is the extra chime that you can purchase if you already have the receiver . I am purchasing another one because it 's working so well . I am a professional dog trainer , and all I can say is that the product is great , but that owners who do not know how to teach something to their dogs probably should call a dog trainer for help with this if you are unsure how to proceed . As a professional dog trainer , I still live with my family members who are decidedly not dog trainers . Our toy poodle was essentially house - trained when I was home , but because my teenagers and husband were oblivious to her subtle signals that she needed to go out , she ended up peeing in front of the door , because nobody was letting her out . So , I got the Lentek Door Chime , and taught my dog to use it , and now no more accidents because she is signaling in a way that everybody can hear . We also put the pad outside so she can signal to come back in . Everybody is happy . Now I 'm getting another pad for upstairs , because we still have oblivious teens and hubby .... So , great product , but be sure that you have * both * parts of the product , and give a good trainer a call to help you get started .
5 #### It takes a little patience to get the dog to use it , at first she thought is was a treat machine , but eventually she realized it meant go outside . Works very well .
2 #### I bought 2 of these for my cats , and they worked fine for a while . It 's a smart design , but they 've got many flaws . They use a LOT of batteries - the 9 volts die after 2 - 3 weeks ( so you have to keep a * close * eye on it ) , and they turn very slowly because of the weak , poorly designed motor . They both died within about 6 months , and I had to replace them . Also , it 's not really a 6 - day unit - it 's a 6 * meal * unit . Each tray only holds up to 1/2 cup . Since my cats ( normal size ) eat 1/3 cup per meal , I must set the unit to go off twice a day . I ca n't imagine this working for a large dog . And , since the sixth compartment is perpetually open , you can only set it for 2 1/2 days in advance . Not much help for vacations . The person who said their unit has been working for 8 years is either mistaken or lying . This Asian company is barely 3 years old . I have a sneaking suspicion that the seller wrote a review of their own product , using their " imagination " & hyperbole . If anyone knows of a better system , please let us know or post a review .
3 #### Our cat Khaleesi is an evil genius foiled only by a lack of opposable thumbs . As wonderfully QUIET as this feeder is -- and it is virtually silent -- unfortunately the rotating lid does not prevent our determined feline from pushing the lid to open the next meal . Because of this we have to return it in favor of one that we know Khaleesi can not defeat .
2 #### I had bought this for my overweight cat but she easily cheated it by pawing the lid until it slid to the next portion . Nice design in theory .
4 #### I purchased this pet feeder to feed our cat when we went away on weekend trips . Our cat , who is very food aggressive , is unable to get at the food for the future days , much to his dismay . This feeder is very easy to set up , and though I do not use it for canned food , it has ice packs that can keep canned food cool and fresh . I would recommend this feeder for anyone who takes short trips and has a cat that needs to be on a feeding schedule .
5 #### Really liked this . Had one before the racoons tried to get into to and it got turned over and did n't work while we were gone - were devastated , worried our cats did n't get any food . This one sits on the ground and the racoons did n't seem to be concerned with this one for some reason , and we liked the way it turns to the next meal after the time you set it at .
5 #### This feeder works great ! You can set it for every 6 hours , 12 hours or once a day . I put in new batteries when I bought it ( the first batteries were old and barely turned the carousel ) and weeks later they are still working . My cat loves it and comes running when she hears it turn .
5 #### Best automatic feeder I have found ! It 's a automatic feeder and my alarm clock in one ! I just listen for the noise when it advances and that 's my wakeup call ! I will get up at night and my Yorkie will be sitting by it at 2 am waiting for it to advance so she can eat ! Sadly she 's waiting until 3:30 when it finally goes off ! lol
3 #### Was useful until my clever and always hungry cat figured out how to take cover off . Hope they fixed the design flaw since I purchased it .
4 #### Got ta love cats . Within a day or so the cat learned when it would open and would stand there and wait for it . I became redundant , or at least freed up until refill time came
5 #### My cats are n't particularly smart , but they are particularly food driven . Having this keeps the 5 am I 'm hungry yowls away . I 've had it for over a year now and it still works . I do n't use it for wet food because I tried that once and the food went bad . I could have divided it into 4 , but that would have defeated the whole purpose of having an automatic feeder . Now the cats have been re - trained to listen to the motor of this thing , they pretty much do n't bother me in the morning . ( I also do n't allow them in the bedroom so that helps too ) Also , I can go on vacation for a week and have someone check on them once or twice instead of every day .
5 #### Love this . Reliable way to portion our cat 's food when we 're gone .
5 #### This is great . Practice with you pet before you go for first time to get them used to it .
5 #### I bought one then turned around and bought another one . my cats get it ! and I do n't worry now !
5 #### This thing is so durable . It does what it says , feeds on schedule automatically . There are six tray total to put your pet 's food , and can handle wet and dry food ! I use wet food in mine for my cat when we go out of town . It 's very easy to take apart and clean , and I 've even accidentally left it outside for a month and it still worked like a champ .
5 #### Great when you have to be away for few days . My cat is fed without having to have a pet sitter come in to feed her .
4 #### This is the best invention . My cat was waking me up at 6 am everyday for food . I set this to feed her two times a day , around 6 am and 6 pm . So I have it set for the 12 hour option ( there 's 6,12,24 ) . There are two big freezer packs if you want to put wet food into it . I did have to figure out how to fill it . Basically , I had to pull the two parts apart . the center console is clipped in , very well , but does take a bit to get it out . It 's great though because my cat ca n't get it out . I found out that everything needs to be snapped closed for it to rotate correctly , including the center console / timer part . if you do n't snap it tight , it wo n't rotate . The food tray will not spin if the cat hits it with their paw so they ca n't eat more than intended . It 's locked in . I can now sleep past 6 am ( until she decides she 's hungry again )
5 #### A little tricky at first glance to open and get up and going ... would be better if it came with two sets of freezable thing - a - ma - jigs . Wish I could find one that completely refrigerated ... my cat eats a raw food diet and this is n't cold enough . :/
2 #### Did not work well at all . Raccoons or something had it torn up in no time .
5 #### My cat wakes me up at 5 am every morning , so I decided to buy this automatic feeder . This pet feeder exceeded my expectations , my cat no longer wakes me up ! It 's simple to use and I have n't had a problem with it so far ! It needs batteries , they do n't come with the purchase .
1 #### Terrible quality , threw it away and it never really worked right . I would not trust it to feed my animal while I was away .
5 #### I works great . We got the Lentek 6 - Day Automatic Pet Dish for weekend get aways to medicate our one cat twice , a day at home . We crush the tablet into a powder and sprinkle it on just enough dry food ; that , it sticks to the food . If , any powder falls off , we roll the dry food in the Rx powder . With just 3 - 4 pieces of kitty kibble to eat , we know that he wo n't leave any food behind and he gets the full dose . We have used it about 6 times in the past 6 months .
5 #### Daughter loves this . I ca n't rate because I am not using it . but she says it works well for her .
4 #### Reliable , updated version of an old standard . Not really confident in power by only 1 9v battery .
4 #### When we started using this we found it hard to keep track of when we needed to refill since the compartments are not numbered . We solved that by taking a sharpie and numbering the compartments ourselves . Does tend to take quite a bit of battery power so it would nice of there was an optional power plug .
5 #### We got this for our overweight cat . The measured feeding worked well after she got used to it . Unfortunately , she died about a month after we got the feeder , so I can ' t say how effective it was in helping her lose weight . I do think it would have been a help , because regulated feeding had worked in reducing her weight and the automatic pet dish would have helped that approach . From what I 've seen , I would recommend the product .
5 #### This is perfect for feeding my cat over a weekend . A couple things : You have to set the timer 6,12 or 24 hours ahead of time because the timer is n't digital . You ca n't enter a start time . Example- if you need it to go off every 12 hours , you 'll have to fill it up and start the timer 12 hours before the time you want your pet 's first feeding to be . I set mine for every 12 hours at around 9 - 10 am before I leave and it feeds my cat at 9 - 10 pm , then at 9 - 10 am , and so on . Another thing that did n't occur to me when I bought it is that technically it will only automatically feed five servings , because one of the dishes is n't covered by the lid . I was worried that it might make enough noise to scare my fearful kitty away , but it 's pretty quiet and does n't seem to bother her at all . Every time I use it I come home to an empty dish and a happy cat , so I will continue to use it with complete confidence .
4 #### The great thing about having a cat is that you can leave home for a couple of days without asking someone to cat sit . However , if your cat gorges itself , this feeder is the perfect answer . It allowed us to be gone for 3 days without asking a neighbor to stop by a couple of times a day . It 's rather flimsy for the price , but it serves its purpose and I 'm glad I found it on Amazon .
1 #### What a waste of money ! The tray did n't move as promised and I was afraid my cat would miss meals . The tray would advance sometimes , but not consistently . Taking the unit apart to insert a battery is a pain . I returned my pet dish .
2 #### The idea was good and the unit is attractive but it took an inordinate amount of time to install the 9 volt battery . It takes a small size Phillips screwdriver to open the compartment , an unnecessary precaution , and the screw started to strip . The lead on the 9 volt battery connector is way too short and it will easily break - a real problem since it eats batteries . It took me a half hour to install the battery , which is ridiculous . It works for now , but the electronics will fail easily . Set it up at the time you want to feed the cat because there is no way to adjust the hour ,
5 #### My only complaint is that you need to pop the whole center out before you refill it , or you mess up the timer programming . It 's not super easy to pop back in , but not too hard either . When you pop the timer mechanism back in , make sure you line up the little prong on the timer with the notch on the plastic dish cover 's center hole . If you do n't , it wo n't fully lock into place and kitty might be able to get into the hidden pockets . My cats have stopped screaming at me when it comes close to dinner time ; instead , they just wait patiently for the dish to open . They took to it instantly !
5 #### Simple and worked well for me for years . Would definetly recommend . Ideal for cat when when leaving for 2 - 3 days .
4 #### does the job but removing the centerpiece to change the battery is VERY difficult . if that were easier , I 'd give 5 stars .
4 #### I have had these feeders for 2 years now , and I still trust them . They are excellent for weight loss in those cats that cry for food all the time ( eventually kitty learns that you do n't give food , the feeders do ! ) . They are fairly loud ( which actually turns out to be good because they call the cats to eat ) . I have 2 and they stay in sync just enough to let them eat at the same time ( and so 1 cat does n't get all the food and the other gets none . ) They hold about 1/4 cup of dry kibble well . Anymore would be too much ( so maybe not a good option for dogs over 15 lbs or so ) . It has setting to rotate every 6 , 12 or 24 hours . A little green light blinks every few seconds to let you know that the battery is still good ( they take 9 volt batteries , and I have n't had to change them very often ) . Only 4 star review because I would rather have an 8 hour setting instead of a 6 hour setting . Also , do n't use it for canned food , even with the freeze tray - it just gets gross .
5 #### I love this dish - works great for feeding my small dog and keeping her on schedule when I am working . I just set a calendar reminder to refill it every 3 days ( I feed her twice daily , so I set the dish on the 12 - hour interval ) and stay on track . The unit is very sturdy , and while it takes some effort to re - insert the center motor unit after installing or changing the 9 - volt battery , once it 's inserted , it 's not necessary to remove the white food compartment cover to refill the dish - simply use the advance button . Love , love , love this product !
4 #### It is great - just looses a bit of time now and then . I had two before but one of my cats went after it like a toy and had to replace .
3 #### I ordered two dishes for my cats . One works perfectly ; opening every 12 hours for feeding . The other dish is hit or miss . Sometimes it will advance without issue . Other times it wo n't advance at all ; or it advances partially , stops , then goes backwards a slot or two . The whole point of these dishes is to feed my cats when I 'm not home at mealtimes . This is n't working out too well !
5 #### This automatic feeder has saved our life . Our cat used to wake us up in the early morning hours just meowing and bugging the heck out of us until we woke up and fed him . This is now set to the same time every morning and it automatically goes off without a hitch . Pros : - Sleek and small size - Holds 5 servings of food - Quiet - My cat can not break into it ! ! Cons : - You can only set it in 12 or 24 hour intervals , no specific time like " 5:00am . " If you want it to go off at 5:00am everyday you have to put it on the 24 hour option and actually turn the machine on at 5:00am , then it goes off every 24 hours . - Can not use with wet food
4 #### I love not being bothered by my cat to feed her . Holds the perfect amount of food to just have it turn every 24 hours . Turns reliably so I do n't have to worry if I leave for the weekend . Only complaint is that you ca n't set it to turn exactly at a certain time ( like 5 am ) but ... either way , I guess if you turned it on at the right time that it probably would ...
4 #### I bought this because my older cats only consistently eat canned food so I needed a way to feed them if I go away for the weekend . This fit the bill . The ice packs keep the food fresh but they defrost as quickly as you 'd expect and certainly wo n't last all 6 feedings . Maybe about a day or so . But it 's better than nothing . I bought two of them and they both work well . I like the way you have 6 , 12 , or 24 hour options .
5 #### My cats were waking me up every night begging for food . One night my cat licked my eyelid and it hurt my cornea so bad I thought it could be damaged . I ordered these feeders and they worked like a charm . I had them go off at the most frequent setting and so that they would get fed in the middle of the night . I finally got sleep , they lost weight , and they did n't bother me for food because they knew that the feeder was the one that would give it to them . The only downside is that you can not have it too close to where you sleep . It 's not obnoxiously loud but loud enough that if it 's near your bed it will wake you up . It takes a nine volt battery that if either store bought or rechargeable will last a month .
2 #### I really wanted to like this feeder , but I do n't . The main problem is that you ca n't program it , you can only set it to go off EXACTLY 6/12/24 hours from the time you turn it on . So if you want to feed your cat at 6 am , you better be around at 6 pm or midnight to enable it . If you do n't use this every day and always have it turned on , this becomes a major hassle . The ice packs sort of work , but did n't keep the food particularly cold , freezing the food worked much better . They are very thin plastic that you fill with water , and I have a feeling the continual expanding of the ice will eventually break them . After a month I was so sick of trying to get this going at the correct times that I ditched it for the " PetSafe 5 - Meal Electronic Pet Feeder " . It is much better . I will say though , if you make the necessary modifications ( see the pictures I added to the product ) , this feeder is impossible to break into . So if that is your primary concern , this is a good choice .
3 #### Within a few weeks , Ms. Kitty figured out how to break in the feeder to eat whenever she pleases . It works as stated . I would give it 5 stars if there was a way to keep her out of the other compartments .
1 #### Not a good buy . Worked for about one week then stopped working . Will turn if you push the button but . not at the programmed time .
2 #### This is a great product , or would be if it worked . The removable ice trays are a great feature to keep moist food fresh . There is a problem with the motor , probably a short , because it either runs all the time or not at all .
5 #### I had ordered an Animal Planet Feeder and while testing it , it was inconsistent on even giving food . I ordered this and so far it works flawlessly . Also , it came with two freezer containers so that food wo n't spoil in it . It is very hot here so the freezer containers will probably only stay cold for a day or so , but I can now leave my cats medication for the first day when we are traveling .
5 #### The variety of times available to set allowed us to go on vacation for 4 days and leave our cat at home . We used the dish for her treats and medicine ( she takes a powder med that she loves ) . We would just put the powder on her morning treat and she got her meds . Did n't have to worry about her eating it all on day one . I read reviews that said their cat destroyed the dish , but our cat had no problem .
1 #### The motor on this product stopped having enough power to rotate the cover in one week , even when a brand new battery was placed in the unit .
4 #### This was a great automatic feeder for controlling my cat 's weight and not sure what I would do without it . We only used it for dry food ( did not feed our cat wet food ) so we never used the cold packs . We put it on every 6 hours ( lasted 1.5 days ) and filled it once a day . When we first received it , we were disappointed since you could hear it when it was spinning ( and it was right outside our bedroom ) , however we got used to it and our cat was trained to know the feeding time from the noise . I felt the battery lasted a good amount of time . The only difficulty is the feeder has 6 slots so if you put it on every 6 hrs feeding , it would run out after 1.5 days . Can put it on 12 hrs and it will last longer .
2 #### After reading the many reviews I decided to purchase . I love it ! Had it for several months now and no problems . Rotates every 12 hours and using 1/2 cup per section . My mom found exact same one at the goodwill for 25 cents in the misc section and now she uses it at her house with no problems . My sister bought one here on amazon too after she heard about it from me .... They all work great what a deal ! UPDATE : JAN . 19 . 2016 Electric motors are severely worn out due to time . Sometimes the cat food jams up during the rotation which may cause more stress and early failure of the electric motor .
5 #### I was hesitant after reading other reviews , but needed to try something . I found it worked great . you have to read the reviews and understand that the item does n't tell time , it works by hours . If you put it on 12 hours @ 11:00pm , then it 's going to open @11:00am . That was the only mistake that I made . I did n't turn it on until 8:00pm for 24 hours and my cat is use to getting fed in the morning . I do need to buy another one , so I can feed twice a day , when I go away for more than two days . I put dish soap in the plastic cooler items that they give you to freeze . I read that it stays cooler a little longer than the water . Until I find gel packs that fit in the spot , this will have to do . When I came home my cat was still eating the food out of it , but we 're still cold in CT . Hopefully I 'll find something before the summer heat hits .
2 #### I purchased this automatic feeder in an attempt to feed my cats a small amount in the middle of the night ( to keep them from waking me up ) . There were two problems with this : 1 ) due to the fact that this rotates based on hours rather than at a specific time , I had to set it at exactly the right moment either 6 or 12 hours from the time I wanted it to feed . I could never set it at 24 hours because I never was awake enough at that time of night to fool with the darn thing . 2 ) it did not rotate reliably . Even when it was set for the right time , it often simply did n't rotate . Generally speaking , I do n't recommend this product as it could not serve my purposes . I have not tried another brand yet so I do n't know for sure if there is one that is more reliable - I just know this one did n't fit the bill .
1 #### Not worth the money . The individual dishes are very small . Maybe if you have a cat this would work well but defiantly not for dogs .
1 #### Pros : Good pet feeder Cons : The reason I gave it one star is ecological . After going through four of these units , the timer seems to only last about a year . When it goes out , one has to buy the complete unit again which means we have that much more plastic in our landfill . I 'd be willing to pay full price for ONLY the timer if it was available . If you have a unit and the timer goes out , you do n't need the rest of the carousel ! ! ! ! ! You just need the timer ! ! ! ! ! :-( It only lasts for five sessions . If you are leaving the house for longer too bad . I wish it could be plugged into the wall rather than a battery . You have to be around to know if the battery has gone bad .
3 #### No problems with my cat playing with the controls , and it moves from one section of food to the next on schedule . The only problem is that my cat wo n't eat from it - but that 's because my cat wo n't eat until I 'm standing next to her food dish . I do n't think she 's going to adapt to this since she 's 16 years old and pretty set in her ways . But that does n't mean it would n't work for a cat who 's been spoiled in a different way .
5 #### This has saved me from getting woken up every morning between 4 and 5 AM because my cat decides he wants breakfast . Now he knows he just has to wait for the auto - feeder and to not bother me . It 's also really nice for over the holidays , since my family lives in a different state . The 6 days is inclusive , since that last dish is never closed . It 's also kind of awkward finding a place to put it that my cat can get all the way around to eat , since the white part is the part that turns , not the dish . My cat always figures it out , though . Be careful when the battery starts to get low , it wo n't turn all the way and will turn very , very slowly . The 9 volt generally lasts about 6 months , and I use this feeder for daily use ( set at the 24 or 12 hour setting ) . All things considered , still a great product .
4 #### This feeder is a good product and much better than the feeders that I have tried in other brands . The motor is quiet and the construction is durable . It is a little bit of a challenge to get the lid open the first few times you try but after that it is easy . However our cat sitter has never learned how to master the thing and leaves the lid off and feeds by filling one tray at a time when we are away . I would recommend this feeder to anyone .
5 #### We got this for our bunnies to feed them when we are gone . We 've used this probably a dozen time , and every time I 'm afraid it will malfunction so I have people come down to check on the bunnies but it always works ! I did draw an arrow on it so i could figure out what way it turns - thus if I only want to fill up 1/2 the containers . It would be nice if it was made with the arrow - but a Sharpie works just as well .
5 #### The Automatic Pet dish is a great thing to help out when you are away from home for a day or so . It is well made .
4 #### As far as I can tell , it works as advertised . We only used it once while we were gone from the house and my cat did n't eat ( stress I think ) . We have to use wet food though and the ice pack did n't last as long as I 'd hoped . We were gone overnight and the ice was n't cold when we got home , we threw out the food that the cat did n't eat . So if someone can come in to change the ice , it would work . There must be a way to do it where it would last longer , but we 've just had someone come feed the cat instead . If someone knows of a way , please let me know !
1 #### I should 've known when I first tried putting in the battery ( when I tried to remove the battery , which is seriously difficult , it ripped off the metal contact point , wasting an expensive but otherwise new battery ) that this product was no good . I figured since Amazon 's return policy is a bit of a pain , I would stick with it and see . Well , about 8 months of using it , it started developing problems ; it would turn halfway , then backtrack , then turn to the intended slot . Now , 10 months in , it completely ping - pongs back and forth -- and it wo n't stop ; I have to turn it off midway and then turn it back on so it will turn to the correct food slot . I figured no problem , I 'm still under the 1 - year warranty -- wrong ! I checked the manual and they only offer a 90 - day warranty . What ? ! Had they offered a 1 - year warranty AND I was out of that 1 - year warranty , I would 've bought another one as a replacement . But the 90 - day warranty is pretty worthless and shows they have no confidence behind their products . I 've already purchased the QPet Timed Automatic Pet Feeder ( hopefully I wo n't have the same issues ) . Other dislikes : horrible warranty , noisy motor , unable to set actual time ( only 6- , 12- or 24 - hour time intervals from initially powering it on ) , uses expensive D battery ( thought the battery has lasted quite some time ) .
5 #### I 've had this item for about a month and so far , it 's great . I have it set to offer a carefully measured portion of dry food every 6 hours to my cat who likes to overeat . This item keeps his portions under control and on a schedule , and keeps me from having to stop and feed him throughout the day . Since I have it set for every 6 hours , I reload the trays once a day to make sure he does n't miss any meals .
1 #### I purchased the product even with all the negative reviews . First of all to refill the feeder requires really taking the feeder apart ... very cumbersome . However having said this the green light was on . I turned it on at the time I wanted it to rotate , 7 am every 24 hours . I had to wait until the next day , well it never rotated . Also the lid is very easy to move . I have a Bengal cat , even if the feeder had worked I know he would have easily been able to move it . I needed the feeder as we are going away . However I returned it . I will look for other options . Unfortunately there really are no other automatic feeders with any consistent good reviews . Save your time and effort , this product is not worth the trouble
3 #### This is an adequate feeder . My cat has n't been able to break into it , and that 's definitely something . It is very basic , with just 6,12 , and 24 hour options that start only when you turn it on or select a new time period . I set it to go off early every morning to take care of his breakfasts and let me sleep in . The coolers are a handy addition - if I 'm going away I can set the next meal to be canned food and be fairly confident it will still be cold in 6 hours . I wish it had more scheduling control , but it does the job . Awkwardly .
1 #### I have an overweight cat on a diet and thought this bowl would control his food intake . For the first few months it worked great and was happy my cats were getting a controlled amount of food , but in no time the motor burned out . I contacted the company to see if I could get a new motor , but they do not sell them by themselves you have to buy the whole food dish . I am not buying another food dish for 40 dollars for it to break in a few months . I was hoping they would honor their satisfaction guarantee and send me a new bowl or at least motor . I will not shell out another $ 40 to them to have it only last a couple months . very disappointed in them ! ! Bad customer service ! ! We did have other small issues with the bowl , but still like using . Sometimes it would get stuck on food and rotate back and then should clear to be able to open and it would n't rotate back and cats would miss a feeding . Cats faces would be in bowl as opened and I would be afraid whiskers would get caught , but what really made me made it having the motor burn out ! ! It 's not a cheap bowl to break so quick . Time for me to find anther brand which I hope it better .
2 #### The cover rotates , not the dish - so the unit needs to be placed so your dog can reach it from all sides . This does n't work in my kitchen , I feed my dog at the end . It is also somewhat small . I have a small yorkie who eats 1/4 cup of small kibble . This unit would work for that quantify , if you have a bigger dog I do n't think it would work . I 'm returning it . It seems sturdy , so if the design works for you I would highly recommend it .
1 #### This unit has no clock , only a timer . Feeding dish does not rotate at proper timer intervals and sometimes rotates two spaces at a time . In addition , you have to use a Phillips screwdriver to change the batteries , which is ridiculous . I bought two , and returned them both . We currently use the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Ergo-8 - Day - Auto - Pet - Feeder / dp / B0008173UQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Ergo 8 - Day Auto Pet Feeder</a > , which works much better .
4 #### I needed something to titrate food out to my furry kid while I am away for a few days . Since she is unsocial to say the least , so having a person come over and do this while I am out is pointless . She just wants the food from them & hides until they leave . I tried it out on an overnight trip to make sure it worked & it 's great ! Does exactly what I need it to . Note : it 's hard to tell it 's actually " on " at first . When you figure out how to get to the batteries & put them in , turn it on and keep an eye on the green light . It does n't light up continuously , but blinks periodically instead . Just FYI ... I thought it was n't on because the batteries were bad . LOL .
3 #### I read the reviews before purchase so I was pretty familiar with the product . Once we figured out how to set the timer , it 's been a GODSEND for that 5AM feed where the cats were previously banging on our door . We have some pretty smart cats but they do n't try to break into the feeder . The sound of the motor is noticeable , but only if you 're in the area when it goes off . I like that I can pop the lid , put the food in , and put the whole thing back together without having to reset the timer . I just wish they made a curious toddler proof clear cover . ;) The only improvement , IMO would be a digital timer , but the product does what I need it to do . I can sleep in and it 's FANTASTIC ! Edit to add : The dishes are still going strong almost a year later , the cats do n't break in and the motors have n't been chewing batteries . However , if you need spare parts , do n't bother asking . Our child took the plastic cover off the motor and when I inquired about JUST that part , I was told they do n't sell it and I would need to return the whole dish . After some back and forth I decided to just live with it , but it 's annoying that they do n't sell replacements for easily removed parts of their dish . We use it almost daily so sending it back would be a real hassle . Dish OK . Customer service ... not so much .
5 #### I bought this for my cats so when I go away for the night they still get fed in the morning . I was expecting the unit to be smaller than it is but overall it looks nicer than I expected and arrived very quickly . I am very happy with my purchase and I will update the review in a few months to let you know how it held up and if my cats figured out how to get to the food .
1 #### This arrived broken before we used it . the electronics with in this were destroyed , totally fried . It registered there was a battery , but the light kept blinking , and it would n't register to be programed . the wiring was totally faulty . furthermore , the lid and did n't fit quite right , and it was extremely light weight , it was clear that the compartments were not airtight , and that small paws could fit into the adjacent compartment . it was also not easy to reassemble , and i 'm not sure how they intended the ice packs to work . they were hard plastic , inflexible , and were poorly seemed , so they leaked when water was poured in them , so they would n't have frozen well and easily leaked . it ended up being returned to amazon .
3 #### i had this feeder for 6 months or so . worked well for the most part but took some abuse from my cat who jumps on it when it starts to open each time , literally standing on it while it would turn open ... think the motor burned out , it started acting like it was confused or low on battery and would n't turn all the way to open , then stopped working all together . was good while it lasted .
2 #### My cat started standing on the top of this while it rotates , and then the dish wo n't go to the next section of the feeder . My cat then would n't get fed and would be acting crazy and I could n't figure out why until I realize it was no longer advancing . Then the other day I watched the dish advance and then just randomly go back to the empty section . The motor is blown . I guess it was ok for the price but I would n't buy it again .
4 #### This product was perfect for feeding our cat when we were away one weekend . We took to using it daily , just so he would learn to wait for the dish to advance automatically rather than whining at us . This worked really well for a month or so , but now it seems he has learned how to force it to the next segment - not sure how . Overall , a good automatic dish and I like how you can choose the timing ( every 6 hours , 12 hours , or 24 ) .
2 #### I purchased this feeder after my cat broke the LeBistro brand feeder I had by repeatedly sticking her paw up into the food dispenser to coax more kibbles out . The design of this feeder prevented that , but it was clunky in other ways . I had to remember to fill it again every few days by guessing when I had last done so , because you can not see which of the hidden trays are empty . Since I could not figure out how to lift the tray cover , I had to rotate it by battery power - very slowly - tray by tray - to refill each one . The batteries lasted several months , but when they began to run down , I could not for the life of me get the center console with the motor in it to " lift " out ( as per instructions ) to put in new batteries . I pried it with a screwdriver , rotated the cover to each tray in turn , shook it - nothing worked . After two frustrating days , I finally sent it back to Amazon with the dead batteries still installed . It was useless . I would not buy this model again .
2 #### I bought this for my cats because they woke me up every morning for food . After some frustration getting it to turn at the correct hour , it worked okay for 5 months . Then it died . The lack of a time setting : Adjusts to 6 hour , 12 hour , and 24 hour settings . The problem : I wanted it to turn at 5 am when I 'm not usually up so my cats would not wake me . That meant that I needed to be up at that hour to set the timer . Yuck . If the battery dies , start over and repeat . After 5 months of use ( 1 time per day ) , it will not turn on anymore . New batteries do n't help , and this thing only has a 90 day warranty . Buyer beware .
5 #### Love these feeders . I bought a second one because they work so well and I got a second cat . The 6 spaces are large enough that if i fill them full there will still be some left for the next time it rotates through , meaning it will last longer than just one rotation . I do n't think wet food would work . Maybe for 1.5 days . The little ice packs just would n't be large enough or insulated enough to do the job much longer . But I highly recommend these for those who travel a lot on weekends or for short trips .
4 #### I like this product , it works well for me . I use it when I am gone 2 - 3 days . I freeze about half the cat 's food ( in the tray)and refrigerate the rest before putting it in . I also use the ice trays . This way I avoid the problem some people have had with the food going bad . The frozen portion thaws out slowly . When you prepare the tray , be sure the food is in the right slot and rotation so that the frozen food is accessed last .
3 #### I purchased this for my puppy and she broke into it in about 3 days . She scratched at the top and got the whole lid off ! ! Otherwise this feeder is n't bad if you have an animal who is n't determined to eat all the food in the feeder at once . I was disappointed as I thought it would have some sort of locking mechanism on the lid so it did n't come up so easily . Maybe they need to figure out a way to lock the battery mechanism to the lid !
5 #### Gave this to my daughter - she reports that it 's terrific - she 's glad to have the cat find food at 5 AM - those mornings of a cat standing on her , carrying on about food , are over - and she 's very glad !
4 #### This product is a great buy for the money . I shopped around a lot and could n't find anything to compare . This is the second one I bought . I 've had the first one almost a year and it 's still working . It is pretty quiet and the timer works well . My cats do n't try to break into it like others seem to do . It wo n't work with wet food for 6 days though because the ice will not keep ( since it 's just water in plastic ) but works well for a weekend away . It has eliminated me having to get up at 4:30am to feed the cats too !
2 #### This product is OK if you 're only going away for a couple of days . I used it for about a week and now it is in he cupboard . I like the LeBistro Automatic feeder much better .
5 #### I have 2 cats and one is getting chubby , plus I 'm tired of always feeding them regularly . I needed this for when I was out of town anyway . This is great for feeding them a certain amount of food without overfeeding them . I do n't plan on using it for canned food with the ratings I saw on the site . Besides , it 's not vacuum packed to keep the canned food from spoiling and the ice packs are kind of cheap on the bottom --- a gel that lasts longer than frozen water in them would work better and the manufacturer should have thought of that .
4 #### We bought this to use to feed our two adult cats whenever we go out of town for a few days . We chose this model because it was reasonably priced and holds enough food for up to six days . The unit has six pie - shaped ( wedge ) sections that you fill with food ; one section is always exposed , so it basically holds food for today plus five more servings . There is a switch that lets you select between 6 , 12 , or 24 - hour serving intervals . At the preset interval , the lid advances to the next section . Each section holds enough dry food forup to two cats if you fill them up . There is no clock display on the unit ; there is a manual " advance " button on the unit ; whenever you press this , the lid rotates to the next opening and it resets the timer so that it will advance at the preset interval after this , or it will advance at the preset interval after you install the battery ( one 9 - volt Alkaline battery ) . There are some small water tanks on the botton that are intended to be filled with water and frozen to keep canned food cold , but they are useless after more than a few hours . Overall , the unit does what it is supposed to do very well , without any complicated clock or timer settings to worry about , and it is large enough to hold a few days worth of food .
5 #### My cats were driving me near the brink of insanity with their whining for food at 5 am . As a last ditch effort , i decided to buy this automatic feeder , even though i assumed my cat would figure out a way to sabotage it . This machine is a godsend . My cats ca n't get into it , and they do n't whine for their food nearly as much . Instead , they sit patiently in front of the feeder from 5 am until it goes off at 6:15 . it 's just so wonderful ! If i could change it in any way , it would be to add a clock to it to set precisely when the machine goes off . It 's a little inconvenient how you have to be at the feeder when you want to change the time . Meaning if you want to change the time from 7 am to 5 am , you have to be at the machine either at 5 am or 5 pm , since it works on a 12 or 24 hour interval . If your cats are whiners , save yourself some suffering and buy this now !
4 #### This product worked great for leaving our pet cat for a week . We tested it prior to leaving . Our pet caught on quick and the timing mechanism has worked flawlessly . It makes leaving your pet and imposing on a friend or neighbor to check on them less an inconvenience . For the price , ease of use , care of your pet , and convenience of temporary caretakers -- you ca n't go wrong with this purchase .
3 #### The dish is fine - works as advertised & is cleverly designed & operates quietly . The problem is my geriatric cat who could n't even be tempted to eat from the open tray , never mind once the mechanism was in place . He 's 18 & goes through periods of wanting to eat every 3 hours , day or night - a bit rough on those of us who 'd like an uninterrupted sleep . So I thought I 'd try the auto - feeder . Oh . Well .
3 #### I have two of these and my dog learned to use the bell very quickly . The only issue is we can be in another room and it will start riniging on its own . If they could resolve this I would have given them 5 stars .
5 #### It 's simple . It 's useful . And the home and office have been accident - free since we got it . Also , people think it 's hilarious that my dog uses a doorbell .
5 #### My dogs have had a great time playing with the doorbell , learning that it gets the door opened for them , and the praise that comes with it . It 's easy to activate the bell and that makes it a lot of fun .
5 #### Very easy to install and has great range . I stared with the button and the bell next to each other so Sadie could relate the pushbutton , chime ( barking ) and the door opening . It took 3 times for her to figure it out . Great tool for the dog that does not bark .
3 #### This idea is great . The kids love it and it amuses many . The presentation is a little cheesy and less than refined but , this can be enjoyed because of the practicality of it . The transmitter - > receiver reception has a little to be desired . The product says that they can be 100 ft apart . If ours is more than 10 feet apart it does n't work ( no chime ) . If the transmitter / receiver are around a corner / outside a door / or too far apart ( 10 ft ) this system did n't work for us . We thought of returning it but then found a work around where we placed the chime next to the door ( since it is loud enough to be heard throughout ) and the paw at the door . In this set up , we can put the paw outside so that our pooch can tell us she needs to come inside without scratching . Thank you for that ! !
1 #### I had this less than 2 days and the button on the paw pad would stick causing it to chime over and over until the button is pushed again . Then it started to randomly chime by itself . Thinking it was the batteries , I added fresh new ones , but the problem still exists . Since it continued waking me in the middle of the night I have discontinued using and it 's been less than 3 weeks since I purchased .
3 #### Not so crazy about this . My dog ( a havenese ) is not fond of these , so it 's difficult to tell if they work or not .
1 #### They used to make these in breath strips that worked great . These do n't smell minty at all . Essentially are just a regular dog treat , but smaller .
3 #### nice concept , but ca n't tell the difference with dog 's breath ......
4 #### So my dog goes CRAZY for these things , BUT they basically smell like the chicken flavoring for Ramen noodles , and do n't seem to do anything for her breath .
3 #### Ca n't really tell any difference but dogs like them
5 #### My dog loves these and her breath is much better now . I give her one each morning with her kibble .
1 #### These always worked really well with our dogs ; however , the ones I received today look like someone chopped them up with a hammer . Very few of them are not broken . You have to do better than this to get a better review .
5 #### best thing we have found for dog 's bad breath
2 #### My dog does n't like these . She 's a small mixed dog , so maybe a large dog would just eat with no problem , but these seem like human mints and she does n't like them .
5 #### My dog loves these and it has sure helped her bad breath . I give her one each morning with her kibble .
3 #### dog prefers Prosense which are n't made anymore .. thought these could replace them but he wo n't have any of them .
5 #### My three dogs love these yip yaps , crunch them up , and do have resultantly sweeter breath . Having bought some in a pet store a long time ago , I was delighted to be able to find them online .
5 #### My dog has always had bad breath . No matter what we try it comes back . These always seem to work . I give him one a night and he 's good . He 's only 7lbs so a big dog May need more . But they do the job . Just wish they were n't so expensive for a small amount .
2 #### Sorry , but my dog just did n't like these at all . He just sniffed them and turned and walked away so I have to defer to his opinion .
3 #### These are n't miracle workers but the dog loves them and they seem to help a bit .
5 #### I have no idea how something so stinky can make my dogs breath so much better . But it does ! We give one daily to our 40 lb dog and it keeps bad breath away . She loves them , although she is n't picky so your experience may differ .
4 #### My little dog loves these , although I do n't think they help her bad breathe very much
1 #### My dog ( toy poodle ) does NOT like these . They do n't smell great either . Will NOT be reordering .
5 #### My pug has stink breath .. It will take your breath away ... This helps and she loves them . She does have dental cleaning but not as often as she should . Would buy again . Ca n't find them locally . Price is high .
5 #### My dog just love these yip yaps . I would recommend every pet owner to try these for their animals . They will love them .
5 #### Although I do n't know if these actually function as " breath mints " I DO know that all I have to say is " Yip - Yap " and my 3 dogs come running ! The shape is adorable , facilitating their gently taking one end of the " bone . " This product is so good that I 've shared it with 2 friends who now love it , as do their dogs ! It 's a great treat .
5 #### I first bought yipyaps as they are nearly protein free , and my dog was on a low protein diet for liver failure . But it turned out that all 5 dogs love these yipyaps ! They 're cute little crunchy treats , kinda like the old Pez candies but shaped like little bones . Now I keep a tin in my purse for treats at the vet 's office or wherever . It 's great to have a purse / pocket sized treat that never rubs off on your hands with stinky greasy crumbs , like other products .
5 #### Jake I bought this for my aging shihtzu . He used it as soon as I set it up . It is very sturdy and durable . Would hold a big dog easily . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I love this ramp and so do my dogs . I like the material - it 's a little soft which I less is less scary when training dogs to use it . I used to own a ramp exactly like this one years and years ago and I 'm glad I bought this again . Easy to use , I like there 's a lock on it , and it 's very strong . I have a 130 pound mastiff and it 's great for him .
3 #### It works but its a bit too heavy to carry for me . difficult to pickbup , open , fold , replace ... so i bought the doggie hammock instead for the backseat . dog prefers to have the back seat rests dropped down and have large cargo space in back half of car which is why i purchsd ramp ... but sadly not working out for me . If you 're tall and strong should be no problm ...

When I could n't find sturdy stairs in the correct size , I started looking at ramps and chose this one based on the positive reviews and the video another reviewer posted . Using roast beef as a high - incentive treat , I walked him around and on the ramp while it was on the floor before moving to the car , and it worked like a charm ! Take an extra 5 minutes to do the intro correctly if your dog is a scaredy - cat like mine ; it makes all the difference . He likes the ramp so much he even lays on it in the back of the car ! The ramp is n't lightweight but it 's doable ; it 's sturdy and does n't bounce . The surface provides traction even in wet weather . Really glad I purchased this ramp !
5 #### Very sturdy . Both my Aussies took to it right off . The rubber keeps the bumper from getting scratched . Does n't rock or bounce . Great product . Weighs 18 lbs but worth it for the quality you get .
5 #### Ordered this for my husband and our dog . Have n't tried it with our dog yet , but hubby used it for something else and it works great for loading items onto his truck .
5 #### This is a well made and easy to use ramp for large dogs . It folds in two and has a spring retainer to keep it together . the ramp is coated with rubber that gives my dog a lot of traction when ascending it into my SUV . I would highly recommend for large dogs .
2 #### Sturdy and does the job but way way too bulky and heavy to be really useful . I am back to lifting my dogs fat - ass into the truck .
5 #### this thing is the bomb ! taught my choco lab to use it in less than ten minutes ( start on the ground with treats and work your way up to the back of the suv using a case of dog food in between -- easy peasy ) -- worth every penny
5 #### After our dogs ACL repair she was not supposed to jump in and out of our vehicle . This ramp is awesome . It took a full day of training , but now all three of our dogs use the ramp .
3 #### Well it is big and heavy , but folds in half and is well made . problem is , I ca nt get my dogs to go up it , at least not yet . So kind of useless for me and expensive . But if your dog will use it , it could be a godsend to your back !
5 #### I bought this ramp to help my two 60 lb bullies get in and out of my SUV because , being that I am pregnant , I am no longer able to lift them . This ramp is VERY sturdy and thoughtfully well made . There is grippy rubber on the part that the dog walks on which helps them feel steady and allows them to easily go up or down without sliding . There is also rubber on the part that rests on your bumper to help prevent scratching . My only complaint is that it is still fairly heavy and bulky for a pregnant woman to be pulling in and out of the car a total of 4 times for a simple trip to the vet . However , I am still happy with my purchase because , although it 's bulky and heavier than I 'd like , it 's still well made and is going to last a long time .
2 #### I bought this to help my senior dog get up and down the steps to our front door . The nonslip textured grip on this ramp is superior to the sand paper style of other ramps . That is a plus . However , the material was not made to last . It claims it holds up to 500 pounds . I weigh 120 lbs and the ramp broke when put a foot on to step up . I am glad it was me and not my dog who fell . If she had fallen through and broken her weak leg , I would have been really , really , upset . As it is , I am just out the $ 128 I paid for the ramp I used for less than a year .
5 #### I have no idea why people have said the surface is bad or that it is n't strong ... The vinyl surface is formed over the actual structure and though not too smooth ... you do n't want it too smooth . This ramp is extremely sturdy and easily supports my 175 # great dane to get in and out of our camper ( and fits over the threshold really nicely ) . It is heavier than the aluminum ones but my dogs do n't like those ... they do n't seem to trust them . Put these on the ground and use treats to get your dog to walk back and forth across them for a few days ... they will adapt and get used to them . If you have a short run of stairs in your house ... put them down and you may find your dog having fun walking up and down the stairs .
4 #### This is a great product , exactly as pictured and described . I purchased it for use in my pool because the dogs can not see the steps . It worked brilliantly in that respect , however like other reviewer 's have stated , everything rests almost immediately due to pool chemicals . It would be awesome if they could create a model specifically for this need .
1 #### The dogs hate this ramp and I hate it almost as much . Good concept , but bad in practice . The hard surface and light bounce have the dogs scampering across it and they both attempt to jump off the side rather than walk up or down this ramp . We have 100 + lb . dogs . The ramp is also heavy and awkward to lift in and out of the car . We 've pinched our fingers more than once moving the unit . And the unit is quite large taking up a lot of space in the back of the wagon . For the price , I do n't recommend . Spend more and buy folding stairs . I finally broke down and spent the money and the dogs are thrilled . Zero learning curve . They go up and down without issue and the stairs are lighter and take up much less space in the vehicle .
4 #### Very durable , well - made , liked the heavy - duty rubber treads , very tactile steps so our Chocolate Labs would n't slip , easy fold / unfold , useful integrated handle . Everything about it was great and I would have kept it ; however , it was just too heavy for me to transport daily from home - use to car - use . Even my husband said to buy something else that 's lighter weight so he purchased one , but that model had the " sand paper " tread . We 're still looking for a happy middle , a model that 's light - weight but with the rubber treads . This model is a 5 - star if I did n't have to transport it , kept it stationary at bedside , great for home - use . It 's also a 5 - star for people who can handle the weight .
1 #### Much too heavy and bulky . I could not even lift it out of the box , nevermind in and out of the car . Returned it immediately
5 #### I 'm not one to write reviews but since I looked for so long for the best pet ramp for our golden retriever , I wanted to try to help anyone who might be looking for the same . The learning curve was so simple , a couple treats when he went across it flat on the carpet between the couch and coffee table , another when he went up and down it on the step out the sliding door and then more treats when you put it up in the car ! This is 10 stars , honestly , it 's perfect ! He 's only 2 but we take our golden retriever everywhere and I started to cringe watching his ankles and hips with multiple ins and outs of our vehicles per day . Pros : genius preventative on pet 's body ; material is one million percent injury proof ; ideal width for even a large dog ; works for husband 's suburban and my car trunk ( has a pass thru to the backseat that he climbs thru once he gets in trunk ) ; all weather proof ; super sturdy - no weakness or sag to it ; color ; would be shocked if it did n't last a lifetime . The only con would be it 's a bit heavy but once you get used to maneuvering it , the weight seems more manageable .
5 #### Love this ramp- it 's made our life 100 % easier . We have 2 dogs & a boat- getting them on & off was extremely tricky & we dreaded taking our dogs to the boat . Several people on our dock had ramps & after 3 years ( ! ) we decided to try it . The dogs walked across the ramp onto our boat like they 'd been doing it forever . The ramp we lined best was the Petstep- well made , easy to store & heavy duty . I highly recommend this ramp !
5 #### Got this for our above ground pool as our lab was having problems with the steps . Purchased the leg set as well . Easy in and out and our dog loves to just sit on it submerged in the water . Do recommend .
5 #### This was the second pet ramp that I ordered . I had to send the first one back ( SolveIt brand ) because it was total garbage for the exact same price . All the other ramps beside this one were made with sandpaper that cut my dogs paws and provided no traction for climbing . The PetSTEP is designed more intelligently , made of rubber with horizontal ridges that make it easy for your dog to climb and not slip . It also has guards on the sides , and provides good width . My dog who just had knee surgery was having a hard time getting into my Toyota highlander , and this ramp has really helped her regain confidence about going for car rides . It also has a 5 year warranty , and does n't look like it plans on giving out any time soon . I walked up it ( 170 lbs ) and it felt very stable . I saw that people complained about the weight and size , but it is n't any bigger or heavier than the first ramp I ordered - just a lot higher quality . Overall , good product that your dog can use for a long time .
5 #### Great for the pool , move kayaks , car use . It 's a sturdy ramp ! My dogs feels safe when walking on it .
4 #### Was looking for lightweight ramp for 6 mo . golden retriever post spay surgery . Gave the puppy a month to get used to using ramp instead of stairs , no fear or problems with walling up or down the ramp . I like the non slip material they used , it 's better than the rough sandpaper stuff on other ramps . It 's on the smaller side so it easier to fold and store .
5 #### This ramp is fantastic ! I 'm glad I spent the extra money to get one that is sturdy . We use this ramp for two 60 pound puppies getting in / out of a crew cab of a Chevy 1500 . The ramp has two rubber strips running the length of the ramp in addition to the horizontal plastic ridges so the puppies do n't slip .
4 #### Just a bit heavy when controlling a blind / deaf dog , but he manages it quite well . Had no problems opening and closing . Ramp is made very well .
2 #### This is a really well built ramp , and the rubberized surface is great . The problem I have , and the reason I 'm returning it is it hurts my back to use it . It does not lock open and wants to fold shut until it is placed down on the bumper . It 's quite long and wide so trying to open it and maneuver it around is difficult . It also has pinched my fingers as there is no handle , just cut out areas and if you grip too close on the edges of the cut out you get pinched . I 'm a fairly large guy at 6 ' and 220 lbs . , so I imagine it is difficult for others as well . Ca n't ask for a better built product , just not easy to use . I 'm probably going to order a telescoping ramp and give that a try . I do wish this one was telescoping as it would be perfect .
5 #### I 've had this for a long while . I have a Maltese that ca n't jump up on my bed . So , I put this at the foot of my bed , and the dog loves it and uses it all the time . This is a heavy , sturdy , and durable product . You can wash it off and wipe it down , and I find it easy to carry into that back bedroom that stays locked when the housekeeper come to clean the house . It is heavy , but manageable . I 've had it for almost 2 years and the springs , latches , hinges - everything is working as well as the day I received it . Would not give way with a much heavier than 15 pound dog .
5 #### Great ramp . The ridges provide sure footing for my big girls ( 90&100 lbs ) and they even included training directions for those who need guidance . Our car is a new Suburban and the back is 44 " high so I make sure I am close , we 're the ramp to slip but is so substantial and week designed that I do n't that there is a chance of that . I have had telescoping and other folding ramps but this one is far superior . If you love your dog 's and value their safety , this ramp is for you .
4 #### This is the perfect solution for loading my aging German Shepherd Dog into my Honda CR - V. The non - slip surface works very well . It did n't take long for my dog to figure out how to use it . I only wish it was a bit lighter weight and folded into thirds to keep the length shorter during storage and travel .
5 #### I love this ramp and own two of them . One of them has been in constant use for 5 years and ( aside from a little dirt ) is just like new . These ramps are truly built to last . It is a nice heavy weight which makes it stable underfoot . The treads make it safe for the dogs even when they are at a dead run . I use one of these outside the doggy door to span a 2 1/2 foot drop . The dogs love it . It is more expensive than many other ramps , but it 's worth the money .
5 #### Unlike every other ramp I 've seen , it has rubber nubs to help the dogs feet grip ( we 'll see how well it works in Alaska ! ) . We have one with a sandpaper type of grip , and after a year outside in Chicagoland , the grip top all peeled off . ( I believe this is the only ramp that the WeatherTech Floorliner Company carries ) . Nice color . Good length . Very sturdy . Highly recommended .
5 #### Durable and effective . My 2 small dogs ( approximately 16 lbs each ) have used this daily for over 3 years . I leave it propped up outside , and it had endured all types of weather ( California weather : ) ) and does n't look like it 's going to breakdown anytime soon .
5 #### SO pleased I researched until finding this ramp ! It works on the side Toyota sedan door - is sits a bit angled but still allows our girl to walk up instead of jump poorly with her aging spine . Have it set up for the love seat when not needed for the car . The built - in handle works well for carrying . The rubber - like textured surface is wonderful - great traction . After debating a year on this , saw the PetSTEP last week and knew right away it was the one ! Kudos on your engineering !
5 #### Did a lot of research and figured the rubber non - skid surface was the best choice for our boxers out of what was available on Amazon at the time . Had a few reservations thinking the ramp would have to set / install at an angle in our truck rear doorway , forcing me to place more of the top edge into the vehicle , leaving less ramp length . Surprisingly this was not the case ! Have not yet introduced the dogs to the ramp but do n't expect problems . It is wide enough for them at 17 inches and quite sturdy ! It is not the lightest of options but I am a woman and can easily lift it once the bifold spring latch is hooked up . However , wo n't have to worry about it flying out of the truck bed or jostling around too much . Our 2015 RAM 2500 Crew Cab ( pretty tall ! ) has the fold flat floor in the back . The ramp rests securely on the ledge of the elevated floor . Yet the ramp angle appears to be quite manageable .
1 #### I am very disappointed in this produce . The folding petstep came and the box was not damaged . When I took the petstep out of the box , the spting that holds the two sides , was stretched to the limit . I read the training instructions and laid the petstep out on the floor , for my Newfoundlands dogs and I cut the heal of my hand on the ragged platform . The petset was broken on the ramp portion and the broken edge was staggered . This is really poor quality control ! Sometimes I wonder if pet companies have our animals best interest .
2 #### Too Heavy . I bought it for my wife to get our 65lbs Bulldog in and out of the Volvo but it 's too cumbersome . She decided to just pick the dog up and put him in .
4 #### This is a great ramp for larger dogs . Only 1 problem , there is n't a way to hook the ramp to the pool . If it had that , 5 stars ! If you buy , I suggest also getting the leg attachments that will hold it up better in the pool .
5 #### This ramp is solid ! My 100 lb Alaskan malamute who is arthritic can easily go up and down it when loading and unloading from our truck . It does not bow much when he is on it . Like barely a bend in it . Also the traction is top - notch . No slipping at all even when wet . It is heavy , but this is the most solidly built and has the best traction of any we have personally seen . Highly recommended .
5 #### Our 3 rescue dogs ( 13 yo Boxer mix , 8 yo Beagle , 7 yo Terrier mix ) adapted to this very quickly . ( But the manufacturer does include some tips on how to train your dog to use it . ) It 's easy to fold , but may weigh more than some are used to lifting . It also has a spring - lock securing tab when it 's stored . Easy clean - up too . Only drawback is you need some depth to use this . I have to pull my vehicle 3 feet out of our shallow garage , set up the ramp , then load in all 3 dogs .
5 #### I have n't use yet but looks stunning , good ramp .
5 #### A little long but absolutely perfect for our black lab with a bad hind leg to get up and down the bed . Pretty heavy for regular transport so if you need to get them in and out of the car , might want something less heavy .
3 #### It is helpful for my old dog , but it 's bulky & heavy for me to lift , and the hook / loop to keep it in place stretched out almost immediately . The good news is the ramp seems to stay put w/o having to use that . The ramp may not be as difficult for others -- I had a partial wrist replacement surgery six years ago & am not as strong as I was " in my youth " ...
5 #### Wonderful , back saving , heavy duty ramp . Worth it . It did take up a lot of room in the back of my wagon , but I never have any human passengers anyway so that does n't matter to me . This thing is rock solid and has great traction built into it .
5 #### Easy to setup and easy to load and unload my 75 lb black lab . I 'm a petite woman and find it fairly easy to setup and transport .
5 #### Perfect for my 150 lb mastiff , it took about 15 minutes to convince him to walk on it but once he did he loved it ! Feels very sturdy and stable . I am definitely happy with it
1 #### Very heavy and inconvenient ramp . My dog is 60 lb and this ramp is heavier than her . The folding closure is very difficult to handle especially when it 's so heavy . If we found out the issues earlier , I would 've returned it . We started using it a while after we received it .
5 #### The best pet ramp out there , with the best traction for their paws ! Since I 'm a pet products retailer , I 've tried and seen many others but this one beats every other ramp . I 've been using this for well over 5 years , still going strong ! Very sturdy to support my over 100 lbs Golden and 84 lbs Lab ! Totally worth the investment !
3 #### little bit of a pain to use , not really a friendly item
4 #### We have a Golden who will not jump up into the bed of our F250 . I got tired of lifting a 75 Lb dog up everytine we stop on a trip . This is light weight but very solid . Folds in half for storage / transport and uses a plastic coated spring to keep it in the folded position . It would be very beneficial if they would add a carrying strap / handle .
3 #### heavy , watch the fingers . My dogs did n't like it !
4 #### Probably ought to give it 5 stars , but have n't had it that long -- got ta see how it fares after a few years . So far , works great . Dog has plenty of traction , ramp is plenty stable . Not too heavy to move occasionally , like to mow the lawn . As I saw other reviewers note , it is easy and pretty painful to pinch your fingers when folding it up . Excellent for any human or animal weighing up to about 160 pounds .
5 #### This works very well for the intended purpose . We have three dogs that we take on frequent trips in our truck and travel trailer . This is long enough and sturdy enough to give our older GSD / Lab mix a steady entry into both . All three of our dogs use it and it gives us peace of mind that they will avoid injury while entering and exiting . We place it in the bed our truck so that it is handy . It has a non - slip texture that works well in the rain , but is not so rough to rub paws . I am an older female with some arthritis in my hands , but if I wear gloves , it does not present a problem for me to open and close it . Love this for the dogs !
5 #### Such a great ramp for my two Goldens , aged 14 and 13 . They went up it without hesitation the first time . It is heavy , but that is what makes it well made . I live at the coast and needed this to be rust proof . There are a few parts that seem to be rusting but it 's held up for at least four years without falling apart . I am using it for more than my car . After our daily walk on the beach , I clean my dogs up on my wood patio table . I place the ramp on the edge of the table with no problem at all . My dogs scamper up and down it at will . Good rubberized surface for great traction . The underside that rests on the car bumper or my table is cushioned so no damage has occurred to either surface . It also folds , so after loading the dogs , I slip the ramp in next to them . They lay on it while traveling . For solving the problem of lifting older dogs into an SUV , this has been great . I should have purchased this years ago to save my back .
5 #### at how well this works . Yes you can pinch your fingers but you have to be a klutz to do it . Handles my 120 lb shepherds with ease and they like it and it seems like it will last for a long time , very sturdy . Not too heavy for the strength it has but at 18lbs or so might be a bit much for elderly or smaller folk . Works well with SUV , do n't know about smaller cars cause it is not small . I and my dogs are both very happy with it and the price was MUCH cheaper on Amazon then at the pet stores !
5 #### Have bought several ramps and returned them . This is the BEST ramp . I have a 2002 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo I have an 85 lb . yellow lab and after a few tries with treats and on a leash .... she got it quickly . The most important thing is that it is sturdy . Very stable on my tail gate . And easy , easy , easy , to fold and slip right in . I 'm a 5'1 woman and I have no problem ! My lab actually waits for me to get it out . Jumping in and out on an SUV is not a good thing for a dog . And get it before your dog starts having problems . And if you have a puppy ... get it now . You may not think you need it with a puppy because they can easily jump in and out . But that constant pounding on the front joints getting in and especially out will start to show as they get older . GO GET THIS ... YOUR DOG WILL BE Much better in their older years .

3 #### This is a well built super strong 200 lb capacity ramp that performs as advertised . For the money it is probably the best one that you can buy . I bought this and was impressed with the quality but I 'm sending it back . Here 's why . This thing is huge , 70x17 inches and weighs 22 lbs . Due to the weight and size you can not easily fold it ( pinched my fingers ) then it takes up a lot of space in the rear of your vehicle . My Lab refused to walk on it which created a further training issue . I also purchased a dog crate for the back of my SUV which also had to be returned . Due to size restrictions of the vehicle my dog just barely fit in it . A good plan that fell apart . I found a solution . Purchased from Amazon was a luxury bench rear seat cover . It 's a heavy duty quilted polyester water resistant non - slip cover for the rear seat . It has a hammock fitting option that totally covers the rear seat and back of the front seat area . The manufacturer is 4knines . Basically your dog is restricted to this one area containing the mess and hair and not destroying the rest of your car . It works . This product is fully washable . This is a viable option you may wish to consider .
5 #### We have three large dogs and they use the ramp with ease . Might have to assist pushing their behind up the first few times , but they get the picture quickly . Saves their shoulders ! It folds easily and fits snugly onto the back end of my SUV ( Porsche Cayenne 2011 ) .
5 #### looked into something that was portable AND would hold up in our winter snows . Been very pleased with this product . Following their instructions , I got my dog to use it within a few hours . It has been out in all sorts of weather and seems to be holding up well . I like that it will not rust , folds easily and quickly , and has rubber strips to give them traction . Unlike other similar products , this rubber strip seems to be the superior product . The box it arrived in was damaged but maybe that was it was so bulky . It was in pristine condition . This is helping my dog tremendously with her mobility issues .
2 #### Try as we might we could n't get our old dogs to use it . It freaked one of them out and the other one still had enough gumption to jump in the back of the car . The product itself is fine I think . Rather long , does n't store in the back of the car like I thought it would . They should probably make it 3 folding sections that you can put in the back of the car with the dog(s ) .
4 #### This one is a good quality product sturdy and hard . Difficult to open it . It is too big for my SUV Grand Cherokee . I wish it was holder to 3 piece not two and wider . I do n't have much experience in pet ramps this one is good but did not make my life much easier than before as much as I wished for .
5 #### Bought used - opted for this version of a ramp for my pack of aging herding dogs - 50 # Aussie / BCs and a 75 # Bouvier des Flandres - who were beginning to tear my aging back . Made in USA from heavy duty plastic by the same folks who made the floor mats I got for the truck ( Weather Tek ) . Folds easily . The weight is necessary for the sturdiness I need ( plan to throw in the truck bed when not being used ) . No metal to rust . Textured ramp built in ( no peeling ) . Altogether the ramp is an ideal product I was very pleased to buy at 60 % retail cost .
5 #### We purchased this for a large mastiff ( 167 lbs ) to get in / out of a truck and camper . We got him used to it by having him go on / off our porch with it , and then moved to the steeper truck and camper . It can be a bit slippery in the rain but the ridges help with grip . Watch out when you fold it , because as the directions state , it can really pinch if your fingers are in the wrong place when you fold .. This is a lifesaver for us as we could not lift our mastiff into our truck or camper , and this ramp stows folded in the truck between the back seat and front seat , in the bed of the truck , or in the " basement " of the camper . We had a tri - fold ramp before this one and it was far heavier and harder to handle , yet did not seem to be as secure for him . We like this one and will be purchasing another one just like it so we can have one in the truck and one in the camper all the time .
4 #### I got this ramp to use over the stairs to the backyard ( 2 steps ) when a dog was injured , and now use it for getting dogs into / out of my vehicle as well . I have had it for several months in frequent use . Its width , the raised edge rail , and the texture + rubberized surface combine to provide good traction in any weather conditions . It 's a bit heavy but easily managed , and the substance and weight provide a firm surface that all my dogs are comfortable using ( no wiggle , no sagging ) . If your dog is not used to ramps or vehicle rides I strongly recommend getting them used to it flat on the ground and as a ramp going into and out of the house before adding the stress of a car on top of it , and letting them have their head so they can keep their balance . My only dislike is how thick it is when folded . I was hoping to able to slide it under my car crates during transit but it simply does n't fit ( when folded in half and laying flat it is about 6 - 3/4 " tall on the thicker end ) .
5 #### Easy to use and folds compactly . The three greyhounds took to it immediately . I would highly recommend it to anyone .
5 #### great product .. feels really high quality .. just watch your fingers when you pick it up .. now I have to train my dog to use it :)
2 #### Great for my dog and ease in getting out of a high SUV , but step is bulky and heavy . It would be nice if it had a handle of sorts .
5 #### Years ago when dog ramps first came out they were fairly steep and my 100 # Labrador had much difficulty going up it . Fast forward 10 plus years ...... now there are a ton of options out there ! We have two Labradors .... one is 80 # and the English Labrador is 90 # . Within minutes they were using the ramp without any hesitation or issues . We have a Dodge Durango , and the incline is at a perfect grade for them to feel safe going up and down . The ramp is light weight and stores easily in the car as well . We are THRILLED that we picked this particular ramp over the other ones listed . BUY IT NOW ! !
3 #### A piece broke off before we even used the ramp . I we guess should have paid attention to other reviews . Altho I like the ramp , the fact that something broke immediately is unacceptable . Altho there were many 5 star reviews , I should have paid more attention to the 1 & 2 star reviews .
5 #### Love the ramp -- it folds right out / in with no sharp edges or anything , the surface has a non - slip surface which my 60 # dog manages quite well -- just took a little practice with it at a lower angle then up a little higher each time . He 's getting older now and has trouble with his hindquarters , at times he ca n't seem to pick up the rear legs , so obviously he ca n't jump into our Mountaineer anymore . I 'm 67 , female , and I can pick it up and put in place -- it 's about 18 # so not bad ... I am very happy with it and am glad I did n't go for the cheaper metal one ( from another company ) that had comments regarding sharp edges . And this one is long enough , at 6 feet in length it can accommodate the height of the liftgate bumper .
5 #### The ramp works great ! Perfect to use with my GMC truck . Love the non - slip surface and so do the dogs ! !
5 #### No assembly , flip open and use it . Works on my Toyota mini van , fold up when done , and lift using the built in recessed handle on the side . I am a guy and can carry with one hand like butta
5 #### I use this ramp for my pet potbelly pig who weighs about 110lbs . Other ramps were hard for him to climb up as his hooves could n't grip the surface . This ramp , however , is wonderful ! He climbs right up without sliding backwards at all ! ! !
4 #### I personally like this product . It is durable , folds , and has multiple uses . Our dog does not know how to go up step that are terazza . She bonny hops up the 5 stairs , but I am concerned when she is older , she will not be able to get the push from her back legs . I followed the advice that came with the ramp . We put it flat in front of her food dish . Within a day , she was willing to walk on it and go back and forth . Then I put it on a set of steps outside and within one day she would go up if she got a treat in the end . Then I put it on the steps we bought it for and as yet , she will not use it there . However , I am not giving up . She is still young and eventually I hope to get her to use it . In the meantime , I have it near the area and have her use it on a less angled surface . I think the ramp is a good product but it does not come with a dog trainer !
5 #### Received earlier than expected . Is exactly as described . We have a 2 year old husky and a 8 year old lab ( who can no longer jump into the back of our Honda ) . Before using it in the back of our car , we had easily acclimated the dogs to the use of this ramp by placing it off to the side and on the bottom 4 stairs ( inside stairs ) . I blocked the other side of the stairway with a chair ( anything like that would work ) . We called them up the stairs and gave them a treat . We called them down the stairs and gave them a treat . It was quite entertaining for them . Sturdy . Stable . Will help to preserve their hips and knees .
4 #### I had to return a telescoping pet ramp I got through Amazon because the scratchy , ping pong paddle surface did n't work for my 30 pd dog . She literally slipped and left scratched marks on it . This one has ridges that are close together and the surface feels like a synthetic rubber . I set it up and put a couple pieces of kibble at the top of the ramp set at a 45 degree angle and my 8 year old dog scrambled right up it , ate the kibble and laid down on it . I had to tell her " table " to get her up and onto the table . She had knee surgery earlier this year and this would have helped a great deal with the car and the grooming table as I have a bad back making it a challenge to lift her that far . I do n't need it to get her down but may try it to get her ready for the back of the SUV . It is 2.5 pds heavier than the other and the sides are relatively thin plastic as opposed to the fiber glass with the telescoping one . The box states that it weighs 18.5 pds which differs from the description a bit . This one is harder to move around and there really is only one length . It 's rubber feet left a mark on white berber carpet that the vacuum removed . A friend of mine has this ramp and has used it for a variety of other uses .
5 #### I got this for my aging 26 - lb . dog who was having trouble climbing the steps from my back yard to the porch . There are only two steps , so the ramp angle is too shallow for the top edge to rest flush against the porch as pictured , but the rubber along the front edge still grips the porch securely and I have had no problems . I bought this two months ago as a permanent outdoor fixture and so far it has endured a variety of weather conditions , including rain and snow . Only time will tell if it can withstand a Texas summer , but so far it seems very durable . Best of all , my dog took to the ramp right away and the built - in treads allow him to walk up and down with ease . My only concern is that he is so comfortable on it , he sometimes gets a little too close to the side and I have to monitor him to make sure he does n't fall off . So if I could make any improvement to this product , it would be the addition of side rails . Aside from that , I 'm really happy with the ramp and recommend it highly ! UPDATE : After more than a year of use and countless days baking in 90 + degree heat under full sun , the ramp is as solid as ever . I thought the rubber treads might melt or come loose , but they did not . Great product !
4 #### My pool does n't have steps & my Golden , unlike my lab , wo n't jump into the pool . I bought this ramp plus " legs " and put it in my pool so my Golden could walk down the ramp into the pool . He learned to use it immediately . My only comment is it 's not stable & I have to hold onto it as my dog walks down it . Again - this is in the pool . I ca n't comment on how it is on solid ground . It did solve my problem , however . My Golden can now enjoy the pool with me & my lab .
4 #### Chose this ramp due to it 's numerous positive reviews . Liked the fact that it folded instead of telescoping . The weight rating was also a good selling feature . The downside was it was too short for my needs . No matter how I tried to convince my dog to use it , the steepness of the ramp was too much for him . In his defense , he is a large ( 100 lb ) , senior ( 10 yr ) golden with hip dysplasia . The ramp was well made and had great traction and would still recommend it even though it was n't for me .
5 #### This ramp has good traction and can be set up easily on more than one kind of vehicle or object .
4 #### This is a great product but too heavy and cumbersome for most women to use without risk of back injury . While this product has been a lifesaver , I 'm currently looking for a lighter product that will work as well as this one . If you have a suggestion , please leave me a comment . I use this ramp with a hatchback and for storage am able to stand it on its side against the door using a bungy cord to keep it upright . This saves a lot of room and allows me to carry 3 large dogs in my hatchback with rear seats folded . I previously tried putting it behind front seat but it was awkward to get in and out with back seats folded down . On the plus side , the ramp is sturdy , easy to clean , and the dogs have had no problem using it . I used the training instructions for my dog , but his companions were motivated just by dog bones .
5 #### AFter much shopping , we are glad we decided on this ramp . Our 3 elderly dogs have no problem using it , even in the rain , because of the textured rubbery surface that gives them great traction and does n't scratch their paws . It is somewhat heavier than some other ramps , but well worth the weight . We put this up over our RV steps for the dogs , but it is strong enough for us to use also . It fits , at an angle , but still sturdy in the open back passenger door of our GMC 2500 truck . Also , there is nothing to scratch the vehicle as all surfaces are protected with the " rubbery " coating . We could n't be more pleased .
5 #### My two little Dachshunds are too old to go up and down the steps easily , and I 've got COPD and it 's hard for me to go out a lot to let them use the bathroom . So , I got this ramp and it 's next to our deck steps and my little dachs go up and down it whenever they need to go outside without any problem . My cats even use it !
5 #### Sturdy , wide , big , long -- perfect for my 80 lb . dog -- > Subaru Forrester . I wanted something that I could stand and walk on to show our dog that it could be trusted -- and sure enough , it is . Our dog isn ' too old to require this , but I wanted to start using it as trying to teach some dogs to use ramps can be difficult ( and the last thing I wanted to do was to teach him how to use it when he was injured ) . He is n't injured , but it took about 4 weeks to truly get him comfortable with using it . FYI , I always stand on it myself to make sure it 's not wobbly or so the middle does n't slightly buckle upwards ( make sure the top part of the steps is FLAT as possible on the rim of the car / fender ) . It 's a bit heavy , but it truly is solid and constructed well . Also , as others may have written , closing this must be done carefully . Not sure if they changed the design since when I got it ( about a year ago ? ) but you could lose a finger or two when closing this thing .
5 #### Bought this for our 50 - pound dog , for use following surgery , to reduce the risk of post - op hernia . Trained him on it prior to surgery , since he 's used to jumping in and out of the van . Dog navigated it just fine , even in post - anesthesia haze :-) . Also used indoors to get him on and off the grooming table . All surfaces are coated , so there 's nothing to scratch the vehicle 's paint . When folded , ramp kept closed with a coil spring , protected with a bit of clear tubing . Simple solution that works just fine . Notch in rails well - placed to carrying when folded . Rubber pads help resist slipping off the bumper when the dog is walking the ramp . Definitely recommend to dog friends .
4 #### First of all , this is heavy and bulky . Those two items are why this is a 4 star item instead of 5 . Having said that , I had no problem lifting or using it . This ramp is superior in every way to another ramp I have . ( The other ramp I have is the Solvit 62337 - it has a sandpaper type finish that is hard to get up if the incline is too steep ... say , in a standard SUV . My dog also FELL off of it NUMEROUS times , hence why I purchased this one ) . The PetSTEP ramp has a wonderful rubbery texture that makes it easy to walk up and down for a dog . It is a bi - fold ramp versus a sliding accordian type , but it needs to be for as sturdy as it is . It stows nicely in the back seat or propped up against the wall in the garage . The material on this ramp alone makes it worth the price !
5 #### The PetStep ramp is the best quality pet ramp I was able to find after much research . I had even brought one ramp home , and then returned it because it was poorly designed and constructed . It was the same price as the PetStep . The PetStep model has a rubberized texture on the ramp , which is fantastic . All other models I found had a gritty sandpaper for traction . This was hard on human hands when manuevering the ramp , as well as the pads on the dogs ' feet . The dogs are not the delicate type ( 3 of them , each 100 + lbs ) . The ramp is very sturdy which helps the dogs feel secure when using the ramp . No wavy wobbling even for our hefty pups ! And ... Amazon 's order processing is great . The ramp was delivered very quickly .
4 #### Our 90 pound husky just had ACL surgery and I bought this so he could get in and out of the SUV . It is a great ramp , easy to use , very sturdy , a cinch to unfold and very lightweight . The tread is very good and provides for sure footing . We have used it outside over a few steps for him and it has been left outside in the rain overnight . It is plastic , so being outside does n't hurt it and the water runs right off it . I am really happy with it .
5 #### Our older dog sometimes has trouble jumping into the SUV , so we bought this for him . It was very easy to train both of our two dogs to use this ramp . We have had the opportunity to use this when we go on our long hikes , we are out for hours and have two very tired dogs when we get back . They walk right up the ramp with no problems . I have had the ramp for about two months and I would recommend this ramp as it is easy to use and to train a dog to use it . We keep it in our back seat to always have it handy . I look forward to using this ramp for years to come .
5 #### We have a very old 20 pound rescue dog who has a terrible time with stairs . Very arthritic and has old orthopedic issues . We were lifting him constantly . Debated and researched ramps FOREVER ..... finally settled on this one . We could not be more pleased ! ! ! First , I am a small woman , and this is EASY to lift ; and I have no idea about where folks are getting this " pinching you fingers " stuff .... I mean , yes , if something folds and you put your fingers in the way , you will get pinched , but you have to be stupid to do that ! We carry over next door sometimes without even folding it ..... very easy to manage BUT very well designed and sturdy . Love the rubber grips at the top and the ribbed ramp is just perfect . He learned to do it in 2 days and seems sort of proud that he can go up and down by himself now . We hear the " WOOF " at the door and there he is at the top of the ramp . BUY IT ! ! ! It has changed out lives . And , Amazon is always excellent to deal with ! ! ! !
5 #### Toby , our 90 - lb " pup " , got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own . The Petstep saved the day . Easy to deploy , easy to fold and stow . You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up , but only once . Sorta like a child and a hot stove . Live and learn . I do n't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use . By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds , and stow it in about 10 seconds . From a dog psychology standpoint , I found that even after using it for a year , Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down . And his legs were not able to handle that , so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he would n't try to jump off . In the end , it was prostate cancer that did him in . The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I 'm sure we 'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own . But she 's only 6 so she has a few more good years I think .
4 #### The plastic is thick enough not to flex or twist , and the shape of the end is good as it sits on the tailgate . Very stable . [ ... ]
5 #### I purchased this ramp a little over 10 years ago when I bought an SUV and did not want to lift my elderly 65 lb dog into the rear . He caught on right away and this worked so well he never missed his car . I got 2 puppies 8 years ago and still have the SUVs - did n't want to damage their puppy legs so have used this right along every single day into their older years ! It has held up remarkably well and I can easily fold it and stow it in the back when it is not being used . This has probably been the only item I have ever used on a daily basis and still have as much need as I had the first day I bought it ! I have recommended this item to friends and they seem to think a ramp is ramp . Some of their ramps are too steep ( short ) for an SUV - some are too narrow for our 65 lb chows , and some get either slippery in the rain or hot in the summer . And some are hard to put away . This ramp does n't have any of those limitations . I am pleased with this purchase and hope you will be too . And FYI - I paid about the same price 10 years ago !
5 #### I searched for any ramp that mentioned it would be good for outdoor use . I could never find one that actually said so . But this one looked sturdy and durable and like it would hold up in the direct sun . I needed a permanent one for my senior dog to get down the back stairs . So far so good and I 'm very happy . My boy still will not use it on his own , but if I point he will go up and down the ramp . The funny thing is , now he is running down next to the ramp , using it as a guide and is n't falling like he was . So it has a dual usage ! I recommend this great product .
4 #### I bought this for my 10 year old , 80 lb dog who is arthritic and diabetic . I have a Mazda hatchback ; without a ramp it is very difficult for her to haul herself up into the back seat . I gave this ramp four stars but that is only for the product & the company itself ( ie construction , perceived durability , quick shipping , etc ... ) NOT for the usefullness of the product , at least in my car , which is not an SUV or particularly high . I give it two stars for usefullness and ease of use . The ribbed surface has good traction and the construction seems good . This ramp is too short to be used to climb into the hatchback . The angle is too steep and there is no " lip " to secure it . But , the ramp is too wide to fit in the rear door so we just can not use it . I will try to make use of it in the house or back porch . I recommend going to a store to try this out before purchasing .
5 #### I love this ramp for my Brittany to get up on the sofa . She is 12 years and has multiple elbow and hip surgeries making jumping up on the sofa non existent without me lifting her up . I have tried a step but steps are too far apart and she is very unstable on it . This ramp has a rubber coating on it making it easy for her nails to grasp for sure footing . I will be using it also to help get her into our SUV .
5 #### I like this ramp because it does not weigh much , is shorter than most ramps . I have a older model Honda CRV and just fits on lower ledge . Any wider and it would not work for the back doors . The rubber type ramp material is really good and there is no slipping as I read on other ramps that had sand paper type anti slip . I also can use in my bedroom for my dogs to get on the bed .
5 #### Excellent supplier . Just as promised and timely . Thank you , kindly .
5 #### I like this product fine , but my dogs do n't like using it - they like steps better and fortunately they are still able to use steps .
5 #### I bought one of these 13 years ago , the half size , to connect dog door with the outside . Used by three dogs , often simultaneously , 65 pounds , 60lbs and 45lbs . Stood up to hot tropical sun that beats down on it every morning . Has been scrubbed clean numerous times and it still holds its traction . Just bought a second ramp for a doggie pool . Attached it to the Skamper Ramp . The doggie pool is a heavy duty stock tank and PetStep 's rubberized grip grabs the stock tank and leans at perfect angle from ground to pool . Skamper Ramp is tied to a couple utility holes at top of PetStep . So dogs have both an entry and exit from the pool . The PetStep ramp is so secure that my 15 pound dog sits at the top before deciding whether to go swim . And my 27 lb dog who does n't like water can climb up PetStep to drink pool water , then turn around and walk back down the ramp . Both entry and exit ramps lift up easily when it 's time to cover the pool . PetStep HalfStep Ramp is a solid , secure , long lasting product .
4 #### This ramp will not be breaking in two ; with loose hinges . Easy to train just put at kitchen door ; a chair on one side . myself on the other and she went right up . It is heavy . I think it is supposed to weigh 10 lbs . Seems like more to me ; but I have back problems . If it were lighter would give it 5 stars .
5 #### This Petstep HalfSTEP Pet Ramp is just what we needed for our 5 month old Shih Tzu . Poor thing is so short and close to the ground that she can not jump high enough to sit on the sofa or see anything other than ankles and feet . With her new ramp , she is able to get up in bed , bound up the deck steps and set and romp on the sofa . She took right to the whole ramp concept and is a master at flying up and down it . We like that it is durable and light enough to put just anywhere for her . Great product for short puppies and dogs who want to get to a higher level .
3 #### This dog ramp is sturdy poly but it is heavy . Specs say it is 11 pounds but it is awkward to handle . especially for my wife . You may want to consider something that is collapsible as this ramp takes up a lot of room in your van , SUV , etc .
5 #### The kitties love these " mice . " The tails do n't last long so I guess it 's good they come in a pack of 3 . I also needed the actual wand part because the other one was really chewed up . They enjoy these even if i wave them around by hand . The panic mouse does n't hold their interest for very long so it 's nice to be able to manually engage them by taking the wand off . if you do n't own a panic mouse your cats can still enjoy these .
4 #### My cats enjoy the Panic Mouse , but they get pretty rough with it , so it 's nice to have replacement wands . I recommend this product .
1 #### The Panic Mouse is such a let down . These wands do n't really connect to the unit , so they just yank out with enough force . And my 10 month old cat had enough force to do it ! What a bad design .
3 #### My cats went bonkers over the Panic Mouse when I first turned it on , but they quickly developed a tolerance to it . One cat now lies on the floor in front of it and passively whaps it when the mouse wand moves past him . Another cat sits still and allows the wand to " pet " him . A couple other cats quiver in the background and watch the wand spin around with eyes like pinwheels , but they do not interact with it , no matter how fast or slow I set the toy . Perhaps it is the loud whirring noise that puts them off . The Panic Mouse seems sturdy and relatively well made , so I do n't plan to write it off just yet . I think younger or more active cats would enjoy this cat toy more than older , lazy cats who just want to be adored . From a safe distance . To date , the best cat toy that gets regular use ( and maintains interest ) is&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Da - Bird - Interactive - Feather - Cat - Toy / dp / B0006N9J3A / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Da Bird Interactive Feather Cat Toy</a > . That and crumpled up balls of aluminum foil and the string that was once attached to my kitchen timer .
4 #### I purchased this , alongside a spare , to allow myself to more easily walk my three dogs ( two on the system , one on a traditional leash ) on my lunch breaks . I have three 25 - 30 lb dogs and it really made it a lot easier ! However , if you 've got a dog that fiercely pulls like one of mine , this may not work as well . Safety - wise ? Great , it held all their multi - directional crazy just fine ! ;) I just happened to find that if we did long walks where she was exceptionally determined to chase the bunnies on our walk , I had a sore lower back the next day from where the pressure points lay . If your dog is n't a zoo , however , this is a FANTASTIC product . I think I 'll just put our puller on the regular leash and the two charmers on the Buddy System !
5 #### I LOVE this leash ! The small size purchased has a lighter weight clip to attach to a small dog collar ! Those of us with small dogs know that a heavy metal leash clip hanging a dog collar is too much weight for some necks . I have recommended this to all of my dog - owner friends . This system keeps my hands free to carry packages , mail , grocery sacks , etc . , while my best " buddy " is trotting along at my side . I also enjoy using an extra leash to walk another dog at my other side .
5 #### Just received this a couple days ago and already love it . Now I can run , skate or ride my bike and keep my dogs right next to me . One warning , though . Instructions indicate you can leave the collar clip attached to the dog 's collar . I do n't recommend that as it can hang down just enough for your dog to get it in her mouth and chew the clip . The company was nice enough to replace the clip when I called them so kudos to them for doing that . I 've added the Add - A - Buddy , Extend - A - Buddy , and Lunge Buster accessories so I can walk my entire pack at once . I have a Husky , an Australian Shepherd / Border Collie mix , a Pug / Chihuahua mix , and two Chihuahuas . The Buddy System has small dog and regular dog extensions so walking all five dogs at once is easy . It 's quite a sight to see me walking down the street with five dogs attached and my hands are still free to offer treats , give hand signals , or carry a couple toys . I 'll have to make a video review at some point soon and post it here . In the meantime , if you want to walk or exercise with your dog and keep your hands free this is the system to use .
5 #### These arrived in a timely manner and I was pleasantly surprised to receive orange ones , instead of white . We have two already and they are great for getting ticks off dogs and ourselves , VERY simple to use and gets the entire tick every time . We keep them in our backpacks and take them anytime we are in the woods . I wanted to buy a couple more because we sometimes have a hard time finding them in the various packs and bags we have . I bought some small carabiners so I can clip these on the outside of bags making them easier to find ( and being orange they should be even easier to spot ) .
5 #### Easily scoops the tick off without having to touch it ! !
5 #### This is the second one I 've purchased . The best tick removal tool you can find !
5 #### Have not had to use it yet . Thank goodness but looks sturdy and effective
5 #### Purchased more than one - this works GREAT ! Easy to use and lightweight , I keep one in my backpack at all times .
4 #### I 've tried a few tick removers for my pets , this one seems to be the best one for me . It seems to have the least amount of effort and I never had to struggle with it . I keep one in my adventure bag so it 's always handy and available .
5 #### I purchased this as well as two other tick removal tools . This is by far the best of the bunch removing then holding the tick in the cup once removed . It easily gets underneath the tick with the long coat my cockers have . I just purchased another one ( a 3 pack ) to have in our Rv and give one to my brother inlaw .
5 #### Pulled off many a tick with this . Works like a charm !
5 #### Get more than one ! We have one upstairs , one downstairs and one in our car .
5 #### Love this ! Arrived on Monday , found the first tick ever on my dog Tuesday , super easy to use , pulled the head and all !
5 #### Best product I have ever used to remove ticks .
5 #### A friend told me about this item - I was skeptical but figured it was worth having on hand . My pup had an embedded tick in her side . This remover pulled it out very easily . I was impressed and relieved at how well it worked . Highly recommend .
1 #### Waste of money . Does n't work as described . Just use tweezers - grab as near the tick 's head as you can and provide a constant gentle pressure away from the dog 's skin . The tick will release ( not instantly ) . This scoop this is for the birds ( or NOT as the case may be . ) Could n't get around the hair / fur to get to the base of the tick head - just did nothing . WASTE .
5 #### The only remover that I 've ever tried that actually works perfectly on every tick I 've encountered ( only used it on humans )
5 #### Right after purchasing this tick remover we went camping and I got three ticks . This removed the ticks so easy and painlessly that the other family that was with us ordered it for themselves . Great product and I highly recommend if to anyone who spends a lot of time outdoors
5 #### It worked ! I just removed my first tick . It was from my son 's calf and it worked just fine . I bought mine at my vet for only $ 5 so you may want to check your vet or walmart / cvs first . But it 's a good product . I 'm going to buy another and put one in each car . With dogs it 's especially useful because it 's harder to take tics off of them . I have not yet had to use it on one of my dogs yet .
5 #### This product works great and removes the head of the tick -- I would n't use anything else !
5 #### I 've owned this product for several years and love it . Purchased this one for a friend who has a small child that recently had a tick attached . Easy to use .
5 #### I 'm always in a panic about removing ticks ( my 14 year - old dog never had a problem with them until last fall ! ) and luckily my husband is usually around to help pull back her long hair so I can get to the tick . We 're both a bit freaked about doing it right / getting the whole tick . I ordered this " Ticked Off , " tick remover and just used it for the first time . I was by myself .. meaning one set of hands and the stupid creature was right by her eye . I ripped open the package and followed the swiping motion shown in the directions . It came off whole , and my poor old girl did n't even flinch ( like she usually does when we go at her with tweezers ) . I 'm thrilled with my purchase and because I read every review before making my purchase , I signed right on to Amazon to let everyone who may be looking for a solution know about this great product !
5 #### Very easy to use . The hardest part is getting the pet to hold still , as it is with anything you are trying to do to them . My wife and I both have problems with our hands , but found this style of tick remover to be the easiest to use . I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products . I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product . You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes . I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own .
5 #### This is a great product , although I have n't had to use it yet , it is great to have on hand ! !
5 #### Works really , really well ! ! just takes the stupid bug right off of the dog or human , with ease . Great product
3 #### The last few weeks have been brutal in terms of numbers of ticks . We have two short haired , indoors but spend time outdoors hiking and playing dogs ( A Ridgeback and a Blackmouth Cur ) . Although we spend a lot of time grooming them for ticks to get them before they embed we still get a range from newly embedded , partially full and fully engorged . All smaller ticks , no full sized dog ticks . After looking at all the tick products available on Amazon I decided to order a bunch . The Tick Key , Coghlan 's Tick Remover , Ticked Off , Ticklasso , and the Tick Twister . Ticked Off and the other tools based on a groove are ok , but it 's easy for hair to get in the grooves and cause small non - bloated ticks to twist out and take multiple passed ( or give up on and grab the lasso ) . They are better than nothing but ca n't compare to the lasso . Of the varieties listed above Ticklasso is simply the best for removing small ticks reliably regardless of engorgement level . It takes a bit longer to get them lassoed than it takes to line up any of the grove ( Tick Key , Ticked Off , Tick Twister ) style removers , but they come off intact every time and once it 's on none slip away . Those may be a bit faster and more effective for fully engorged ticks , but the lasso is SO much better on the not full and small ticks that it 's far and away the best for us .
5 #### Have n't had to use it , but seems like it should work . Pretty ingenious idea . I 'll update at later date once it 's used .
5 #### this is wonderful ... You isolate the tick and not any fut ... our dog does not fight this like he does the tweezers
5 #### We have dogs and live in an area where we have a tick season . This little tools is the quickest and simplest way to pull off a tick from a squirming puppy I have found . Once scoop and you got the bug .
3 #### A great idea ! Works well for larger ticks , but not very well for seed ticks . You need to twist a little as you pull on the tick .
4 #### Pros : Quickly removes ticks from my dog with their head intact Holds ticks in place Cons : Takes a small amount of practice to properly use . You can do the same thing with tweezers with a little extra effort and attention . Often the ticks get stuck in the crack and you will need a toothpick like object to fish them out . Other Thoughts : Many users say they ca n't remove ticks until after they have fed , I did not experience this . I can remove new ticks as easily as fed ones . The spoon , as I call it , is made of cheap plastic , but feels pretty sturdy since the plastic is fairly thick . It should n't break unless stepped on or abused . It is small enough to be easily stepped on if dropped however . I would recommend this and will probably buy another once I get drunk and step on this one .
2 #### I had one tick I pulled off that just happened to work . I can see it may be better if you let the tick get bigger , but if it 's newly dug in , it is very hard to use . You have to try to line up JUST right , and if your dog squirms like MINE does , well - you are pretty much out of luck .
5 #### my dog will sleep on the couch while i do this and it wo n't wake him up .. great product
5 #### I bought this for my yellow lab that seemed to be a tick magnet last year . Well , of course since I bought it for her , she has n't had ANY ticks on her ! Last week I had a tick on me ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I ran and got the tick spoon and with out muss or fuss that tick came right off . No trying to grab next to the skin , or anything else to make sure you get the whole thing , etc . Just slide the end right up to the tick and lift . Yes ... for me ... much easier than trying to use tweezers .
2 #### Sorry , but I have better luck with a pair of tweezers . The thought behind it is a good one , but needs more research ?
5 #### Very easy to use and you do n't have to worry about not getting the entire tick out . Far better than tweezers .
5 #### I compared this product with other tick removers and chose this one as it is simple and cheap , but effective . We have deer ticks my dogs often get , despite my best efforts to keep them off with other stuff , so this purchase was a must . There is a small wedge groove at the bottom of the bowl and it seems to fit perfectly between the tick 's suction and body parts . Removal of an adult slightly engorged was not a problem . It did n't pull off skin with it but it left no part of the tick in there either . The tick can then put directly disposed of as it fits neatly in the bowl . Genius design .
5 #### Ticked Off makes removal of ticks from my dog safe and easy . Such a simple device but works great . Great value .
4 #### My cats have had a rough spring so far due to numerous ticks in our yard . This product is simple to use and usually the tick comes right off . I have had a few that did n't but I think that was due to my cat squirming to get away .
5 #### My dog is a tick magnet , have bought collars and sprays , but still gets them . This simple spoon works great , get the entire tick out every time . Best to pinch the skin around the tick , to better get at the tick .
5 #### works perfectly ! Great product ! A must if you have any tick problem . It removes the whole body and head every time .
5 #### I used this while working a a boy scout camp for a few summers as the first aider . Boy scouts in Ohio know how to find ticks and get them in some strange places . Following the CDC guidelines on tick removal this tool is the simplest tool for the job . Getting the whole tick is the most important thing when removing the tick . Often when using tweezers you can leave the head . With Ticked Off you just slide the spoons v shaped notch under the back side and around the head of the tick and lift straight up slowly . I 've pulled over 500 ticks off scouts and have never left any part of the tick behind . They even work for those pestsy seed ticks that are so small you can barely see them . Small enough to put in a backpacking first aid kit , light enough to keep attached to your dog 's leash .
5 #### Awesome product ! I have two cats that bring home ticks all the time . This product gets all of them ! No matter what size the tick is , I always get that satisfying " popping " sound of the tick coming out , head and all . The v shape of the ticked off keeps the tick contained until you take it out , ensuring it will not crawl away before you can dispose of it . Yes , it works on humans too !
5 #### I have two gerbils and both love this food , even the picky eater . I like that it 's made specifically for gerbils . It always arrives on time and in good shipping condition .
5 #### she was getting kinda lazy and chubby , when i got her on this , she was more active , running the wheel , and slimmed down quickly !
5 #### I 've had three generations of gerbils who 've eaten this food . It was originally recommended to us by the small animal rescue where we adopted our first family of gerbils . It is a well - balanced product designed specifically for the needs of gerbils . Our vet told us that contrary to the way pet food is packaged , gerbils and hamsters do have different nutritional needs , and most gerbli / hamster foods are formulated primarily for hamsters , not gerbils . Unfortunately this food is not carried by many vendors in the US anymore , and I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to find it anymore .
5 #### It is extremely difficult to find a prepackaged food that is made specifically for gerbils . Most products are formulated for other rodents - hamsters , mice , rats , etc . Gerbils are mostly vegetable and fruit eaters . Some will eat grub worms occasionally for extra protein in the wild . This product is much better than commercial hamster / gerbil foods .
5 #### Most commercial hamster / gerbil food is designed for HAMSTERS ... and will contain a mix of sunflower seeds , peanuts ... millet ... oats ... etc . Your gerbils have an instinct to gorge on high fat foods and will eat out all of the sunflower seeds , peanuts ... and high - fat seeds first ... and will only eat the millet , oats and green pellets when everything better is gone . If you feed your gerbils " hamster food " daily ... you'll soon have plump gerbils . ( Hamsters on the other hand ... are hoarders ... and will hide a portion of high fat foods in their nest for " later " consumption which rarely happens . ) Gerri Premium Gerbil Food is actually formulated for gerbils ... not hamsters ... leaving out the high fat sunflower seeds and peanuts . ( You CAN still feed sunflower seeds as treats ... don't get me wrong ... but they should n't be included in the " regular " food . You would n't serve dessert to your kids with dinner and expect them to eat their dinner first ! ! ) I believe the food is manufactured in the UK . I 've only been able to get my hands on a couple of bags ... which I thought were excellent in quality . What a relief not having to spend an hour picking sunflower seeds and peanuts out of the mix !
5 #### I read on more than one gerbil care site that this was the food they recommended & I agree with them completely . It is made up of alot of different things . My gerbils seem to like it .
5 #### Great product . Get this if you have any areas that have ticks . Works on humans and dogs / cats just as easily and scoops out the tick with it 's head and feeding tube . You need this .
5 #### This is a truly great tool and I 'm now ordering two more -- one more as backup for the dogs , one for us . We live in a tick intense area . I 've tried everything , including extremely fine tweezers , with some success , but ONLY this small spoon remover gets the whole tick , every time , mostly with no visible after effect ( that depends on how embedded the tick has gotten -- regardless , the tool removes the WHOLE tick ) .
5 #### Love this tick remover ! I lived in an area with tons of ticks and my dogs were always getting them . It was disgusting to try and pick them off by hand , and using tweasers was gross because it squeezes the tick and leaves the head half the time . Then the whole match thing never worked for me either . I found this tick remover at the counter of a pet store- took it home to test it out- and voila ! Works great . I 've had no problems , and it works effortlessly every time for me . Just have to " scoop " the tick and the tool actually lifts the tick out ( the whole tick ! no head left behind ) . Once you get the right scoop technique it will never fail you . Such a stupid idea really , it 's basically a teaspoon with a notch cut out , but I could n't live without it ! ( & p.s . I have a Siberian Husky with super long hair , and a Great Dane with short hair - so it works great on everyone ) .
1 #### I 've been removing ticks for years , and this tool is a very crude approach to tick removal . I just found a tick on my dog-- first of the season-- and tried ( for the first time ) using this tick tool which I had bought several years ago . It is a BLUNT object and I spent 15 minutes trying to remove a moderate - sized tick with it and finally gave up in frustration . There are better devices on the market . Do n't waste your money .
5 #### Gerbil loves it and seems healthier than anything available at pet store . He loves the dried carrots .
5 #### My two gerbils LOVE this stuff . When I first got them , I experimented with Oxbow rings ( too boring ) and big box pet store food ( too much junk ) , but I could n't find something they would readily eat and had the right nutritional blend . Those little fur - friends eat every morsel of their Gerri Gerbil food and it appears to do them good . They 've maintained a good weight and have had no health problems since I got them . They seem to like the variety and I think it keeps them from getting bored with the food . I order 2 bags at a time and freeze one . Highly recommend !
4 #### Gerbils really enjoy this food and eat most of the components happily .
5 #### My gerbils love it , and I like that it does n't have those green pellets that every gerbil I have ever had has hated . I found myself throwing away a lot of gerbil food because they did n't eat the pellets , but this food is wonderful ! They love the pumpkin seeds and you can pick them out of the bag and save them to give them just as treats if you like . This 2 pound bag should last my 3 young gerbils about 2 months ( I had a 1.75 pound bag of other gerbil food that lasted half that time because I had to throw out so much ! ) . They say that if you just leave the food the gerbils do n't like in their bowl that they will eventually be forced to eat it , but I do n't like doing that to them ; I do n't want them to have to force down food they hate . Now with this food I do n't have to ! They love every bit and it makes me feel like a good ' parent ' to give them the best quality food made specifically for them that they enjoy .
5 #### My gerbils love this food ! Just not sure why it is so expensive here on Amazon .
5 #### Best gerbil food around ! Perfect protein to fat ratio !
5 #### best food on the market for a gerbil in my opinion .
5 #### I had heard good things about this food , but I was skeptical because all gerbil food seemed to be the same . I 'd been trying a different brand of food every time I need a new bag ( Brown 's , Vita Prima , Higgins , several Kaytee mixes , Walmart brand , etc .. ) . But this is the one food that my gerbils will eat every morsel of - any other food I tried , they would skip certain pellets or seeds until only that one kind was left . They seem to really enjoy this food - every time I refill the bowl , they come and get their favorite piece and go hide to eat it so the other one ca n't take it from them . This is the one we came back for .
5 #### Awesome ingredients ! My gerbils love it , and it is n't filled with fattening seeds ! Most food is for gerbils AND hamsters , which really means only for hamsters ! This food is just for Gerbils =) Sadly it has n't been available for awhile , but in the past I 've ordered multiple times and each time was 5 - star satisfied !
5 #### This food is Great My gerbils love it Keps them Shiny and healthy . They are not fat or anything and do very well on it . This is the only food ill feed them
4 #### Dogs loved them waiting to see if they work , being patient ! I also liked that they did n't have a bunch of additives .
5 #### This product helps with fleas prevention . My dog loves it and I use it as a training treat . thank you
1 #### I read the reviews for this product and bought it based on belief that people were always honest = not . Most of the reviews said that their pets LOVED to eat these like a tasty snack = not . My dogs wo n't even eat their food if I crunch the tablets up and sprinkle them on the food . Either I got the wrong item , or somebody is stretching the truth = big time .
2 #### My only experience with Yesterday 's News is when my cats undergo a declaw procedure . It works for that . I do n't think I would ever buy this litter for everyday use . The pellets are gross and they do n't absorb well or control odor . Stick with clumping litter for the best results overall . But again , after a declaw , this stuff is essential for kittens with extra - sensitive , post - op paws .
5 #### This is great dog food . It 's what our vet recommended when out Boston Terrier was a puppy and he 's been eating it ever since . We change up the flavor that we buy occasionally , but he really seems to like the chicken . It has normal kibble and then larger pieces of chicken mixed in that he goes crazy for . He 's a very healthy little guy .
5 #### This bag will last me forever ! ! I only use a tiny scoop to mix with wet dog food . My dog does nt seem to like to eat this dry , but she may just not like dry dog food . I will be buying this from amazon again !
5 #### Love this cat litter because my cat does n't end up scattering it all over the place and as long as you scoop put the soiled areas periodically it keeps the fact that you eben5have it low profile
4 #### Its a great product if looking for a alternative to more traditional litters . It does nt always do the best job at keeping smell down on solid waste but its a breeze to clean up and has very little tracking . I do n't think I 'll be going back to regular litter anytime soon . I would recommend this product .
5 #### I love this litter . Why ? Mainly because it does nt track all over my home like the clay and sand - type litters do . At the end of each day I dump the entire box into the outdoor can . I pour approximately one inch of Yesterdays News into the box eac time I empty it . I have three cats , so I have to dump it every day , but I find this much easier than scooping .
4 #### This stuff is necessary for kittens after declaw surgery but yikes , it stinks when they use it ! It also tends to end up all over the place . But its a must - have so can put up with it for two weeks but that s it !
5 #### The cat 's track it a little bit , but not as bad as conventional litter .
2 #### I did not care for this litter neither did my cat . He did n't really want to walk on them plus it clumped really oddly with the litter
3 #### This was my backup when i ran out of my usual brand . Its nice but really does n't cut down smell like my usual brand does
3 #### I always had been happy w/ " Yesterday news " pellets for litter boxes . Even my Vet recommends this brand & product and uses in her animal hospital . But lately , when buying the pellets are thinner , harder & longer and my picky kitty cats wo n't use the litter box . I understand that the company thinks they 're improving the product to make it past longer but if the fur kids wo n't use it , they 're going to lose customers . My kitty 's liked this product because it was so much softer and comfortable , now it 's not ! So disappointed and using Pine pellets now which do n't last as long as the original " Yesterday 's News " formula & cut but 100 % better than this new formula they 're selling ! Bring back the original , softer pellets , please ? ? ? ! ! !
5 #### This food was on several lists of quality dog foods . Our dogs love it and I like the convenience of having it delivered .
5 #### Our 2 year old dog is very picky and she has been through many types of food- some that cost even more than this , but she gets sick of each food without weeks . I tried wet food , which was easier since my older dog has wet food , but she would n't eat even that after a few weeks .... then I tried this dry food and so far so good , she has n't gotten tired of it yet ! I would be careful what size you get though . I tried to get a big bag and saved money and it took her months to eat ... and I think it was getting stale ( not sure ) but now I only buy the small size since she takes forever to eat it .
4 #### I 'm looking for my dogs but it seems like the prices are always going up every time I order
4 #### It 's a good product . It 's a shame my cat does n't like it .
4 #### This litter is a GREAT option for my foster kittens because the large size of the pellets keeps the playpen easy to clean ! Pros : 1 . Much less likely to track outside the litter box 2 . Easy to pick up pieces tracked outside 3 . Post - surgery safe Cons : 1 . Difficult to scoop all the dirty litter because of its already - dark color . I wish they would make this in a lighter color . 2 . Does n't cover up the smell well . Be sure to use a hooded litter box to contain it ! Luckily , this is cheap enough through Amazon that I do n't mind fully changing out the litter box 1 - 2 times a week ( depending on the number of kittens I 'm fostering ) . I will continue to use this litter because the pros greatly outweigh the cons for me .
3 #### I m changing my review on this because I found a better product . It does track all over and makes a mess .
4 #### Smells kinda odd but does the job for my ferret
5 #### Been feeding this now for sometime with our Bassett . Likes the shredded pieces of meat .
5 #### My dog loves this food . However , the bag that I ordered was 18 lbs and was a bit too much . I think he 's getting tired of it . When he first started eating it , he would gobble it down . Now , he slowly eats it and sometimes does n't finish it . I think that he needs more variety . I will order this food again , but will get a much smaller bag since I only have one dog .
2 #### This litter is n't horrible but I 've had much better . It does not help with smell at all . I just would never buy it again . It has lasted a long time though and I have two cats using the same box . There are just better options out there that also work with the Breeze system .
5 #### I 've worked in several vet hospitals and this is all of their go - to regular good . The formula has been specially made by hundreds of professional scientists and veterinarians at Purina . When my puppy graduated to adult food , I found myself wondering if grain free really was better , but I 'm glad I decided on Pro Plan ! My baby downs it and her coat is softer than it was on a lower quality diet . Also , you can tell by looking at the poop at what kind of quality diet they are on ! Good poop = happy pooch ! ( Remember that grain free replaces grains with other carbohydrates in any dried dog food . )
5 #### My dog likes this food . Better price than in pet stores .
5 #### I started my 8 yr old dog on this after she sustained a shoulder injury . I tried several other joint formulas ( cheaper , found at local pet stores ) and just did n't see the results that we got with this . I ran out once , and she was without all of it for a week ... and in that time , her limp came back and her activity level dropped quite noticably . I think this product works wonders !
5 #### My cats just love the Friskies Pates and will not eat any of the textured ones , like shreds , except the tuna and egg which Amazon does not carry . I have six cats . They all share one can each morning for breakfast . The one can feeds them all with some left for seconds . They have their regular Friskies dry food out all the time in the gravity feeder , but they enjoy their breakfast Friskies pates . Wo n't go with another brand . I 'll stick with Friskies . Be sure to choose the 24 can case of one flavor pate for about $ 9 , not the one for about $ 18 . It is the same product and quantity , just a higher price . Also use the subscription to save more .
5 #### My two finicky felines prefer the Friskies canned food , one , my Aby , will even nose out her Siamese brother to get his food . It is great to get the food delivered , and at a cheaper price than I have been paying at the grocery store . I have trouble getting around due to some physical problems , so the free delivery is especially nice for me . My Aby will worry me constantly if she thinks I have forgotten to feed her on time . No way to forget when feeding time has come with her around .
5 #### That about says it all . We give our 3 Maine coons a little wet food in the morning for a treat . I hated having to drive to the pet food store ( much cheaper than the grocery store ) . Now that it comes to my front door , I could n't be happier - and so are the kitties !
3 #### I received the case of catfood I ordered in a timely fashion , but it had been handled roughly , and several cans were smashed and leaking ! It smelled so bad , with all the catfood juice intermingled with the rest of the cans that I had to throw it all away . I really did n't feel like washing the cans for storage !
3 #### Pate .. best served warm .. our cats will tolerate this for a few days as something different , but then turn away from it . This is used in addition to dry food ( their basic ) . I do n't recommend for a steady diet .. lots of waste .
5 #### My fur baby absolutely loves this dog food . I went with the expensive brands at first and he refused to eat them and so I put this in his bowl and he devoured it . I like the two different textures that it has and obviously so does he . Bonus was this was an add on item so I can save a few bucks ! Definitely recommend , especially if you have a picky eater ! ! ! !
5 #### High quality - love that it is delivered on a schedule .
4 #### I definitely prefer the scented version of yesterday 's news . Especially this " Fresh Scent " vs. the Lavender or the unscented . Keeps the litter box smelling fresh ! Although because it does not clump , the recycled material seems to get dusty quickly with frequent uses . I definitely refresh the litter box more than with clay clumping litter . Chose this product to litter train my kitten and it worked great for that purpose !
2 #### Fresh scent ? Do n't smell a thing , except cat urine . I only use natural cat litters - non - clay and compostable so thought I 'd give this a try . Much prefer Feline Pine - and not one of the off - brands - have found that the Feline Pine brand is much superior in absorption and odor control - just wish Amazon would offer it in Subscribe and Save .
5 #### This is the only brand of litter that I use for my rabbits . It absorbs really well ( in comparison to some large chain store brands that I 've purchased in the past ) and a little goes a really long way . I also like that despite it being fragranced , the smell is very light ( bonus for my sensitive smelling buns ;-)
5 #### My lab mix really likes this food . We 're on the third bag and he has n't gotten tired of it like other foods . He also has a sensitive stomach but this food does n't seem to bother him at all . Try a small bag first if you 're iffy .
5 #### My dog loves it and looks great . He was on the Pro - Plan puppy for a year and is on going on his 4th bag of this .
5 #### I had seen this toy many times , but finally got one and my 4 cats all love it . I never would have thought that a simple toy like this would interest them . It has a very smooth and fast movement on the rolling ball and the scratcher is used by my cats too . You can get the replacement scratcher boards easily .
5 #### We use this for our bunny 's litterbox and absolutely love it . It does n't smell , and does n't stick to her fur and feet like bedding and such does .
4 #### Do you have ferrets ? I do ! I use paper litter in their litter boxes and when I 'm unable to go pick up a physical bag , this is the bag I order . The size of the litter usually varies from bag to bag , sometimes they 're large and sometimes they 're split in half . I 'm sure it just comes down to how the box was handled . Smell is greatly reduced and litter is easy to handle .
5 #### Been using this litter for my rabbit . Controls odors , no dust and does nt track .
4 #### Excellent quality dog food for my senior dog . Highly digestible .
5 #### I have used this product in both forms for several years with my now 12 year old Labrador retriever ! He has arthritis in one of his elbows from an old injury . I often take him south for a couple of months in the winter and I think because of the humidity , he could hardly walk by the time we got back . After using Connectin , he can take several hour long hikes each week and never is sore or lame afterward ! This product is amazing ! ! I did start him on the " initial dose " for the 1st 2 months then went to the maintenance dose . It took about 3 weeks before I started to see results .
5 #### We were told about Connectin at a local pet supply store . Our dog is ten years old and has the usual old age arthritis . She s on Rimadyl . But this stuff made a noticeable difference in just a few days . Normally shed be limping by the end of the day . Not as much now . The limping now is only after those days she s played really hard . She is a ball / fetch monster and needs her play sessions for her mental well - being . So if your dog has arthritis , try this . Its definitely made a difference for our pup .
5 #### Has really helped my Pit With Her hip issues Highly Reccomend
5 #### I use these as an alternative to the plastic pellets in some litter systems . Does n't smell , cheaper than the " official " pellets , and are probably friendlier to dispose of .
3 #### My cats collect and drag litter everywhere , so I decided to give this a shot . I have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes . I have a long hair who always has litter on her and takes it all over the place . I also hated the dust from clay , wheat , and corn litters . This litter is great , as I can just vacuum or sweep up the pellets . I also scoop out the poop or obvious soaked pellets and then dump the entire box every 3 - 5 days . HOWEVER , the odor gets to be way too pungent after a few days since it absorbs so much urine . I learned to only put a few scoops of litter in their boxes and dump in that 3 - 5 day window . Filling the boxes meant the urine / ammonia smell was overpowering , even when scooping . The scent is pleasant but does n't do anything for odor control . Realistically , this is convenient and easy for me to just dump it rather than vacuum and dust all of the particles from other litter . My cats also took to it without issue . Pros : Easy to clean , simple to scoop / dump , decent price , lasts about 1.5 months between 2 cats . Cons : Does n't do much for odor control
4 #### SO much better than clay litter . The dust is very minimal , which makes it less aggravating to clean the box ( and also helped clear up some of my cat 's allergies ) . It lasts the same amount of time , and the cats adjusted fine to it . It does n't smell anymore than clay litter does -- aka you need to clean the box regularly , but it wo n't stink up your whole house . The two issues : 1 , it 's difficult to scoop . Scooping out poop ends up taking the litter with it as well , which is annoying . 2 , the cats seem to track it everywhere ... not sure how that happens with the pellets , but it does . Not quite so bad at tracking as clay litter , though . It also does n't seem as dirty , although that 's probably psychological .
1 #### I am not sure what is going on exactly . My 3 Pit Bulls love Purina Pro Plan , but this batch / bag they will not touch , they smell it and walk away . Expiration is 10/2018 , so it should still be good ? I googled to see if there is any recalls , but could not find any . I would like to know how Amazon is storing their dry dog food brands ? Does anyone else have this problem ?
5 #### My dog really likes this food . It 's the only brand we 've ever given him ( he 's 1.5 ) and he 's never had any illnesses .
5 #### If only my dog could review this product ! It 's a great price for the amount you get . I am in the process of trying to find the best dog food for my pup . He seems to like this a lot and I like the natural ingredients that this product uses .
5 #### This is the only wet food my cats will eat . I have to warm it up Sous vide because they wo n't touch cold food unless it 's dry , but they gobble it up . I use this to supplement their diet which consists of Blue Buffalo dry food and weekly treats of homemade yogurt sprinkled with bits of dry food on top . No more shedding , no more hairballs & my cats have never been silkier . They 're so shiny they sparkle in the sun !
5 #### Finicky Persian LOVES this Pate formula ! Inexpensive and good ! ! Thanks
5 #### Everyone should give this to their pet ! ! ! ! Works way better than other supplements , plus more natural I believe !
5 #### My little one has been limping . After being told about these I figured I would give it a try . A week later she hardly limps at all . She even likes the taste + always wants more . I will continue to give this as the benefits are huge for her .
5 #### I 've noticed a huge difference in my dog already . Just after 1 week !
5 #### My older service dog has back and joint injuries , so our veterinarian suggested giving him daily glucosamine / chondroitin supplements . I originally bought this product from a local pet store , but Amazon 's price is much lower . Dog chews and swallows this tablet quickly with no complaints .
5 #### My dog loves this food and she 's fairly picky . It was recommended by a local Pet Store . Buying it on Amazon saves me a couple of dollars over the local store .
3 #### At beginning my dogs like it , but now not anymore , I do n't know why . Buy a small package the first time , it 's better .
5 #### Even tho my dog picks out the pieces of chicken first he does love this food !
4 #### this is ok for a temporary litter but not for full time unless you like the smell of urine and feces and no clumping and money is no object . I use this if cat needs it after surgery etc . its softer on paws and no litter to get impacted but it does not clump or hide odors at all . you go through a lot of litter because you almost have to change the whole thing every day and add all new litter since it does not clump and hard to get out just the bad parts . its not cheap if you have to replace all of the litter every day , adds up . for temporary use its perfect with the downside of it does nothing for the smells .
5 #### I love it . Had excellent results in use with ferrets in past . My three new fuzz - babies however , seem to prefer placing their waste anywhere OTHER than the litter pan . * sigh They think the litter is for digging . I have other things for them to dig in , but they continue sleep in the litter pan and poop / pee next to it . * sigh
2 #### no clumping urine goes through to the bottom of the litter box .
5 #### I have 3 cats and found the pate is more filling than the gravy version so I 'm going to stick to this . I can tell they really like it since they try tripping me every feeding time to get their point across .
5 #### My cat is n't picky ; she 'll eat any wet food ( no food sensitivities either ) , and the price of this one is good . I usually buy the 32 can pack on Amazon but I buy this in the periods between when they do n't have stock of that . Good variety , arrived with no dents in the cans , nothing spoiled . Not the best brand of wet food nutritionally ( do n't expect top notch ingredients , there 's a lot of by - product ) but not the worst either , with the plus side of it not breaking the bank .
1 #### Too many non - food particles . I have to add water & make it soupy for one of my cats . In doing so , little black flecks of varying sizes would appear in every serving . Upon close up inspection there was a consistent raised pattern in the flecks , indicating it was a manufactured product and not something naturally occurring in any of the ingredients . My personal opinion is that it is pieces from the rubber / plastic sheeting on the conveyor belts . Similar to thick shelf liner material . This was observed over several months , close to a year , of feeding to my cats . I switched to Sheba and do not find any particles of anything in that . Friskies is cheap for a reason . Quality control is not important .
5 #### Cat LOVES this toy , and plays with it again and again . It 's a little noisy for sleep hours , so we turn it upside down at night .
5 #### 5 stars for this toy getting the attention of my 13 year old arthritic cat . I actually bought this for him when he was a kitten but he had no interest in it . Having arthritis , he needs some exercise . On a whim , I bought it thinking my younger cat would play and maybe entice my older boy to join in . Quite the opposite , my eldest went crazy playing with this right out of the box , youngest not so much . I 've had it for 3 days and watching him bat the ball with both paws is a joy ! I just purchased the smaller , 2 ball toy , hoping for some interaction for both boys . Oh , my boys are n't small , 12 & 10 pounds , and this has n't moved on the rug or tipped over . Just goes to show you CAN teach an old cat new tricks .
3 #### It 's ok , but our Shar - pei requires grain - free for it 's allergies . Had to switch to Wellness Core .
3 #### great price and product dogs did n't care to much for it though
5 #### oh god my dog LOVED this food , not only did she enjoy it but her coat is much shinier , her teeth are cleaner , her stools are perfect , she has lots of energy and seems healthier overall . great food ! !
5 #### I actually do n't use this for my cat , I use it for my ferrets ( as pellet litter is recommended for them , to protect their respiratory tracts from dust and their tiny paws from irritation ) . We have four ferrets and I line the areas where they go with it ; it only needs to be changed every 2 - 3 days , is very absorbent , and does n't leave messy residue like some litters . It also has a nice scent which is pleasant but not overpowering .
3 #### Works fine like the unscented version , but a lot more dusty .
5 #### This is the best and cleanest litter I have ever found and use it all the time .
5 #### My bunny loves it and i do n't smell anything from his box ! But i use puppy pads in addition to it : 33 no smell .
5 #### My dog is very fond of this food . Amazon had a great price . This does not specify any particular dog size . I was a little worried when I tried this , because of this . But , my Yorkie finds the medium sized pieces to be perfect . She just gets to chew a little , where a big dog would probably just gulp and swallow .
5 #### Been using this and the puppy version since my dog was able to eat dry food . He loves the soft chunks and eats them up right away ! To Amazon CS : Please make this available for subscription again !
5 #### I jest . This is perfectly normal dog food . Correct product , correct packaging and arrived as expected . I use it as the crunchies in my homemade dog food for my elderly and incredibly spoiled pug . I 'm sure it 's spectacular on its own but the princess pug wants homemade
5 #### PERFECT - BOUGHT THIS WITH A COUPON ( THANK YOU AMAZON ) I DO NOT HAVE A DOG . HOWEVER , I WILL BE DONATING THIS TO MY LOCAL SHELTER . I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE OF THE HIGH QUALITY INGREDIENTS THAT GO INTO THEIR PRODUCTS & ALSO BECAUSE THE MORE I SAVE - THE MORE I CAN DONATE . THANK YOU AMAZON & PURINA PRO PLAN :) YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE THE DOGGIES VERY HAPPY .
5 #### I was very excited to see Purina Pro Plan dog food for sale here on Amazon and at a very reasonable price . I bought some and I was very surprised I could see the actual dried chicken chunks in this dog food . Most dog foods say there is real chicken but you do n't ever see the chicken pieces , just kibbles . In this one , I saw the chicken . My dog is usually very picky , so I was hoping he would like this food and eat it . He does like it and ate every crumb out of his doggy dish once I had served it to him . Purina makes good food , I think their best food is Pro Plan .
5 #### my dog must think this is a treat instead of his normal dog food.when his other food runs out this will be his only food .
5 #### Very good for use with kittens . Less mess than clay litter and did n't stick to furr . More than adequate odor control .
5 #### My cats hated this at first and the only reason I bought it was because one of my cats had surgery and could n't use regular litter while healing . They eventually got used to it and it never smells . This is the first cat litter I ve ever used that does nt stink up the place .
3 #### I purchased for my cats post surgery . I have two cats . It just requires frequent cleaning job for the entire litter box since it becomes smelly easily ( after 4 days for two cats ) . Do not recommend to multi cat family unless you have the time and energy to dump and clean the litter box every few days . But do recommend to any cats who just had surgery ( for a week or two )
5 #### This is the only litter my one rabbit will use . It works great and keeps the smell to a minimum . Great stuff
5 #### Really cuts down on odor in the bunny ' : litter box .
5 #### Repeat purchase . We have 5 dogs and they all think these are treats . Once they finish their breakfast , they all come over to me for their " treat " .
4 #### When you have many cats , it really helps to find a greatly desired food that is decently well made . I have been woken up early There is a thought that the lower priced brands are just cat fast food . However I have found Frisies to be the best and healthiest bang for the buck so far . Just read and compare the labels and you can quickly tell . There is some debate about Meat - By - Products . However cats tend to eat most everything from things they would kill in the wild . As long as the source is of good quality , it 's simply a safer form of what they would eat in the wild .
1 #### Wish I could rate Friskies lower than one star ... wish I knew better before . Glad I researched this brand . Do not use this brand if you care for your cats ... look it up , research for yourself and make your own knowledgeable decision .
5 #### I took in an old tomcat that found his way to my front porch , got him a check up , shots & fixed him & discovered he was missing a lot of teeth . He 'll still chomp on dry food , but he loves this pate and it 's easy for him to eat .
5 #### I tried several options but kept seeing good reviews for use with rabbits . My rabbit really took to this in her litter box and since it 's just paper I was n't concerned when she would chew some .
5 #### My Heidi is a Bichon with allergies and her doctor told me to keep her on Duck and Potato food as these were the least likely to cause an allergic reaction . I , of course , wanted the best for my Heidi and Wellness is the best .
5 #### I like the idea this dog food is holistic with limited ingredients . This dog food is human grade . I picked this Wellness food to help my dogs with allergies . Their fur and skin look great with no dry itchy skin . No tummy problems either .
5 #### Purina Pro Plan is a favorite . My dog loves this blend .
5 #### Great price and delivered right to the front door :)
1 #### This product arrived on time but the bag was n't sealed ! it was actually closed with regular tape making the product not safe to eat for any dog ! !
5 #### UPDATED POST I mentioned my concerns about bugs in bag after writing the initial review and my dog sitter revealed he had accidentally left the bag open outside for a few days . So I can not confirm issues with Purina . Lloyd the Wonder Dog really likes this food and has no issues . But he has also eaten a bike glove and had no issues with that either so you should not put a lot of credence in his digestive system happiness . I am going to order another bag soon and go through it cup by cup . Will report findings .
5 #### These are the Purrfect toy for your feline friend ... they can keep busy for hours watching the ball go round .. ,very durable and well made !
1 #### My cat sniffed it .. looked at me and walked away . he will not eat this at all !
5 #### I love this supplement for dogs . Nothing is a miracle cure for old age , but at least their are nutritional supplements of benefit . This is one of them . Compare it to Cosequin ( sp ) or some of the other high end products . Compare the ingredients in your products and you might just decide that this is just what your doggie needs .
5 #### FINALLY , NO MORE LITTER AND DUST ON EVERY SURFACE . I PUT A POTTY PAD IN THE BOTTOM WHICH WORKS EXTREMELY WELL . TO CLEAN , I GATHER ALL FOUR CORNERS AND BOX STAYS CLEAN .
4 #### Good product but I notice the cat is capable of getting more of these pellets out of box than other brands . Also , odor control is slightly behind other leading brands ( also non perfumed ) . Overall , at this price point , it 's a good deal .
5 #### The only litter that can handle the strong urine and heavy volume from my 24 pound cat with kidney problems and dustfree
1 #### This is NOT the standard yesterday 's news pellets . Bought this as I use it with the breeze litter system . These pellets are very tiny and thin and fall right thru th slots . Even in a regullar litter pan the will be useless as they are so small they wo n't absorb anything . Guess I am stuck with them now .
5 #### Dogs love it and that 's the most important thing . I personally have stopped checking every label and deciphering every little ingredient . If others want to pay for Blue B , go ahead , I 'm done and will just get some regular food . Not the worst , not the absolute best , but decent . :)
5 #### Cooper ( 3 year old Golden Doodle ) loves this food . He weights 78 lbs . and gets between 3 and 4 cups daily . It is nice to be able to just click " buy this again " on Amazon and in a couple of days it shows up on the front porch .
1 #### This brand sometimes has moths at the store - this came without moths but made my dog throw up ( she does NOT have a sensitive stomach ) , she tried just not eating the shredded portion and I though she was being fussy so left it til she ate it . Now I feel bad for making her eat something that was obviously not right . Too much hassle to return so will throw away .
3 #### My dog liked this food and the price is decent but she was never enthusiastic about it . Some online review sites suggest that the ingredients are not great quality so we switched to the Costco brand .
5 #### Best price I 've found anywhere and it 's shipped right to my door . I have trouble lifting heavy items , so this saves my back !
3 #### my cat plays with this very occasionally ........ she does like the scratch pad part very much , especially when i put catnip on it
4 #### This is good for one of my Labradors but not the only , only because the other will not eat his food when this is mixed in . I use 2 scoop per day , scoop provided in package and it keeps my dogs from going lame . They run and play hard . I walk them between 70 and 80 miles per week , plus they swim 3 - 5 times a week . My dogs are 8 and 9 , and using this keeps at least the one running strong .
5 #### Excellent product . My dog damaged her ACL . After one month on this product there was no sigh of limping or discomfort ! We r sold . She will get this for the rest of her life , as the vet said she will get arthritis ! Hopefully this will keep it away for many years to come !
5 #### My 7 year old Lab / Australian Shepard mix has been having hip / joint issues ( also a bit overweight ) . She 's been on this two month now , and I have noticed a definite improvement in my hip / joint issues . She 's much more perky and playful again , will run , jump for hugs , and just generally is happier ! And all of this has helped to contribute to some exercise for weight loss . Highly recommend !
5 #### I love this product and believe that it is really helping my 13 y / o dog cope with walking issues - better than anything I 've used to date . My dog is n't picky but she really likes these and considers them a treat so it 's super easy to give them to her daily . But I hate that the price springs from $ 82 to $ 130 - what is up with that ? If the price stays at $ 130 I will be looking around for something else because my large dog can run through a container fairly fast . However , for a smaller dog , it might be worth it .
4 #### Very good stuff , cat loves to dig in it
4 #### Cats like it . It is a little messy . The cats seem to kick some of it out of the box .
5 #### Good price and I do n't have to pick it up at store .
2 #### My cat hated this product . It still tracked put on the carpet and did not keep smell at bay nearly as well as clay litter . I have 3/4 of a bag left and I am not sure what I will do with it .
5 #### My dog loves this food ! And I 'm an Amazon Prime Member and this is cheaper on Amazon than me driving an hour away to Pet Smart to buy it . Thank you .
5 #### I feed this to my 7 year old bichon and she LOVES it . This is now the only food she will eat . Pro Plan is such an amazing brand of food and I highly recommend it .
2 #### Caused my dog to itch . Other Pro Plan dry foods do not . I will be switching back to those , but the price was right to try this at least once . Also , pieces are too large for a 20 pd dog . This food should be labeled for large breeds . I took a picture with a pen to give you an idea of the size .
5 #### the dogs are eating the dog food . It is something they eat when other dog foods were left in their bowls .
5 #### Old cats like Pate ' . My cat is getting old .
3 #### My cats wo n't eat this because of the texture , but the feral cats like it
1 #### This food is cheaper for a reason . All three of my dogs got diarrhea from the first can . I also had the same problem with ordering wellness dry food from online . I went back to spending the money and getting it at the local pet store with no issues with it . I do n't know what is going on with it but I strongly recommend not buy dog food off the internet until this is investigated . My dogs do well on Wellness just not from online :
5 #### I foster for a local dog rescue group , and often take in pregnant females . They are often malnourished which does n't bode well for the unborn pups . I immediately start the moms off with this very nutritious puppy food to help build up their immune system . I continue feeding it while mom is nursing the pups , and once the pups are weaned I start them with this same food . I 've raised many , healthy moms and pups who have gone on to have wonderful adoptive homes .
1 #### This probably is pretty good dog food , but unlike the other fine canned dog food I buy , but it must be opened with a can opener . Since I feeds my dogs in their kennel in my walk - out basement , this means I have to keep a can opener down there and struggle with my arthritic hands , to operate it . Noe , I guess I must buy an electric can opener if I want to use this . I switched to another premium dog food .
4 #### We used only Wellness brand food for our last dog .
5 #### I 've tried all varieties of litter , initially clay- too dusty ! Then crystals- too expensive ! Pine- I liked that for a long time but I had saw dust everywhere . And finally we arrived on the paper pellets . I tried one brand I liked very much but then found it difficult to find again . We tried a store brain but it did n't kill odor well enough . Then another paper pellet type which seems to emit its own ammonia odor and finally , Yesterday 's News ! This is by far the best . It can be a bit more expensive but it does n't track . It really keeps scent down . The cats like it . And it 's easy to find and easy to scoop .
5 #### I have rabbits and use this exclusively . I have tried other types of litter and none works as good as this . The pellets are heavy enough that they do n't end up getting tracked on the floor . And it is safe . There is no clay or perfumes which is perfect for sensitive rabbits . I would never use clay for any pet . Clay litter contains silica , which is a known carcinogen when inhaled .
4 #### I had to use this litter temporarily per recommendation from my vet . Ever since , I have never gone back to regular litter . This litter is pellet - based , so it does not get all over the house and is very easy to clean up . My only complaint is that it does n't control odor very well . I did try switching to another brand of pellet - based litter , and my cat refused to use the litter box . So Yesterday 's News it is ! If you add a wall plug - in or one of those automatic spray cans to the area , that does the job . I will note that this scented kind does control odor better than the unscented though . Definitely would recommend this product .
2 #### It may be good stuff but my dog would n't touch it ... however he 's very fussy and will only eat the dogfood that he 's had since we brought him home ... however , he will eat the rice and chicken mix that I make !
3 #### This is a very high quality product fro being a Purina brand . It starts out with chicken as the first ingredient . If you are considering a step up from " store brand " this is one step in the right direction . Cedar gets a variety and this is one that he really likes . Formulas that support joint mobility are a plus , as joint issues are becoming more common in older dogs . There are better foods out there , but there are worse foods out there as well .
4 #### My dogs ate this without too much reservation . I have come to expect that the food with the lesser quality ingredients will be ones that they will eat quicker . I like it because they eat it but I am not a huge fan of soy being an ingredient . I love my mutts so I try to purchase the healthiest food for them that I can afford . This one will not be number one on my shopping list .
3 #### My dogs loved this despite the gas . I normally feed grain - free diets and mixed it in slowly . My picky eaters loved this , so it gave them a break from their " normal food . "
5 #### My 9 - week puppy LOVES this food . I trust this brand & feel confident my pup is getting safe , healthy food . I also buy the puppy treats !
1 #### 1 of my dogs refused to eat this food . My other dog ate it and her brothers food and then got diarrhea .
4 #### Through my research I found this brand to be the top recommended . I 'm a little grossed out by the amount of jelly fat around the can . Other brands I 've used did n't have that .
3 #### My cat is not fond of the salmon pate .
5 #### The cats love it . My cat who ran up about $ 2000.00 of vet bills for cystitis on dry food has not has one instance of urinary tract problems since being on this wet food . The cats like the taste of all the pates . The cats would rather starve than eat CD or Hills .
5 #### Great product at a good price . The fast shipping is nice too .
4 #### Love that my cat leaves less mess with this but I guess because it 's heavier she got lazy and stopped covering her stuff up so it 's stinky but that 's not the litters fault
3 #### While I was n't overly impressed with the food 's quality my dog really loved it . Which begs the question ... was she wolfing it down because it was good stuff or because she was n't getting enough actual nutrition to last her from meal to meal ? It 's a bit less expensive than what I usually buy for my GSD and I do tend to lean toward ' natural ' foods but if you 're looking for a moderately priced option that your dog is likely to love the taste of I think it 's worth trying .
4 #### RIley and Halle are back on their reviewing job , and they both really liked this dog food . As a Doberman , Halle gets more than small Riley , but they both eat eagerly . The scent is n't gross like some brands so you can keep it stored in the house . Cats do n't seem to like so they wo n't get into it ( they usually try ) . I like the composition as my vet had actually recommended I make chicken and rice fresh for my dogs ( but I do n't have the time ) . Without corn , this keeps them from itching . The only reason it did n't get five stars was that Halle became a bit gassy after her dinners . Not sure if it 's the food or something else , but Dobie gas can be tough to deal with ( she sleeps in the house at night ) . Will update review if this changes .
3 #### The dog liked it and did not have any adverse reactions , but I do not like so much corn and wheat fillers . Chicken is the first ingredient , so that is a huge plus over almost all of the bags of food you will find at the grocery store or kmart , Walmart , etc , but after the chicken is a bit more " stuff " than i 'd like to see . It does have a decent amount of vitamins in it , though . Overall , it 's not bad , but it 's not the best either . The subscribe and save price here at amazon , as I am writing this , is a good price for this quality level and size bag .
4 #### Despite there being a couple of ingredients that I was n't so sure / happy about , this food was a hit with three of our four dogs . Not as much of a hit as the beef and rice , though . Our one very fussy dog did not take to this , which was n't a surprise since she 's not a big fan of dry food . We have been feeding our dogs Purina products for quite some time , and they have not suffered any apparent ill effects . Not all the foods we 've given them boast the healthy ingredients in Pro Plan , and it is a little pricier than some of the others . However we have also had the experience where they 've all turned their noses up at foods that were touted as more nutritionally sound or were vet recommended . Our goal in choosing a dog food is similar to our goal in choosing people food . It should be healthful not harmful and it should taste good , which means finding a balance between the two . For three of our dogs , this variety of Pro Plan makes the balance , although we probably wo n't be getting it again , since there is another variety that they will all eat .
3 #### Our dog eats this , but he likes cat food better . I assume that since cats need taurine to live , their food has more meat than dog food . Poor dogs get the short end of the food stick , since you can feed them mostly fillers . At least this dog food is primarily chicken . You would n't know it , though , since our dog will leave it for a bowl of cat food anytime ! The ingredient list does n't seem that impressive , I try to avoid giving my family corn and soy , since they 're mostly GMO , and my dog is part of the family . I actually have two dogs , but the kibble is too big and hard for our smaller dog , she has bad teeth , so only our big dog eats it and the review is based on his reactions . I suppose the vitamins might have made him healthier , it 's hard to say after such a short time . He has n't had any digestive issues with this food . He likes it OK , it 's mostly chicken , and it did n't make him sick . I might buy it again in spite of the corn and soy , since he did eat it , and most dog foods just make him turn up his nose and head for the cat 's bowl . I also like that the number one ingredient is meat , I 'd have him on a raw meat diet if I could afford it . I just wish the non - meat ingredients were less likely to be GMO .
5 #### My dogs never turn down any Purina product , and this is no different . I find I can feed less of this food than other cheaper foods so value is there as well . Healthy skin and coat , no GI upset . Great product .
4 #### I have had him alittle sick with just flim but if it is changing .welll .... just would love to find something he loved and quit thinking if he do n't eat I am one of those that will make him some real chicken .. but he seems to like the hard food in it not too much soft so i keep it freshed up
4 #### I thought they would go with the weird looking yellowish bits first but they did n't seem to differentiate . Though the first ingredient is chicken .. there 's also brewers rice and wheat and corn gluten meal .. so we never get away from that corn do we ? Seriously , there are all kind of things in this food that are good for your dog . I have 8 , so I pay attention to cost and the ingredients . In cheap foods I have found that most of what goes in all comes out , with purina pro there seems to be less " waste" .. meaning my dogs are utilizing more of the food . There is one thing that I wish I knew was . It 's called animal digest .. listed as ingredient .. guess I 'll have to ask purina that one ! !
5 #### Works great . Same product I have purchased in the Pet store . Arrived in expected condition , just as if I had gotten it off the shelf at the pet food store myself . My Koi love it !
5 #### My sister recommended these , and they are fantastic - definitely worth the price for our sweet girl !
5 #### These were good for my dog as she got older , used it for giving her pills and " convincing " her to eat when she was being picky . We love the wellness products , we feed the dry food as our main food and supplement with the canned food as needed
5 #### great ingredients & quality , and my dogs love it Whole Dog Journal gives Wellness a high rating because Wellness discloses their lab tests
4 #### My dogs seem to like it but they are n't super picky . Good price for a quality product .
5 #### My dogs love this food ! I 've been feeding it to them for 2 months now and their fur is so soft and shiny . Their breath is a bit stinky , but a greenie usually helps with that . I highly recommend wellness to everyone . Do your research and see how awesome this dog food brand is .
5 #### My dog does well on this can food . I 've tried other flavors of the Wellness but this senior formula just molds better for my toothless 4 lb old doggie .
4 #### I used this for my rats ' litterbox , as clay cat litter is a big no no , wood shavings seemed to make them sneeze no matter what kind , and the soft fluffy stuff just stuck to everything and made a big mess . The only downsides : - it 's hard to scoop out the poo , because it 's the same size as the pellets -it 's noisy when they go to their litterbox at night , and my younger rat liked to dig around in it for hours The pros seem to outweigh the cons : -has a very slight scent to it that covers up the litterbox smell and did n't seem to irritate my rats -nice to the environment -not dusty -won't be ingested by them on accident ( unless you have a rat that chews on absolutely anything ) Would recommend to any rat owner that uses the litterbox method as opposed to pottying in their bedding . This will definitely not work as bedding .
4 #### The only improvement I think it needs is the better clumping factor . Other than that , it 's almost perfect .
5 #### No more stinking Guinea pig cage .. love love this product . I am happy tat I found a better solution . I have two litter boxes for each of my piggies and I keep hay grass in the corner of the litter box filled with yesterday 's news litter and for 3days it remains fresh and I remove it and fill it back . Its safe and also does n't contain any chemical substance which will make my piggies skin dry . Nothing wrong in trying once Bcoz if it works then u wo n't have stinky cage around u anymore .
1 #### Smells terrible after just 3 days , even with scooping out the wet / dissolved litter . Going back to sWheat Scoop .
5 #### a very reasonable price for this amount of cat food and delivered very quickly
4 #### I have tried this brand before but it was a different flavor . Our dogs are n't picky when it comes to food and will eat just about any anything . This brand is better than a lot of other brands out there and our dogs ate it without hesitation . Shredded chicken is the first ingredient and rice are much better for them I would think than some of the other things they put in dog food . The dogs did n't have any digestive issues that I could notice . They just ate it and layed down for a snooze . Hopefully your best friends will enjoy it also .
2 #### My buddies will eat this like any brand but it 's fulla stuff you may not want . Nearly every ingredient after the initial chicken is rice and corn and I just ca n't suggest it unless your dog is having bizarre health issues , and then , I 'd suggest real rice ( cheap ) boiled in chicken broth with water before this junk . It is only a bit better than Old Roy from Wal - Mart or Pedigree , the cheapo corn brands
5 #### I knew that my dogs would love this product and of course I guessed right . Knowing that it was made by Pro Plan I knew that I could n't go wrong . I routinely buy this line of dog food , we just had n't tried this flavor . This flavor is now also a hit . Five stars here . Buy it for your dogs too . You ca n't go wrong with this one .
4 #### This dog food looked good - not a lot of kibble " dust " from broken pieces and it smelled fine . I saw absolutely no evidence of any bugs or anything like that and I dumped the entire bag out on a piece of plastic tarp before I fed any of it to my dog . My dog prefers her kibble to be on the small side and she did nibble at this but only a couple of times and then would n't eat it . However , my stepson 's dogs really thought this was good . My dog is a blue heeler ( medium sized dog ) and my stepson 's dogs are larger - a mix of setter and Labrador I think , so they probably do n't mind the size of the kibble . I would n't buy this again for my dog as she 's particular about kibble size but if your dog does n't have that preference then this might be a great food for them . No unpleasant smell and it seemed fresh to me .
5 #### We have a small dog and a large one and they both love this food , probably because of the high meat content . They happily eat everything in the bowl , including the non - meat parts . The meat and non - meat are easy to distinguish ; the meat is shredded while the rest is hard little " kibble " chunks . But the dogs are n't fussy . To them it 's all good . Nutritionally this looks fine . We have n't seen clear health benefits in the first couple of weeks ( Vine reviews have to be done within 30 days ) but we expect this to be at least as good and probably better than their regular non - premium food . But satisfy yourself ; look over the list of ingredients . Chicken is the most prevalent ingredient and by eye seems to be about half the contents . This is not a " cheap " dog food ; it seems like a premium food but without the premium price tag . Overall , a good food that the dogs like and providing value for the price .
5 #### The manufacturer is quite proud of the nutritional value of this product , and I have no reason to doubt them . I also have no way to check their claims , so I will report on what I do know . Whenever we try a new variety of dog food , there can be issues . First , the dogs may not like it . Second , the change my cause digestive upset manifested by diarrhea , etc . Neither of these was an issue with this food . No digestive problems are happening , and the dogs seem to really like it . I think that 's all I can ask for in dog food .
2 #### While the animals seem to like the taste I really feel it is not a high enough quality to warrant the higher price . It is not organic and has a lot of ingredients that I am not sure of . I mainly buy a local food I found that is made in my state with natural ingredients including a natural preservative and does not use BY - Product meats or a lot of grains . You decide for yourself if you want this food or not . Here is the list of ingredients-- Chicken , brewers rice , whole grain wheat , poultry by - product meal ( natural source of glucosamine ) , soybean meal , corn gluten meal , animal fat preserved with mixed - tocopherols ( form of Vitamin E ) , whole grain corn , fish meal ( natural source of glucosamine ) , animal digest , glycerin , dried egg product , wheat bran , calcium carbonate , salt , calcium phosphate , potassium chloride , Vitamin E supplement , zinc proteinate , choline chloride , manganese proteinate , ferrous sulfate , L - ascorbyl-2 - polyphosphate ( source of Vitamin C ) , sulfur , niacin , L - Lysine monohydrochloride , copper proteinate , Vitamin A supplement , calcium pantothenate , thiamine mononitrate , riboflavin supplement , Vitamin B-12 supplement , pyridoxine hydrochloride , garlic oil , folic acid , Vitamin D-3 supplement , calcium iodate , biotin , menadione sodium bisulfite complex ( source of Vitamin K activity ) , sodium selenite . W-4455
3 #### My cat had foot surgery and was n't suppose to use regular liter . This " paper " liter was so different that what she was used to she would n't use it .
3 #### NOT REALLY WHAT I EXPECTED BUTH THEM I HAVE THREE CATS AND MULTI LITTER BOXES DID NOT HOLD UP AGAIN URINE AS WELL I THOUGHT IT MIGHT JUST CRUMPLED UP AND HARD TO SCOOP FOR ME .
5 #### Only kind of litter we can get the cat to use ... does the job ! !
1 #### This whole product line gave my GSD diarrhea . Had to switch to Purina Pro Plan to finally get him well .
5 #### Great dog food . Can see the real veggies in there . Both my dogs devour this stuff .
5 #### We bought this for our gold - fish and tetra because this is the best , most nutrient - rich fish food on the market . We have an acquaponic garden so fish food is very important . They love eating these little pellets . Great buy !
5 #### We needed food in a pinch because we are having unusually nice weather . By now it 's cold , about 30 - 40 degrees , not 65 - 70 . So , I turned to Amazon to get something quickly . This food was much less expensive than what we normally feed , so I was worried our 4 koi and many gold fish would be picky . No such thing occurred ! Everyone came to the surface to eat and for their usual petting . Thank you Hikari !
5 #### Arrived quickly . Great price and the Koi love it !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R34E812UQY8ORS " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1NLEGojxyS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/918uFBx4p1S.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Great little toy ! My cat , Patrick , loves to take his frustrations out on it . The plastic is sturdy , and the ball has some weight to it which I did n't expect . Its definitely not a ping pong ball . It also came with a bag of catnip which was excellent . Great buy ! I d recommend !
5 #### This has been the absolute favorite toy of every single cat we have ever owned . Sprinkle a little catnip on the scratching pad and they go crazy ! They love doing back flips while chasing the ball . This turbo scratcher is also incredibly durable and you 'll literally never need to replace it . We have had ours for almost 18 years ! If you have cats , this is definitely a must have !
4 #### One of my cats only eats Pate therefore I am glad that Amazon sells it . It is coming harder and harder to find this product at a good price ... every penny counts .
4 #### Does n't matter what I think . All I know is that my cats , who do n't like anything , clean their dishes . They like it , so I like it .
5 #### Recommended by a vet , this supplement clearly makes a difference and observing such I plan not to be without it for my bigger dog with some joint problems . Highly recommended .
5 #### The first thing a noticed about this dog food was the bag . Finally someone has designed a pet food bag that is easy to open . Yay ! The food itself has high quality protein , prebiotics , and omega fatty acid for a healthy dog . Our dog loved the taste !
5 #### I have 3 mixed breed dogs and they love this food . Having said that , one is not picky and eats everything , the other two are a bit picky and very picky , respectively . All three dogs eat this food , so there is something they like about it . I guess it 's the # 1 ingredient : chicken . The pieces are fairly large , triangular shaped . The smell is a protein / grain smell . Not appetizing to humans , but it 's not made for us . The price for an 18 . lb . bag of dog food is n't too bad for a product of this quality , however , we have 3 dogs and they will go through this bag quickly . If you are on a budget and/or have more than one dog , this food is n't very affordable . We have to follow a budget for our pets , and feed them what we can afford , knowing that the cheapest grocery store brands of dog food are full of grains & meat by - products that cause allergy related skin & coat problems and can contribute to overall weak immune systems and poor health . For us , finding a middle - of - the - road priced dog food that is somewhat affordable is a constant challenge . I recommend this product because our dogs like the taste of it and it 's a high - quality item . We just ca n't make our budget stretch that far .
5 #### I really do like to feed my dog food with the word real chicken as the first ingredient . This dog food is made to increase a dog 's immune system and improve its coat and skin . My dog loves it and I highly recommend it .
4 #### I have a 7.5 year old cock - a - poo that has become increasingly finicky with each year that passes . We have gone through so many different types from the very expensive to the not as expensive . He is still a very picky eater but he is responding better to this type of dog food than the recent IAMS all fish type . I had him on the all fish diet because of his skin sensitivities . He tends to scratch a lot ; the itching is a lot better with this brand . The dry food is mixed with a wet food twice daily but he still rustles around and eats all of the wet food out the majority of the time . My one complaint is that the kibble is large and triangular shaped . It is a bit big for his little mouth especially after recently have two extractions . I can not review the products ability to improve his breath or the tarter on his teeth because he had disgusting breath beforehand even after extractions and cleanings . Recommend this product because even though it is n't produced with top of the line ingredients it is n't the worst when it comes down to it . It smells rather nice for a dry dog food and even though he is very picky , he will tolerate this brand mixed in with his dry food instead of running and hiding .
5 #### I want to be able to give my dog Bo some variety in what he eats , and I am also wanting to be sure he gets the nutrition he needs . Bo really likes the flavor of this dog food and the size of each bite are perfect for his medium size mouth . I love that it contains protein , vitamins , and fiber for his diet to keep him healthy ! !
4 #### Bought for a kitty that had surgery . It worked fine , but will go back to regular litter that works with a self cleaning litter box .
2 #### My cats did not like this at all . The pellets were really big and very hard .
3 #### I liked the idea , but my cats would n't use it . In fact , one of them thought the little pressed paper shapes ( they look like worms , or little broken cylinders ) made great toys and he kept stealing them out of the ( untouched ) litter pan and playing with them all over the house . Maybe if this was the litter they used from day one it would be better .
1 #### Product is good but expiration was only 2 months from arrival date . Totally fine if immediately consumed but other brands like Blue Buffalo have expirations of 2019 - 2020 . Allowing it to be safely fed for 2 + years . Bad Wellness .
5 #### I have used this for a long time it 's great when weaning puppies
5 #### My puppies love this food . I am a breeder and was looking for a high quality puppy food . This is the one I will be using from now on .
5 #### Wellness soft food for my older doggy keeps him happy !
4 #### I have two cats - one ignores this toy , and the other just loves to sit on top of it . Neither one plays with the ball , which is kind of clunky and heavy . If it were light and spun around , they probably would chase it . It 's a nice scratcher for their claws , though , and a great seat for one of them ! It is made well and is definitely worth the reasonable price !
5 #### Our cat loves this toy ! Our dog enjoys watching the ball go round and round too .
5 #### My cats love pushing a ball around a little track . They also love catnip . And not too surprisingly they also love to scratch stuff . This covers all three bases nicely . I 've several toys of this nature scattered throughout the cats ' royal palace and this one gets played with on average twice a day . I have this one in my office - just across from the bed room . And night or day they play away pushing the ball in it 's track , stopping it , sending it back , and starting over . Each play session lasts from 3 - 8 minutes depending on which cat it is . We have three and two of them like this more than the third .
5 #### We 're big fans of the shredded chicken blend as it has a smaller percentage of " processed meal " in it . We 've been using chicken and rice because it has not caused digestive problems , so why change a good flavor . Dog 's do n't need variety .
5 #### The most important thing is finding something that they will like , contains natural ingredients and a lot of chicken . The biggest problem I have is my male Chow picks out the non chicken food and places in a very neay pile next to his dish . Some days he will come back and eat the rest but that 's only if I stand next to him while he is eating so I he knows where I am . My female just gobbles every bit and asks for more . Purina has over the past 2 years improved the size & amount of the chicken bits which currently make up at least 50 % if not more of the food . I and the kids highly recommend this product .
4 #### Our dog likes this food and usually is good about eating it . When she does n't seem to want to eat it I mix one of the Purina Roasted Chicken slices in with it .
3 #### Loved this stuff until one of my cats had a urinary tract infection , and stopped using the litter until I switched it to normal clumping . Too bad because I mush prefer this over little that tracks much more .
5 #### Wonderful buy from Amazon and saves me the drudgery of hauling heavy cat little into shopping carts , cars and across parking lots and more steps . AND , it 's cheaper ! Cats like this litter . I have two cats and a huge litter box . One - third of the bag lasts about a week . Easy to clean up box . Not perfect ( needs a bit of litter spray on it daily ) , but it works out well . Recommend !
3 #### It is alright , although fresh scent is n't that strong or good and it made me and my pets sneeze a lot compared to the non scented version .
5 #### This litter is awesome ! It 's cheap , it smells good , and blah blah blah . Let 's face it ... My cat poops and pees on it . It 's good enough for my cat 's excrement ... It 's good enough for yours ... I mean your cat 's excrement . It might not be good enough for your own excrement .
4 #### Wonderful Price for such a large bag AND FREE shipping ! This is the perfect product for potty training bunnies . Bunnies can not use cat litter of any kind , especially the clumping type because it gets inside their urinary system and creates some pretty serious problems . This product was suggested by my exotic veterinarian years ago for my bunnies . The only thing I was a little disappointed with , was that the " Fresh Scent " is smells like floral female perfume to me . I am a strong believer in not using perfumes because they are usually loaded with toxins of some sort . If you just clean up after your animal daily , smell will never be an issue . I put my rabbit in the box directly on the product and she did " taste " , not eat , the product several times because it does look similar to her pellets . She figured out it is not food and stopped so I am happy about that . I would love to find out if this company makes a non scented identical product . I will be purchasing this product again . I am giving 4 stars because of my personal belief in keeping things more natural , especially if you are using recycled material .
2 #### my 4 cats were not impressed and would prefer Sheba
4 #### This is my cats ( four ) favorite fast food . I give them very healthy , very pricey food , but when they want the drive through fast food , ca n't beat this item and pricing .
5 #### Just right consistency for my 16+yr - old outside cat . He 's been having trouble chewing other foods . Therefore , this pate goes down easy . And he likes it .
4 #### I 've been using this Wellness Senior canned dog food for about 1 year . Yesterday I found a piece of rubber in the next to the last can I opened from a case of 12 cans . Unfortunately I do not know which of the three cases I ordered on the same day is the right case but I 've included photos of the lot number , expiration date & UPC code . The piece of rubber is stretchable , about 2 " long & about 1"-1 1/2 " wide , black , see pics . I just want others to be aware of this . There 's nothing in the ingredients that should be the color black so I 'd not use it if you see this also .
5 #### When depleted wildlife comes in for my care this is my choice to get them over rough spots . It has saved many babies that were in jeopardy due to dietary reactions .
5 #### This has been great , dogs get excited when I pull it out of the cupboard , we have tried other brands but they seem to respond to this one better . I love that it is made with just a few items and healthy for my puppies
5 #### there was about three cans damaaged in the middle of the case that s my only concern
5 #### My 7 week old pitbull puppy loves this food mixed in with the dry version . Smells fresh arrived dent free ..... for now lol but so far so good . I 'm sticking to the brand .
5 #### My two 2 puppies love this and are growing nicely on it .
5 #### This is a miracle ! I went from a wonderful vet suggesting I " become financially prepared for spine surgery " to a toy poodle who is back to running , playing and flying up & down stairs again . He was unable to walk and in pain- within about 2 weeks , there was noticeable improvement . It 's been 4 months now and the back injury is just a bad memory .
5 #### I mixed this with the Germ and the Gold and my fish love it , It certainly had boosted their growth and color of my Koi a lot compared to the generic foods .
5 #### I have large koi so I buy Hikari large size pellets to add to other medium size pellets . Good quality and great price .
5 #### Fish love it and they 're happy to see me in the morning for a feeding . This is great for larger koi ( my biggest are about 2 - 2.25 feet ) and they love it . I also feed the medium for the smaller ones in the pond . They have n't had any health issues since I started feeding them this .
5 #### Thank you ! GOOD stuff and the price was right !
5 #### My kitty loves these and having this shipped makes life much easier on my back
3 #### Cat liked this well enough but I have recently weaned her off of all foods that contain grains so I will not be reordering . I think her new grain - free diet is more natural .
5 #### My cats love this food and usually eat most of it which I put on top of dry cat food . What the cats do n't eat the possumscome along in the evening and finish it all of .
5 #### My cats love it ! Probably not the highest quality ingredients , and I try and feed my cats grain - free most of the time . But I 'll still supplement that with good old Friskies because they 're so fond of it .
5 #### I decided to buy this scratcher after I read the reviews here at Amazon . I picked it up from my local PetSmart , and boy , it sure does work ! I put a little bit of the included catnip on it , and my kitty jumped on the scratcher like , well . . . like a cat that 's smelled catnip . I 've had it a few weeks now , have n't added any catnip since that first day , and she still loves scratching . I think she 's clawing the sofa and bed less , but I 'm not sure , since she can be very sneaky and could be doing it when I 'm away . However , when I am home , I just pat the cosmic cardboard scratcher , and she pounces on it and picks on it like a good cat . In other words , I give it two thumbs up , and my cat I 'm sure would give it two paws up as well . Oh , and one more thing , I think I will buy the refills , but it seems like the current set of cardboard will last at least a few months , but like I said , I just recently bought this and ca n't say for sure . Hope this helps .
5 #### Have used this for over a year . A rescue kitty had the right rear pad paw pad badly ripped and this was the litter the vet recommended during her 6 week recovery . Only a small layer ( just enough to cover the bottom of the pan ) is needed . Dump after 2 days and replenish . Very easy to use , nothing sticks to the litter box .
1 #### I HATED THIS STUFF ! This stuff smells like s * * * on its own or it just makes litter smell even worse than necessary ! It stunk up the whole house and would be hard to scoop
1 #### My cat did n't like this and showed his dissatisfaction by pooping right outside of the litter box . I think it was because it was pellets . He apparently does n't care about the environment and will only use Arm and Hammer unscented . Sigh .
5 #### This litter is a great price and perfect for our rabbit 's litter box .
4 #### I do n't know how to say " I like it " because I do n't eat dog food . But , the dog seems to like it . Suggestion is to ease into it with small portions to start .
4 #### It 's nice that I can buy my dogs food online , saves me having to go to the store & get it , and it 's heavy so much easier having it delivered to the door . Good quality , have never had a problem . My dog loves wellness brand .
1 #### Several months ago I wrote a review stating that " My 11 - year - old dog Cody , 65 - pound Rhodesian Ridgeback / Lab mix , loves this stuff ! " NO MORE ! Wellness has quite obviously changed the formula for the food , or perhaps it 's just poor quality control I do n't know the reason as the manufacturer hasen't responded to my inquires about the food . However , the last few cases we went through were obviously different from what we began feeding Cody several months ago it 's much softer with a lot of liquid in the cans , and it smells like overcooked fish . Whereas Cody used to be so eager to get to the bowl that she nearly knocked me over , after we started feeding her from our last order of 10 cases , she became more and more reluctant to eat it , flatly refusing at times and at other times eating it only with a great deal of coaxing by my wife ( who would get on the floor and hand - feed Cody to get her started ) , and even then she was anything but enthusiastic . Today was the last straw Cody flatly refused to touch it , even with my wife 's coaxing so I made her her a mixture of baked chicken , brown rice , hard - boiled eggs , peas , and carrots , and she went wild . It 's not her appetite she simply dislikes the Wellness Senior . We 're switching to another brand tomorrow .
3 #### It did the job until I could start cooking my fur baby 's food . No flavor and she did n't like it . Throwing whole foods with chicken breasts in a crock pot and letting it cook all day lasts a week , and is 60 % cheaper per month , vs ... wellness brand .
4 #### Good size for my Koi . They love it ! Water stays pretty clean if you do n't overfeed
5 #### Great quality and a great price . Much better than the local fish / pond store .
5 #### Great for our dog when he had teeth removed . Switched back to his dry food when his mouth was ready
5 #### My dog has a heart condition and I was looking for a product that was low in salt . Wellness was the lowest one . Rosie loves the treats and the wet /dry food . It was no problem converting her to another brand .
3 #### My dog seems to like this food and she does well on it . She is 10 lb and she gets two tablespoons with her kibble in the am and pm . What will likely stop me from purchasing it again is the amount of fat that settles around the edges of the meat . Once you refrigerate the leftovers , the fat solidifies , and frankly , it 's disgusting and I do n't want to feed it to my babygirl , so I end up trying to work the solidified fat out of the can . Ick .
5 #### I 've switched my elderly chihuahua due to skin allergies to this and in a month it 's cleared up and she likes it
5 #### My dog gives this food 5 stars . I ca n't really speak on the flavor but my girl seems to love it . I use this as a supplement to my dog 's dry food .
5 #### My dog and my cat love this . Perfect pate with gravy . Will continue to buy .
5 #### Had to switch my dog to a Venison diet and the prescription canned food stopped making it . Switched to this brand and my dog Snickers loves it .
4 #### I give this to my dogs everyday . Hopefully it helps . The quality seems good .
5 #### The second I took it out of the box , my baby Bella was all over this thing . It was much bigger than expected . Alot bigger than the first one I bought at TJMaxx . And the scratcher thing can be changed out for a new one ! I love the fact that it comes with cat nip , and a little toy in the bottom . My cat will not stop playing with the toy . Here is the reason why I really really really love it . IT DOES NOT MAKE A MESS . Like I said before I purchased one from TJMAXX , which I still have btw and every time she scratches it she leaves cardboard pieces on my carpet . I do not know if it is cheap cardboard compared to this one but she has yet to make a mess from the new one . Obviously I realize there will be when it is worn in . Till then I am 100 % satisfied .
5 #### Smells good it is easy to clean box and good price
1 #### I thought I would try this for my breeze litter system ; what a bad idea ! It made the biggest mess and fell through the grates and I had a real job when I finally decided to clean it out . I would n't recommend for a regular litter box either . I made my apt wreak of urine . Ugh , it was so gross .
5 #### I have used this and I 've used an off brand of this for quite some time now , for a ferret . This actually does better than the off brand , though they look the same . It works well to absorb the scent and leaves a light fragrance behind . If I could afford it , I would continue to use this over the local off brand . Maybe one day I will come back to it . There definitely needs to be more Yesterday 's News coupons !
3 #### I have a love hate with this litter . I use it for my indoor , litter box Chihuahua . I 've found it always has a scent even when shopping out the wet litter . I also have found that my dog will not use it if it 's even slightly damp . This is the same exact materials that branded dog littler is made of , but this is much cheaper . I 've recently stopped using this and switch to the dog pads and it 's made a world of different . I would recommend this to anyone that insists on using litter vs. pads as it does serve it 's purpose and I do n't really know of any other brands out there .
1 #### I bought Yesterdays News because my local SPCA recommended a non clumping cat litter for kittens just incase it accidentally ingested some . The problem I quickly discovered is with the cat urine , it flows to the bottom of the litter pan eventually and will ferment producing a foul amonia smell . There is not a way to rid the litter box of the litter that has been urinated on . The only thing to do would be to dump the litter frequently and start fresh each time roughly every 3 - 5 days ?
4 #### I like this litter but I do n't love it . This litter absorbs pretty well but it 's not really a great replacement for my breeze system . The pellets do puff up and it does n't really cover the urine smell that well but over all it works for now !
2 #### My cat did n't like the consistency of pate . I had to exchange it for chicken bits , which she likes . I rated it two stars not because it 's a bad product , but because my cat did n't like it .
5 #### I have 5 cats and they love this cat food . UPS delivered it very FAST . THANKS AGAIN ! ! ! !
4 #### Both my tabby and my himi love this - they much prefer the incline to a flat scratch box . I only wish it was a bit more sturdy as at the bottom it 's came apart . Yes , I could fix that by glue / tape / etc but it would be best if it did n't come a part . That said , I 'd buy it again and recommend it as well since both cats use it frequently . No wasted money on this one .
5 #### I have 2 cats , and multiples of these all over the house . They are of a good size for the kitty to stand on while scratching so it does n't move around on them . They get used all the time . The catnip is a plus .
5 #### Love these and they actually sink . Plecos LOVE em .
5 #### so nice to use as litter , no dust and easy to clean up , soaks up odors well
4 #### Okay , I will start off with if I was using this for a cat , I would n't like it , as it 's not easy to scoop . However , I use it for bunny litter . Yes , my rabbit is litter trained ( and it was as easy as litter training a cat ) . Rabbits are n't supposed to have cedar shavings and so this makes a great litter for rabbits . There 's no dust and it 's very absorbant . I do wish it was easier to scoop as it 's be nice to scoop out the poop without changing the entire litter , but what can I say ?
5 #### Price is great . Perfect litter for Pet Rats . It lasts 2 weeks before needing to change it . Absorbs very well with little urine odor . I also use Baking Soda beneath the litter which also helps with it lasting so long . Very good price and good product .
4 #### My new puppy loves this food . We switched from a different type and she had no issues .
5 #### My dog loves this food as a topper ! It does well on my dogs srnditive tummy !
5 #### Turns out " picky " had food allergies . Potatoes , rice , peas , milk , peanuts . What 's left to eat ? THIS ! ! !
5 #### Very picky dog loves this , but the seafood / fish one smells HORRIBLE ! Just a heads up if you do n't enjoy fishy breath !
5 #### I know everyone recommends dry food , but my little Coton just does n't like dry food on it 's own . I mix 1/2 can with a handful of the Wellness dry and feed her that twice a day . I 've tried sneaking in a bit more of the dry , but she will ignore the food if it 's not mostly wet food . She 's still a puppy though and doing great on this diet .
5 #### Fantastic Toy Easily replaceable scratch pad , that can be made extra fun with catnip !
3 #### My cats love this and will play every time I spin the ball . Do wish the scratch pad was a bit sturdier because mine lasted less than a week but the still love batting the ball .
5 #### Cat loves it . Dog is very interested in it ! ! !
4 #### My big ( 15 lb ) kitty loves this ! The only problem is he is so big , and this is light , so he flips it over easily . I have to wedge it in - between two pieces of furniture to keep it in place . Would be perfect with some weight to it ..
1 #### I got this product because of its amazing reviews from amazon customers . WOW . They were wrong . I got this chunk of cardboard home and my cat wanted nothing to do with it until I added the catnip that comes with it . Then he was interested in licking it and rubbing his body on it . I made the mistake of putting this setup on my rug so as his body weight tip the box it fell in the rug along with the catnip that now the cat is destroying my rug to get to . I do n't suggest this product for any cat as this ingesting cardboard can not be healthy for cats .
5 #### My cats used to claw away at the carpets in spite of a tall cat post . This seems to have replaced that problem . A little more time will tell as I 'm watching for dig marks in any rug I have . The do love it . The one I think is the guilty party goes for it in a big way .
4 #### My cats love this thing and they scratch things they are n't supposed to scratch a lot less often since this has arrived . One of them is n't even crazy about cat nip so it 's not the bribe that causes him to use it . The only trouble is that it sheds cardboard bits all over the place but they are easily vacuumed up .
5 #### for those of you looking for " Grain Free " and " Gluten Free " catfood , read the labels on your Pate style cat foods . Most of them contain rice . The problem comes in the styles of catfood where it 's chunks in GRAVY . The gravy is made with wheat gluten which can be a problem for some cats . I have a cat who does not tolerate wheat gluten . For those who might be tempted to say I 'm lying should see the number of times in a day she vomits when I do n't give her " Grain free / Gluten free " food . She does n't even tolerate " Grain free " dry food very well and will often vomit that up too . The pate is the only thing she keeps down . Friskies and 9 Lives Pate are so far the least expensive option for " Grain free/ Gluten free " wet food for me . As for dry I prefer " Evolve " - the chicken and rice formula is only about $ 5 for 3 lb and all my cats really enjoy it .
5 #### My cats and my neighborhood abandoned cats that i feed every night LOVE Tasty Treasures with chicken . I highly recommend it AAA+++
3 #### Mature cat Sweetie prefers FF but new kitten Baby Blue digs in , although preferring FF
5 #### One of the best fish food . Arrived on time and will buy again . Glenda
5 #### Great product , delivered to my door . My Koi continue to thrive .
5 #### Best food around . Our koi have not got sick in 3 years since we started feeding then this brand .
5 #### We have two German shepherd puppies , and they love this food . We mix this with the same brand of large - breed dry food . They gobble it right up . Quality product with no wheat or corn .
4 #### A good product . My three pugs are old and love this stuff . My only complaint is receiving dented cans . If it continues I will have to go back to buying this from the pet store .
5 #### Turned my rotty into a nutjob ... he was a normal puppy before he had this stuff ... now he 's always on the hunt for food ...
5 #### The local all natural pet store recommended when we adopted him . My puppy loves this food . The ingredients are good and I have a healthy 6 month old puppy . I use this with a dry food . We have had a couple of others but this kind he seems to respond well to . Others have not agreed with his belly .
5 #### I bought this for the cat box and it works ok . It works much better for our indoor bunny litter box though . I 'd say better than the litter that is advertised for bunnies . I change the box completely once a week , and just dump it straight onto the garden / compost .
3 #### It stinks . We use it for our kitten post - declaw , and it works for that , but we would never use this for anything else . The Fresh Scent is better than Unscented ( at least the litter itself does n't stink right out of the bag ) , but it does nothing to mask kitten poo .
3 #### Some said it tracks less than clay litter . My cat manages to track it more , so I do n't know .
5 #### About 10 dollars cheaper than what the pet store wanted for it so not only does it work but at a GREAT price .
2 #### The kitten did not like it . Maybe she was too young , but we had to go with a non - clumping litter . The vet told me they use if for animals after foot surgery , but that sometimes kittens do n't like the way it feels on their feet .
5 #### We switched our dogs to Connectin , because we 're able to get a great deal on it and I 'm so happy that it works great for our dogs . We have 4 herding mix dogs who are very active . 2 of our dogs developed arthritis early in life and I struggled finding a joint supplement that would work for them . Today , our dogs are flying across the property at high speed , you would never know that they took a joint supplement . Together , Connectin with their raw food diet has given us 4 happy , healthy , and very active dogs . Kimberly , KeepTheTailWagging.com
5 #### This product is fabulous . We have given our large shepherd mixes these chewables or Connectin powder for years and they love them . Must say , within the first week of giving our older dog the powder , he was bouncing around like a pup again ! Could n't believe it !
5 #### My koi are little piggies and there are some really small ones in my pond that can not get the normal pellets in their mouths . So I bought Hikari mini pellets so the littler ones could get some of it . I have had my pond for 6 - 7 years and this is the only brand I feed them . The pond stays clean because there is less waste .
5 #### Our pom loves this he ca nt get enough love that its better made than other brands out there
5 #### Great product my toy fox terrier loves this .. Needed fish for his coat
4 #### A few cans were dented but all seems well . My dog loves this product and she 's now almost a year . I highly recommend this brand and I 'm really glad Amazon has the larger sized cans as well as the smaller ones .
5 #### I have 4 senior dogs who have eaten Wellness brand canned ( wet ) food since they were puppies and they are all very healthy and happy . Very fast delivery from supplier , too .
5 #### Wellness senior formula has been working well for my 13 year old dog . He 's been on it for a bit over 2 years now and has n't had any bad reactions to it . I had him on just kibble for a while , but then he needed to put a few pounds on and this really does the job keeping his weight normal .
3 #### I liked it to a point, ........ but the dust ( from the particles breaking down after my kitty 's urination ) seems to be more along the lines of 5 % and not less than 1 % . It was these dust particles that were making her sneeze . After I switched to Precious Cat liter ... within a week - her sneezing had stopped . Not every one will have a kitty that 's allergic to this type of litter , but mine was .
4 #### I definitely like this stuff better than typical litter . My miniature pinscher has this stuff in his litter box that he uses when he 's in his crate . He likes the stuff and it 's not as messy as regular litter . It does not clump at all and it absorbs liquid very well . My furbaby got mad when I was late getting home from work and dumped his entire water bowl into his litter box . Luckily the litter soaked it all up . Personally - I also like that it 's made out of recycled paper . It makes me feel like I 'm helping our environment by reusing :)
3 #### My cat will use it , but it needs full replacement too often to be an Eco - conscious choice for cat litter . It does n't control odor , but the paper pellet will cling to solids and make those easy to scoop out .
1 #### I use this litter and have for years . Well , the cat uses it , I just buy it . I inadvertently bought the scented version . I initially thought that it did n't smell too bad and maybe since it 's so much less expensive I 'll keep using it . I dumped it in the plastic tote I keep the litter in and closed the top . Out of the bag , and enclosed , the scent got stronger and stronger . In the enclosed litter box I thought I might be hurting George with the smell , it was so strong . I dumped the litter and I washed his box and the tote and set them in the sun . They both still have that lingering scent . DON'T buy the scented Yesterday 's News - DO buy the regular kind . :)
5 #### My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat ( so take that Ogden Nash ! ) . She still voom - voom - vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted . She loves toys , especially stuff she chases . So the bubbles are great full . Especially since they are catnip bubbles . You do n't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick . She love jumping high to pop them . So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty , you might try these .
5 #### The cats just love it and push each other around aggressively for it . That answers it ..
5 #### The cats start refusing to eat the wet food if I do n't mix it up . Variety pack saves the day .
5 #### We have had this toy for five and a half years now , and it 's still going strong . Save for the replacement scratching pads , that is . Both our cats enjoy batting at the ball and watch entranced as it goes round and round in the track . It gets noisy but they get so much joy out of it . The toy is a hit with toddlers too . When we 've had friends with young children over they tend to make a beeline for the Bergan Turbo Scratcher over everything else . lol
5 #### My cats go berserk for this thing . One of them could n't care less about it , but two of them play with it in their own bizarre , unique ways . The key is liberally dousing the scratchy part with lots of catnip .
4 #### My cats like the scratch pad part more than the ball . My cats do not really play with the ball . the product does last a long time . the replaces for it are easy to find .
1 #### Was excited to save some money and start buying these cans in bulk . Unfortunately , I started opening them . There was just a mush of dog food in it . Not a solid piece like there 's supposed to . View pictures for reference . Never buying these again . On the left is a cam bought from Petco . The right is the ones I got from here .
5 #### We got a new puppy ( 4 months old ) , off Craigslist . We really lucked out . The puppy was bred for sale to a pet store . The owner was a young guy who had this dog for one month and he called his new dog " Dog . " We were more than happy to adopt this puppy , but this was our first ever experience with rescuing a dog that was younger than 9 months . We wanted to be sure and give our " Starboy " the best food so he 'd have a great start in life . Starboy hikes up to 6 miles per day and he needs to be getting proper nutrition . Wellness ingredients seem to fit the bill . Our dog loves his food --- we mix in veggies and olive oil and some raw full fat hamburger , too . Starboy is now 5 months old . You should see his coat ! This photo does n't do him justice . Happy dog !
3 #### My dog suffers from colitis . I 've tried a couple of different foods for her . The Wellness Duck and Sweet Potato , and the Venison and Sweet Potato seem to have done the trick for her . No more episodes . 3/10/2017 - I am amending my previous review . Stupid me looked at the front label of this dog food , but never checked the actual ingredients . The actual protein ingredients are duck , turkey , chicken LIVER , and whitefish ! ! ! ! I personally think that labeling this dog food as duck and sweet potato is deceptive . While Daphne has not had a colitis episode in a while , liver is not the best thing for dogs with gastrointestinal issues . I 've also been reading about guar gum and carrageenan , which eaten occasionally is not bad , but as a daily part of the diet is not that great . I will not be ordering this food again . I 'm switching to Zignature Duck Formula . The only protein is duck . That 's it ! No liver , no other meat proteins . Their label also states no guar gum or carrageenan . It 's a limited ingredient formula , and when I read the ingredients , I actually know what they are .
5 #### I have noticed shinier coats on my dogs with this stuff . They go potty less and it 's firm too so I know it agrees with their system . Price is right . I trust Wellness and all it 's products .
3 #### I prefer the stew bc it 's easier to get out of the can
3 #### My yorkies thought this was an ok food , sometimes eat it sometimes not . It was very greasy though , having to pull the excess grease off the sides .
5 #### this stuff really works for elderly dogs with severe arthritis and displaysia , they are able to walk better afte a few weeks of taking it
2 #### My dog started throwing up and lost her appetite .
5 #### My cats just love this stuff . And it 's a favorite of the kittens .
5 #### My cats love the pate , one flavor was not favored as much by one cat , so the other cat who did n't mind got the flavor the other one did n't like ... everyone still won on these .
5 #### My cats were so excited . They were waiting all morning for delivery . I split up 2 cans / flavors at once , and they are so peaceful . I used to buy nothing but Meow Mix . Now we have a new house favorite . This variety pack is A-1 ! I recommend .
5 #### This price can be better than the Costco price . Really great deal . This is two 12 packs , do n't let the image confuse you . It does have 24 cans total .
4 #### I 'm an avid customer of Friskies pate : HOWEVER : My cat has projectile vomiting traced responsibly to the Salmon Dinner ! I 've researched and found data supporting the fact that fish is contraindicated in many cats ! He 's in excellent condition otherwise ... and does n't seem to experience the same results in the ocean whitefish ... but I 'm sticking to the non fish varieties after cleaning up too many messes !
5 #### Finally one they will eat , at least for now ! They do so much better with actually eating the pate .
4 #### absorbs great for a rabbit litter but does nt do very much for odor control . great size for the price tho either way
2 #### My aim was to get a less dusty litter that was made from recycled material Well , that much was a success ! However , what good is kitty litter that has particles SOOO large as to be unable to sift through the openings in the litter scoop ? ! Also , unless there was a significant amount of time from pee to cleaning the pan , the particles of litter never clumped at all . I really wanted to like this litter , and I think the situation may be salvageable . This would be a very acceptable product if the particle size was 1/2 to 1/3 the present size . If that ever happens - I 'll be back !
5 #### My 4 month old got k laser declawed spayed and Home Again , and vet insisted on YN . I bought the softer pellets . Love it . No tracking . The 26.4 pound bag lasts about 6 weeks . Every day I sift out the poopies with my litter scooper . Two 5 pound chihuahuas and now my little kitty that was living in the woods ... got to love 'em .... Just ordered this for $ 14.03 , Just got second second delivery . Amazon needs to put lots stronger tape and better box so it will stay closed . But I love the product . Will order again . Thanks ...
5 #### I use this as litter for my bunnies , its perfect~
3 #### accidentally bought this scented version over the unscented . however i have since switched to pine litter because i like it more
5 #### Love it . My puppy ca n't wait for her food .
5 #### My Havanese 6 mos puppy loves this and looks forward to feeding time .
5 #### Great product at a decent price . Our dogs deserve nothing but the best !
3 #### Not a bad food , just did n't sit well with our dog .
3 #### Arrived as expected and good quality . I know this might sound stupid , but I ordered this because it was blue . They shipped me a red one . Not a deal breaker , but annoying .
2 #### Much too crumbly and our cat just shovels it out of the box . Needs to be larger more compact pieces .
4 #### Use it for my rabbits litter box and absorbs a significant amount . Way better than paper shavings . Highly recommend for other bunny mothers :)
5 #### My puppy loves this stuff . He is a picky eater and under weight for his age . This helps him to put on size and entices him to eat .
5 #### We just took in a foster that is 16 years old - no one would adopt her at the shelter . She was abandoned by someone and needed medical attention . She is in good hands and has had her health issues taken care of and is thriving on Wellness for seniors . She loves it !
5 #### My dogs love this canned food as a supplement to their dry food . It is a quality canned food that while still expensive , it is n't as expensive as most other quality canned food .
4 #### Have to admit the dogs liked it , I found the smell really strong .
5 #### so happy with this product , my dog 's coat and health is so much better - she used to eat kleenex and paper and I think it was because what we were feeding her was n't what her body needed . It costs more but it 's worth it . The healthier she is the less I have take her to the vet .
5 #### The person at Petsmart recommended this stuff . We bought it on Amazon because it 's cheaper . I mix a heaping tablespoon of this in with my puppy 's dry food ( Solid Gold little boss puppy food - also highly recommend ) and my puppy loves it . This is a reputable brand and their food contains good ingredients , which is important to me because there is a lot of crap out there .
5 #### Simba and Cookie go crazy when the Mail lady drops off packages especially when they see the bright box of Friskies.classic pate .. They each have their favorite.that they Love I am going to order monthly now as it is cheaper . Great price great for your cats ,
5 #### 4 out of 4 cats in my household will eat it .
4 #### I was surprised my kittys did n't like this too much
3 #### When I found out that Carefresh is starting to incorporate baking soda in their products - which is poison for rabbits and other small animals- I started researching other litters and came upon Yesterday 's News . I like the fact that a little goes a long way , as the pellets absorb moisture and too much will fill the litter box too quickly . Odor is contained well also . A pretty decent alternative , though it weighs a ton !
3 #### Vet recommended I get this for after my cats surgery . It was okay , but definitely not my favorite cat litter .
5 #### This is the ONLY litter that I will use for my ferrets ! ! ! It is the best product on the market for ferret litter !
5 #### I use this for my 2 holland lop rabbits , it is easier to find than rabbit litters and still paper based for their safety . does n't track through house , absorbs urine well and helps control odor of their very strong ammonia urine so I only need to dump once a week ( they have multiple large boxes all around to easy litter training as they are young ) they took to it no problem and will only urinate in the litter now .
1 #### No dust . Yeah . House smells like cat poop , even when scooping TWICE A DAY for my kitten . ICK ! My husband , who can not smell anything ... even smells cat poo . YUCK ! I only used it for my post surgery kitten . I will be happy to go back to clumping , heavy , dusty cat litter . At least my house did n't smell horrid . P.S. We also have carbon filters on the litter boxes and an electric air cleaner and it still smells bad . FYI No diet changes ... only change is the litter . I do NOT recommend it unless you HAVE to use it . I 'm just grateful my cat will use it for right now and has not blessed our floor with poo or pee .
5 #### I use a mix of this litter and Carefresh to line my Chinchilla 's litter boxes . Yesterdays News covers the bottom , and the white Carefresh lets me see where the little critters have peed , so I know which area to scoop out . I have also used this litter for rabbits and it works great . I would recommend this for small animals and for anyone keeping a compost bin . Clay litter is not safe for rabbits , so only use paper litter for them . This littler is not dusty or smelly in any way .
5 #### Our puppy loves this product .... he is now being weaned off of it as he gets older .
5 #### Great . Good ingredients . Dogs love it and it is n't a set of dented cans like I have received from other companies .
5 #### The puppies love it ( so do the older dogs if they can get to it ) .
5 #### The dog eats it like humans to steak . Good for his stomach also
5 #### Great Food that is so easy to feed in container and amount is perfect .
5 #### My Doberman sprained her front right shoulder once and our vet recommended this to keep her joints " well oiled " . She exercises hard , between 30 mins to one hour of solid running , wrestling , swimming , or jumping . This glucosamine supplement is perfect . Since taking it she has n't had other sprains or stiffness in her joints . Tastes like chicken so she looks forward to her daily glucosamine supplement . Had to give her a high dose per the instructions on the bottle for the first couple of months and then transitioned to the maintenance dose . It 's worked out great . I hope it keeps her feeling young for many more years to come .
5 #### Wo n't let my boy go without this now . He is a 9 year old cocker spaniel and , before this stiff , he was having obvious joint problems and seemed to be developing arthritis . He was in pain , hesitant , and slow to move . He would n't go up steps , walked slow and hung behind me on walks , etc . After just weeks on this , the difference was remarkable . No more pain ... he is back to bouncing around like a puppy . It 's been two months now with no recurrences .
3 #### I 'm sure it 's a great product but my dog wo n't take it ... Will give it to a neighbor or donate since return policy was n't so good .
4 #### Great value , one of the most cost efficient supplements I 've found for large dogs .
5 #### They are a bit thin but I mix them with a tube of Incredibubbles for Cats , which is thicker . Makes a perfect bubble consistency . The bubbles are strong but do not leave residue . My cat loves these . As soon as I bring the bottle out , he starts meowing from the catnip scent and the fun he knows is about to happen .
5 #### Perfect alternative for my diabetic cat . Always arrives on time
5 #### Good product , but my cats prefer the chunky or shredded versions better . Sometimes I mix them together 50 - 50 . This is the brand my cats like best .
4 #### MY CATS LOVE IT BUT THESE CAT FOOD IS NOT ORGANIC IF THEY WILL HURT THEM .
5 #### My cat ate this for years , enjoying it until his heart finally gave out , but he loved every can for more than 19 years .
1 #### Do n't use any more as when it is on the ground snd the bubble brakes it leaves a very slippery pool
5 #### The bubles are n't like soap bubbles , in that it takes a lot , hit or miss , if it makes bubbles , a bit frustrating to get it to work consistently , but it 's safe for cats , my cats adore the bubbles , they chomp at them ( do not add soap to make it work , it 's edible ) , and I love the concept- for what it 's worth I may be doing it wrong lol blowing too hard etc ... wonderful thing this is ...
5 #### I use this for my indoor bunny . My girlfriend visited the other day and could n't believe how nice it smelled . I love this stuff and I change her litter daily .
2 #### This was not at all what I thought it would be or was advertised to be . It is NOT soft to the touch and least of all to the paws of my kitty . I mixed it with her regular litter and gave her a chance to try it . She did not like the feel of it as evident by her not burying her waste . In the plus 8 years we have had her , she has always used her litter box and I will not force her to use something she does n't like . Even if there would be an adjustment time for her to accept it , not worth it to me to put her through that . Another huge deterrent for me was the fact that this is not light weight . Think of how heavy a newspaper gets when it gets rained on and you 'll get the idea . All in all there are just too many negatives for me to buy this again or even use the bag I have now .
5 #### My puppy loves everything wellness . this brand was recommended my dog groomer and vet and from a couple of friends with dogs . Thank you !
5 #### A quality product recommended initially by my dog 's vet after determining skin sensitivity to grain based dog food . Just the right size for a saily serving of a dog in the range of 25 - 30 pounds . Thanks Amazon for caring this great product .
1 #### This is far from the consistency I was expecting . Unlike the same product which was purchased at my local national pet store , my puppy is simply not interested in eating this soupy stuff . The product purchased from my local national pet store chain had a much firmer consistency which my puppy liked very much when mixed with the Wellness dry food . I am very disappointed with this purchase . Too bad I have to throw out the rest of the case and this brand is not cheap !
5 #### Our dog has thrived on this food . We mix it with Rachael Ray 's dry food . It all disappears . When I say thrive , our seven year old looks healthier and acts younger . We are pleased and will continue with this product .
5 #### I took in a 6.2 lb , senior Miniature Dachshund . She was abandoned in the woods with horrible flea dermatitis and very few teeth . The day after rescuing her we took her to the vet and found out this malnourished little dog was pregnant ! I immediately started looking for a high quality canned puppy food to put her on and found Wellness ! I 've seen some people on here complain about the runny texture , but it is perfect for her since she ca n't chew . She LOVES this food , is already getting some new hair growth on her back , and gave birth to a healthy baby boy a few days after starting it . She is producing plenty of milk for her baby and eats her meals with vigor . When he is ready , I will wean him onto Wellness Just for Puppy !
5 #### This is a great product ! My Jack Russell will be 18 in June and this is his supplement .
5 #### My dog has been on this for years now . She is a Mutt and 4 years old . She has always had the extreme " butt shake " when she 's excited , due to the oddness of her hip build . This keeps her moving . She avoids pills in her food at all costs , but likes this . She licks the bowl clean . It seems like a lot of powder for the size , but as long as she likes it and i 'm not forcing it into her it 's worth it .
2 #### Ca n't blow very many bubbles ! The liquid is too thick ? Not bubbly enough ? I do n't know , but my cats are getting regular bubble to watch & pop !
4 #### My wife and I have 1 cat that is VERY picky about her litter . If any of the other cats have used the clay litter then she will walk away from it and use the restroom somewhere else in the house . In an attempt to find a better solution we ordered Yesterday 's New 's and found that she would use this litter even if someone else had as well . We have 3 litter boxes in the house and one has been assigned this litter , in the future we may start switching all of them over to it as well .
5 #### I use this for the bottom tray of my rabbits ' cages . I sprinkle it along with other absorbent materials . I probably use more variety of materials than the average rabbit owner but I like the bottom trays nice and clean . I 've used this in the past when I had cats too .
3 #### I researched environment - friendly cat litter options . This was the top ( and cheapest ) option . It 's made of recycled newspaper and it comes in tiny little sticks . Very different from the pebbles of typical cat litter . I followed the suggestions of others and traded out my old litter for this over a few weeks - to get him used to it . He did n't like it . He just pooped on top . Which smells . I 've tried a few times and it 's not working . Also , when he urinates into it , it just turns an entire section soggy . Which you learn to spot pretty quickly but does n't really look that different . And is really different from clumping litter . This is easy to accidentally mix the soggy litter in with the clean and separate .
3 #### We bought it after a reviewer said their guinea pig loved it . Ours would n't use it , so it was kind of a waste . Recommendation--- before you purchase a pet care product online , buy in the store to make sure your pet likes it .
5 #### this is the best puppy eat food I found . It has a lot so you will need to refrigerate the rest ( depending on the size and type of dog ) I usually mix it with dry food so I do n't use as much at one time . Its smells good and has great health benefits .
5 #### I have a Chocolate Lab , well labs a known for getting FAT and how I know this , not only is my beautiful baby 10 now but I started him on this with the wellness core weight control and only mix a good tabelspoon in with his food ( and warm water ) and he lost the weight i needed him to ... without haveing to cut back and starve him even though Labs think they are starving ALL THE TIME :) He gets fed in the morning and at night so every 12 hours , snacks consist of the wellness and steamed veggies ... he loves'm and is has good weight now
4 #### Thought it would be excellent for my picky 1 year old dog . She will not eat it direct from can ... or mixed with dry dog food . Will offer to her at various times and see if she will eat ... if not , give to a friend with a dog .
1 #### came in poor condition :( More than half the cans were dented .
5 #### My cats ( and son ) really love this . There must be catnip on it also because the cats love to rub all over it .
5 #### So of all the toys you could buy your cat this has to be one of the cheapest and best we have bought ....
3 #### < div id="video - block - R1ZKZCM1QCHU6P " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91IDiHOPO%2BS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71CFlziAiRS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;It arrived with scratches front and back , looks like used but its wrapped with sealed plastic so I d say its its own product quality problem that its made with scratches on it ? ... Another thing I do n't like about this is that you ca nt pick the color . Why ? ? ? Why ca nt you let customs pick the color they prefer ? They are paying for the price for it they should be able to choose what they like more . I really wanted a blue one , but they sent me a purple one . Anyways overall the design and functions of this toy is good . Just these 2 cons I have problem with . Our kitty ragdoll plays with it when in the mood here there .
5 #### Great price and variety for the pate friskies . I would however recommend friskies trying to become healthier . There is too much grains in these that are n't healthy .
1 #### My three cats were completely disinterested . Not sure if that 's a product defect or what , but I do n't recommend it .
5 #### Yes every product I buy is very useful for me , with 5 cats in the house I need something to amuse them and this drives them crazy .
1 #### had to add dish - soap to make it actually blow bubbles
3 #### Has good bubbles at times and other times wo n't blow a bubble to save your life .
5 #### I love this litter for many reasons , but mostly because it does n't track on hardwood floors .
5 #### Puppies love it . I have 5 gsd puppies and its healthy for them and they eat every bite . It is a little pricey but worth it .
5 #### Love this size for puppy . We keep kibble out all the time , feed a small amount of wet food in the evening . With a small puppy I appreciate these smaller cans . And my husband found lids to fit . Great product , the puppy loves it . She is healthy and we want to keep her that way . We feed wellness to all our pets .
5 #### My puppy loves this stuff . Just wo n't eat the Wellness dry . A bit pricey tho but like the Vet says , Pay now or pay later with my dogs health .
5 #### Just a word of caution , it is a great food for dogs with no issues with fat . The fat content is quite a bit higher in this particular food than others . Other than that it is a very nutritious food .
5 #### I have been feeding Wellness canned Turkey & Seeetpotato to my Cavalier Spaniels for years , as recommended by our vet , and they love it ! They have healthy coats & tummies too .
5 #### Puppy loves it expecially when I mix it with blue buffalo dry food for small breeds .
1 #### My dogs would not eat them due to the taste .
5 #### This is a fabulous product , & has helped two of my Newfoundlands get healthier . My order arrived exactly when I expected it .
3 #### Would be great to use if there was a wand included How am I supposed to use it ? ? ?
3 #### do not use inside - green drops everywhere . I prefer the clear bubbles
5 #### The jury is out as far as I am concerned , but it does work WELL .
3 #### Works well , but Fresh News does n't hold as much of a urine smell . I use it with a Breeze cat pan and Fresh News crumbles more readily , allowing the urine soaked pellets to fall through the grate better when I stir it up . Yesterday 's News is fine too , just a little stinkier .
5 #### Softer Kitty litter was needed during the recovery time for the kitten 's declawing at the local Vet . Items arrived and were placed into good use . Worked great and I am sure my two kittens loved me for getting it for them .
5 #### I could not get my new kitten to use the litter box for anything ! She kept having accidents everywhere and to the point I was ready to surrender her BUT this product was recommended to me . I bought it and loved it ! The kitten started using the litter box and we 've never had another accident from her .
5 #### Use it for my rabbit 's litter box and she loves it . I love it too because it does n't smell or get dust everywhere .
5 #### nice not to worry about running out . Just what i needed .
5 #### great food for my pups I also enjoyed eating it too lol .
4 #### The dogs seem to like it & that s all that matters
1 #### My dogs liked this food , and the ingredients seems good but the quality control of the product was so bad you did n't know what would be in the can . It has gone from a firm content to a sticky soft goo , large chunks of what I think was bones ( they crumbled not hard but I would n't want my dogs to eat them ) sometime all around the can was a gel ( I called them and they said it was broth that separated from rest of the ingredients ) sometimes lots of large sweet potato chunks . The main complaint was it seldom came out of the can as a whole to cut it into equal parts and it was never the same consistency .
5 #### Bubbles for the cats with catnip wow my kitty 's first bubble day the went crazy
5 #### Got this for my kitties . They love it and chance after the bubbles . Keeps them entertained and the get some exercise by chasing the bubbles .
4 #### I could 've purchased regular bubbles for the same effect . My cats rather watch the bubbles hit the ground than go after them . Every cat is different I guess , however I think this being " catnip scented " or whatever the case is , is just a gimmick . The liquid is a greenish - blue and did leave a spot or two on my carpet , completely my fault for not being more cautious . Just a heads up to anyone that might purchase . I probably would n't buy again .
2 #### Tried and tried but we could not create bubbles - this liquid does n't have enough detergent in it .
1 #### Does n't work . Wo nt even blow one bubble . If company reads this and wants to send me one that actually will blow bubbles I will change my review .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R5K1D0AR6NHQT " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1U7h - D7pDS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91aS4i5wcXS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;If I could give this 100 stars I would ! I purchased one several years ago and removed the ball as my cats liked to play with it at 3:00 AM ! Unfortunately I have no idea where I hid the ball LOL ! My cats LOVE this ! ( Now I just put it in the closet at night . ) I have to say it is a little noisy but totally worth it seeing how much my cats enjoy it . They literally play with this thing for hours . Others have mentioned their cat managed to get the ball out of the track . I have n't had that problem but trust me , it 's not for lack of trying ! We also did n't have a problem getting the label of the middle of the toy , it peeled right off with no glue residue whatsoever . My cats LOVE the center for scratching . This thing is well built and very sturdy . Great price and great product ! !
5 #### My cats like this toy . They get quite wild playing with it .
2 #### Not great bubbles . It is hard to get bubbles with it and is messy . I had other people try so I know it was not just me ! !
4 #### Will take patience to use it the proper way
3 #### These are pretty cool , but they arrived with a leak , so I was n't extremely satisfied . My cat is more mesmerized by them and just stared at them instead of playing with them .
5 #### Cats love it , great value for 24 5 oz cans
2 #### Wrong . Not one of my own cats or my community strays like salmon . They pass it up every time and that 's food wasted . Until Purina gets something in these multi packs that cats actually like I wo n't be buying them again .
1 #### This review is more on the quality of packaging . I had the terrible experience that one can was open inside the box and got to me covered in maggots ! ! ! My cats love this food and I thought this was a convenient option but I guess it is better that I return to the stores .
4 #### this was a great product in eliminating odors , but it did track all over the floors and you 're not able to analyze the amount of urine kitty is passing to make sure that she is healthy and has no tract problems , that 's the only drawback .
1 #### I heard good things about this but my cat does n't like it . I thought it would be newspaper pieces but .. It 's actually hard and heavy and no very absorbent . I gave it to my worker since she likes it . She mixes it in with her clump litter and to me , I did n't like this idea because it ended up looking like poop pieces in the litter ... :-/ sorry . No go for me
4 #### As a regular litter , I used this for years since my cats were raised on it . I had to add Feline Pine though to keep down the odor . Nothing wrong otherwise with this product .
5 #### I use this litter for my chinchillas ' cages . It 's not dusty and if they eat it , it wo n't hurt them !
5 #### My dog enjoys the food and NO DENTED CANS
5 #### Very good dog food . Thank you from me and my dogs . A+++
3 #### I have used Wellness off and on for years . Lately , the food is shrunken in the can and does not seem as high quality . The whitefish is a darker color - almost like there is more fish skin than flesh . It used to be much lighter . I am experimenting with different foods .
1 #### Have purchased the wellness wet food for senior dogs and my dog is happy with it but on the last two orders I have received damaged cans . This last dozen had five significantly damaged cans . I suppose the food is still ok if I can get it all out BUT these are SALVAGE cans and I do not appreciate paying full price for them . Salvage is a discounted product .. Not full price ! ! ! ! ! !
4 #### I want to give this 5 stars but I am torn . The product is good . It 's bubbles . But my cat was not interested . At all . I used the whole jar of bubbles to try and get her to play . But I 'm not really sure this is the products fault . I think she just does nt care about bubbles . I mean she is cat . But I have fun trying to play with her . I can definately see that some cats would love to play with it .
5 #### I bought this for the reviews ... and they are spot on . My 8yo pug was limping ( she likes to jump off high places . Pug body + dainty legs X age = frequent minor injuries ! ) . Just as promised , within 14 days , she was right as rain . I will continue to use as a preventative measure . Feeding my other 2 younger pugs the maintenance dose , while the older is on the dose for dogs w/ issues . That larger dose lasts up to 90 days , then moves to maintenance dose . With 3 pugs once daily , this is 2/3rds gone after 5 weeks ... that is my experience anyways . Does smell like " henna " as one reviewer stated , which is not a bad thing . My pugs did not even notice this in their wet food . Highly recommend . At a minimum , it wo n't hurt . But if you are looking for " just the right " product for joint issues , I 'll go out on a limb and say : Stop searching , click " add to cart " and be done with it !
5 #### Ordered for Door Co. Humane Society . I 'm sure the cats love it !
3 #### I know this food and have used it many many times in the past . I leave 3 stars not 5 based on the cats liking . But it 's consistent and they always eat it just not as desirable as say gravy pleasures . Diabetic cats so wet food is a MUST ! Just ca n't afford expensive food so this is cheap enough and they do eventually eat it , just not as interested in it over other more expensive ones .
4 #### The cats seemed to like this , especially the salmon ( ? ) I think is in there .
5 #### I feed this to the feral cats in my neighborhood . They love it !
5 #### I can not say enough good things about Wellness cat and grain - free dog products . Healthy ingredients , okay pricing , and dog likes it well enough
5 #### Vet recommended this . The dogs love it . Better price than Petsmart .
5 #### Our dog loves this food and it was a great transition from her wellness puppy food .
4 #### My puppy took some time to acquire a taste for this food . He enjoys it as long as I switch him between this and wellness core pet food .
5 #### Is an excellent dog food with no additives it keeps my three doggies very healthy
5 #### When we first got our 8 week old Aussiedoodle , we tried mixing this in with his hard food . He would only look the soft off of the hard food because he thought it was so delicious ! We were actually advised by vet to stop with the soft food for awhile , until he starts better eating the hard food . We still have plenty and plan to start giving him more after a few weeks . All in all , he LOVES it and we LOVE the ingredients !
3 #### My cat 's never been difficult about her litter box . She litter box trained herself at a very young age and I 'd never had any issues with her . We 've used the crystal litter as well as normal clay litter , and she used both just fine . Then I purchased this thinking the less dust would help her allergies . She has watery eyes that I thought we could help correct . Instead she started peeing in a corner of the living room . She would refuse to go # 2 all day until she absolutely could n't hold it . She never once peed in this litter . I had to mix it with regular clay litter for her to finally give in . The odor control is n't great . It does track less ... although since I 'm combining it with clay litter that 's kind of irrelevant . I wo n't be repurchasing since she clearly is n't happy with it . I can handle a little extra vacuuming if it keeps me from having to clean the carpet daily .
5 #### I 'm using this in my rats ' litter pan . It 's nice and compact , dust free , and lightly scented . Does the job and one bag lasts a good long while for this purpose .
5 #### I 'm so happy I found this . My breeder mentioned pine bedding so I bought that and then read about concerns about pine fumes . Worse than that fear was the mess everywhere- the pine shavings would stick to my lionheads fur , spin about the room , get in the water bowl , etc etc etc . I was sweeping the laundry room twice a day to gather the shavings . This is SO much better I could n't be more thrilled . No more bits everywhere unless they do a binky or get startled in their litter box and this litter comes out with their kicking , which is rare . My girl bun did try to eat this at first but now seems to know its not tasty and not food . This brand came recommended by a bunny website ( houserabbits ? ) but I could not find it in any local stores , hence my ordering it here . While the tracking said this would take up to a week ( understandable since this is a heavy , bulky bag of litter ! ) it arrived in about 2 days , surprising me .
5 #### I bought this for use with my rabbit and an greatly pleased There is no dust like with other litters and less expensive than other non - clay products
5 #### My cat did n't bat an eye , but my friends cat ( who I donated this to ) LOVES it . She plays with it all of the time , and it 's holding together fairly well . You 're getting a toy AND a scratcher for a small price . It 's a great deal .
5 #### My cats love this toy ! My 11 yr old .. owning the toy does n't want to share it .. so she sits on it .. like , if it fits , I sits .. " this is mine ! " She hardly plays , but when I brought this into her house she attacks it .. makes the ball roll . Then runs away , only to duck and watch the ball . So .. my 3 year old is obsessed with it too .. whenever my 11 yr old gets her but off it my 3 year old goes crazy !
5 #### We just moved to a much larger home and our cat has been bored . I got it only one hour ago and he loves it ! It came with catnip and little feet so it does n't slide around . It gives him something else to do besides sitting on his cat tree .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R1HE4GNFARAP9E " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1Nk2 - WhxmS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91A8RZnKnCS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Cat loves this . Even the whippet tries to play with it but cat is the boss
3 #### I thought this concept was a great idea but my cat was afraid of the bubbles . The only downside to this product is that when blowing about 50 % of them pop before even making an actual bubble .
5 #### My daughter 's cat loves these catnip bubbles . Did you hear that ? Catnip . Bubbles . ! ! ! ! ! ! What 's not to love . Cat jumps all over the place trying to eat these things . Was impressed that bubbles were strong enough to land on carpet without popping . Good fun .
1 #### I do n't know if the mixture was too thick or not enough " soap " was used but this just DID NOT create any bubbles . It would work for one blow of the wand and then after that I could n't get anything to form . It was also sticky when the bubbles would land on anything around where I was using it .
3 #### I like the price but it is difficult to form the bubbles .
4 #### Cats enjoyed them but they are a bit sticky and leave a little residue .
5 #### great low calorie , palatable wet food . I use it to get my picky older dog to eat his kibble .
4 #### My senior dog will eat this on occasion . He is a very fussy spoiled dog who would really prefer to eat chicken at every meal ! But he does like this . I have found that it is preferred plain and not mixed with any kibble . But this is just my dogs preference . I am impressed with all of the Wellness Dog Foods and Treats .
5 #### I love this litter because it lasts a while , there is no smell and it does n't track nearly as much as the scoopable stuff . Just scoop the poo as needed and the litter is good for about a week ( for one box with one cat ) .
5 #### I bought this item because my cat injured herself by pulling one of her back claws completely out . The paw became infected very quickly . After I brought her back from the vet I filled her two litter boxes with Yesterday 's News . The pellets are a little larger than I thought they 'd be for a cat , but Samirah adjusted very quickly . I completely changed out the litter in the boxes after three days , washed the boxes out and put in fresh litter . I 'm very impressed . I poured the used litter into a garbage bag and the weight was lighter than clay litter would have been . The sides and bottom of the litter pan was a little dusty . Clean up was a breeze , very easy . The pellets absorbed the urine and swelled up slightly . Solid waste was no problem , either . No large soggy clumps to scoop out . I would highly recommend this litter , especially for single cat households .
5 #### my cats love the Pate , they can not get enough of it , will order more in the future along with other Friskies products , Perfect for 2 cat household , 1/2 a can for each cat .
1 #### my cat would not touch it , tried to give to smokey the neighbors cat who eats almost anything , wouldnt eat it.must taste like crap.wasted my cat food buying money ...... gave it one star cause i am a nice guy .
5 #### Exactly what I expected and was shipped fast ! Will purchase again !
3 #### When you can actually get bubbles the cats love it
2 #### My cat loves these . I have purchased 3 bottles on separate occasions . All 3 bottles crack at the lid . I 'm not sure why but it appears to build up pressure inside the lid causing it to crack open .
4 #### My boxer likes it ; I found cheaper brands he liked more .
3 #### Not Grain free but does n't contain any Chicken if your dog has issues with that .
5 #### No meat by - products ! New wheat , corn , soy , artificial colors or flavors or preservatives . Chicken is the number one ingredient . My dachshund loves it , and as an added bonus , she does n't have bad breath anymore !
5 #### dog loves it . you can see the bits of carrot
2 #### Every can came dented . I love wellness and did buy a lot of their food for my dog but it seems that she is allergic to something they use .
5 #### My kitten loves it , but my older cat was n't very interested other than to sniff the cat nip . For playful cats , it 's great !
5 #### I have used just about every litter sold on Amazon . The cat was costing me a small fortune in litter . I bought a bag of Yesterday 's News Cat Litter early December 2013 . In three months I still have a lot on hand . I have a very old cat who pees everywhere and has an over active bladder . It is true The YN is very absorbent ! We have several litter boxes of varying sizes . Currently I am using a small Pureness Giant High Sides Cat Litter Pan , no liner . I store the YN in a five gallon pail wiith tight cover . I place about 2 cups of YN in the pan . I dump litter once or twice a day into a waste basket with liner . Litter dumps easily . No need so far for a scoop , a light tap on wastebasket the used litter drps into bad . I do n't worry about the pan being damp . Keeping YN in covered pail keeps it from absorbing moisture from the air . This bag of YN will last a long long time . I used to load the litter pan with a couple of inches of litter . The cat would pee over the side . Just covering the bottom of the pan works . I should have used YN a long time ago . It is not available in lour local markets and with Prime shippig it is easy to by here .
4 #### It 's not perfect but if you 're looking for a natural product to replace clay litter , I choose Yesterday 's News . It absorbs urine but does n't clump . Stir it daily to contain the smell . Remove the " lumps " daily ; more difficult since the litter is brown . Replace it weekly ( I have 2 cats . ) There is some tracking but the pieces are large and easy to find . So what makes Yesterday 's News better ? I tried Feline Pine ( non - clumping ) . Urine dissolves the pieces into powder which is tracked all over . I also tried World 's Best but the smell was uncontrolled .
5 #### Yesterday 's News cat litter always arrives in a timely manner . It is packaged efficiently , works amazingly well . And yes , I would order it again .
5 #### This is by far the best rabbit - safe litter I 've found ! My cat loves it too . When it get wet it forms a big blob of mush , so it 's easy to scoop it out of the box . It 's softer than other paper litters , and the pellets are much smaller , so it 's much more comfortable for the critters to walk on and a scoop covers the bottom of the litter pan more effectively . It does n't really smell like anything ( the other brands I 've tried smell like wet ink ) My rabbit does n't love to dig in it ( so my apartment stays MUCH cleaner ! ) and it does n't get tracked across the carpet . If you 're looking for a paper litter , this is definitely a great one to use !
5 #### So far so good ! We needed canned food FAST when our 3 cat household suddenly turned to 6 . No one turns up their noses to any of the flavors ( mixed grill , salmon , turkey ) , and its pretty juicy which helped get moisture to 3 ferals that would nt drink water from bowls . Its mostly by - products , but what are you expecting for around 0.42 a can . Its still mostly meat ( rice is an ingredient ) , and easy to get in larger quantites . I ve actually ordered this product twice , once from prime now , and again from regular prime . I believe prime now has newer packs with new logos . But the current pack I have actually came with less dents in the cans , and the expiration is Jan 2019 . I ve found that if you can get the pack of 24 for $ 10 , its cheaper than costco , petco , and petsmart . Happy feeding !
5 #### Cats love it , that 's all I need to know .
5 #### I have used Friskies canned food for over 30 years with my cats . Occasionally , I 've tried other brands , some more expensive and some cheaper but , for the most part , my cats turned up their noses . They love Friskies . While I do use Fancy Feasts for an extremely picky cat and others with special needs for a higher calorie count , Friskies Pate is what my cats want . Good quality , vet approved , and good price .
5 #### When these are on sale at $ 10.75 they are cheaper then the grocery store . Also , these three flavors are the ones my cats like the best .
5 #### I recognize that there are " healthier " cat foods out there . But if he wo n't eat the " good stuff " then there is no point it giving it him .
5 #### My feral cats love it but i would nt pay more than $ 11 something for it
4 #### It smells strongly of catnip which is good , however my cat did not care for it and it 's difficult to get the bubbles to actually blow . Some dish detergent could potentially help this .
1 #### Terrible . I think I literally got 5 bubbles out of it and gave up . I know how to blow bubbles very well , this formula and the wand are TERRIBLE . I would not recommend . Walmart has a 97 cents cat nip bubble , small , but works much better . What a waste .
2 #### My kitties are catnip FREAKS ! In fact , they put the Fabulous Furry Freak brothers to shame ! So , I assumed they 'd love these bubbles once they got a whiff . So , when they did n't quite get it right away , I still kept blowing bubbles ( over newspaper and paper bags ) for a good 25 minutes . They finally came close enough to inspect ( and smell ) the bubbles but were completely unimpressed . I guess it was a waste of my money .
5 #### I first used this product when our flat coated retriever started to feel her arthritis . After a few weeks , she was in a playful mood again ! I have recommended it to friends who have also commented that their dogs perked up again . I currently am using this on a younger dog , so hopefully she will enjoy her mobility for longer .
5 #### Our dog recently had surgery for a tear in the knee . We purchased this to help her recover . So as not to make the other dog jealous , we fed it to them both . What a difference this has made to our old dogs spirit and playfulness . Will continue to use for as long as they are here in out family !
5 #### It kept my fluffy beast alive ...... so i suppise it worked . Haha
5 #### Friskies is Friskies . I usually buy mine at Costco in a much larger package but in a pinch this works .
5 #### My cats , of various ages , eat primarily dry food but they get a smaller serving of wet as a treat every day ( 2 cans for 5 cats ) . I 've been feeding them this for years , they enjoy it , digest it well , and it seems to be the highlight of their day . I also use it for when a cat is mildly ill with a viral infection or after surgery , or a tooth problem .. something transient ) as an easy to eat and tempting food , and it has always come thorough for me ( and them ) in those circumstances . The combination of wet and dry seems result in good digestion and happy cats . The five of them are currently 14,12 , 10 , 7ish and 5ish . This offers a good variety at a really terrific price .
4 #### I 'm sure it 's good food but my dog did n't like it
1 #### Used to like this product for our dog . Then it started coming in watery and she would n't eat it .
4 #### My chihuahua is picky . I mix dry kibble with wet food . I tried this product bc I 've read that they 're considered healthy . I know my puppy loves chicken . She 's not a fan of fish . I did n't realize the food would have a fish smell to it . It smells more like fish than chicken . She ate it for a while , but most times it was hard to make her eat it . She 'll eventually eat it bc she got hungry . I probably wo n't order again bc of the fish smell . I 've changed to Eagle pack turkey flavored and I 've tried Blue .. Both turkey flavored . I 've also tried other beef , chicken , and turkey flavored brands . She devours it every time . I mixed the remaining Wellness with the turkey and she ate it . I 'm assuming it 's the fish . So if your dog does n't like seafood , do n't buy unless you have the money to invest to sample it .
5 #### Excellent puppy food with natural ingredients and my little guy loves it . I mix it with the dry wellness puppy which works perfectly together . Very impressed with this product .
5 #### My dog loves this . It actually keeps him satisfied longer and seems to be easier on his stomach . He has heart - worms and is on medication twice a day .
2 #### Choking hazard : Beware of bone fragments ( some sharp and hard ) ! Image attached . I bought 2 cases of the Wellness Senior Forumula within the past month for my toy dogs . Most of the cans in the first case were okay , but then I started noticing little white crunchy fragments from some . I was not sure what they were . There were more of those fragments and little black flakes in the cans from the last shipment I received a few days ago . From what is listed under ingredients , I have not been able to make out what the black flakes are as I did not noticed them in many of the other cans . After carefully sifting through each can and removing the white fragments , it dawned on me this morning that those fragments are definitely bones . Each fragment appears to be approximately 1/4 to 1/5 of an inch long and still hard . Small as they may appear , I think they can be a choking hazard for senior dogs , and especially toy dogs . I like Wellness overall . My dogs love the taste , however , I will no longer be buying this particular can for my senior Chihuahua .
2 #### I keep it for back up if the dog food my kids like runs out , but they do n't like it .
5 #### Love this ! I use the high calorie content to fatten up my underweight foster dogs
1 #### very hard to get one bubble out and most of the time the liquid just dripped off the wand waste of money
5 #### Do n't try to scoop this stuff out ! Ai n't gon na happen ! But there is a perfect resolution : I 've been using this litter and I love it . What I do about cleaning is to get cheap plastic bags available at pet stores for lining litter boxes ( instead of the expensive litter box throw - a - ways ) . After about , say 3 days , I just tie it up and out to the trash . SO EASY . " No muss no fuss . " I 'm so happy with this stuff . The only thing I do n't like is the pellets that get kicked out , but the ease of cleaning for me overrules that BIG TIME . For those of you who tried it and hated it , give it another try . AMAZING . :)
1 #### We received a free coupon from Purina for a bag of Yesterday 's News . We are used to using clumping litter and prefer " World 's Best Cat Litter " over many others . This product is completely terrible . The product is messy and goes everywhere . Because it does n't absorb or clump , the solid " pieces " even come out of the litter box and we are constantly having to pick up pieces of litter and " the other " off the floor . The product does nothing for odor control either . I do not recommend this product and luckily it was free because I would n't pay for another bag .
5 #### The softer texture has pellets that are indeed a little smaller and softer than the pellets in the original version . This litter is flushable and offers decent odor control , and it 's absorbent and non - clumping . Also , it 's made of recycled paper . All win for me . My cat had little difficulty getting used to the different texture , and she does n't track it around the house like she does grainier litters . She is a determined digger , so she still manages to kick some pellets out of the box , but cleanup is easy . The odor control is n't quite up to par with Feline Pine , but it 's good enough , and with the flushability factor , makes it my favorite litter for the box located in the bathroom .
1 #### Got this food for my puppies , if it was from the west coast factory it made them sick , east coast factory they were fine . it was too much of a hassle to figure out which one it came from . Amazon was great with the return , but the product itself is unpredictable which is not something you need on a sensitive stomach like a puppy .
5 #### Healthy wet food for my 11 tear old dogs .
4 #### Good product but get a lot of dented cans . Send the ones that are dented on the seam back .
5 #### Dogfoodadvisor.com rates this brand 4 to 4.5 out of 5 stars nutritionally . Not cheap , but my dogs love it .
4 #### High quality , pups love it . It can be a bit rich for some puppies though , and it can cause loose poops .
5 #### Feeding this food for over 20 years . Great quality food at a good price . This comes from a multi cat household .
5 #### All my cats eat and Amazon has a great price . My local store only sells them as single cans and this adds up fast in price . Great deal considering where I live .
5 #### Great Price and it arrived on time and at my door step . So much easier than lugging cases of cat food from the shelf to the cart , to the conveyer belt , back into the cart , into my trunk , and finally into my basement . Saves me so much time and work with 8 cats .
4 #### Turkey & Giblets is the one my cats love the best . I 'm so glad they have just the meat pate 's in a variety pack , as my cats wo n't eat any of the seafood kinds .
3 #### I HAVE A BUNCH OF THSE CANS OF CAT FOOD ..... -- Friskies ....... Winkie did not lick them much ... so I bought case of smaller cans ( cats liked this ) .. Purina F
5 #### These are really good . My cats love them . I like the large size .
5 #### My cat loves these . If loved to get one of those bubble machines and pour these in just to watch his little face light up with delight .
4 #### definitely catnip , definitely bubbles . wish the cat liked it as much as i do
5 #### These bubble are awesome ! ! Some of the bubbles actually land without popping , which my cat go cuckoo for . They would just watch at first then they totally got into popping them . Then where the bubbles land smell like catnip so , they roll around wherever they land .
4 #### My three cats love it . They like the ball , they like the scratcher , and one of them even likes to sleep on it . The only down side is that it 's already ripping up and I only gave it to them a few days ago .
2 #### Two stars because bubbles are always fun , but my cat ran away as soon as one popped on him and the " catnip " did n't seem to have any effect .
5 #### Good price , great quality ingredients . I have n't tasted it and my dog will eat anything , so I ca n't vouch for that aspect .
1 #### Why has the price increased for senior wellness can food ? I bought it for 26.00 a case and now it 's 42.00 .
5 #### My Standard Poodle has chronic kidney disease and this was recommended by Boston 's Tufts Vet Hosp for her . She loves it ...
5 #### There are a lot of reviews mentioning that these cans came damaged . Mine came wrapped in plastic with cardboard surround and in a large padded box . I had no issues with damaged cans . Our vet told us to get wet food specifically for puppies to help encourage her to eat her dry food . This is definitely working . The consistency is like a paste - dark brown in color and definitely smells like the ingredients but is n't awful . Our pup loves it . Each can has a pull tab for ease in opening the cans . Highly recommend .
2 #### Not sure why our Senior Dog is snubbing this product - Put 1/2 can in her bowl in the morning - came home around 7 pm and the food was untouched - thinking she 's being a diva - we purchased a different brand at our local feed store - she ate the secondary - not sure if she 's been spoiled and healthy dog food is not desired - we donated the rest to the Pet Shelter
5 #### I had my dog on ceasar for years and recently read how its causing pancreatitis and kidney failure in dogs . My other dog who was 14 was recently put down from kidney failure . not saying ceasar was the cause but I 'm not taking risks . I researched wellness and liked it 's all natural made in the usa . So I now have my 10 year old dog on this food . I 'm also giving her nothing but the wellness dog treats since so many dog treats have glycol in them and that 's found on antifreeze . Wellness is more expensive but my dogs worth it . She loves it .
5 #### This brand was recommended by a dog trainer for my rescued dog . She was refusing all dog food . She can not wait to eat . Her tail wags and she jumps up and down when it is mealtime . I like the serving size . She gets two cans a day .
5 #### Friskies - owned by Purina is one of my favorite canned food diets . I have used it for about 6 years - both at home and in the shelter environment . The price is very fair for the amount of canned food that you get . I also have a friend that fed his cat this for 15 years ... his cat never had any issues with the canned food and lived a very long life . Canned food is great to supplement because cats do n't drink much water . Canned food has about 78 % water content which is ideal for prevention of diseases or medical conditions related to a poor water intake . The canned food is easy to chew and digest for most cats and even kittens . I use this food as a treat for some cats . I would have the cat eat this canned food while I trimmed their claws so they would associate Friskies with a procedure that they had to have done every 3 - 4 weeks . I highly recommend this canned food brand .
3 #### Feral cats like it a lot , but the Veterinarian says it is bad for their kidneys and recommends Fancy Feast instead , so we have to pay more .
5 #### Always keep these on hand for our cat . She is large recuse cat we took in two years ago .... -but now she weighs 14 lbs . ! We now are putting a scoop of the canned food in her dry Purina Cat Food . She is a really big Purina Fan !
5 #### My cats like it . I like that they like it . I buy it over and over again .
5 #### My cats like the Pate type cat foods over the shredded stuff . Good price . My cats are getting old , and they lost a lot of teeth and they seem to like a little variety .
5 #### My cats love this food and the price is awesome
2 #### The bubbles are heavy and fall right to the ground . They do n't float around like the soap bubbles for human kids . My kitties were n't as interested in them as I imagined they would be . Umm ... they are pretty potent in the catnip way . They caused my dominant cat to feel that he had the right to swat at his " sister . "
3 #### I read the bad reviews on this product before ordering and decided to order anyway because it 's the same brand of dry food I feed my beagle puppies . The consensus seems to be a conspiracy of which Amazon sells the reject cans of food . After using 5 cans I think it 's a problem with the company not Amazon . I did n't receive any dented cans and 4 of the cans I opened were perfectly fine . One of the cans , however , was full of chunky hard bits that I 'm pretty sure would choke my dogs had I given it to them . Wellness clearly has consitency issues .
5 #### Wellness is a dog food product recommended by my vet , but the " in store " prices have gone up exponentially . Online prices have been good , but if they go up as high , will be switching to another brand .
5 #### My Pugs love this dog food ! ! Because of the allergies that my dogs suffered with other dog food , my Vet suggested we try Wellness fish and sweet potato formula . They improved the first week they were on this diet . So now it is routine at our Pug - Palace ... and " the Boys " are happy , healthy Pugs . I love that I can order it from Amazon and have it delivered to my door .
5 #### My 17 week old lab / pit mix goes crazy for this stuff . I use it to give him pills or when I am worried if he 's not eating . He can smell it from across the room and will lap up every last bit of this . I usually mix it with kibble .
3 #### We purchased a similar model that was pricier that is far superior to this one . This one is larger , but the ball does n't roll very well . It wo n't even complete one full circle rotation before it slows and stops , so the cat does n't like it nearly as much . Go for the pricier , superior model .
4 #### The trick is to hold the wand upside down and then many bubbles come out . Our cat loves these though sometimes she chases them and other times she just watches in wonder .
4 #### I was expecting my cats to chase the bubbles , but that did n't happened . But my two cats really enjoyed watching the bubbles , one of them enjoys them so much that when i stop he starts meowing and meowing until i blow more .
3 #### My cats would rate this 5 stars because they love catnip bubbles and they do n't give a crap that it came with the lid cracked . A little of the liquid leaked in the box but it 's a good thing it had that seal on it under the lid , or I woulda been hella mad ... The seller seriously needs to package this better to avoid leaking because the plastic is so cheap it breaks very easily . If you 're going to buy this , have a spare pill bottle ready to pour in the liquid when it comes broken and sticky . I warned you :-)
3 #### Meh - our cat would rather play with regular bubbles ..
5 #### My cat loves this floavor and the salmon one too . There is also an " indoor cat " variety , which I 'll use next time I order .
5 #### Elderly dog loves this wet food ! Will purchase again !
5 #### My Poodles need a limited ingredient grain free and no chicken diet - Wellness is the perfect solution for their dietary needs !
5 #### I am very pleased with my purchase and realized very substantial savings over the price I had been paying for it at PetSmart . Excellent vendor ......
5 #### No Chinese products inside . No recalls I can remember . Plus , my JRT loves it .
5 #### Excellent ; quality , value , communications and fast shipping . My dogs love it . Arf , arf , arf , arf , arf . 5 arfs from my doggens .
4 #### Good food for my little one just as an additive to her dry food . Wish it was organic
5 #### I bought this because my dog hurt his should falling down some stairs . nothing broke but he was banged up . he has totally recovered and I will keep him on this for ever . I also used this on my senior horse .
3 #### When I first started giving this to my 10 yo lab , his limp from arthritis went away . I switched to chew treats b / c if was more cost effective but then went back to this powder . His limp has come back and after about a month it 's still there . I am going to keep giving this to him and my other lab with hopes it is doing something !
1 #### I was a bit disappointed . My cats were curious but did not go crazy over it as they do with other toys , especially something new . I have hardwood floors and where the bubbles hit it mad a mess .
3 #### When I took this out of the box , the plastic screw on lid was cracked open .
4 #### This product produces tons of bubbles . I was just surprised at how disinterested my kitties were with the product . I really did n't expect my older cat , nearly 16 , to be very interested . But I was shocked that my 1 year old cat , who chases everything , was n't at all interested in the bubbles . I do n't think that 's a reflection on the product . He 's just not into bubbles I guess .
4 #### My dog likes it and it is a good quality dog food for her . I have no problems with it or the seller or the delivery of it .
3 #### Puppy does not like this food , unfortunately . It seems well balanced to me . No accounting for doggie taste I guess .
5 #### I mix this with my Lab 's dry kibble a few times a week in an effort to keep his weight down . He loves food in general so I ca n't rate it based on if he 'll eat it or not . The ingredients look fine for him , therefore 5 stars .
5 #### ELATED THAT AMAZON IS SELLING WELLNESS , MY PUPS ARE ON CORE WELLNESS , AND MY 6 YEAR OLD ROTTIE IS ON THIS THE SENIOR . THEIR COATS ARE SHINEY AND THEY ARE AT A PERFECT WEIGHT :)
3 #### Good product but my dog did n't really like it .
5 #### I did n't taste the Wellness canned food but my dogs LOVE it !
5 #### Connectin has made a big difference in our dogs ' mobility . And they love the taste enough to lick every last speck out of the bowl every time .
5 #### I have seen a difference when I started this product with my Golden . I give it daily in the food .
5 #### We have been using the Connectin tabs for our Chesapeake Bay Retrievers for quite a few years , after my sister told me about it . ( She has long used the equine version for her horses . ) Our dogs on Connectin and Fresh Digest ( digestive enzymes by the same company ) have stayed in surprisingly good shape and lived well beyond their life expectancy . Other dogs I know who are on it are also quite healthy . When we run out of it our senior dogs seem less comfortable . Success with just a few dogs is not proof of anything , but I 'm a fan of this stuff and think it contributes positively to our dogs ' health and lifespan . BTW , if you shop around a bit on other websites you can sometimes find it a little less expensive .
5 #### My 12 year old standard poodle has had back pain for a few years . She has gone from at times needing help to get up to now running and resuming her much loved counter cruising . For her it took a good month before the results were fully felt . It 's definitely worth every penny .
5 #### I use this product for joint support for my 2 dogs . I want them to live a long healthy life . My 3yr old Golden has some hip issues and it seems to help him .
5 #### This item was received in new condition and in the amount of time estimated . I have used this product for my small senior Chihuahua before , and it has helped the arthritis in her joints so that she is enjoying her walks again . She likes the taste of this product , so when I administer some of her tablet medications , I place a small amount of the Connectin powder in the palm of my hand , along with the tablet(s ) , and she licks everything up , as if it were a treat !
5 #### Cats love this better than Rachels Good Quality , but perfect when giving medication all cats love it .
3 #### Meh . They always just like the juice off it and I end up throwing most of it away .
5 #### Was cheaper than store and cats like it ; alternate with gravy kind
5 #### My cat loves all of them thank god he only 2 years old will 3 now in cat years so its good ! !
5 #### My cat was perching on a chair , looking fairly bored but watching me intently as I sat on the floor pulling the cling wrap off of this . As soon as she saw what it was , she jumped down and started meowing repeatedly at me . She totally knew it was for her ! I set it down and she went to work on it right away . She was already scratching the cardboard and playing with the ball before I could even get the catnip on it . The catnip only sweetened the deal after I managed to sprinkle it on in whilst trying to avoid her claws . I 've had it for a couple of days now and she visits it frequently , batting the ball around and around . I have no idea what is so enticing about it , but I 'm so happy that she 's entertained !
5 #### my cats love it , tear the st out of it
5 #### This is , by far , my cat 's favorite toy . I gave one to my sister , who has a cat , too . She said her cat loves it also .
5 #### It would be nice if the blower thing was attached to the cap so I did n't have to stick my fingers in the soap all the time . But it 's great otherwise . My cats love it .
5 #### Maybe I got a good batch , but this stuff really produces a lot of bubbles . The cats were frightened , but to be perfectly honest , I only half - cared , as I was having more fun than I have in a while ( pathetic , but I do n't think I 've blown bubbles since I was 8) . Bubbles seem to stay suspended in the air for quite a bit of time . Hold the wand about 3 - 4 inches away from your mouth to produce more bubbles . Make sure a nice thin layer of liquid is on the wand before giving it a try . Perhaps more fun for humans than for cats .
1 #### While my cats love Catnip Bubbles , this brand is TERRIBLE . It makes a sticky mess ( more so than other brands . ) Most importantly , the bubbles only work for a single day and they do n't work at all . I bought this twice because I thought the first one might 've been a fluke but they were both terrible . If you live in the midwest near a Meijer store , their store brand of cat bubbles is much better . I 've had my current bubbles for a week and they are still going strong . They are also good for giant bubbles .
5 #### I only ordered 1 6 lb bag -- not 2 I have one cat and this is an evening snack . For breakfast he gets a can of nutro .
5 #### Our 20 year old cats love this food . Keeps them healthy and easy to chew . Great product .......
5 #### My kitten loved this food . It appeared to me that he was struggling with another brand of kitten food that was shaped like tiny round balls . When I gave him Nutro Max Cat Kitten dry food , he dug in and crunched every bite which he clearly thought was " heavenly . " He was having a hard time " getting a bite " out of the tiny balls , sometimes swallowing them whole , but the pieces of Max Cat are larger and irregular shaped -- just right for Charlie .
5 #### One kitty gives it a 5 and the other yawns and says it is edible . I sprinkle a little Muse dry cat food on top and my Chevy will often pick it over the wet food . I keep a bowl handy for nibbling and it is usually gone .
5 #### The cats are always happy when this is delivered .
5 #### my cats love this stuff , , bowls allways empty after feeding time.great price point too
5 #### Bought a good supply ahead and I am glad I did . The cat adores me and can continue to adore me for months ahead . No more fast trips to the store because the cat is out of food ! LOL !
5 #### An excellent food recommend by the breeder and the vet . My dog loves it . His coat , skin and energy are excellent . We use it one heaping tablespoon at a time to wet and supplement our dry food .
5 #### Dog love this ! We mix with Wellness dry food for my senior dog that is missing many teeth and with the puppy food for the baby dog .
1 #### I am giving one star because the second batch that I received has a different consistency compared to the first ones that I ordered here from Amazon as well as the ones that I bought from Petsmart . My puppy had diarrhea after eating about 4 cans so I started to investigate . When I opened another can , I smelled the food and it smelled really bad that my puppy wo n't eat it anymore . This is is his favorite food and for him to reject it means that there is really something wrong with it . To make sure that he did n't just lose his interest on the food I bought the same exact food from Petsmart and to my surprise - he happily ate it . I ordered two cases of this product and I am definitely returning them . It is cheaper to buy this pet food here at Amazon but I do n't mind paying more somewhere else as long as I know that my puppy is getting quality food .
5 #### I put a small amount in my dogs ' morning feeding . They love this and it adds a bit of moistness to their dry kibble . Much less costly than in the pet stores !
1 #### Horrible product and do not recommend . Knew it was going to be bad when I almost could n't get the seal off . The wand drips constantly so you end up with green stains on your floors ( because of the artificial green color ) . And the bubbles are not only difficult to get but must not be much of a catnip smell because my 4 cats hate them . I was also very unhappy to see they are made in China - with the track record of products from that country I will not be using these with my pets anymore .
1 #### I recently purchased this item & when I first opened & used it , it worked great , lot 's of bubbles , my kitties had a blast chasing them . So 2 days later I opened them & noticed only a few watery bubbles , then nothing ! ! ! ! The solution would n't even stick to the wand ! I 'm really disappointed , a clear waste of money . I would rate it no star 's .
1 #### Not one of my 23 cats would eat this . I have no idea why . I kept putting it out and it was all left in the bowls . Had to throw it all away .
5 #### First time purchase . All my three cats love this stuff . Ate it all up from the dish the first time . Try it .
5 #### All my cats like this food and it 's affordable good food .
5 #### Cats with allergies can eat it without any problems
5 #### My cats love this food . Not the best analytically , but decent ingredients and they seem to do well ( I supplement with canned and fresh food as well . )
3 #### It would not be fair to give this a bad review . I think it 's probably a very good product , but my dog got sick from it . She has a very sensitive stomach , so I can not blame the product , which gets very good reviews elsewhere .
5 #### My senior Chihuahua has been using supplement to help her with her arthritis . The first time I used it , I bought it from a local specialty pet store , and it really seemed to help her . But I saved about $ 7 by purchasing this from Amazon this time - and shipping was free !
5 #### It not only meets my expectations , it also meets my cat 's which is the most important
5 #### I have tried several brands of catnip bubbles , and only Kookamunga and the Petco brands caught my cat 's interest . He likes both . The Petco bubbles have less smell ( and therefore generate a little less cat interest ) but the bubbles are sturdy enough not to pop the moment they hit the carpet . My cat prefers the Kookamunga catnip bubbles over all the rest . In fact , when he wants bubbles he taps the bottle ( sitting a low shelf where he can reach it just for that purpose ) . I 've bought two bottles TWICE and I 'm getting ready to order more . If my cat likes it , then I 'm happy . :)
5 #### My puppy had to have a small portion of her intestines removed and while recovering , she needed a healthy , well balanced and easily digested diet . This is the BEST ! ! ! !
5 #### Our fawn Doberman Pinscher puppy thinks this is candy . Furkid CANDY ! She recognizes the color of the can from her Wellness Puppy Treats http://www.amazon.com/Wellness-Puppy-Natural-Treats-3-5-Ounce/dp/B001HBBQKY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1434157071&sr=8-1&keywords=wellness+puppy+treats . The food is just the right amount of moisture and when opening the can there 's no pungent " dog food " smell ... it also keeps well in the refrigerator with a can topper ! My puppy also loves the texture , which is something I noticed as well . When mixed up a little it 's more like a pat&eacute ; than a regular dog food ! She likes it plain , mixed in her Wellness Large Breed Puppy dry food and for the summer she 'll be having it frozen in her Kong . I 've done a lot of research on food before adopting her and we 're VERY happy with the quality from Wellness ! May I also add they have great reviews on Dog Food Advisor . I also introduced my Veterinarian 's office to Wellness because they were impressed with the quality of our furkid 's coat !
5 #### My 4 - 5 week old puppies eat this until it 's gone ! Even mommy would try to compete to eat some , we have to hold her down so that her babies can eat it . LOL . It gives mommy gas when she does it eat but the little puppies do very well on this food .
4 #### I got a lot of cans and my dog liked the first couple of cans , but got bored with it and I had to vary it with others .
5 #### Romeo loves it and I love knowing he is getting proper nutrition . I have noticed the ones from Petsmart are a little creamier than the ones purchased here . Not sure why .
5 #### But I 'm not buying it because the price is now 72 cents a can !
3 #### Buy this product frequently at $ 11.00 - $ 12.00 , which is good . Just went to order again , only now it 's $ 18.00 , too much :( The product gets 5 stars but not the price ...
5 #### Max Cat is all they will eat . Not sure why . Three rescues , adopted in 2015 and 2017 . Tried many different products .
5 #### Max Cat is all they will eat . Not sure why . Three rescues , adopted in 2015 and 2017 . Tried many different products .
3 #### Cats seem to get tired of it real quick
5 #### My meow meows love this food ! They wo n't eat anything else , not sure how they do it but it 's great and keeps them healthy !
5 #### My go to cat chow for the last six years ... all of my cats are picky eaters and they will all eat this brand . I 'm constantly filling up the bowls around the house !
5 #### Wish I could get the 16 oz bag each time ! I have 6 cats
1 #### maybe it was my cats but not one of the four would touch it
5 #### Our cat loves this cat food and refuses to eat anything else . His coat is shiny and healthy . He 's a happy kitty cat .
5 #### My cat loves these . When I get tired of blowing , my cat actually cried because she was not done . She chases some and then watches others with great interest . I like that I 'm not blowing soapy stuff all over her .
5 #### 16 year old dachies little guys seem to like it and do gobble it down . I had to change from another brand , very happy with consistency of buying regularly on Amazon .
3 #### This food is very healthy and seems to have excellent ingredients , but we could not get past the strong fishy odor . Even my dogs did n't seem to like it very much , maybe because of that . Odd because fish is n't one of the first ingredients .
4 #### My dogs likes it . My only complaint is that I wish it had an easy open tab .
1 #### UPDATE May 17 , 2017 -- Had to update my original review , below . The last shipment of this formula had something like crushed glass ( or pottery ? ) in it ! A very unpleasant experience . I called Amazon and they refunded it . Am going back to Natural Balance . Love this formula because my dog loves it -- I give her my own cooked chicken ( thighs cooked in a broth with some carrots and celery ) which she 's always been crazy about . I make a pot of this every week . This Wellness formula has good healthy ingredients in it , and is a change from her venison formula . I just give her the chicken for a bit of fresh , unprocessed food , as I 'll never believe that any processed food , no matter how good the formula , is sufficient nutrition for a living creature .
5 #### Great product . It should be carried by more retailers .
3 #### I really trust the PURINA brands to deliver good quality food . But in this case , the Subscribe & Save pricing SUCKS ! I am a solid PURINA consumer . I 've found over the years they have the best quality pet foods and are committed to animal nutrition . So spent an hour looking for a good prince on a value pack of Friskies canned cat food , in the traditional PATE style . and end up frustrated & perplexed . Take a look at the this comparison : Purina Friskies Variety Packs Wet Cat Food . Poulty Pack , 32 cans , FLAKES & SHREDS , is $ 14.72 or .45 each . - BUT - the Purina Friskies Classic Pate Variety Pack Wet Cat Food - Turkey , Salmon , Mixed ( PATE STYLE ) ( 24count ) is $ 17.29 or .71 each . So , Why is the PATE so much more expensive than the flaked or shreds ? Why pay .72 each for Subscribe & Save , when they are .45 to .55 each OFF THE SHELF IN THE STORE ! ? ) Why is there no well priced PATE selection inside the Amazon Subscribe & save store ?
1 #### I use this cat food all the time and have been ordering $ 17 which is ridiculous . I can get it cheaper at my local petstore ,
5 #### my spoiled kitties love their friskies canned as a treat .
4 #### I 'm a high end animal food snob and when my vet recommended friskies pate for my cat who had kidney issues , I was a bit shocked honestly . But I followed her recommendation and he 's been on nothing but watered down pate for 3 years now and is doing well . It totally grosses me out when it gets on my hands , I do n't like the texture or the smell but since I 'm not eating it I can look past that .
4 #### Our cat is the typically finicky eater , but he loves this stuff - all three varieties , and since he 's both happy and healthy , I would say they got the recipe just right .
5 #### My cats love this variety pack ... if they love it , I love it because they lick the platter clean . We have relied on this Purina product since forever it seems and continue to feed it to felines daily . Older cats like the softness of the Pate on their older teeth . The variety is good for their bodies as it conditions different organs and bones .
5 #### Hi ! I am a very spoiled Joshua . My mom used to buy me the indoor cat formula but one of my siblings and I started projectile vomiting . My sister decided to change us to the senior diet ( My brother is 7 and I am 17 ; my sister went with my mom at age 18 . ) After we started getting this new kibble no more vomiting .
5 #### I think I said on another review that THAT product is my cat 's favorite food . Now , this one is her favorite . I try to keep up , but cats are weird :)
5 #### Our 3 cats love Max Cat products - both the dry and wet food . They like the Salmon as well as the Roast Chicken dry food ,
5 #### My cat told me he just loves this Chicken Food . NUTRO MAX CAT Adult Dry Cat Food , Roasted - NUTRO MAX CAT Adult Dry Cat Food , Roasted
3 #### Despite the god reviews my cat did n't care for this brand . I gifted this to another cat family and those cats loved it .
5 #### Again , my cats love this product , one was afraid of it . , the other loves the bubbles , probably because they are catnip
4 #### They 're messy , but then they 're soap bubbles so you ca n't expect anything less . They definitely seem to work better than the last brand we got , which popped almost instantly and it was almost impossible to start them from the stick . Your mileage will vary depending on your household companions , though . The older cat seems enamored of these , and will chatter at them as they float . The younger cat is scared of his own shadow and these do n't help . He 'll watch them only from a distance and is content to get no closer .
3 #### My cat goes crazy when he sees the bottle , he chase the bubbles and look at them sometimes . However , it smells horrible and also it turn green the carpet . So If you do n't mind that , it 's a good toy for a crazy kitty .
2 #### Cat loves ( regular ) bubbles ! Bought this stuff . Now , the cat just waits for the bubbles to pop after they land on the floor , and she licks that up . Can you say ' Lack of motivation ... dude . " ? * Sigh * Maybe my cat should watch Cheech & Chong movies ... : -\
4 #### Cool idea ... maybe a cat somewhere would love it ! Just none of mine seemed to care !
4 #### My two cats just watch me blow bubbles , then eventually get annoyed and walk away . BUT the neighbor cat goes C - R - A - Z - Y for the catnip bubbles . I will most likely keep buying them because he entertains both me and my cats .
5 #### Strong smell , but my little dogs love this . I like to mix this with Wellness dry food --- especially since dry food has little or no moisture . Wet foods are not only good for pets with few teeth or other eating difficulties , but also provides extra protection against urinary stones . I ordered online , not just because I am lazy , but because the price is less expensive than in stores . This is the third time I have ordered , and I have not received any dented cans . Thank goodness !
5 #### Shipping was fast . The product - my dog who is almost 12 loves it . I will buy again and again . What we do for our pets !
5 #### My little Maltese puppy loves this , I am glad that it is so good for her too ! ! !
2 #### Strangely , the lamb food that came in these larger 12 oz cans was a different texture from the lamb food that came in the 6 oz cans , which was much more creamy . Our dog also seemed to enjoy the food in the 6 oz cans more .
2 #### All the cans were dented , so these must be rejected retail cans ? I really do n't want that since there is a danger that air would get into the food and be contaminated or bad . Do n't want to risk it .
5 #### We have been using this supplement for several years - for a dog who is thirteen now and has had arthritis since he was 9 , and for a dog we adopted 2 years ago at 5 whose fractured front leg had never been treated properly and who also had some hip problems . We really think this product helps them have less pain and move more freely - so much so that we recommended it to a friend whose older dog was starting to have joint problems . She is on a limited budget but she sees enough improvement in her boy that she has continued giving this supplement . Our vet says he has had similar reports from other patient 's caregivers . If you look around on Amazon , you can usually find a supplier with a decent price for the 650 gram container .
5 #### My Newfoundland is 8 years old , has had 2 knee surgeries , & suffers from arthritis . I have tried dozens of joint supplements over the years . This is the first one that has clearly made a difference . He is playing more , walking more freely & generally enjoying life . I would recommend Connectin to any dog or horse owner whose critters have joint problems .
5 #### I 've been feeding my animals Nutro brand forever . Two healthy cats eat this . Their teeth look great ( so says my vet ) , and they are n't overweight . Older cat 's blood work came back perfect as well . Do n't spend more for fancier brands . Max Cat is great .
5 #### Well , the cats love it really . They also love the mouse - head shapes . We mix different types of food together so that if anything is ever discontinued , switching over wo n't cause a lot of stomach upset . These pieces always get eaten first .
5 #### great cat food for my senior kitty at a great price .
4 #### The bubbles arrived quickly and were exactly as described . Only downside is that my cats are terrified of bubbles . My dog , on the other hand , thinks they 're amazing . All in all , it 's still fun to use these . Just be care as the liquid is green . Some of it dripped on my cat tower and left a green spot .
2 #### So this review concerns this product 's ability to make bubbles : on opening and introducing these to my cat , many bubbles were easily produced . On the very next day , bubbles were difficult to produce . I think my cat enjoys these bubbles as much as she enjoyed a bottle of catnip bubbles I bought in the past . The problem is , right out of the bottle those bubbles were n't easily produced , either .
4 #### It does n't stain carpet or furniture . Does n't smell bad . The cats got a kick out of it - something different then the usual feather toy that I use to play with them .
4 #### My cats love this food over the more expensive cat foods . The cost was slightly better than the good ol local WM or WC . I was going to do a subscribe option for this , but the price jump of over 6 dollars shot that idea down . I 'm going to be looking for cases of single flavor here on Amazon .
5 #### My three Darlings like Friskies . Big Snuggles prefers the Salmon , Scratchie - Scratch Off likes them all and baby Krayz - Whyte prefers the Salmon and Mixed Grill
5 #### A staple cat food at a good price . Friskies is a kitty favorite around here . We rescue pets , and go through a lot of food . Amazon makes it easy to purchase . Thank you !
4 #### Cats like three out of four selections . They have never been crazy for white fish variety , but they do eat it .
3 #### my cat liked some of the flavors but not all , he likes bits or shreds not patte too much but loes shredded beef , his favorites
5 #### My cat would not eat dry treats of wet cat food . He likes these and begs to be fed .
3 #### This is actually good . My cat loves this . But I am beginning to suspect that it is causing his stomach upsets because some have more grain than meat .
3 #### This needed more soap added to actually create and hold a bubble , but once doing so generated a bit of kitty interest .
3 #### I was SO excited to get this in the mail . I ripped it out of the package and blew some bubbles at my cat . He could not have been more disinterested . Very sad ! I have tried again several times , with the same result .
4 #### I have a ravenous monster kitten at home ( we think he 's part ragdoll and part garbage disposal ) , so I buy a lot of kitten food . Nutro Max is a brand I trust because of its quality ingredients and positive effects it 's had on previous pets . This small bag seemed like a natural add - on item to the order of wet kitten food I also purchased to feed the adorable bottomless stomach that has taken residence in my house . But when the package of kitten food showed up , it was trashed . Kibble everywhere inside the box , kibble falling out the gaps in the tape , and when I looked back , a trail of kibble following me from the front door to the kitchen . The kitten was thrilled with the trail of food , of course , but I was not . Probably half the bag had emptied in transit . It looked like the glue on the bag had come unsealed , possibly from being knocked around by a package of canned food in the too - big box it was shipped in . I left packaging feedback , which I hope they 'll take to heart , because if the kitten kibble keeps falling out in transit , my kitten might eat me instead . Please enjoy the photos I 've included in my review . One shows the state of the packaging , the other shows the ravenous monster kitten ( because I know you 're really here for the kitten pictures ) .
5 #### My kitten seems to like it . No strong oder like some other brands I 've used .
5 #### Collie picky puppy likes moderately . But I like a lot ! Does n't cause diarrhea .
5 #### Our middle aged dogs love this , and that is a real bonus , as the Ladies had become rather picky and partial to a certain flavor of Pedigree dog food . Nothing wrong with the Pedigree , but this seems better suited to their age and is probably more healthy when fed occasionally
5 #### So good I will eat in a pinch ! haha
5 #### My dog gobbles this up ! I serve it mixed with the dry version of Wellness .
5 #### My pup loves this canned food ! I give it to her along with the Diamond Puppy Lamb & Rice Formula dry food . She seems to really enjoy it so far !
3 #### really mushy ... i have a mini schnauzer and this gets all in her fur around her mouth ... wash cloth does n't get it out have to run it under water .. what a pain ...
5 #### In my opinion the best cat food . My cat and mini dog loves it ! ! ! Quality matters .
2 #### This stains my carpet green and it 's a hit or miss on the bubbles . Plus , you have to pour it out to get the plastic bubble blower out .
1 #### I got a good bubble one out every 10 blows , cats loed it but not good for bubbles . Everyonein my house tried it and they allhad the same results .
2 #### A lot of dented cans . 8 of 12 cans .
5 #### We have a picky eater and after trying many foods , he seems to like this brand the best . I order it as a 12 pack from Amazon as it 's about $ .60 a can cheaper .
5 #### Great food for my dog . The price is right too .
5 #### My 10 year old chihuahua loves this food ! i feel good knowing its a quality food she is eating ! i ordered these lids ( 6 Piece Large Medium small Plastic Can Cover) ... for the small cans and they fit perfectly !
5 #### This is a very good food . Looking at the Dog Food Advisor website , it is ranked as a 5 star food . The only problem I had was that it made my puppy a little gassy , but he is prone to tummy problems anyway , per my vet . I am currently using the wellness core conned puppy food .
3 #### My dogs like the food OK , but Wellness canned food always has very dented cans , which make it hard to open and get all of the food out . Probably wo n't buy Wellness canned food here again .
5 #### My cats love this . So much less expensive than the store .
4 #### They love pate but I notice at times they snub it , could it be that the fish is a bad batch ? My rescue kitty with no sense of smell loves them and it is soft for his mouth . My other girl has cancer and it is her favorite . I wonder about the chance that it has a high level of mercury ? She got cancer from vaccinations , I would n't vaccinate too much , and her microchip came out , vaccinations have aluminum and metal , it caused cancer which is fatal . I can not save my girl and she was only 6 years old when she got a reaction . I regret vaccinating her but I though b / c she goes in the yard at times I should do it , do n't !
1 #### I 've shaken the bottle , blown very slow to try to get a bubble , and it is too hard to get bubbles . I 've just ordered another brand to see if I can find a good product . The actual device for blowing bubbles has a tiny flat handle ( not as shown in the picture ) and you have to dig down in the bottle to try it fish it out which is messy . I had other brands that worked much better with a double option device to use to blow bubbles . My cats love to run after the bubbles . This was a disappointing purchase .
3 #### A LITTLE BIGGER BITES THAN DESCRIBED .WILL KEEP AND GIVE AS A TREAT IN PLACE OF REAL KITTY FOOD BECAUSE SHE WON'T EAT IT AS FOOD .
2 #### I have three cats .... None seemed to care for this item ...
4 #### Only kind of dry food my cat will eat . She 's strange and will only eat Flat shaped kibble . I 've tried other , more expensive ( and I think better quality ) brands but she wo n't touch them because of the shape . At least the cat is a cheap date !
5 #### My very selective ( okay , finicky ) cats LOVE this . Thanks ! This food has become my favorite reorder .
3 #### It spill smore than making bubbles . But my cats likes the bubbles , although I 'm not sure if it has enough cat nip . I think my cat enjoys regular bubbles more than this kind .
1 #### This stuff used to be great , but not anymore . I have 9 kitties and only half take interest in the bubbles , which is fine . Then only half have fun . They changed the formula and the wand with the new label . I do not recommend this product . Hardly get any bubbles to blow out of it . My cats sit there waiting for bubbles while I continue blowing duds , not any suds . Hope this review helps ! !
4 #### OH man , who knew cat 's go crazy for bubbles . My cat will easily play bubbles with me for 10 minutes before getting bored . I 've tried normal bubbles and there does seem to be a subtle difference between the catnip ones and regular ones . I would n't go so far as to say these are better than regular catnip .
1 #### I bought this thinking that our cat my have some fun with the bubbles . I had a hard time getting the bubble blower out of the bottle . I could barely make it make any bubbles . When I finally got a few small bubbles , the cat was n't interested . Do n't waste your time on this product .
1 #### Not happy at all with this product . Has fish and making my dogs throw up .
2 #### I was attracted to this product because of the fresh and quality ingredients but unfortunately my dog ( Jack Russell Terrier ) does not like the taste of it . She could be a picky eater sometimes and I 've had a very difficult time trying to get her to eat this .
5 #### The best . My Maltipoo loves this food mixed with wellness small breed dry .
1 #### Unfortunately when ordering this brand online all the cans came dented and the food also looked bad . My puppy refused to eat it and everything has to be returned . What was her favorite food she will no longer eat now :(
5 #### We just got a puppy and wanted to start her out on the right diet ! She loves it and is growing like a weed ! !
5 #### This is a good quality dog food - my girl loves it .
5 #### Our cats are 16 and 17 and have been eating Friskies all of their lives . It 's tempting to want to give them nice fancy $ 3 a can Wellness , but they love it and seem to do well on it .
5 #### The only wet food that my cats will eat .
5 #### I buy it here for convenience . The cats love it .
1 #### My cats love this food , but I will never buy it from Amazon again . This is my second delivery of this order and I keep having the same problems . The cans are badly dented , like about 80 % of them are . This time around though I had to actually throw multiple cans away because the cans were damaged to the point they were no longer safe to feed to the cats .
2 #### I get a bubble about every tenth time . I just have blue splots all over everything . Even traded out wand for one of my own ... no improvement .. Cat loves the few I got but not worth the money if there are no bubbles for him to play with .
1 #### I 'm disappointed to say that there are very few bubbles , mostly very tiny and they pop as soon as they touch something . I gave it a thorough test , blowing air at different speeds and angles , shaking the bottle before using and then using it when it has n't been shaken in a couple of days , etc . Total letdown . Important to note : both I and another person who gave this a shot felt stinging in our eyes when the bubbles popped close to our faces . Not good ! ! !
3 #### Even my cats who are sensitive to catnip had no reaction to this product . I would not purchase it again .
4 #### Purchased this from our local animal shelters wishlist . They were happy with it , but we were n't as the bag was half open when we unboxed everything .
5 #### my cat loves this food . his coat gets super soft and shiny from it too .
5 #### My picky cats like this dry food . It is one of the only things they consistantly will eat .
5 #### I refill my cat treat container with this and they love it . Keeps me from feeling so guilty since I can be overly generous with treats .
5 #### I purchased one of these food for my little kitten but I found out adult cats are also love this . I purchased 2 more of these from here . ( My two indoor cats and one outdoor cat are crazy about this NUTRO MAX dry cat food . ) I feed them this dry food as " treat " . All three cats LOVE this food than any other more expensive dry food .
2 #### I thougth this was worth a try . A new treat for my 2 kitties . Unfortunately , they each just watched the bubbles fall to the floor and pop . One of them did sniff the spot where the bubbles broke , but that was about it . Nice idea , but no treat for my 2 kitties anyway .
5 #### One cat is annoyed by the bubbles and runs away . But the other kitty loves them and screams ( in joy ) . I had used a different brand before , and when they popped , they seemed to burn her eyes . This despite the bottle saying they were specially designed for cats . But this brand does n't burn her eyes and she enjoys them a lot .
5 #### I know regular bubbles can be just as fun , but I worry the splash of soap in the eye will hurt them if the bubbles break in their faces . They will chase the bubbles and be at attention for as long as I am willing to blow them into the air ! It is a fun toy that we can do with them and I recommend them .
3 #### I like feeding my dog this product , however I am angry that so many of my deliveries from Wellness the entire case is damaged . I pay full price and expect the cans not to be second rate !
5 #### My dogs LOVE this food , even my picky little yorkie .
5 #### Good price and my puppy loves it . Fast shipping , too .
3 #### We love Wellness brand and always use the dry . Sometimes we top the dry with some wet . This one makes my dog have the worst gas . We will be donating all the rest of the unopened cans .
5 #### Great food , I can see the change in my dog . He 's 17 years old , and is moving slower , normal for a dog that age . I will admit that I can see the difference in feeding him your food . I bought the canned and dry . Has everything a old dog needs .
2 #### Half of the box arrived dented ( not unuseable ) but otherwise still a good value .
5 #### As you can imagine , it is hard to find any single cat food brand that 5 cats like at the same time . We literally had bowls of dry food everywhere . My 5 senior cats actually seem to like the NUTRO MAX CAT Senior Dry Cat Food . They are eating less of their " wet " food and there seem to be fewer hairballs since we changed over to it . My husband is in charge of cleaning the litter boxes & he says that the cat poops are more compact & less stinky .
5 #### This is a re - order and one of the best brands in dry cat food . Our spoiled feline loves it . We try different brands in between , but it does n't make the cut . This seems to be the one that always works out . We just need to keep it dry for it 's crunch . I 'm happy it came in a smaller bag rather than a large one .
5 #### I personally ca n't speak enough on this dry cat food . I have sphynx cats , and those who know care of a sphynx , even they are a hairless breed ... Their skin tends to be high maintenance .. I have used this brand / flavor for many years .. I have healthy cats . I keep this dry kibble down fulltime & feed a raw diet once to each of them daily . Do no hesitate in buying this dry kibble . However in advance in will tell you all of my cats , turn their noses up at the nutro max Canned cat food . I also will tell you Amazon has raised their price , by almost 5 dollars on the 6 lb bag , in less than a week . So it looks like back to . Petsmart I go .
5 #### How to review cat food ? My cat eats it so I assume it taste good however I have not asked her opinion and am unwilling to try it myself .
3 #### The smell that came out and off of these small little creatures , while on this food , was atrocious . Additionally , their coats were so greasy that the hair was clumping together . They finished 1 - 2 bags before we switched them to whole farms grain free . Happy to say no more smell and their coats are beautiful again . The kittens liked Nutro but obviously something was n't agreeing with them . They seem to like their new food even better !
5 #### Great price for this food . It 's a brand I prefer to use for my cats .
5 #### My older cats love this food . There must be a difference because the younger two try to steal it out of their dishes . I guess I will have to get Max Cat for them now too !
5 #### Figured out how to encourage the cats to use this toy . Place it halfway underneath a bit of brown wrapping paper ( or newsprint ) that comes in your amazon packages . Irresistible . They like to push the ball under the paper and then sneak up on it , making the paper crinkle . One of my cats ca n't resist making the ball disappear under the paper , he gets obsessed . ( Also helps to put it in the closet for a few days . Cats are just like kids and are interested again after a break . )
5 #### Larger than I thought it would be ! Comes in various colors . My cat loves it .
5 #### my cats love it they wo n't stop playing with it .
5 #### I adopted some cats who were never taught to play with toys , so I hesitated buying this . My cats do n't play with the ball , but they do use the scratching interior circle . They also like to sit on it . This one of the only toys they ever interact with , so I would buy this again .
5 #### Cat loves it . When he 's not playing , he sleeps on it .
5 #### I actually bought this product for use by staff at a zoo . They 've discovered it 's not just some of their cats that respond to the bubbles . Their binturong goes absolutely nuts for them , too . And , yes , these bubbles are great fun for house cats , too .

Caution ! Do not try this at home . Do not use with already deranged felines ! You have been warned ... ; -/
5 #### Kitty LOVES eating this food . He is a shelter cat that was found in the wild . He is enjoying his new home as well as his new food ! We purchase it regularly !
4 #### Cats like the Wellness . They have it occasionally in the rotation of their foods , they prefer Weruva brands . Worry about the recalls they have had , probably will not buy anymore .
5 #### My girls love it ; they just see the can and begin wagging their tails because they know what is coming . They finish their dry food and wet food completely now , where before it was a definite struggle . I recommend this product .
5 #### I was concerned regarding the quality after reading the reviews , but mine came out fine in California . I bought 5 cases and so far they all seem consistently solid . There is some broth gelled on the side , but nothing of serious concern . My pup loves this food , so I 'm a happy mom .
5 #### I have 2 7yr old chinese pugs . One black - one fawn . My fawn pug used to shed tons of hair constantly - year round . Since I 've been feeding Wellness Canned for Adults I have noticed a dramatic change in both . Their coats were shiny before , but now they are glistening and softer . Shedding has decreased significantly . I rotate between the Chicken & Sweet Potato and the Lamb . I also feed the Wellness Kibble . They absolutely love the food . They are healthy , energetic and shiny . I can not recommend this product highly enough . No garbage in the food . Pure . Natural . Wellness has us as a lifetime customer . I used to cook chicken breast , carrots , apples & sweet potatoes ( mixed ) for my Pugs daily . I have serious mobility issues and not always able to cook for them , leaving them to eat Purina One kibble . No more ! Now I do n't feel guilty about not being able to cook for them from time to time . Wellness is their only food now . I 'll never go back to Purina or any other brand .
4 #### boys like it , but the cans are not cleanable . you waste expensive food and have to rinse down the drain . Does anybody have better ideas ?
5 #### I have a 5 year old male Shih tzu who is a discriminating eater . He does n't eat everything and few things does he eat with gusto , except for this food . He has been eating it for several months and has maintained excellent health and a beautiful coat . The ingredients , which are items I understand , appear to be natural and wholesome , which makes me feel good about feeding to him . Very pleased .
3 #### I always buy wellness canned dog food but this flavor came without the easy open lid . I hate having to use the can opener instead of my finger to open the cans .
5 #### I 've been feeding my cats Max Cat for years . Both are happy and healthy critters . My vet says that they 're in perfect health because of this brand . The switch from the indoor adult line to the senior food was easy . I also fed my dog Nutro for years . Ca n't go wrong with this brand . I only wish this bag came in a slightly larger size .
5 #### My cat loves it . She wo n't even touch the canned I bought .
3 #### 2 of my cats did n't seem to be to impressed with this . Back to Friskies !
5 #### My cats have developed a game : I buy a small bag of food . They love it . I buy a big bag of food . They whine and refuse to eat until I buy some other small bag . Rinse and repeat . So far the Max Cat is a hit . Bowls are n't as empty as they used to be in the small bag days , but there 's positive evidence that the food is being eaten .
4 #### My male cat loves these bubbles , but he loves playing with bubbles anyway . My female just looks and occassionally bats at one of the bubbles . This formula makes LOTS of bubbles ! And it 's thick enough to get three sets of bubbles with one dip . This is sometimes a disadvantage because it seems to overwhelm my cat ! There is a slight smell , but it does n't really bother me ( I 'm very sensitive to chemical smells ) . I only gave 4 stars because I am not sure my cat is more attracted to these bubbles because of catnip . He does n't act the way he does with the herbal catnip ...
3 #### My cat likes these bubbles ok I guess . He kind of just sits and watches them fall ... then swats a few times and gets bored . He is 3 months old and has TONNNNS of energy , but these do n't really impress him much . They smell horrid .... so if you do n't like the pungent smell of liquid catnip DO NOT BUY THESE ! Great concept though .

However , I am owned by the Laziest Cat in the World who prefers to sit and watch the bubbles instead of chasing after them . Still they do keep her busy and away from the food dish for a few minutes .
4 #### My cat loves these bubbles . All I have to say is " Do you want bubbles ? " and she comes running out from wherever she may be hiding . She meows and pounces on the bubbles . I am giving them a rating of 4 though because they smell horrible . If they drip on anything white it will turn green , but can easily be cleaned with some water and a sponge ! ! ! !
5 #### For some reason , Friskies puts corn products into all of their food EXCEPT for the ones called " pate " . Any good vet will tell you that corn products are unhealthy for cats . My cats love the Pates ! I wish this particular item would go back to being on Prime .
5 #### Convenient and cheaper than buying at the supermarket . My cat is very picky and gobbles down this wet food !
2 #### My cat loves the taste , but it gives her some really gross stomach distress . Gave it to my roommates ' cats , and they seem to be having the same issue . It 's a shame , because my cat apparently really loves the flavor , and the non - senior version of this food did n't seem to give her these issues . Maybe it 's just time for grain free forever for her .
3 #### its ok , different shaped , but cats did not digest it very well
1 #### This is cheap crappy food . I only bought it because my cat came from a shelter and this is all she would eat . Now she is thriving on healthy wet food from Wellness and Weruva , and dry from Orijen , Wellness , Purevita and other superb brands . Read the ingredients ; . Do you really think a cat needs grains and fillers ?
5 #### My cats love Max Cat Salmon . They have been enjoying it for years . It is one of the few food that they will eat consistently . It is nutritious and has great ingredients without ground corn .
5 #### My vet recommended this and my dog loves it !
3 #### Most cans damaged in cases . They hide the damaged cans and put those in the cases thinking no one would notice . This is a pretty shady way of packing dog food , especially as expensive as Wellness is .
4 #### Good quality food . Consistency reminds me of refried beans . It is good for mixing with dry food in order to get them to eat the dry food .
3 #### I have noticed over the last couple of cases , it appears that there is more bone fragments in the food .
5 #### Our 13 year old dog does very well on this food from Wellness . I mix a small amount of this canned product with her Wellness senior dry and she eats it right up . Wellness is a top name brand of high quality . Amazon has the best price compared to local pet shops .
2 #### I 'm sure this dog food is good for some dogs , just not mine . She would n't touch it , so again I had to give it to my son , his dog gobbled it up . With chicken and sweet potatoes , its sure to be a hit with many a canine , just not mine .
5 #### My boys love it . Now make it.less expensive and.you will enjoy their support for life .
5 #### My cat is kinda a finicky eater but he s eating it thank god ! He seems to be enjoying it so Ill probably buy it again .
5 #### I love this brand . Healthy food for the kids and they love the wet and dry .
5 #### My puppy is a yellow lab and he loooves his " dino " toy . He has had it since he was 2 months , is 6 months now , and chewed off the head , tail , and legs , and still is thrilled with it ! ! It 's his # 2 fav . toy ! I would recommend it for anyone whith a large breed puppy / teenage dog .
2 #### This is probably good food . My cats hate it .
4 #### I have used Nutro for many years and have always appreciated the quality of their food and treats . With an 11 year old siamese I recently changed to the senior line , I was pleasantly surprised she did n't seem to have any digestive issues with the change over
3 #### Our cat liked it , until we gave him Fancy Feast
5 #### My cats both love Friskies and especially the three flavors in this pack . I supplement them with a dry cat food .
5 #### Always good quality . I bought this to have it shipped to my favorite animal shelter . They asked for this product because their cats love it .
4 #### Our cat loves this stuff . She is typically a very picky eater but can eat 1/2 a can in 5 minutes . It was priced almost the same as my local box stores but I could order from the computer . I did not like how it arrived to my house though . About 1/2 of the can were severely dented . Luckily , none were so badly dented to the point of actually being open . I do n't know if this was a fluke or if they sell of their dented cans . I may reorder again when we run out and see how the next batch arrives .
3 #### For some reason these cans are never full and the food is discolored around the edges .
2 #### None of my cats , including a feral cat , will eat this .
1 #### This made my cats ' poo so smelly we switched brands . I even wrote the company asking for more info regarding the product , and they ignored me !
5 #### I assume this was okay . I sent this to my favorite animal shelter as it is on their wish list . You order it and its shipped to your favorite charity .
5 #### My dog loves this product and it 's sold for a good price by the case . Good quality product .
5 #### My two dogs love any flavor of Wellness canned food . I feel great about feeding them Wellness since I know they make the best dog food . My dogs deserve the best and Wellness provides it !
5 #### Excellent product for our Wheaten terrier who has skin problems .
5 #### Our dog has skin issues . This brand agrees with her totally . Excellent product and service .
1 #### Again - this one was watery as well . Would not recommend unless you Want your dog to have diarrhea .
3 #### My Labradoodle loves it , but I 'm not so sure her stomach agrees . It seems like the last shipment was overly watery , this one the consistency is better .
5 #### My 16 yr - old outdoor cat likes it ! He forgets he 's " an oldie " and gets finicky at times . He gobbled this dry food without complaint . It 's not very hard , and the nuggets are " flat " -- therefore making it easy on his teeth . Glad I tried this . Had never seen nor heard of this senior cat food product . But , I 'm glad I did . And I 'm sure my old friend does too .
5 #### My finicky cat has preferred this food for over 15 years . She actually prefers it above wet canned food .
5 #### My Kittens really enjoyed eating this product . Two bags eaten and gone . Time to re - order some more .
5 #### I started feeding my cat this stuff after I got used to the idea of spending more for better quality food . I tried to upgrade again to a more expensive salmon flavored Nutro food , but she would n't stand for it . She got really skinny before I realized her pickiness was the problem , and not worms . So we went back to this . It 's what she loves , so we 're sticking with it .
5 #### My kittens will not at anything but this brand . It is high quality in ingredients and is not overpriced like some other brands . I just hope that when they get older , I can transition them to the adult formula . This one is the only one they like !
5 #### My cat loves this stuff . I think he d give it five stars . He cleans his plate easier with the pate vs the chunkier style .
5 #### My cat ( who has early kidney disease ) loves this food but EVERY case has 30 - 70 % of them dented ! !
5 #### My puppy loves it , just mix some wellness dry food with it and they LOVE it .
5 #### Dog loves this stuff . Would be nice if the cans had pop tops .
5 #### I bought this at 1st my dogs ate it , mixed with dry but then switched to another wellness can food
3 #### I am sure it is a good quality wet dog food but , unfortunately , my pooch does n't like it much and hardly touches it ! Buying the whole case , unfortunately , I have to give them away to a friend with dogs ! !
4 #### My rating reflects the fact that some of the cans in the case are dented each time I receive them .
4 #### Cat seems to like it . If only I liked the cat as much as she likes the food . ;-)
5 #### My kitten loves this food , and it 's a great buy for the price .
5 #### My cat loves this food ! It is all she will eat !
5 #### Start your kitties off with this very good food , It is smaller pieces and they never refuse to eat this brand . This is quality food , it is more nutritious so you do n't have to give them tons of it like a cheap grocery store cat food .
5 #### Great kitten food , Ca nt keep the adults cats away , They think its a large bag of treats . Kitten is loving it too and growing up big . Price is great too .
5 #### Bought for big girls but puppies were interested in it !
5 #### These are great for your dogs teeth . My dogs love them
5 #### My bulldogs love these and they last ! Another great bone from Nylabone
5 #### This is the wet food my cat has always liked and if it ai n't broke do n't fix it .
5 #### Wow ! ! My cat loved this and he is the pickiest eater . His whole life he would only eat one wet food . He also eats only one cat treat and it happens to be the most expensive one too . He s so spoiled . I put this out for him and was so shocked he ate it , then I came back an hour later and it was gone ! ! I ve tried to give him wellness many times but he would always sniff it and turn his nose up to it . My other cat loved wellness and she was n't picky at all , but she passed away last year . But for my cat to eat this shows how delicious it is . Also , why are people giving bad reviews to the food for the packaging ? Hey ! ! That has nothing to do with the food ! ! You re rating the food , not the delivery .
4 #### My rating reflects that fact that some of the cans in the case were dented and every time I receive my order they are dented .
4 #### My rating reflects the fact that some of the cans in the case were dented .
5 #### Wellness is a great brand ( no grain ) and Bailey has been eating it for a few years now . By the way Sweet Potato is really healthy for dogs ...... Thanks !
2 #### This is probably great dog food but not for my dogs . It is very very rich - and it caused a great deal of intestinal upset in both of my dogs - and I had to smell the residual results . I 'm just thankful that we did not have company when the dogs were eating it .
5 #### I give some of this to my cat every day to add some moisture in her diet . It is smooth . She does n't like cat food with too much texture .
5 #### Feed this to stray kitties . It is the only flavor on their plate that allows me to get close to them .
5 #### I have 3 adult male indoor / outdoor cats . I feed them this plus various wet foods . The cats seem to like this salmon flavor slightly more than other nutro max cat food that I 've tried , the others being chicken indoor , salmon indoor and chicken indoor low weight . There are fewer hairballs with this brand than others . There may be more important nutrients in this food as one cat had a chronic weepy eye that nearly disappeared soon after I started feeding them this brand . pros : they like it , not the most expensive cat food , but yet is high quality , does not result in smelly waste after digestion cons : some may not like the price - are your cats worth it ? Highly recommend .
5 #### My four year old orange tabby loves this . His litter box habits are great and I do n't notice any significant odors . He 's a very healthy boy .
4 #### My kitties like the Max chicken flavor better . Typically salmon is usually the first choice at our house ?
5 #### My cats love this flavor . One of my cats does not care for dry food . But she will eat this one . I keep the dry food out in their bowl throughout the day for them and it takes approximately three days for them eat it all but with this dry food , it 's gone within one day . Smell of this dry food smells like the trader joes ' cat treats I buy for them and they love the cat treats . I would buy this again for them because they both love it . And I think I 'll have to buy it for them way sooner rather than later .
5 #### I have five cats and they really like this a lot ! I always have a choice of two to four brands of dry food and I must say , the LOVE it ! Paws up for sure !
5 #### I 've bought these for my crazy chewer and licker dog . He loves it but it makes his gums bleed . I give it to him occasionally only and also have to closely monitor him play .
5 #### This is the one chew toy I 've purchased that shows absolutely , no wear . Big dog , small dog ... Does n't matter . They 've had it for a month an it looks the same as the day I gave it to them .
4 #### My dog was n't a fan because of how hard the dinosaur was but my sisters dog me loved it . UPDATE 10/01/17 : My new puppy loves this toy - my older one not so much ; great for teething !
3 #### Fell apart faster than regular Nylabone products , in my opinion . Hurts like a b * * * * to step on ....
4 #### Food is great . I do notice that there are some inconsistencies ; some batch are softer and darker than others and my cats prefer some batches over another . Delivery man threw the box over the fence so all the cans on one side are can not be opened . And the case looked like it was taped with packaging after some sort off food explosion because there are food residues on some of the cans .
5 #### Excellent quality and grain free . I know I am giving my felines good food , no leftovers .
5 #### I have a spry healthy cat , Al , who has been eating Nutro cat food for 12 years now .
5 #### Cats seem to like this food . I think it is more healthy than meow mix . Good .
5 #### The cats really like this , and with subscribe & save , this is much less expensive than buying this at brick & mortar stores . So unless I have a good coupon , I 'll continue to get this through Amazon .
5 #### This is my puppy 's favorite . It has lasted forever , and I already bought more backups for when it finally gets too chewed up .
5 #### This was so cute . My dog loved her little animal , and chomped happily on it for hours . Kids seem to love it too , so little warning , if you do n't want your little boys thinking it 's one of their toys , keep it up during doggy not chewing time .
5 #### I love that this chew toy has lasted so long for my dog . I do not love when I step on it ! LOL
2 #### I have been getting this for a couple years now but with the last several cases , I have noticed quality issues . The consistency and smell of the food is different- slimier and stinkier . My dog does n't does n't seem to like it as much any more and his poop has been runnier . I do n't know if they changed the formula or what , but I am concerned that there is something wrong with the food now . The problem is , he has a sensitive stomach and switching to something that agrees with him AND that he likes is a ridiculously long process . Oh , and I have gotten several shipments with dented cans- if they were pop - tops the seal would be broken and therefore unusable .
5 #### I ended up getting a puppy and finding out she was taken away from her mother to early . We had her on milk for the first week then I wanted to get her a good high quality wet food . I did some research and found wellness was a great brand . Her coat went from a dull gray to just shinning silver after a week and half . She also picked up weight very quickly . I would recommend to anyone
5 #### We use premium dog foods to top there dry diet kibble . It is solid canned food without a lot of " gravy " . We also use Blue Buffalo and Wellness Core .
5 #### I have not tasted them myself , but my Yorkie seems to really like them . He does wiggle his tail while eating them , so I assume that eating this item brings pleasure to him !
5 #### I like the small cans - just the right size for my dogs and hard to find in stores .
4 #### Puppy seems to enjoy his can food . Need to mix well before serving --- otherwise too oily .
1 #### 4 cats refused to eat this ! ! even the stray we feed did n't want it but finally ate it . I do n't know how the reviews could have been so positive on this product ? They like creamy foods but even after adding some water and making it less sticky they just would walk away from it . Darnedest thing . Just wasted a whole lot of money . Going back to Fussie Cat .

5 #### Best money spent for our kitten Sir Prince Jinx !
4 #### Kitten played with it for a few weeks and even used the scratching pad , but eventually got dis - interested .
5 #### My finicky toothless boy can handle this and he loves it ... if his bowl is getting empty he stares at me until I replenish it .
5 #### Best cat food on the market . Made our cat 's fur feel like a mink coat .
5 #### Well the cat 's seem to love it , which is the important thing . A nice bonus is that I 've noticed that their bowel movements seem more solid and certainly less smelly . The whole house use to run for cover when we saw them heading for the litter box , not now we do n't even notice when they " do their thing " . Also , my kitties are long haired and typically shed like crazy . I switched to Max Cat about 2 months ago and I 've noticed a significant difference in their coats , so this cat food has to be doing something right . Their hair is much softer , shinier , and does not seem to tangle as easily ... but the biggest improvement is that they are shedding less . My black clothing and vacuum would like to express gratitude to makers of Max Cat .
5 #### My cat loved this food and does not love much
5 #### These last forever ! Our boys love chewing on their dinos and anything nylabone !
5 #### My hound gets 1 of these a year , and it takes him a year to gnaw it done !
4 #### A little big for a small dog , but product was fine
4 #### My English Bulldog is a heavy chewer . I love Nylabone products because she can either : a ) chew on them forever without destroying or b ) if she does destroy it , it takes a long time ! This toy has not disappointed . We 've had it about 3 months now and she has n't gotten any big pieces off yet . The reason I dropped it a star is because she just does n't pull it out of the toy box everyday like most of her other Nylabone toys . I 'm not sure if she does n't like the flavor , the texture , or shape but she only chews on it about twice a week vs. everyday .
5 #### cat loves it so he will be getting this every day and I will be buying it from amazon
5 #### I am a hooman slave to eight rescued cats of all ages , health conditions , breeds and temperaments . Every cat overlord , fussy finicky eater and all , loves this food . There are no leftover morsels , the bits are in a rough doughnut shape that helps to provide a satisfying crunch and help to remove tartar , and the taste must be excellent to tempt everyone . The price is very reasonable for the quality ingredients .
5 #### Since switching to this , my cat only has a hairball every 3 months ... He loves it !
5 #### this product has done wonders for our 4 yr old cats very sensitive tummy ..... really makes a difference
5 #### My old girls love this ! It agrees with their digestion as well .
5 #### My cat loves this and wo n't eat anything else , not even wet food . It may not be the best food out there , but she will eat it .
5 #### My two - year - old boxer - pit still chews on both of these we got when he was 10 weeks old . He is a BIG CHEWER , and these still live on , do n't break off in big chunks .
5 #### Long lasting bone that my dog loves . Great value !
5 #### My dog LOVES these ! They are great quality and offer excellent durability , even for the most difficult chewers . My dog rips every toy apart , but these are still staying strong !
3 #### This was n't my dog 's favourite toy . She liked it at first but then got bored of it when she realized it was just plastic . She prefers antlers or bones .
5 #### Good product for heavy chewers . I have a black lab that has gone through a few of these but she loves them and does n't chew up anything else in our house . We do toss them out when they get smaller . Worth the $ $ $
3 #### Seems like a good product but my dog has no interest in it . He 'd rather have good ol bone .
5 #### Great for my dogs . They lovie it . They each get half a can and dollop of Greek Yogurt in the morning .
3 #### My dogs do n't really care for this that much . The consistency or texture is gummy or glue like . They have a hard time getting it out of the bowl .
5 #### Dogs love the flavor and eat it eagerly . Coats shiny and soft . Beautiful athletic form . No stomach upset .
4 #### I buy a lot of puppy food for my foster litters and the only thing that concerns me when I buy online is product freshness . These came today and they do n't outdate till 2017 . Perfect ! Good price , good puppy food .
2 #### My cats really dislike this . One even scratches around the bowl trying to " cover " it , which he does with unpleasant smells . I have 3 cats and 4 foster cats currently , and none of them will eat this . I gave 2 stars , because it may be their personal preference , not the product .
4 #### the cats like this ' ok ' ; better when it 's introduced as a treat from their reg diet .
1 #### I used Wellness for many years with two cats but no more . When I recently adopted an abandoned kitten , I started using this Wellness kitten food and she liked it really well . Then I noticed hard bone fragments in the cans . One piece was sharp and the other was rounded . Please check your cans for the expiration date - the cans we had with bones expire on 2/11/20 . Unfortunately , Amazon 's recent shipment to me ( January 2018 ) was from this batch . In addition to this experience , last summer when my ailing cat was doing poorly , Wellness changed the formula of their Signature Skipjack Tuna . It was the only food he would eat near the end and , thankfully , I was able to find one more can of the old formula locally before he was put down . A close friend went through a similar experience with a formula change with her blind kitty . Neither of us will purchase Wellness again . It 's too bad because I believe their food use to be of good quality and many flavors are very palatable . But with disagreeable formula changes and dangerous quality control issues ( and not much genuine help offered from the manufacturer ) we are done . Especially if you have animals with special needs , I suggest you look elsewhere before your cat is dependent on a particular flavor / type from this brand .
5 #### This is the o my flavor of Wellness Naturals that our cats like
2 #### Because my cat gained so much weight I researched cat food . The 1st 5 ingredients which is what you should look for lists this food with " meat " and " by - products " . Apparently grain free wet food would be best but pricey , an excellent alternative for the same price as this is Trader Joes , or Newman 's Own , and the 1st 5 ingredients MUCH better . Good luck !
5 #### What can I say ? I got a good price and the cat loves it . My vet actually said Friskies pate has one of the best nutritional breakdowns for cats you can get .
5 #### My 3 babies ( 6 yrs ) love this food . I was introduced to the Nutro Brand in Petsmart by a brand rep . Ever since I tried a small bag I have begun getting bigger bags . They also love the chicken flavor .
5 #### This food was recommended by my vet and I have been feeding to all my cats for the past 14 years . It 's a little more expensive than brands like Purina , but the ingredients are higher grade , and almost all of my cats have lived to be at least 18 years old . ( they are indoor only ) . If you can afford it , I definitely think it 's worth the splurge .
4 #### dogs like it a lot , but does n't last long with aggressive chewers . we 've recently switched to the more expensive , american made Benebone Jumbo and the dogs LOVE the peanut - infused flavor .
2 #### though my dog loved this toy it did a lot of chipping , not sure it is really safe .
1 #### My pup did NOT like this flavor . Donated to local animal rescue pound . Perhaps other pups can benefit .
4 #### My dog loved this food , ate every last bit . But she had such bad gas we never gave her another can . This is probably true for any new food that a dog eats a lot of .
5 #### New puppy loves this and the dry Wellness puppy food . And Amazon is cheaper that local pet stores .
4 #### Love it because it 's well priced and my mega - esophagus dog can keep it down ( mostly ) while getting a higher caloric food . Yet some of these cans are quite soupy in consistency . She 's too small to consume a whole on in one sitting , so refrigeration firms it up just fine , but it 's just something to be aware of .
4 #### add this to dry food once a day and all but one of my seven pups like it
1 #### First time purchaser --- STINKS--- like fish , smells like it should be cat food . Wo n't buy this flavor again , it 's dark like beef , says it 's chicken & sweet potato . Would n't think chicken would be this dark . Just nasty ...
4 #### The texture is a bit more hard and gelatinous than the other pate wet cat food I ve tried . My cat seems to like the taste ok .
1 #### i purchased 6 cases at 20 $ a case . Was one heck of a sale . Ill not pay 35 $ for 12 cans of this stuff . That s 7 hole chickens .
5 #### This is the only cat food I have ever tried that all of my cats love . I do n't know if its the really soft texture of the pate or what but they all love it and that s never happened before .
5 #### Ca nt beliece my picky eater loves this food ! I have tried so many different wet food already , and this is one that did n't even give me any trouble in transitioning . Last night I gave him a scoop of wellness to mix with his old food and he ate it without hesitation . This morning I gave him a scoop and he begs for more wellness . He left the old food in the bowl and kept licking the spoon I used to give him wellness . So I gave him the whole can , and he s so happy ! He usually never finish his food in one sitting , but he just kept eating wellness and licking the bowl ! I can tell that the texture of this food is much smoother than other products I have bought , even after being in the fridge for a night . I m glad that my cat likes this healthy new food .
3 #### Cats were not a fan . At least the fosters we had ate it . But our resident cats would not touch it .
1 #### My cats would not eat this . With 7 cats you would think that one would ! Not to disparage the product , cats are strange ( spoiled ) creatures . So my local no - kill shelter ended up with it and were happy to have it .
5 #### Got the stegosaurus ! My dog loves this thing . Well at least for the next 30 minutes ... But these are pretty indestructible . My dog typically gets disinterested when she ca n't destroy something , so this is good as an every now and then toy for her ( she is a 45 lb goldendoodle approx . 2 years old )
5 #### Best chew toy for a pit bull ! The one dinosaur lasted her over three years , and she loved it .
5 #### These are my dog 's favorite ! I have ordered them three different times and they love all three shapes .
4 #### Good price . Cats like it . They do not like the Mixed Grill can .. neither of my cats like it . Have to trade friends with this one .
5 #### I purchased this as a gift for the animal shelter . The cats like this food , and there is a lot of food in the Pate cans , so it can feed several cats . The animal shelter also likes this food . This is their recommended brand / flavor . When people offer donations , this is the one they ask for . I have 4 cats , and they all love this food as well . As long as Amazon keeps selling this product , I will be sending a case of it to the local animal shelter on the 1st of every month . The local shelter is a no - kill shelter so they need a lot of food that the cats will actually eat .
5 #### Love it but had to change cats diet to grain free .
4 #### Besides random recall , shortage , and price hike , the cat likes it and it is a decent quality .
5 #### I believe my 6 - year - old has a sensitive stomach or something because she has not been able to eat a single wet food I ve given her without throwing up . I ve tried countless amounts of brands and types , and she either did n't like the taste and would nt bother eating , or shed throw up if she did . This food , however , has been amazing . She has n't thrown up once from it and seems to like the taste just fine . My kitten likes it as well and the shelter I work at hands this out to our kitten fosters . I d highly recommend .
2 #### Something has changed in the formula . My cat has been eating this for years and now she refuses it . It looks different also visually , now it has a darker / orange - y color .
5 #### Excellent quality ! My big boys , Harley ( Blk Lab ) and Buddy ( Red Heeler mix ) love their TRex ! I really need to get them another one ... TRex is just about mangled to death ! haha ! I plan to buy more for them ... they really outlast the bones I have bought for them .
5 #### The pup likes these durachews better than the smoth bone shaped ones . Last a long time and keeps the pup busy .
1 #### I got the T - rex for my dog who is a powerful chewer as they put it . He did n't even have it for 5 minutes before he broke a chunk off of the body and got it lodged in his molars . He freaked out for a few minutes before I was able to get a hold of him and figure out what the issue was . I ended up having to sit on him while reaching back into his mouth to pry the wedge piece out of his teeth . Never again will I buy Nylabone . I 'm sticking with KONG
5 #### Excellent product , puppies love them We train service puppies for Guide Dogs for the Blind organization , and this is one of their approved toys . It 's super sturdy and a great toy for puppies who love to chew !
2 #### While I think these are adorable , they were actually TOO hard for my puppy to enjoy during teething
5 #### Great for mixing with dry food , my dog loves it !
5 #### It is working well with my dog who has skin allergy problems and also is very finicky . It seems to work well with her now that I have switched to this brand of dog food .
3 #### So far my Shiba Inu pup is turning her head on this .
5 #### I wasted a lot of money on this product because five out of twelve cans were dented too badly to be safely used . I ca n't get a refund unless I return the item , but that 's quite a big hassle packaging and hauling a case of dog food out to be shipped . That 's the reason I tried subscribe and save - so I would n't have to haul it ! No more canned goods from subscribe n save .
5 #### My dogs are obsessed with these dino bones . Carry them everywhere and keep their teeth clean !
3 #### My dog has never played with this or chewed on it . I can see why , it 's very hard , not colorful , and does n't smell . There is nothing to attract my dog to play with it . I wish he did , but he has other nylabone and chew type toys that he loves . You win some , you lose some . My dog just does n't like it . 6 month old golden retriever .
5 #### My Pointer chews up everything and fast . But this chew has managed to last . YEA Not to mention they do not care for plastic , But got lucky on this one .
5 #### My dogs absolutely LOVE these ! They last forever as well ! We have chewy time each morning !
5 #### Just got two little kittens and they LOVED this stuff , no runs or tummy issues from it ! Really pleased and would order all the flavors !
5 #### Both of my cats will eat this ! One threw up the chicken pate , but both are fine with this turkey pate so I was happy to find a grain free wet food they would both eat . The price here easily beats my local Pet store . I also feed them Fancy Feast classic chicken pate ( which is why I thought the chicken would work , but you never know with cats lol ) . My cats have happily eaten the Wellness grain free indoor dry food for years now , which is why I decided to try this brand when I decided to upgrade to a grain free wet food . I 've only ordered once so far , but no cans were dented and the food looked just like the trial cans I had purchased locally .
5 #### One of my dogs has a chicken and poultry allergy so finding alternatives is great . We trust wellness for her .
5 #### I finally found a food my finicky little puggle will eat .
5 #### I like the product but my dogs do n't ... go figure .
5 #### Only wet food that I trust giving to both of my dogs . They love the variety of flavors
5 #### A high quality dog food my dog loves . Winner
1 #### These toys destroyed my dogs teeth . My dog cracked the enamel of several teeth and lost half a tooth on one of these .
1 #### These things are hard as a rock and can chip your dog 's teeth . Check with your vet first and monitor your dog if you get these - we no longer use them .
2 #### She likes this enough , but it 's so loud when it hits the floor or any hard surface !
3 #### Wow , the T - rex version is big . Much bigger than expected , and the bumps do grind down pretty quickly . Probably wo n't be ordering this one again , my dog is into it , but it 's an awkward shape for her to get a good grip and it 's really heavy .
5 #### My Aussie and mini Aussie love these . Seem to last a long time and when I see a little wear and tear , I dispose of them and give them new ones . Good for their teeth and gums , and a great price point .
5 #### A repeat customer . The cats seem to like it and eat it , so there it is .
5 #### My dogs love this bone . The bones have lumps , bumps , and curves and are fun to chew . I often see my 2 dogs chewing on this dinosaur together- one on each end !
5 #### This is apparently the best chew toy ever - ask the dog ! ! Whenever the dog starts to look bored , I just put this by her , and she 'll spend at least an hour working on it . I am still on fence about plastic chew toys , but nothing has broken off , and I check it everyday and remove anything that I think might be harmful to her .
5 #### Both my dogs and my neighbors dogs love these . Great for powerful chewers . Long lasting , and do n't leave stains or residue . No bad smells to them either .
5 #### Really cute . We got the t rex looking one . A fun new shape , pup likes to chew it
4 #### Good for large breed puppies . Keeps them interested and survives the teething times . Not appropriate for heavy , adult chewers
5 #### My dogs go bonkers for these things . We order a pack of them every Christmas and they usually last the dogs all year long . They go through one every two or three months . They destroy the actual bone - shaped Nylabones in a couple of weeks , so we shifted to these dinosaurs a couple of years ago . The nubs on the dinosaurs help keep junk off their teeth , and it keeps them from chewing on other things , like shoes and underwear . Nylabones can be a little more expensive , but our dogs love them , and they are safe for our fur - babies and always made in the USA . For that , Nylabone will always continue to have my business !
5 #### Great product . My dog loves it . Worth the money a quality pet food .
5 #### I 've been feeding Wellness canned food to our dogs for years . The venison is a very solid wet food , it 's not too mushy - I think the chicken is mushier . I feel like this is valued nutrition at a good price for our dogs , we feed it with Canidae dry dog food twice daily . Our three dogs have had no major health issues at ages 10 + , 8 and 7 . Wellness works ! I started buying canned wet food online since it 's now cheaper to do so than buy it at a store . I 'm looking at you , Pet Value .
4 #### We are very happy with the price , delivery time , but the consistency of food itself seems to have changed more into a pate rather than the chunky style that we used to get My girl seems to snub her dinner a bit more , lately ? But all in all , I trust anything Wellness puts into it can !
5 #### Beagles just lapped it right up , they love it . They lick their dishes clean .
5 #### Our dogs love this dog food and it keeps them and their coats healthy . The sweet potato in the ingredients provides good fiber and prevents loose stools . This is really good quality dog food .
5 #### I mix it with the Wellness dry food and my puppy lives it . I know she 's getting a healthy food .
5 #### My dog was the worst eater . Walked away from everything except treats but this ... he loves and barks for more . Will reorder other flavors also .
4 #### You do n't get to choose which dinosaur you get . I ended up receiving the stegosaurus . I wish I had received one of the other shapes . This toy has a lot of sharp edges , which are made worse once your dog starts to chew it up . It 's also pretty heavy . On multiple occasions my dog has dropped it on my feet and it hurts ! I also have bamboo floors and her repeated dropping this off the back of the couch has started to leave small divots and dents in my wood floor . The product does live up to the Dura Chew reputation though , she has been working on it for a few months and has n't made much progress . I imagine due to it 's mass it will last a long long time . Hopefully some of the sharper points will be smoothed out ...
2 #### Normally I love all nylabone products but this one was a bit disappointing . The white pieces broke off very easily and made a mess . Also probably not good for my dog to be swallowing those pieces .
5 #### Indestructible , but sharp edges develop . They can be filed down for safety . Dishwasher safe and durable .
2 #### Here 's the thing about these types of dental chew things I do n't think they are good for my pet 's teeth and gums . I think they are too hard and once it 's chewed on , it starts getting jagged all around . I started getting worried when I saw the damage it was doing to my puppy 's mouth . I 'd rather give my dog a bully ring to chew on than this
5 #### My dogs love these bones and they seem to be helping keep their back teeth clean which is a major plus !
1 #### I ordered the Friskies canned cat food " Pate " type and received the " Bits " type which she does not like . So now I have 2 cases of canned cat food my cat wo n't eat !
4 #### The only canned cat food my cats will eat !
3 #### Normally , I make our cat 's food but I use this variety in a pinch when I am too busy to prepare their food myself . Our cats do seem to like it . Healthwise , it obviously can not compare to custom raw food . Also , it smells terrible and looks disgusting ( as most commercial wet cat food does ) . All of that aside , my primary complaint is the frequency with which Wellness recalls its pet food . This raises concerns for me about the ong - term safety of relying on this as a diet staple . ( Also , in my experience , the company does not follow through on its recall reimbursement procedures , which makes this all double irritating . )
3 #### We order a lot of items from Amazon Prime . We are loyal customers and enjoy the savings . However , we have experienced issues with dented cans being shipped . A few are so severely dented that I will not feed them to my dog for fear of a compromised seal which could lead to botulism poisoning which does not offer odor or taste changes . How do I get this problem resolved ? I do n't want to return the whole package as my dog is hungry but do n't want to pay for unusable food .
5 #### The phrase " you are what you eat " applies to dogs as well , so its important to provide food with real nutrition and made from real ingredients , not ' byproducts ' .
5 #### The dogs eat it and since being on this diet they all have soft shiny coats . Of course they are dogs and will eat just about anything . First canned food that I have used that has remained fairly consistent on ingredients . I have been feeding this diet for years .
5 #### MY CAVALIER KING CHARLES IS 7 AND A BIT OVERWEIGHT , I MIX THIS WITH THE WELLNESS SENIOR DRY AND HE IS VERY HAPPY WITH HIS DINNER . HE EVER LOST SOME WEIGHT . MY VET RECOMMENDS THIS PRODUCT TOO
5 #### My dog started itching , coughing , developed a rash and refused to eat . I took her to the Vet who ran a bunch of blood work . All tests came back negative and the vet put her on antibiotics . I began feeding her cooked chicken breast , but she continued to decline and started having facial swelling to the point where I had to start giving her Benadryl and hand feeding her just to get her to eat a couple bites . After 10 days of antibiotics , I called the Vet and told her my dog was still sick and not eating . She wanted to do a bunch of X - rays to look for tumors or for me to " think about putting her to sleep" ... I was n't ready to do that , so I began to research and all her symptoms pointed to a food allergy ( chicken is common ) . I started her on the Venison and sweet potato food , now , a week later she is returning to health . Still skinny , but no itching , coughing or swelling and loves the taste of this food . Miracles can happen :)
4 #### I have been feeding my dogs Wellness products for years . I have 2 Shih Tzu 's , 14 & 15 years old . They like the food and they are very healthy . They can not tolerate wheat or beef products and this digests well . I feel good about feeding my dogs this food .
5 #### after doing a bunch of research we decided that now while we want our small puppy to get the best and most growing done we feel great about giving him this food . this is the best price around as well .
5 #### My little guy loves this dino chew ! He is only 13lbs and is not a crazy chewer , but does gnaw at this 4 - 5 times a week . I have yet to buy another one yet . It is lasting forever . It is made of really strong material and I do n't have to worry about large pieces coming off and choking him . Plus , it is adorable ! PICTURE : Shows our T - Rex with head chewed off ;)
5 #### My labs love this toy for chewing . They are 7 and 3 years old . The toy holds up very well to their strong jaws .
5 #### The dog enjoys chewing on the dinosaur 's head and so far has not been able to destroy it . So I am happy and the dog is happy with the dental chew .
5 #### Both cats love all of the Max Cat Nutro chunks in sauce , and usually eat all the food instead of licking the gravy and leaving the rest . This has also helped Cavity gain some much needed weight to help with his Thyroid condition . I fully recommend this !
5 #### My cats LOVE this product and brand . My 18 1/2 year old cat will immediately choose it over the second bowl of another brand and I see a difference when she eats Max Cat in terms of her energy , coat , etc . She will get sick on some other brands but seldom this .
5 #### This was a great price I bought these for ! Thank you !
3 #### I do n't know was the 2 cats problems are . Getting older and more finicky . My cats used to gobble this up .
5 #### cat eats these with anticipation . Great value as best per oz price on amazon for wet food . Noticed some cats did not like some of the flavors , solution is to mix some of its favorite dry food in and they will go to town on it
5 #### I ordered Friskies Wet Cat Food Classic Pate in 3 flavor variety pack to send to an animal rescue that helps the feral cats in the community . I also do pet rescue and regularly feed these flavors to the cats in my own care . They all seem to love the taste of the pate varieties . They hear the can being opened and come running to get it . They love the turkey and giblets flavor and the fish flavors best of all . I will continue to purchase this brand both for the cats in my own care and as gifts I will send to other rescues .
5 #### Our puppy loves these ! I am going to have to buy them in multiples from now on . They are durable and last her for a while , unlike some of the other Nylabone products , she ca nt chew through the entire thing in one day ! I love a toy that can keep her busy for multiple days !
5 #### So my dog was n't too interested in it when I first bought it , but when he 's super bored he goes to town on it , which is great because it cleans his teeth . Overall great price for this item and it does what it 's supposed to .
5 #### Did n't want the frustration free packaging but got it anyways . Oh well . Other than that , the dog loves it ! Also it is just really cute to be honest . I would definitely get it again
3 #### Did n't last very long . It 's currently a sharp white nub in our dogs toy box .
5 #### I have been feeding my dogs wellness venison and sweet potato for a while now . It 's often hard to find at my local pet food store ... When I would find it , I would usually stock up . When I found out I could buy it on Amazon , I was thrilled ! Always having it available ; having it shipped to my front door ... What could be better ? When I first started having the shipped , numerous cans in a shipment would be damaged -- severely ! That is not the case anymore . I am pleased to say that my last six shipments ( at least -- could be more ) have arrived in excellent condition .
1 #### Despite assurances from several people at Wellness , the formula for this product has changed , at least for the last 6 cases we have bought ( in separate buys ) , with an expiration date of 12JAN17 , with different " MWCP " lot numbers . Basically , the food is mushier and softer than it has been for the last several years . Up until now , our dog has been doing very well on this food . Verification of the change is that our dog 's poops ( pardon the detail ) are softer and less frequent ( once a day instead of 2/3 times ) . Not unhealthfully soft appearing but not nearly as " good " as they used to be . Since the second listed ingredient on the can is chicken broth , my guess is that they have increased the amount of that in the mix , which increases the already large amount of water and is effectively , a price increase . I would have felt better about it had I been informed correctly by the Wellness people . This has spurred me on to make my own dog food . If you 're going to do that , make sure that you do plenty of research and get a good vitamin / mineral supplement to add to your meat ( I am using ground turkey and no salt canned salmon for that ) , along with the right calcium / phosphorus supplement and ratios . You can search on " homemade dog food . " Good luck .
3 #### I have been purchasing this item for my Beagle , who loves it . The last time I got a case in , when opening the can 's it look to be " Dried Out " , and not Moist as it is normally observed . I am not sure if this is " Old Stock " , but I will buy it one more time . If I see this again , I will stop buying this from Amazon.com I expect this product to be as fresh as what I purchase in the Retail Store !
5 #### Wellness Canned Dog Food is probably the only dog food my small dogs would eat without any problem . I mix some of this food with the Wellness Dry Food and they love it . Good wholesome food for mans best friends ... My Pomeranian , Papillons and Yorkies are happy to agree ! Wellness
5 #### I buy this brand of food for my cats so It tried it for my dogs . All of the cat food they make are grain free the dog varieties are not . Even though they are not grain free they were good premium dog food options that I chose to feed my dogs as they are not source in china . I have since moved on to another brand of grain free dog food to help with my dogs paw licking and skin issues .

2 #### Bought for my 8 week old chihuahua she ate it only for a short time before refusing it . And it 's is not grain free
5 #### Awesome food . Like others have reviewed , my pup suffered loose stools initially . To avoid this you have to introduce it gradually . It 's well worth it . After 3 months she is the picture of health . Firm stools , gorgeous black shiny and silky coat , no more dry skin or dander . She loves it ! Highly recommend !
4 #### The cat likes it well enough and it has the right dietary advisory approval .
3 #### My cats did n't seem to like this . They d eat it but not with the same gusto that they ve eaten other brands with . And while cat food almost never smells appealing , this one was especially unpleasant to smell .
4 #### My cat likes it , I mean , she does n't go nuts for it and usually waits until it 's warmed up a bit after it 's been served from the fridge . But she usually eats it all up before her next serving .
3 #### My cats are not enjoying this ... I think they know its healthy .
5 #### My lab / golden cross loves these dino bones ! He prefers it over any other toy , and Amazon has a great price for them .
3 #### It 's okay if you 're dog is n't a strong chewer . I have a husky who demolished this and cut up his mouth a little from the sharp ridges he made .
2 #### My dog Munchkin " Munchie " loooves to chew things . I have to buy her a lot of chew toys that are " dura " and she can usually kill these chew toys relatively quickly . The problem with these particular shapes is that she focused her chewing on the feet of the dinosaurs ( I bought more than one . ) So , all that chewing and she completely ignored the rest of the dinosaur and all its raised bumps -- it was all about the feet for her which she decimated in about ten minutes . Keep in mind she weighs 9lbs . The design of these are bulky and do n't really allow for the dog to get a good handle on them to chew .
5 #### I 've had so many of these over the years ! Every dog I 've given one of these to loves it , including my 30 pound dog and my mom 's 60 pound dog . All of the shaped are good , but the stegosaurus has been the most popular from what I 've seen .
5 #### I see there have been some people with bad reviews for this product , but I have had nothing but positive experiences . I inadvertently adopted three puppies within three months -- all abandoned at my place of work . They are now 11 , 13 and 15 months old , but when I found the last , they were 3 , 5 , and 7 months , and one of my big challenged was finding a toy that all three could play with and not destroy instantly . We tried rope toys , but those last about a day at best . Fabric toys were good for five minutes . I tried some of the softer puppy Nylabones , which were great for the littlest -- a thirteen pound Dachshund / Chihuahua mix -- but terrible for the other two , a thirty pound Red Heeler mix and a sixty pound Rhodesian Ridgeback / Pitbull mix . I would label all three of my girls as medium - aggressive chewers , and these things have saved my life -- and my stuff ! They do break pieces off , and I sometimes have to pick little white bits out of my carpet , but I 've had no medical or tooth problems ( as reported by others ) and it 's great to have a toy that everyone can play with ! Every couple of months I order three more , and they 're always delighted to have fresh new toys . Plus , you ca n't beat Amazon 's price !
3 #### Dog does n't really care too much about this one . I do n't either , because it was a stegosaurus instead of a T - Rex , but that 's a crap shoot with this product .
5 #### Wellness is grain free and this is a great flavor my cat likes a lot
5 #### I 've gotten this wet food for my babies since I fostered them and continued when I decided to adopt them , and since their fur is much smoother , softer , and has no more dandruff . I also combine the wet food with Wellness Kitten Core Dry food , and between the two , my babies are super healthy looking and feeling , according to the vet .
1 #### My cats never had problems until the new cans were released , they did fine on the old recipe , now the new stuff makes my youngest cat sick , she throws up all nights several times , i used to love the brand , but after this i will not be buying it and i will be telling others too . This new recipe has something wrong with it
1 #### I started feeding my cats Wellness canned food back when it was made differently , meaning better . I made the mistake of not keeping up with changes in manufacture and it made one of my cats very sick . One of my cats started losing weight a few months ago , and I took him to the vet , and she could n't find anything wrong with him . He did n't have energy , and he kept losing weight , and eventually he quit eating his food . I did n't know what to do so I switched to a different brand of canned cat food and he started eating again . He started putting on weight and of course I ended up discussing this with my veterinarian . She said that I was not the only client who reported problems with Wellness food . Other people reported that it made their cats sick , throw up or lose weight . That 's my experience , in brief . You 're welcome to do your own online research . Basically , this food was making one of my cats sick and I had to quit feeding it to him . this used to be really good food but somewhere along the way it changed . Do your own research , that 's my advice .
2 #### Though I bought chicken and sweet potatoes , the dog food smells like fish . It stunk up the whole area of the dog bowl and got on my fingers from serving it which made my hands stink till I washed them . My dog loved the dog food but I could n't stand the smell .
1 #### I 've ordered this a couple of times and purchased from the local pet store and it was great . The last case ordered through Amazon ( ick ) was the sloppy kind mentioned by a few other reviewers and my 10 month old puppy wo n't eat it . - tried 8 different cans from the case and they are all the same . I 've have now been making my own chopped fresh chicken and mashed sweet potato to mix in with the dried Wellness puppy food . She devours every bit . Sorry Wellness I normally really like your product but this is really bad form when you buy a whole case that can not be used :( Also - as mentioned by someone previously more than half the cans are dented .
5 #### Another good product from Wellness . We mix Wellness Core and Wellness senior formula for our 9 year old little guy . Have tried many different holistic dog food brands , Wellness is still the best in terms of price , quality , taste , ingredients and even the appearance of packaging . Have recommended Wellness to many friends with dogs , they all find the products satisfactory . The only other brand can rival Wellness is Orijen , which is also a great dog food but they only offer dry ones .
2 #### I feed my pups Wellness . The kibble ca n't be beat . I figured it 'd be a no - brainer getting their canned food . Do not buy this specific recipe . It smells like cat food once opened , and has the same consistency . It will not hold up a fresh - like consistency once opened . This does not take away from the brand , and the other canned type stew - foods they make . I only give it 2/5 stars because my pups gobble it up immediately after opened . They do n't care for it after it has been stored / refrigerated .
5 #### I purchased a few different puppy canned foods based on price . The cheaper canned foods were so fatty , that my dog vomited . Wellness may be expensive , but the quality is well worth the price .
4 #### After finally reading the ingredients in the dog food recommended by our veterinarian we felt compelled to make a change . Our dog is a female who is 8 years old and has had a weight issue most of her life . The food we were feeding her had corn and grain in it which seemed to only add to her issues . So we found this and gave it a try . She has lost some weight . The smell is really bad though as it has fish in it . All in all though it may have been a life saver for our girl . We have now changed to food for our younger dog to a Wellness brand food as well .
1 #### Ordered this twice , food came in dented cans though boxes were intact so it seemed to me they send out bad cans knowingly ! Also my food was very separated , it seemed to make one of my dogs vomit ! It 's crumbly and oily on top and I can not recommend this ! The chicken ( 98 % ) is very good consistency but again I get dented cans ! I 've finally decided to get my food from the vet ! This dented can stuff is a scam for these prices ! They should offer dented at a cheaper price or " perfect " for now I 'm done unless I read reviews where they 've stopped sending damaged cans !
5 #### Wellness makes such great products and I have been feeding this canned food with Core Weight Management dry food and my senior dogs love it and it is so good for them .
1 #### Not like other nylabones we 've gotten , this one leaves small plastic peices all over .
2 #### My dog was not interested in this . The smell or flavor did not seem to have any effect .
5 #### Cat 's eat it every day and love it , no issues I have been feeding it for over 10 years . Vet said my cat 's are the picture of health and weight ! !
5 #### This was great for our puppy who is a chewer . Kept her busy for a couple of hours . She loved it .
5 #### I know I 'm taking good care of my cats by feeding them Wellness cat food . My 17 year old will only eat two types of canned food with Wellness being one she 's eaten most of her life .
5 #### I have a picky eater who also happens to be allergic to all poultry . I was hesitant to order him the beef and salmon flavor since I was told by several vets if it is not a prescription hypoallergenic food the ingredients are not guaranteed to be accurate . He has been eating hypoallergenic food for a year , but I do n't like the idea of him eating the same food day in and day out . So I ordered the beef and salmon flavor and figured I would try it . So far he 's been eating it without any allergic reaction ( skin issues ) . He also loves it . Hopefully this will be a reliable formula to alternate with the prescription food
5 #### Shazam ate her first can yesterday . She slept through the night where as before she was eating nibbles at 2 a.m. After much research on wet food for older cats with no teeth Wellness was rated the best . So far I am very pleased .
4 #### I can not get too excited . It is cat food after all . My cat seems to like it .......... some days . Then again my cat is doggon picky and persnickity . One factor about this food is that is causes no discomfort or IBS flareups in my cat . That feature is mighty important . So we will keep buying it .
2 #### I Purchased the Wellness after it was rated tops in the nutrition category for dogs , much superior to Royal Canine and also Hills ID which I had been feeding him . It is exceptional in nutrition but my pooch does nt like it.he will eat it eventually but I waste more than he eats He obviously thinks it 's okay but not great tasting . Dogs like people would prefer something that taste wonderful but might not be the best nutritionally for them , I guess they prefer junk food , sorta like us !
2 #### I was very disappointed on how the order arrived . The packing was not good enough which caused the cans to be damaged . I was totally out of dog food so I had to use what arrived not happy .
1 #### Maybe it 's just my dog but he would n't get near it . Honestly I opened it and it smelled like stinky fish . I read the ingredients but did n't see any fish . But whew my cat would n't even give it a 2nd thought . Very disappointed in the product because he likes chicken and he loves sweet potato but not in this . I ve returned it .
5 #### My Jack Russell Terrier can not eat chicken or chicken fat which is in a lot of wet foods . The food I had been giving her was just not what she liked and she ended wasting more than eating it . With this product she ate it very hardily . I fed her 1/2 can mid day and by evening she was begging for the rest of it ! I mixed it with a little cooked brown rice and I am so pleased my little Lucy loves this for she has a chronic pancreatic condition and allergies but this is settling very well with her !
5 #### We purchased this food for our 11 year old 70 pound mixed breed after reading positive reviews on the internet . He loves this food , it is easily digested and his coat is nice and shiny . We did try the senior formula but it was too mushy . HIghly recommend this one ..
4 #### I mix this with Wellness ' dry food for small breed dogs . My Shih - zhu is very picky , but he usually its this .
1 #### My dog did n't like this bone at all . It 's not flavored or anything . It 's literally just giving your animal a piece of plastic shaped like a dinosaur . How healthy for your animal does that sound ? Cause it is n't at all . I do n't recommend buying this product .
5 #### These are strange toys but I find our golden retriever knowing on these . I ca n't really say if they do anything for their teeth .
3 #### My dog chewed the tail off rather quickly . I had to take it away from him after a few days .
1 #### When the label changed , so did the ingredients- for the worse . My cat will no longer eat this , & he used to love the turkey formula . Also , the new formula kind of sponges up ( hard to describe ) if it sits a short period of time . It looks like the cheap grocery store brands . Thumbs way down for the new formula .
2 #### there is grease or fat in cans . the fat is also thick like a jello consistency . when I open the can there is a white - like film on top of the food . when I use my spoon to take food out of can my spoon is greasy feeling .
5 #### My cats ask for this by name ( Meow ) , and they love the great taste . Thank you so much , Miss Katina Newport News , VA
5 #### We have this delivered every month for our outdoor cat ! She loves it .
5 #### I ca n't say * I * love it ... but my cat does !
3 #### My cats love this stuff ( second only to Friskie 's Lamb & Rice , their all - time favorite ) and you ca n't beat the price . It 's kinda like feeding your kids Campbells Soup , though . They love it , it 's convenient and yummy and cheap but it 's filled with artificial ingredients that kinda make you uncomfortable when you read the label . Also a few of the cans were quite dented when I received the package . Additionally , I think that the feeding suggestion ( 3/4 to 1 oz . per pound of body weight daily ) is way too high . I feed my 10 lb cat a bit less than 1 can per day , plus a few treats . However , my cats are relatively indoor - dwelling and relatively sedentary , so of course your cats may be different .
5 #### Great food all three of my dogs love this food . Wish there were discounts pricey on line otherwise love , love , love the product .
5 #### Wellness is a PetCo brand and is of good quality . My 70 - pound female Golden Retriever had a hot - spots which the vet said could be coming from food allergies , recommending we switch to no chicken , no wheat , no corn in her food . She eats this dog food with gusto , but then she eats everything with gusto , so it 's probably me who likes the brand more than she does . The ingredient list starts with lamb and ends with vitamins . I believe it is very good for her skin and recommend the product to friends . Also available on Amazon subscription , which makes this Prime shopper very happy .
5 #### I have purchased this brand several times for our chihuahua and he just loves it ! He loves all the favors except for the white fish . So I no longer purchase the variety case , instead I purchase several cases of his favorites ! He loves the duck and venison the most . We have purchased these several times over the past year and this brand is the only brand we will feed our little boy . Our vet says it is a perfect choice to maintain his healthy diet .

5 #### I bought this to put a little weight on one of our Yorkiepoos . I only give it to him once a day but it seems to be doing the trick .
5 #### We tried a number of flavors of the small cans of Wellness dog food to mix with the dry food we feed our two girls ( dogs ) . We thought this would both be good for them and add variety to the taste of their meals . Judging from the fact that the food disappears rather quickly we have concluded they like it pretty much .
5 #### This canned dog food is a great supplement to either the Wellness dry food or to top off another brand of dry dog food . Ingredients are limited and good for digestion and coat . It is somewhat expensive , so we feed it daily as the " extra " in a Kong treat or mixed with our dog 's dry meal . Very happy with nutrition value and its effect on coat and overall health .
5 #### Tough and my hounds love them . 3/23/16 Still going strong ! !
5 #### How many times have I walked into the garage and found the cat food bowl on the floor licked clean ? All the time . The cat loves it .
3 #### Price is good but it hurt my cats digestive track . His litter box suddenly got gross if you know what I 'm saying ....
1 #### Only bought it because I could n't afford something better atm . Still wet food is always better than dry in my opinion so do n't go back that way .
5 #### This is an incredibly good cat food from a nutritional standpoint . The " taste point " is well approved from observing my cats devouring it which is followed by them cleaning themselves into zen afterward . My husband said it 's like candy to them . They meow and get giddy at the site of the can . It 's as if on the days I whip this stuff out you can almost decipher the meows in human language as , " Whoa ! Holly Mollie Mama 's breaking out the good stuff today . " My cats normally eat dry food . As a treat , I supplement the dry food with wet food advertently on some days . Yes , my cats are spoiled divas ! I say that jokingly and as a fact . I bought my first case of NUTRO MAX wet food on Amazon 's " deal of the day " . I am a little embarrassed that my cats will not eat 9Lives cat food and many other common store self - brands . They have developed a pallet for certain food , I guess , Higher - end uptown Girls ... sophisticated kitties . However , I assure at the end of the day their ( ahem ) " litterbox " does stink .
3 #### good food , but sticks to the can more then other flavors . seems to be a little bit thicker sauce .
5 #### My cat absolutely loves the Nutro Cat Adult Chicken Supreme , and her finicky digestive system tolerates it well ! Please do n't change the formula !
4 #### This is a good quality food . We foster puppy 's from birth to 8 weeks for various rescues and shelters . We use a variety of high quality foods to give the little ones ( and their Mom 's if with us ) , the best start we can . This particular litter were not happy with the other brands we use , so we tried Wellness . Pups and Mom devoured their food . Biggest problem is cost , but the cost of all the good quality foods is high .
4 #### So much easier to open then the 12 oz can . Saves time and cuts . It also ends up being about $ 10 more a month .
2 #### My puppy really enjoyed this food . However , it always gave him loose runny stools which was a pain to clean up . We even tried to mix it with dried food but his stools never improved until we stopped feeding him this .
5 #### While I order 2 cases each month , the shipping is less than stellar . Today 's delivery included 8 dented cans . The large cardboard box was nearly destroyed in transit . In with the ( heavy ) 2 cases was a bag containing 6 bags of cat litter box pellets . I unload the cases each month , placing the dented cans at the front so they are used first . Would be nice to receive a shipment that is not damaged .
5 #### My puppy loves this food mixed with her kibble and this is so much more economical to buy in bulk ! Very happy !
5 #### My dog has gotten so healthy on the wellness food and is so much happier . She ca n't wait to eat now !
5 #### One of my dogs is very picky . He used to turn his nose at dry food until I switched the dry to wellness ( three years ago ) and now he always eats it , even without the canned . I add the canned in the morning with his medicine . It masks his arthritis medicine pretty well but he still spits out the benadryl . The cat likes to get a bite of the turkey but will not touch the chicken . I get two cases a month on subscribe and save . The majority of the cans are ALWAYS dented - even the ones in the middle of the case . I can only assume the dents are the reason amazon is able to sell them for so much less than the pet store . I 'll take the dents for the savings any day !
5 #### We buy both wet and dry and our dogs do well on it . Never an issue to date . I know wellness was bought out so we are looking at the labels with each shipment to make sure the ingredients / ratios do n't change .
5 #### Our dogs love the nylabone products and these were no exception . They seemed to like the extra texture that 's on these for teeth cleaning . I ca n't say enough about this brand of products especially the dura chew for our tough little chewers !
2 #### I got one of these years ago for a dog I had that is now passed , and he was n't interested in it . But , I now have a chewer so I figured I 'd try it again . But , no luck . Neither of my dogs is interested in it . My sillier dog tossed it in the air a few times , but that was it .
5 #### My dogs are OBSESSED with these . It takes them a while to go through one , but I end up buying one every few months or so so that they can have a fresh one . Actually I have to buy 2 because otherwise my boys will fight over them ! They are serious chewers , about 40 lbs each , and it will take them at least 3 months to chew through one of these . Only knock is they always send the brontosaurus ( which was n't a real dinosaur anyway ) ; I 'd love to see one of the other dinos !
4 #### My boy loves his dinosaur . Noticed that it lost shape quickly from all his chewing . You might want to be careful of small pieces chipping off , but otherwise , I have no complaints .
5 #### My dog 's love these and I have ordered them over and over .
4 #### My cats favorite canned food . I do not know healthy this is , but it is the only canned food my picky eatters will touch . I have a fifteen year old cat that has been eating this for years so it must not be too bad . She is still as healthy as could be .
5 #### Cats ( 4 ) love these . Enough variety that they do not get ' tired ' of eating them .
1 #### My cats eat this stuff very sporadically . I throw more away than they eat . Will not reorder .
5 #### Our cats like this food and I like the of this package .
5 #### My cats love this ! We buy it every month and they split a can in the morning . It 's enough for my three cats to share one can each morning .
5 #### We upgraded cat food to reduce litter smells , and it worked . We also got a bigger cat litter box and a new kind of litter , so our experiment was n't exactly scientific . However we are sticking with this brand going forward . The cats loved it much , much more than Friskies .
4 #### This took a long time for my pup to warm up to , but now he loves it .
5 #### Dogs love playing with their stegosaurus ! keeps them busy while I do something else
5 #### We 've been feeding Wellness wet food ( along with a high quality dry food ) to our dogs for over 15 years , including our dearly departed . When you open the can , it is one pressed can shape form , there is no dripping gravy , like some foods have that count towards " volume by weight " and are really a waste of money . We get the duck , chicken and lamb . Our dogs have no digestive issues being served a different variety daily . Made in USA , bonus . We started buying in by case online because frankly , it 's cheaper . If I can save $ 5.00 per case and have it delivered free , this is for me . Works great for Amazon Prime members .

5 #### Great product . We mix this with Canadae All stages kibble for our rescue dogs . It nourishes and settles stressed digestive systems .
5 #### It looks and smells good , and it has the right consistency . My dogs love it and it agrees with them .
5 #### The dog is in love with this food ! She even eats her dry food when I mix it in with this ! I 'm very pleased .
5 #### This is the only wet canned food that my cat will eat . Arrived on time . Thanks ! !
5 #### I have a very , very old cat who does n't gain weight and is very picky . He loves this , but the price has gone up quite a bit so I will just get it at Walmart .
1 #### Just your regular commercial cat food . My cat gained a lot of weight , he started to get stressed his skin got dry and teeth started to get dirtier and dirtier even with cleaning . switched him to a raw diet I prepare myself . Buy him real meat that will last months for the same amount of cash these cans cost .
5 #### My cats love it and our diabetic cat retained the movement of his legs after switching to this food from dry food .
4 #### Pate is the only food my cat will eat , she also has a sensitive stomach . She will eat almost the whole can and not have any stomach problems .
5 #### Amazon is the only place I was able to find the beef & chicken recipe of Wellness in a 24 pack . My cats love this ! But the problem is that 1 case is n't enough as I ordered the 3 oz can . They arrived in the same day which was fantastic because I really needed them . It 's literally just 2 cases of a dozen cans each . I hope that I can find the 5.5 oz cans soon !
5 #### This is a great value for a wonderful food .
5 #### Probably my Labrador Retriever 's favorite Nylabone and she has a lot of them .
1 #### Too hard , dog was uninterested and it 's nearly the last thing you want to step on with bare feet .
5 #### My Golden Retriever / Border collie mix loves these . She is an aggressive chewer , and although they get rough ( do n't step on one ! ) she continues to chew for months until I pull out a new one .
1 #### Just as an FYI - I found out that these could potentially break your dogs teeth . Check with your vet . I 'm not a vet .
5 #### My dog hates harx chew toys but all my dogs have lovex this dino . Happy to say Ms Picky princess lives it . This is a great item i ve purchased many . Best price yet . Thanks . Its her birthday
5 #### My guys love this stuff and it agrees with them . That 's no small feat considering they range in age from 4 to 15 . Highly recommended
2 #### Is it fair to rate this lower because there are kinds they prefer much more ? It 's fine food , they usually like it . But there are brands they go crazy over and so far this is not one of them . Update : The novelty has worn off and all of them no longer show any interest in this . We did n't even make it through one case of it . I 'm dropping a star off because this is the only food they 've done that to .
5 #### My cat loves this . He would like me to buy more , much more . I told him you were out and he could only have a can a day . Please do n't tell him otherwise .
1 #### 3/2/2014 Updated Review - I 've purchased this food both from Amazon and PetSmart and my puppies always loved it . It was a thick consistency with bits of carrots . Now , the food has changed to a repulsive mess with black flakes of something that looks like fish scales . They hate it and I think it is disgusting . I first received this nasty mess in every can in 3 out of the 4 cases I just received from Amazon . I went to PetSmart to buy more hoping it would be the original consistency and once again , I have a case of nasty food . I placed another order from Amazon hoping to get the good food they love but if I do n't , it will be returned . There is clearly something very wrong with these cans of food . It is so different from what they 've eaten since they were six weeks old , now 8 months old and there is no other explanation other than Wellness has changed the recipe . I 've inquired with Wellness to find out what is going on . I plan to switch foods and have purchased canned Blue puppy and hope they will eat it even though it is a sudden change from the food they 've always loved .
3 #### It was better to begin with , then as we opened cans they tended to have a lot of jelly like gravy . So price wise it may be better to look for another product for you puppy .
1 #### Opened one can- THE SMELL is TERRIBLE . Like spoiled fish .. The same food purchased from my local store does n't smell like this . UGH ! Stunk up the house , and my dog wo n't touch it . Something wrong ! My dog LIKED this stuff ---- but this batch must be funky . Wo n't be buying it again , UGH . And it 's slimy in texture- it just sat in my dog 's bowl - he would n't go near it . They changed SOMETHING . ----- I am updating this review , because I just looked at the bottom of the cans . These are " Best by 11June16 " I am not sure if that means June of 2011 or June 2016 . But I put a picture of the can code in the images section . It is now November 2013 . Not sure if the problem is the product or the expire date . I am returning this order for refund . It smells so bad that opening another can to just throw it away is pointless .
5 #### Both our dogs love this wellness food in particular . One of our Shepherds is on the very skinny side , so we use wet food to supplement and we have not had any tummy troubles at all .
5 #### I rescued a 6 month old German Shepard mix puppy that weighed 24 pounds in July . Started feeding her this and the Wellness dry food and she has grown to 45 pounds and is a very happy puppy ! She loves it and gladly has eaten it since day 1 !
5 #### This is the only brand we use with our cats . They are healthy , silky , shiny , and are an appropriate weight for their size . Since switching to this brand pate , to which we add a little water to increase their water consumption , no more stones ! We give them each 2 TBSP of the Wellness dry just for something crunchy for their teeth in the morning but otherwise have moved away from dry food for their urinary health and to manage their weight . Two cats eat a half can per day for dinner . The vet recommended against even switching flavors saying that animals need to consistently eat the same brand and flavor for optimal results . Switching flavors can create gastro - issues . They have been on this flavor and brand for 5 years with great results ! I highly recommend this cat food .
4 #### Good quality and I liked the multi - flavor pack ; however , our kitty does n't really care for it anymore -- especially if it has been refrigerated . Moving on to something else .
5 #### This is a high - quality cat food that my vet recommended for my Bengal kitten . It has the needed amount of protein for a growing cat and is free from additives and unnecessary fillers . This is the type of cat food you find in a nice organic food store . The volume of food was good for my kitten , not too much .
1 #### This used to be really great food . They changed the formula this year , along with the label . Our persian cats ate Wellness for 4 - 5 years and were very healthy . One is 8 and one is 14 . But over the last couple of months , they both began to lose a lot of weight , and did n't like the food so much , and it seemed to jack them up . We just bought some Ziwi lamb , and they totally love it . They ca n't stop eating . We 're hopeful they will put their weight back on .
1 #### My dog ( who is not an aggressive chewer , she has no problem with plush toys ) chewed off the head within hours . She was laying on my chest , chewing on this thing , completely supervised , and managed to get the head off swiftly before I could notice . She swallowed it . Luckily it passed but I will never again take another risk with Nylabone .
5 #### our dog loved it , he is a heavy chewer it took himm almost a year to destroy it in total !
4 #### I 'm glad I tried these . Thought it would too big for my 11 lb baby . But it is a decent & good size . Her back teeth is still coming in . Overall a good toy for dogs of all ages , I would recommend .
1 #### My dog loves this little very hard piece of plastic shaped like a dinosaur BUT I noticed blood on it and he had chewed it in such a way that it had razor sharp spike points that would cut right into his gums if I 'd have left it down for him . He loves it so much that I ordered another just to see if the same thing happened . I watched very carefully and after he had chewed it 4 - 5 times ( under my watchful eye ) the same thing started to happen . So please beware
4 #### Nice food for my foster kittens , they have all ( 80 ) enjoyed it .
1 #### One of my kittens wo n't even touch this stuff , and the other just tolerates it because he is ravenous and eats everything . I hate it even more than they do because its basically impossible to get out of the damn can . I end up having to spoon it out which really sucks . More dishes to wash and not even to make my cats happy .
5 #### My kitty loves it and that 's good enough for me .
5 #### It 's reasonably priced , has fair to good reviews on specialized websites in terms of ingredients so I thought I 'd give it a try . I did well : my finicky cats love it and they did n't grow tired of it yet although they 've been eating this for 5 months now ( usually after a few weeks with other brands , the older one would look at me like " this thing again , really ? " and he would walk away , decided to revenge later by stealing the food I am trying to eat ) .
5 #### I bought two of these dinosaurs , one for my dog and one for my best friend 's dog . I got a stegosaurus and a trex . I bought them as Christmas presents but went ahead and gave the stegosaurus to my dog early . She loves it . It 's so cute and such great quality for the cheap price . I hope my best friends dog loves his trex just as much !
5 #### i bought one of these over 4 years ago - yes , i said 4 years ! i have a puggle ( pug / beagle ) that literally destroys every toy within 24 - 48 hours ( except this and a real marrow bone from the butcher shop , both of which he still carries around after years ) . he got the head and tail of the stegosaurus chewed off almost immediately , but has never gotten further . i was surprised to read all the negative reviews , and would have probably not bought this for him if i had seen them 4 years ago . i guess you need to know your dog . mine is destructive with toys but not obsessive . it has probably lasted so long because he 'll find it and play with it for a while , then forget about it for weeks again until one night he remembers where he hid it and wo n't stop trying to fit his fat body under the couch until i lift it up so he can retrieve this old dusty dinosaur and chew for another 30 min . i feel bad for those who have had dogs break teeth , but in my case it has not been at all unsafe . i wish i had seen it here and not paid over $ 10 at the pet store
5 #### My Labrador Retriever enjoyed this toy . He still on occasion will play with it even though it is half gone . My sons smaller dog comes over and picks this one up and chews on it for hours .
5 #### My 20 lb . dog loves these things , and have used them in the past with dogs up to 35lbs ! They last a long time , and do a good job helping to keep teeth clean .
1 #### The cans arrived packed tightly , covered with plastic wrap . The can were dented or caved in . I have noticed this before with just small dents , this time the cans which were caved in seemed dangerous to use . The company should address this problem . I wo n't be buying from them again .
5 #### our vet recommended wellness years ago . our dogs are healthy and absolutely love this food . we highly recommend wellness food

5 #### our vet recommended wellness years ago . our dogs are healthy and absolutely love this food . we highly recommend wellness food
5 #### I am trying to find a better food for my pet and this seems to be the right one . great price
4 #### This is a great dog food for my dog who has seizures , no preservatives , especially Rosemary which is a neuro - toxin . I rated this a " 4 " because the cans were frequently dented and difficult to open .
5 #### I feed mostly home - cooked meals , so when I occasionally have to feed canned , I usually am met with disapproving looks , followed by disdainful sniffs and a plate of untouched dog food . Not so with Wellness Venison and Sweet Potato ! The dogs still like home - cooked better , but if I leave them with Wellness , and give them time to think about it for about ten minutes , they will eventually clean their plates .
2 #### I just started giving my puppy the food from this batch of Wellness Just for Puppies- she usually loves this food . The consistency of the food was liquid and she refused to eat it . Opened 2 other cans from this same batch and same consistency ! I called Wellpet ( Wellness ) and after giving serial number on bottom of can , customer rep said this batch was produced in West Coast facility where the product is a loser consistency than product produced in East Coast facility . I wish I knew this before ordering a brand new case of 12 from Amazon this week , Too bad Amazon gets this product from both facilities and does n't ' let consumer know .. my puppy knows which consistency she likes - East Coast batch which is firmer and slightly different taste ..
3 #### I ca n't say I was n't warned , but sure enough , all of the cans in the center of the package were dented , and some were spoiled . Not sure if I accidentally gave spoiled food to my dog or not , but she soon refused to eat any of this , and I had to switch to a different food . If this food is working for you , you 're going to need to drive to the pet store for it .
3 #### Is the current batch safe ? We just purchased 3 boxes , and after the first can all of our 3 cats got diarrhea . They have eaten a lot of different brands of food , never having any issues . The diarrhea was fairly immediate and affected them all . Would love to hear from the company on this ...
5 #### Some of the best kitten food out there on the market . High calorie and good for raising kittens who did n't start in the best conditions . Wonderful ingredients .
3 #### My cats prefer their dry food over this ( grain free , nothing they should go nuts over ) , I think if it was a chunky consistency they might like it better but it kind of just smears on the plate . I thought I could be cost effective and buy the big cans , but with how little of this they eat it goes bad in the fridge before I use up the can . Do n't make the same mistake as me , get a small can first to see if your cat will eat it .
4 #### The chicken and lobster is thicker and tougher than some of the other flavors . I have to mash it up and water it down a little for my cat . But overall my cat likes the flavor .
5 #### I was not happy when I received the same product with the old packaging with as it contains carrageenan the new one does not have Carrageenan that was what was in the photo With the new label
5 #### Cats still like this food with the new formulation- but I had to persist in giving it to them despite the turned up noses initially and the walks away in disgust- One trick I found to work , if they turned their nose up at the new food , was to move their food bowl somewhere strange and that befuddled their tiny kitty brains and they were more likely to sample the new food and give it a fair shake . I fed my boy cat the new food on his cat tree , or in the middle of living room a few times . I 'd follow him sauntering away and just drop the bowl down . " how about now ? " .. he finally relented and ate . I have to say the change to the new formulation was fortuitous for me as I was trying to get them off Wellness due to the carrageenan . One of my cats had been throwing up a few mornings a week after eating the old formula . Wellness has finally removed the carrageenan ! She has n't thrown up since starting this new formula , fingers crossed . * * I wo n't buy this in bulk from Amazon until I know this transition is over with- I ca n't risk getting the old formula-
1 #### My cats threw up when they ate this . Either because they 're allergic or most likely this tastes like crack to them and they ca n't eat it fast enough . Def not healthy . Sorry little men ... mommy ai n't gon na give you mcdonalds everyday . Probs best as a treat every now and then .
5 #### My dog loves these . He is a mastiff and after some time he will wear down some of the thinner parts but it takes awhile and never have I seen any large junks come off of them
5 #### My dogs favorite toy ! Has lasted well over s year and still going strong and my dog can bite thru almost anything ! Only toy that 's lasted ! Great quality product !
3 #### This is HARD plastic . I thought it would be rubbery . It is loud hitting the floor . He was afraid of it at first ... He does chew on it and play with it a little now though ... so it is doing its teeth cleaning job I suppose .
3 #### This is a bit heavy for my 5 lb bichon . I 'm sure this would be great for a larger dog .
3 #### My cat would not touch this stuff . He would rather eat nothing than this . He wo n't even eat his regular food mixed with this . Ingredients look good on paper and price is a good value .
4 #### One of the feline favorites . My cats are allergic to chicken , so this works well for them .
2 #### Cats do n't like it . All 3 leave it sit there . Even the feral kitty walks away from it .
1 #### They love the Max Cat dry food but do n't like this at all . They smell it and walk away . I 've added some warm water , cool water , broke it up into smaller pieces but still no take . Wo n't buy the Nutro Max Wet Food again .
5 #### I use this as the primary food for my elderly Yorkie and to make " gravy " in my bigger dogs ' food . All of them absolutely love it and the Yorkie remains very healthy and youthful at 16 years .
5 #### I have a senior chihuahua who has gastrointestinal problems . My dog loves this dog food and has absolutely no problems whatsoever digesting it .
4 #### Will not order this again . I love the product but every single can was dented when it arrived . I trusted amazon to send me the product in good condition . Did n't happen . Very disappointed .
5 #### I have an ancient Japanese Chin who is blind and has no teeth . It has always been a challenge to get her to eat anything healthy . This has great ingredients and is reasonably prices . And she loves it !
5 #### And he 's going on two years now so he 's no puppy . But I keep this around for special treats because he loves it so much more than any adult food . He loved it as a puppy of course too and has developed nicely . Wet food is great for his coat and his digestion . Highly recommend .
5 #### This dog food met all my expectations and the dogs inhale it . Even after just a couple of weeks , every dog 's skin and coat had improved significantly . Ninety percent of the rescues I take in arrive with skin issues . Putting high quality canned food back into their diets is important for them .

5 #### My senior chihuahua has some stomach and intestinal problems so not every dog food is for her . My pal loves the Wellness adult dog foods which are in a pate form and has no problems whatsoever digesting them .
5 #### My dogs love this , and I love the size - it 's easy for me to use with regards to portions . I did n't know that a decent 6 oz size was out there . Also , this food is on the dogfoodadvisor.com as a 5 star food , so I also have the bonus of feeding my dogs a good meal . Yes , it is more expensive , but as they say - you get what you pay for , and I think this is worth it .
4 #### Kittens did n't love it , had to switch to a different brand .
2 #### I 've been buying Wellness wet canned food for my cat for a long time . My cat used to go bonkers for it , but for the past couple of months or so , the batches we receive have been inconsistent . We noticed that some of the food that we get comes dry and the cat does n't really want to eat it . At first we thought it was a fluke , but it started happening more . So we wo n't be getting this anymore , which is sad , because we 've been buying it for a long time .
5 #### Its a nylabone so no surprises there . I just really love the dinosaur shape
5 #### Strong and long lasting . ( 1 Rottweiler , 1 German Shepherd , and 1 Schnauzer )
3 #### The pate is a pretty good consistency . I used to feed this to my cats before I switched them to a grain - free diet .
4 #### I have one cat who will only eat pate . He does n't like the Salmon , however . Darn cats ! !
4 #### My senior citizen kitty is very finicky . I try to keep a vairiety of food on hand for him and Friskies is always a good bet . Being able to purchase it on Amazon is very handy as well , and cheaper !
4 #### Good quality Cat food , it does n't have a bunch of by products and fillers in it . There are actual pieces of vegetables in the food ( peas , potatoes , and carrots ) . Unfortunately my picky cats do n't like it . I do n't know if it 's because they do n't care much for pate , or what . But it 's no fault of the actual cat food .
4 #### I ve got three cats and they love how the chicken and liver formula tastes . I buy different brands to mix things up for them . They especially love maxcat . Very pleased
5 #### My cats love this Nutro Max Cat canned cat food . I actually split one can 3 ways . One can , I think would be , too much for one kitty . I do n't know why it 's so hard to find canned cat food that is n't pate style . This " chucks in gravy " style is much more palatable to my cats . My cats have favorites and there was only one they did n't prefer . Otherwise , they eat it right up .
5 #### My cats seem to like the Nutro Lite Adult canned food . I feed them this canned food twice a week and they clean their bowls . I highly recommend this product .
4 #### My cat Todd is in love with this flavor and I 'm so thankful I can order and subscribe to it . He 's a picky little hobbit that does n't enjoy pates so having This chunks in gravy option is a godsend . I only wish I could order the larger sizes ! They seem to never be available . If I can ever order the large gravy versions , I 'd be happy to add another star . Needless to say , I put a can of this down and it 's gone in minutes . Thanks for the good food !
5 #### This is all I will ever feed them now ! I used to feed them HILLS , but hard food is n't enough to sustain ANY animal . Also , hard food is all carbs . Also , ever feel that Grease in dry food ? That s aninal fat sprayed into it to make it more inticing . Too much dry food and not enough water can give your little friend balder issues ! I did a search and found this was one of the rated brandsas there are NO byproducts . When you hear , byproducts you 're giving your little friend everything BUT the chicken itself .
3 #### These Nylabones last a long time . Some reviewers say they can harm adult teeth , yet others say their dogs have been fine with them for years . My 22 - lb . Bison / poodle mix loves his Nylabone- BUT please be advised : when your dog reaches for the ( rather flat ) dinosaur , he 'll have a hard time grasping it , and his teeth will bring up carpet fibers while trying to do so . ( The chewed Nylabone pieces are sharp enough to do this . ) Best let your dog play with it on bare floor .
5 #### I 've bought these numerous times for my dog . He is an aggressive chewer .
5 #### My 1 yr old puppy loves her dinasors ! Long lasting and does n't break off . Easy to wash up after she 's been sitting in the dirt chewing away too .
5 #### Our new puppy loves her bone . Great for teething pups .
5 #### These toys are great ! ! I have a pit bull who is an aggressive chewer and these toys have lasted !
5 #### My cats love it and it keeps them healthy .
3 #### None of my cats liked it . It could be good if cats eat it . Not saying it is bad , just that my cats do n't like it . Maybe yours will . The company should sell single cans so no loss is taken if cats do n't eat it .
5 #### Meow- dank stuff , meowlow loves it . More energy sleep100%outt
5 #### My dogs love this , and I love the size - it 's easy for me to use with regards to portions . I did n't know that a decent 6 oz size was out there . Also , this food is on the dogfoodadvisor.com as a 5 star food , so I also have the bonus of feeding my dogs a good meal . Yes , it is more expensive , but as they say - you get what you pay for , and I think this is worth it .

Yes , it is more expensive , but as they say - you get what you pay for , and I think this is worth it .
1 #### The food used to scoop out like regular dog food now it 's like mush . But I will add that the dog still likes it . It just seems like someone mixed water into it . It 's kind of gross to spoon it out . And no , it 's not in a warm area . 74 degrees all day in ac home . This is the second case we got like this . This will be the last .
5 #### I have an 11 year old chihuahua who is a puppy mill rescue ; she was not rescued until just before her eighth birthday . My pal is on medication for a sensitive stomach ; she also has very few teeth with which to chew because they fell out from overbreeding . My dog loves Wellness dog food and she has no problem digesting it . Since this Wellness dog food is a pate my dog missing most of her teeth is not a problem in her eating it .
5 #### My cats love this food . Good quality ingredients . The right balance of gravy and chunks for their picky cat sensibilities .
5 #### Miss Fussy tummy likes this mix of chunks and gravy the very best of all we 've tried . I like to mix her up a bit with different brands , but this is the one that she always cleans the plate up with . Every time , no matter which of the flavors I get her .
5 #### My Cats love FRISKIES , just wish they offered the TASTY TREASURES & SAUCESATIONS versions ... ';- )
5 #### Having it delivered is wonderful ! It is difficult for me to haul heavy items in from the store and this is perfect for me ! Price is comparable to the store I shop also .
5 #### Well , I do n't love it personally , but my kitties do . This is a great buy for a mixed pack of classic Friskies flavors . I will purchase again !
5 #### all my dogs love these and they are great chew toys . Warning : they are like legos you do n't wanna accidentally step on them ....
4 #### my dog 's favorite toy . Caution : it hurts when she leaves it around and booby traps us into stepping on it !
2 #### Interesting idea , but my dog did n't really play with it .
3 #### Puppy did n't LOVE it , but gave it a little bit of attention . I bought this for an 8 month old miniature dachshund who has destroyed all of her stuffed toys and her Nylabone ' Flexichew ' toys . She 'd gotten a few teeth marks into the face . The rest of the body seems to be holding up well .
4 #### Cats did n't like gave it to the stray cats
4 #### I would n't know how good this tastes , but my five cats seem to really enjoy it ! The only downside is , because of the size of the chunks ( very big ) , I run through each can very fast . I 'd prefer if they were half the size . Otherwise though , I have no complaints !
1 #### My cats were not eat it . They took one lick and never went back .
2 #### My cat wo n't eat this . Ended up donating the case
3 #### my cat did not like it much , she finally ate it ...... but not like she will eat other cat foods
5 #### The kitten loves the Max Cat kitten foods more than anything ... She votes with her mouth !
5 #### Cats get most of their water through their food . This tends to help avoid kidney stones in domesticated cats . My cat is now alert , active , and normal weighted after leaving dry kibble behind .
5 #### My little lady loves this food and it is only 1 of two brands I use - my dog has petit mal seizures and has had them for many years - Had lots of them at first , wen ton medication which helped a bit but once I put her on food without chemical fillers and such she got much better - now only has them on rare occasions Ca n't prove a direct effect from the food but it sure seems to be a contributing factor to her having very few bouts . Besides she loves the product .
5 #### Wellness Senior is palatable and consistent in its formulation , unlike some other brands , whose formulation can vary widely from batch to batch . The protein level is exactly what my senior dogs , and all senior dogs , should have . I 'm happy that this product is available among the myriad of choices on the market nowadays . There are n't a lot of senior canned diets available .
5 #### I use two tablespoons of this receipe with Mercedes dry Wellness and she loves it and its good for her .
5 #### This is a good price for a good product . The venison seems to agree particularly well with my dog . I mix some into his dry food . Wellness is a respected brand , but I have seen prices vary quite a bit for the cans . One of my local pet food stores charges quite a bit more . The other charges about the same but does not , for some reason , carry the venison . It 's also available in lamb , fish , chicken , etc . I will buy it again .
5 #### I buy several of the Wellness formulations for my dogs and the chicken formulation for my cats . All of it is high quality food , palatable , and healthful . My dogs and cats love it . The fish and sweet potato is just another one of their good recipes that I trust and feed .
2 #### I really wanted to like this canned dog food . I love the wellness dry food and the puppy treats . Their ingredients are excellent and they consistently get great reviews for nutritional value in dog - food - review websites . My puppy loves the taste of this food . I use it mainly to stuff kongs . I sometimes freeze the stuff kongs so my puppy has to work harder at getting the food ( it keeps him busy and away from socks , shoes and other off limits items ! ) However , he gets a lot of gas , and it STINKS big time , my son labeled it " nuclear - grade " , so amazing that such a little puppy can assault the air quality in the room like that ! At first I thought it was only my puppy 's " issue " , but I fostered two other puppies for a weekend and after they ate this food , it had the same effect and same level of " potency " .. yucky .. Just waiting for my puppy to finish the 12 pack and I am looking to switch to another brand .
2 #### Made my cat very sick and constipated . Sometimes that will happen when switching him to a new food , but it clears up in a day or two . I went through 5 days and had to take him to the vet for an enema . He 's allergic to grains , nuts , and most filler crap . This must have some in it somewhere , otherwise he would have been able to go to the bathroom . Do n't buy if your cat has stomach issues with fillers . This is a bad product and WAY overpriced .
1 #### Despite claiming " New look , same great taste " , the formula for Wellness has changed , with the amount of phosphorus found in this food almost doubling , from 216 mg/100kcal to 382 mg/100kcal for the turkey pate . The increased phosphorous means that we ca n't use this food anymore ; it 's not safe for our elderly cat or our cat with kidney issues .
5 #### We have three cats of varying breeds and sizes . All of them prefer the PATE in the Friskies brand . They 've put weight on nicely with this .
1 #### TWICE I have received a tray of this product that contained cans so bashed in and even split open that I could n't use them .
5 #### One of Daisy 's Cat Rescue 's go to foods for our fosters and feral cats .
1 #### If this is for 12 cans at this outrageous cost it 's ridiculous . No , sorry . I have found a pack triple the size for 1/3 the cost . I was trying to find some items for a prime pantry box and came across this . It 's just a stupidly high price .
5 #### Our dogs love the dino chews ! We ordered two and got the same shape . Our dogs like the unique shape and bumps on the animals . We do keep these toys as supervise only so they do not over chew or cause damage to their teeth . As a bonus , the price can not be beat !
3 #### Not the dogs ' favorite toy but they chew on it sometimes .
5 #### Nylabones are the best for dogs that love to chew
5 #### I think these are our dog 's favorites ! They 're great for strong chewers and last a long time . It 's the toy that is always fought over when 1 of our 2 dogs bring it into the bed . These are well worth the money .
5 #### excellent product and great price bought all four flavors
4 #### The cats do love this . They love the meaty flavor better , but the raise hell if I 'm five minutes late laying out the bowls .
3 #### Normally fluids surrounding the pate when first opened has a gelatinous texture . These seem to be more watery . possibly seconds ? nutritionally most likely not much different . maybe something in the shipping changed the consistency . they eat it regardless . due to one of the flavors they will not eat i will go back to " cherry picking " at the store .
5 #### Food went to a county shelter , I 'm sure the cats loved it .
5 #### Good price on this . I normally pay around 50 cents per can on sale , so $ 6.65 for 12 cans with it being delivered to my door was a decent deal . I see it 's currently unavailable and listed at $ 45 , which of course is silly .
5 #### Excellent price with flavors that my cats love ! Will continue to purchase .
5 #### I order this often for my cats great price no shipping awesomeness
4 #### The kittens go up and down with this . Sometimes they love it , and sometimes they do n't . I have n't yet figured out what the determining factor is !
1 #### I have been feeding this to my cats for years and even had it on subscribe and save . They have recently watered down the recipe and called it " pate " and charging more . I am cancelling my subscription and will no longer buy this brand cat food . Out of integrity !
5 #### Was n't sure what to expect with this food , but it looks and smells good , and my 2 mutts love it ! They also have been used to eating canned pumpkin as a snack ( which is an infallible way to give them pills by the way , as they do n't even question what 's in the " glob " ) I 've only tried this flavor of Wellness , but would definitely buy it again . Love Amazon to - my - door service , ca n't beat it !
5 #### She licks her plate clean and is constantly going back to see if there is any more . Always licking the empty bowl
4 #### I am very happy with this product . the ingredients are ones that I know and understand . My dog loves it . I actually bought treats from this brand cause I was happy with the ingredeints
5 #### My dogs loves wellness food , and I love it since it is consistently rated highly among dog food . I use this as a mix - in in her dry food ( wellness core ) . Since I do n't use much , it can get dry very soon ( I put it in the fridge after opening with very tight cap ) , I will buy the smaller 6 oz cans in the future .
5 #### Sometimes my pup wo n't eat so I put some of the wellness in his food and he eats it . Has a smell similar to tuna however not as strong , would recommend
5 #### My boy loves the lamb / sweet potato . It 's been suggested that dogs should eat the variety of food their ancestors were feed . Since Shetland Sheepdogs were breed where lamb , potatoes and fish are abundant they should be feed those foods .
5 #### I thought it would be a pack of four like what is pictured
5 #### Pit bull can not destroy ! She is a maniac with toys and this keeps her busy . She has n't lost interest . It does get pokey plastic points on it after some time but she does n't seem to mind and has not lost interest .
5 #### Puppy seems to really enjoy this ; I have many nylabones so my dogs do n't get interested in furniture legs and the like !
5 #### The pup loves the different shapes over regular " bone " shaped chews . The dino shape lets him grip it better . They last maybe 4 or 5 months for my dog who is a medium chewer .
5 #### My dog absolutely loves these Bones ! They hurt really bad when you accidentally step on them tho ! ;)
5 #### My dog loves these . They seem to last quite a long time and were a great price for the size of the chew , plus who can resist the dinosaur shapes ! :)
4 #### Dogs love it but if they really work at it they can bit small pieces off .
4 #### my kitties only like turkey and salmon .. They do n't do too well on the mixed grill ( get stomach issues after eating it and do n't like it too much to begin with) .. but this package forces me to get all .. I wish they had individual packages of 12 or 24 per flavor . I have a hard time finding the turkey one in the stores .. they usually run out very quickly .. seems popular !
5 #### Great to have this combo with three different flavors . Cats love the taste . One can goes a long way to feed the clan we have .
5 #### Only food my picky Siamese can eat that does n't make him sick . Great for sensitive stomachs .
5 #### My cats LOVE this stuff ! ! Give your 's a thrill and buy some for them today !
4 #### Have two cats . One cat eats it , the other wo n't after vomiting it a few times . Not sure why that is except might be due to the age of one cat ( 18 ) .
5 #### My cats love this food . It 's their all - time fav .
5 #### Until Dec 21,2016 I had 2 cats .. one was 10 and the other is almost 16 . Due to urethra problems we had to say bye to Levi he was the 10 yr old . I never experienced such a pain as having to make that decision , however I also was not prepared for how Wendy ( 16 yr old ) would take it . Now I have to add that these 2 just tolerated each other they were NOT BEST FRIENDS . She went from eating everything and anything until Levi moved on . NOTHING ... NADA ... she lost over 2 lbs in 2 wks I went thru Nutro and many others for months ... in the trash . Then I went back to Nutro , she ate it ... I ordered this awesome deal and she devoured it . Thank goodness . Her fur is super soft / shinny and after almost 8 mos she is finally adjusting to being the only cat She still sits and looks at his box
4 #### Cat likes , so that 's an automatic win since he 's so picky and also allergic to a lot of different formulas . I docked one star because I received a recall notice after buying , which is always a little frightening . Thankfully , it did n't include the dates of the cans I bought . Still , it 's one of the better deals for grain - free wet food .
5 #### Alpo Snaps have been the Most Favorite treat according to our 6 dogs ( they have tried a lot of others - just for fun and variety , but they always were happy when we had Alpo Snaps to offer ! ) This was also true with other fine pups we 've had before . It seems to have been one of the treats without controversy and one which has had good ingredients .
5 #### My senior boy , Buddy loves this food , anything to make him happy . It has a good consistency and mixes well with dry food .
5 #### We buy offline because it is cheaper than the store , and the store does n't have the multiple flavors that we can get off line . Definitely keeps our dog from getting bored with his food .
5 #### Bought this for a malnurished puppy we adopted . He loves it ! ! ! ! He eats the whole can ! ! He quickly gained the weight he needed to gain to be " healthy weight " with this food . I will definitely buy again .
4 #### ... but I find it too sticky out of the fridge . It smells good , and it agrees with my dogs . I believe it 's good quality dog food . I only mind that the stuff left in the can turns too hard after the can was in the fridge . Small change ....
5 #### My dogs love it and I love them , so it works out wonderfully ! Frequent purchaser of this product & would recommend ! Great service too !
4 #### but it 's not totally inspiring for her . that being said , she 's a DOG and eats it . we do n't service the animals like we service our kids .
5 #### My 16 year old dog was diagnosed with pancreatitis back in January . After lots of treatment and a prescription diet , he 's made a full recovery . My vet recommended Wellness brand , and he loves it ! The biggest problem I 've had with ordering vs picking up in the store is I 've had a few damaged cans ; only one that was so dented I had to throw it away . I 'd highly recommend the food .
5 #### Our large pit bull mix has definitely been known to be cranky and picky when it comes to any pet store bought dry or wet canned dog food . He enjoys every one of the wellness varieties canned food . I find the time invested of getting a few cases at the usual local pet stores is both time consuming and costly so our family really loves the often free shipping and easy order program here on amazon . We like to stock up for a few months so we do n't have to bother .
5 #### This toy is a huge hit with both of our cats . They love to bat the ball around and around , and it keeps them entertained for a long time . I recommend adding the grooming arch , sold separately .
5 #### This is such a great toy ! ! The cats love it ! ! I need to research if I can get a replacement for the middle once my cats have shredded the scratch pad .
2 #### The dogs love this toy . I would have given it more stars , however , since having it the dogs have begun coughing . My guess is that little pieces of plastic are being consumed and scratching their throat . Just in case , I am taking it away from them . If your dog is an aggressive chewer , I do not recommend this .
5 #### My dogs love the dental dinosaurs . I was very pleased to receive this item so quickly . Thank you .
5 #### Belgium Malinois ( german sheppard k9 unit breed ) usually destroys " tough " toys within an hour . Our dinosaur lasted weeks and she did n't get tired of it . Great for the toughest puppies .
5 #### My two cats eat this food like there 's no tomorrow . I bought the chicken selection and they lick the bowl clean . This is un heard of especially with my older cat who is a gravy eater . She licks up all the gravy and leaves the food , but not with this brand , she scarfed it all down ! The best part , no intestional upset with the change in diet . I 'd like to think it 's because of the food , but I have had my cats on a daily dose of ProViable for a few months and I think it makes the difference . Either way , I 'm glad I tryed this brand , it seems like quality food that they both like .
2 #### Meh . It was what my little one came to me eating so I had to wean him off of it . I do n't like the chemicals & preservatives they put in this food .
4 #### My cats go crazy for this stuff . Even the picky guy gets pushy when I am trying to open the can and dump it out . Then I have stand by because he has a habit of snarfing down his food so quickly when it is one that he likes that he can barf it back up . Luckily these are just the right portions , I am mean and make my cats split a can for a treat in morning and evening .
4 #### A little pricey , but the cats like it and it 's better for them than the cheaper brands .
5 #### Wellness is a company I trust . My felines love it .
4 #### My geriatric cat LOVED the senior formula . The only reason I stopped the subscription was she had kidney disease and was prescribed Hill 's k / d. It was the clear winner of an extensive grain - free taste test that included Weruva , Spot 's Stew , Blue Buffalo , and others I forget . My only complaint is many of the cans had dents . This did not affect the quality or her willingness to eat it , but is obviously not a good thing . The opposite happened with my kitten . None of the cans were dented , but she often walked away from it and begged for something else . I know it 's not the chicken - she likes everything else with chicken . She does like the dry version of it though . Wellness is a good brand , just not what my kitty likes to eat .
1 #### something is not right with the case of this kitten food i got recently , kittens barely want to eat it except for a liitle of it in the AM when they are starving ! ! one kitten whose stools finally firm up after a bad reaction to being dewormed , is now back to having diarrhea after we started using cans from this last case . other kitten who has had no loose stools whatsoever , started having looser ones yesterday and tonight had a really loose one with a bloody streak . clearly this food is causing digestive / etc issues , plus kittens do n't even want to chow down on it like they were doing with previous case we bought like 1 1/2 yrs ago that we still had some cans of .. * * after reading other reviews just now , i saw the 7W can code comments and our cans start with that code !
5 #### Perfect product . It is exactly as advertised , and my dogs love it .
5 #### This is a treat my dog always gets for desert after lunch , so I know what I was ordering . Am very happy , especially because it was not only boxed , but also wrapped in plastic to avoid bug infestation .
5 #### Another favorite treat of my finicky pets who turn their noses up on almost all dog treats .
5 #### My dogs love these snacks . I have a 16 year old dog who had to have many of his teeth removed - he eats these painlessly . They just ca nt get enough . I store them in the fridge as where I live is quite humid and the biscuits can get damp and moldy . Other than that I think they 're brilliant .
5 #### Actually you 're getting five woofs from my mutt who totally loves them and has been faithful to the Alpo snaps for all of her five years . they are also aerodynamic and depending on the wind can be thrown almost 20 yards and she always catches them on - the - fly . they serve a valuable purpose as thank you tokens , and training aids .
5 #### My Pug loves these . They are great for dogs that enjoy chewing .
5 #### My dog loves these Nylabone dinosaurs ! They seem to last forever , no matter how much she chews on them . We have several of the T - Rexes and a Brontosaurus , but have n't gotten the Stegosaurus yet ( you get a random one ) . I see a lot of reviews about these breaking their dog 's teeth , but luckily , that has n't been a problem for us , and in fact , the vet just told me at her yearly appointment that my pup has very healthy teeth ! Just do n't step on these - ouch !
3 #### The dog chewed on this for a little bit , then lost interest in it . Part of it could be that he 's turned 2 and does n't need the hard toy for teething issues . but he did play with it for 4 - 5 months , it 's long lasting .
3 #### Dog only chewed it couple times for a couple minutes . He lost interest fast .
5 #### I own a 15 year old dog and was only recently introduced to this Wellness brand when I adopted two cats . The shelter highly recommended this brand for both dogs and cats , and it is what they feed all their shelter guests . I purchased some for my dog and she loves it , gobbles it right down . Wellness comes in a variety of recipes and while my dog prefers this version which is finally chopped and minced , Wellness does carry a version that contains whole ingredients , chunks of meat , peas etc . But my older lady simply likes this version .
5 #### My new puppy loves this dog food . I was told to mix dry food with wet food and this brand was recommended . It is grain free . My vet told me o start with a grain free diet for my pup . He loves it and so do I !
5 #### My boston terrier puppy eats this food mixed with the dry version . She gobbles it all up . The primary chicken base is good for dogs .
5 #### My 9 year old boston terrier has eaten this along with the dry version for several years . She loves it .
4 #### Good quality dog food . I mix with the dry Wellness food and my Shih - zhu gobbles it up . I should note that he is a very picky eater . I have to say , however , that he prefers the lamb to the turkey .
5 #### No by - products , fur - kids love it , healthy , minimum amount of ingredients - just an all around awesome food . Wellness ! Not one recall yet !
5 #### I have had my dogs on Wellness dog food for around two years now . By far it is one of the best canned dog foods out there . All of my dogs do really well on the dog food . It is all natural . I purchase wellness products and probably would not switch to anything else . I purchased a case of the canned dog food , normally I purchase by the can , but decided to purchase by the case . If you are looking for all natural Wellness is the way to go . It is also good for dogs with allergies . No garbage in this food . Highly recommend the product . Well worth every penny .
4 #### I used this to add flavor to my dogs dry food and he loves it ! I put about two tablespoons in it and add some warm water ... mix it up till it forms a gravy and he eats every last bit of it ..........
5 #### The price is right on the money . I send this to my local shelter as a donation and they seem to love it there .
5 #### Our cats really enjoy these . Reasonable price as well . Will buy again .
5 #### These little guys of mine are finicky . I think they eat better than I do .
1 #### I purchased a case of this food , my three cats ' favorite , a few months ago with three other cases of other varieties . I had an experience with damaged cans in all three of those cases , two cases had cans which were so badly damaged they were leaking all over the other cans in the boxes . Amazon quickly replaced those two cases , which was very nice , except I just opened the last replacement box , and the same problem , broken cans with such a terrible odor that I could not possibly even use the cans that were not broken . I saved the info from the bottom of the cans , BEST BY AUG 2017 , 52371161 LA3751659 . Since my cats have been Friskies fans for a long time , I will continue to purchase the product , but I 'm willing to pay more to get cans that are sealed properly and safe to use , from my local store .
5 #### Came very well packaged and in a timely manner . Both the dog and I are thrilled .
5 #### When one dog gets his medicine hidden in liver treats , these are great so the others wo n't feel neglected . I 'm a sap for these family members .
5 #### My dogs are crazy for these . I give them several kinds of snacks , but they prefer these over the bones .
5 #### My cat tends to be the finicky eater . Nutro is able to provide a nutritious recipe that my cat loves . His coat is so silky and soft .
5 #### What can I say ? I believe Nutro Max to be a nutritious cat food and Lola and Springsteen picked the flavor . Its the only one they 'll eat every day ; any other flavor they wo n't eat consistently , but Turkey and Chicken Liver they 'll eat every day , twice a day . And they need cat food with texture - the smooth stuff they wo n't eat . So it 's a big dewclaws up !
5 #### In the max cat brand - this is one of Cammy favorites
3 #### Our dog loves to chew these things but they get sharp as he chews them and they make his gums bleed . We only let him chew when we can watch him , and they do n't last very long before we have to throw them away .
5 #### Love nylabones for my powerful chewers : a 100 lb Rottweiler German Shepherd mix and a 75 lb Lab Husky mix
5 #### Never would have thought the dogs would love this but someone purchased one as a donation for the foster dogs in our rescue around Christmas when they came in green and red . This is paws down every dogs favorite thing to chew on . It is carried outside , it is washed in washing machine , and they still love it ! Great for nervous chewers and do n't have to worry about choking on pieces chewed off . We keep these on hand and even have them on our rescue groups wishlist !
3 #### This is a high quality cat food and my cat really likes it . But . Wellness produces in multiple factories and depending on which factory it comes from , it can be really soupy and gross . I though they 'd fixed the problem , but the last two cases I 've ordered from Amazon are soupy again . They 've also been shipping dented cans , including one that was entirely punctured . I wo n't order it from here again unless they can assure me it will be the regular kind . I mean , who wants to have to ship back a case of cat food ?
1 #### They have changed the recipe on this and it no longer contains the Sweet Potatoes , Squash , Zucchini , or Blueberries . My cat wo n't eat it now . It 's the only thing I could ever get her to eat . They also added a fish oil which ruins the smell and flavor even more . It used to have a pleasant aroma and now it just smells like cheap canned cat food . Thanks Wellness .
5 #### I 've had my kitten on a mix of this kitten food , and Fromm dry kitten food . So far , so good . She very much looks forward to the times during the day when I give her wet food . I do have multiple packs of the 7w foods , and they have n't been a problem for her . My dog also got into some of it that I had left out , and no problem . I will continue to buy this :) .
2 #### I have been feeding my 17 year old bichon Wellness for about three years . After the first year , people told me he was looking / acting healthier than ever . Knowing I could get it shipped by Amazon has been so helpful and the price is good . Lately , however , I have been receiving NUMEROUS crushed cans within a delivery . The whole case is NOT damaged . The cardboard is perfectly intact , and the plastic wrapping is pristine . When I start to take out the cans , however , I find ones that are so severely damaged , I would NEVER use them ! I must admit , I have NOT contacted Amazon about this issue , but I will . If they get their act together on the mangled cans , I will give this a five star rating !
5 #### My dog is pretty senstive to certain foods . So I tried this out and not only did he eat it all but he did n't have any issues afterwards . It 's made with quality ingredients so I know he 's getting the best .
5 #### My dog ( 2 yrs old ) loves this mixed in the evening with Wellness Super5 Mix ( a 6 oz can plus a cup of dried -- she 's 37 lbs ) . Never any fussiness , and it 's kept her health and coat healthy since I rescued her a year ago . I highly recommend this brand . See what works for your pup .
5 #### I 'm very careful about what I feed my puppy and this food was highly recommended by our vet . It 's one of the few holistic and natural wet dog foods on the market that is readily available in most pet stores . We mix it with Orijens puppy food and our pug - zhu mix absolutely loves it . The price is very good on Amazon too .
5 #### My 12 year old Golden / Lab mix loves it . She was on Wellness dry until her teeth started getting sensitive . At her age she needs nutritious food to keep her healthy , not all the fillers that are in the cheep dog food . I use Wellness for all my pets diets .
5 #### Wellness brand speaks for itself . I buy it along with some other brands , to mix it up for the doggies . They love Wellness products .
3 #### Our dogs luv sweet potato treats , but they were n't crazy about this food . Maybee they are just too picky . It 's worth a try .
5 #### It took months to find a food that my old Staffie could eat and not be very sick . He 'd lost 7 lbs when I found this . He 's so much happier and has his energy back . I even had tried making his food from various dog recipes online . He could n't keep those down either . This stuff is awesome .
4 #### Our dogs absolutely love these ! They do tend to get a little sharp after they have been chewed on for a while , which can be a hazard when you accidentally step on it . They are fairly durable for our two strong chewers and get a lot of use .
4 #### The larger cans were a better deal ! Still my cats ' favorite food !
5 #### My picky senior cats love the pate variety of wellness canned food . I will continue to purchase .
5 #### My cats love this , it appears to be one of the better wet cat foods ( not as full of processed carbs or sketchy meats )
4 #### I believe this to be a good choice for canned cat food
5 #### One kitten gobbles it up , the other will just lick the fat . It does the job .
5 #### Cat only eats wet , Nutro is one of the best foods out there for animals . You ca n't beat the price of Nutro max .
2 #### This product actually made my cat fatter . He loved it , but it made him fatter . He weighed less and was at a steady lower weight on his other food .
3 #### The food has gone up 2 dollars a case in less than a year and there are less morsels and more juice ; looks more like soup than food . I buy 20 + cases a month so it is n't just an occasional issue . Started noticing an increase in the food consumption and weighed the portions , less there than before . Asked the question at Nutros site and never received a response . Cats love it , but will be looking for a new food that 's not soup .
5 #### My dog really likes this food and she can be a picky eater . I really like this food because I know it 's one of the better ones out there for her .
5 #### I love , love , love Wellness products and I 'm happy to get this at a great price plus free shipping right to my door - saves me a trip to the pet store . The product arrived in great shape .
5 #### The only issue I have and very frustrated is several cans come damaged , The strange thing is the package comes intact without no damages . Several cans inside are damaged which tends to make me believe thety were damaged prior to boximg for shipment . I pay good money and expect good product .
1 #### First let me say I get boxes from Amazon every day , including 12 - packs of other Wellness canned food . I virtually never have trouble with damaged goods . This Wellness food looks great , so I ordered some . It arrived well packaged and the outer box was fine , but 4 cans were badly dented on the top or bottom seam . These were bad enough I did n't trust the integrity of the seal so I returned them to Amazon for an exchange ( Amazon service was incredible of course ) . The replacement 12 - pack had 5 cans that were BADLY DENTED on the top or bottom seal also , so I returned the 12 - pack . I left packaging feedback although they seemed adequately packaged and my other Wellness food show up fine . It makes me think they get dented before shipping , hence this review as that makes it a problem with the product in my mind . If they would resolve this problem I would like to try this product , but I guess I 'll never know as I wo n't order it again .
5 #### This food has been invaluable in keeping weight on my elderly dog . It is high in calories and easily digested so it is good for an older dog with a sensitive stomach who is not a big eater . The wellness core puppy has also worked well . Before this , I had tried more than a dozen foods unsuccessfully . This food is more economical than it seems too because the high caloric content means you can feed less . Yes , I know it is puppy food . But like many things in life , we come full circle as we get older .
4 #### I do n't think any dog will love the taste , but this food seems to maintain good health and solid , consistent stool in my senior dog . To make it more palatable , I garnish it with salmon fish oil made for pets , boiled eggs and other treats .
5 #### I personally do n't love it but my 2 puppies love it and my 1 old chi also eats it more than his other senior food .
3 #### Puppy ate it at first ... now often wo n't bother with it , even when I mix with real meat . Disappointed and still struggling with how to gt him to enjoy his food .
5 #### I noticed an annoying trend that was making me rather frustrated with our furry little family members . They were lapping up the gravy of their usual Friskies wet food , and leaving a LOT of the actual food to just dry out and go nasty . Why ? I 'm not 100 % sure , but I 'm not exactly raking in the dough to have so much of their food go to waste ! So I figured Pate might be the answer . Now I 'll tell you , I hate the way pate looks . It just looks ... strange to me . It 's like moist spam that is easily mashable , and I do n't really like SPAM . So that tells you how that went . Thank goodness I finally made the switch to pate ! Now the cats are actually EATING their wet food instead of lapping up gravy and ignoring about 30 % of their food . Even my two picky eater boys eat this , and a fair bit ! Which is good because they 're on the thin side and could use the weight gain . :) Our 8 cats give Friskies Pate 16 ( total ) paws up !
5 #### I got these for my older cats who had problems chewing hard food . I must say that they are very vocal now about expecting their meals . My cat with stomach issues has not thrown up since I switched them to this . I alternate shreds with pate and they are quite happy . This food also makes sneaking medicine to them easier .
5 #### Purchased this product for my sister 's cats since she was too sick to leave the house . It arrived very quickly and the price was great for so many variety cans . Definitely will be ordering it again .
5 #### I bought this when I ordered the Ultra Premium Lamb and Rice dog food from Natural Balance and did n't really think my dog ( extremely picky ) would like them . She loves them and her special treat for retrieving the morning paper and depositing it in my hand is one of these -- she 's a 5 year old standard Poodle and I attribute her absolutely healthy nature ( never sick ) to her dogfood . Try these - they are a good size and very satisfying for the dog as well .
5 #### These chew toys do an exceptional job of keeping my dogs occupied while keeping their teeth absolutely clean ! I 'm almost ready for another order or larger chews , if they 're available .
2 #### I have two dogs , an Australian Shepherd mix and an American Bulldog mix . One is a more " aggressive " chewer than the other . I always give chews and bones while supervised . Both of them started to make quick work of these , and within minutes one of my dogs was hacking up the tiny shredded pieces of this chew . It fell apart so quickly and easily ! I would not personally buy these again .
4 #### My puppy does n't normally like chewing on such hard toys like these , but he seems to enjoy these more than the white nylabone bones . He is n't a huge fan of it because he ca n't eat it and it does make a sound , but he still chews it now and then . I do n't know how much it 's helping his teeth but I can only hope it is .
5 #### Our dogs love these Dino chew toys . Have replaced twice and will keep buying them .
3 #### I love Dino 's and thought this was so cute . Plus my puppy is a crazy nutty chewer and destroys every toy we 've gotten him within 24 hours . So I figured this would last . But he has no interest in it . Wah . Maybe it 's too hard and he 'll like it in a few months . I hope !
5 #### I only feed my cats Max Cat wet food . They love it and are waiting by their food bowl every morning and evening for it !
4 #### My cat practically inhales this food and then asks for more . Its easily her favorite canned food , but I tend not to give it to her often because she seems to be hungry an hour after eating it . I think it might be because it has a couple percents less protein compared to the other canned food I give her .
3 #### I bought this food for my foster kitties every time I give it to them they get the runs and are hungry again . Will not use it again .
1 #### Sniff .. sniff ... lick ... lick .. meh .... then walk away . Flush money down to the toilet
5 #### My cat has been eating this wet canned cat food for many years and we have never had any issues . Sometimes we switch to sliced or minced but we always stick with Wellness . Love that it is grain free .
5 #### Des loves this turkey . He 's more of a seafood guy but this turkey is inhaled every single time . He digests it very well . Will buy again .
5 #### Our two 7 - month old kittens absolutely love this food ! They literally go crazy for it . Buying in bulk on Amazon is super convenient and cheaper than buying at a local pet store . My only issue is that lately the food has been more watery than usual and appears to be not as much food . Has anyone else noticed this as well ? Hopefully Wellness can work to fix this issue as it 's otherwise a great quality product .
5 #### We have a senior cat who has been having issues with colitis and is allergic to fish ( sort of ironic ) so our Vet suggested we try the Wellness Kitten brand since it does not contain any fish products in it to help maintain his weight . I have purchased this several times in store and on Amazon and have not had any issues with quality control like others have mentioned but am keeping an eye out . Our cat , who is very finicky , loves the food and is tolerating it very well . Hopefully with the higher nutrition he will put back on some of the weight he has lost and be feeling better soon .
5 #### My 15 1/2 year old cat loves this food .
4 #### I have a dog who is on a purine restricted diet and as a consequence should not eat meat products . She can have a little whitefish now and again , and she loves sweet potatoes , so this food is a winner for her . I 'll put up with the stink because she does well on this food and enjoys it ; my other dog , without any medical issues , enjoys it too . The food is n't cheap but good quality stuff never is . Delivery was prompt and it beat having to haul the case of food home myself !
4 #### My Shiba Inu was tested and found to be allergic to a number of environmental allergens - the vet recommended he also be put on a hypoallergenic dry dog food but despite its ' high cost , my dog would smell his food and walk away . So , in desperation , I ordered a duck and potato canned dog food - at first , when I added it to his dry dog food , he would eat his food but by the time he had gone through a couple of cans , he started to ignore his food again . So when I looked on Amazon , I found this Wellness brand and decided to give it a try . The shipment arrived yesterday so I opened a can and of course , my dog came over to check it out . This one is very wet and dark in color ( compared to the other canned dog food which seemed to have a lot of potato ) . It smelled OK and my dog agreed because he waited until I prepared his dinner and ate it all . Will have to see if he still wants to eat this in a few weeks .
5 #### Certainly the quality of this dog food is very good . The Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato is by far their favorite canned food . It has protein content of 37 % and a fat level of 23 % ( which is a little higher fat level than I would like but ... ) . I use an independant dog food advisory site when considering any dog food I buy and the Wellness canned dog food was rated a 4.5 ( out of 5 ) stars and was highly recommended . I feed my dogs dry food ( consistently the same ) , but for their evening meal I split a can for my 2 large dogs . The bottom line for me is it is a very good quality dog food and my dogs love it .
5 #### This 12 - pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store . It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base . It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener , so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh . Great deal , and now I do n't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans . I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day . I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food , but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they do n't have too much of a problem .
4 #### sometimes i will mix this with dry food for my puppy , the smell is good , my puppy loves eating it(although she loves every type and brand i gave her ) . she does not have any bad reactions after eating it , though no particular good ones neither .
5 #### This food has a lot of vitamins and our baby loves it . When I open each can it smells really good . The food is soft and easy to handle . Great , healthy choice for any puppy . The cans are small enough even for our 3 lb baby so she has her food fresh all the time .
5 #### Bought one to try to stop some fighting over the existing one in the house . Stegosaurus is super popular around here and now there are two thank heavens
5 #### We have at least 6 of these and our 3 dogs share them . It 's one of their favorites . ( 2 Golden Retrievers and one grouchy old mixed breed )
2 #### My dog loved this thing but after some consistent use I noticed blood on the toy . I read other reviews complaining about dental issues and decided to throw it away .
5 #### These are the best brand of dog toys . My EB has not been able to destroy these ! !
2 #### My cat Sophie refuses to touch the cheese and turkey combination . She only tolerates the beef and chicken shreds . Maybe your cat has a different palate but i 'll have to pass on this one in the future
5 #### Great product , delivered promptly . I would highly recommend this vendor and product .
5 #### Do n't know did n't taste them , the cats love them so I took their word for it ! ! lol
5 #### Our cat is older and the pate is easier for her to eat , which she does with gusto . A great bargain too .
4 #### My cat is a bit picky . He wo n't eat pate and likes his food shredded or in bits . This 3 flavor variety was perfect for him . He likes all three flavors and enjoys the consistency . It is n't filled with the absolute best ingredients but I asked my vet and he said this brand was fine for my 8 year old cat and to also give him a supplement to be sure he gets all he needs . He 's healthy and active . He does have a sensitive stomach so I have to give him only half of a can at a time or else he will eat the whole can and promptly throw it all up . If I give him less , he keeps it down fine . That is n't an issue with just this brand or variety of canned food - it is with all canned food . He overeats and ca n't keep his food down so I feet him smaller meals a couple of times a day and leave his dry food out and all is well . The price was good for this case and it was a lot easier than going to the store to buy it . I have just reordered another case .
1 #### 12.00 for 12 cans is NOT a good deal . Is this a mistake ?
5 #### These are very durable for an aggressive chewer , the only problem is them are a bit heavy so may be a bit hard for a smaller dog to carry around . They seem to satisfy a dogs chewing needs , I like to use these instead of rawhide because of the problems it can cause for dogs .
1 #### I purchased one of these dinos for my Chi on recommendation from his " teacher " at the doggy school where he attends activity classes . My dog is a heavy chewer and he manages to destroy most rubbery toys many of which claim to last forever but do n't . This product is rock hard and while the dog was having a good go at it , a huge chunk splintered off and when I was about the take it away from him I found smaller pieces lying on the carpet . I threw it out ! Maybe I got a dud but from other reviews here I assume this toy is just not good quality and would not recommend it to other dog owners :(
5 #### After destroying one too many " indestructible " dog toys , this has become the go to for my lab mix . Keeps her occupied for weeks on end
5 #### Got it for my puppy last year and we still have it . Although it is not his favorite , it is a good value and backup chew toy .
5 #### My little French bulldog loves to clean her teeth on these fun dental chews . Nice price for me too . A lot cheaper than the stores .
5 #### As a newly adopter of a one year old , I tried certain foods with not much success . My dog loves this food , and I do too , as she eats well and healthy .
5 #### Gave to my girl pup because she was getting used to people food and would n't eat .. I was feeding her sporadically to get her hungry and she was just losing weight ... Gave this to her mixed with the puppy dry from Wellness and she went to it and ate every last piece . Good stuff a great relief .
5 #### I have been involved in dog rescue for many years . I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life . The vet recommended this ( in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures , including yogurt ! ) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog . You 'd think a starving dog would eat anything , but often times they will not . I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month . Wellness and Nutro canned were the only " dog foods " I could get him to eat . But he did gain weight steadily , was able to wean off ' human food ' , and did very well . After gaining 20 lbs , he was adopted by a wonderful family . When you need the best , any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend .
5 #### I 've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it . She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish . I would give it 5 stars , except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size , and it has that room - filling reek that most canned dog foods have ( which my dog loves , but I hate ) . She has not had any digestive issues with the food , and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey , and the following three are vegetables . I can actually see the sweet potato in the food . My dog does n't have any food allergies , but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey , lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods . As long as they keep making this , I 'll keep buying it .
5 #### I love this brand . If you go to their website , sign up for their newsletters . They 'll send you $ 3.00 off coupons every couple of months or so . No so helpful when purchasing through amazon but helpful if you have a local store with Amazon similar pricing like I do ;) My dog loves this food . I use a spoonful in his dry food every night with some warm water to make it a little soupy for him . I like the ingredients , the way his coat looks , how he NEVER has bad breath or dog farts . Ever .
5 #### WE ENJOY FEEDING OUR DOGS THIS GREAT FOOD AND IT IS NICE TO KNOW THAT IT ISN'T FILLED WITH FILLERS OR BY - PRODUCTS , WHATEVER THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE!I KNOW WE DON'T THINK BY - PRODUCTS ARE SOMETHING THAT BELONGS IN OUR PETS FOOD.I BELIEVE BY - PRODCTS ARE SOMETHING LEFT OVER AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN PROCESSED ! I LIKE THE IDEA THAT WE ARE FEEDING OUR ANIMALS FOOD GRADE MEALS THAT ARE GOOD FOR THEM . HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
5 #### this food is great but I suggest you just buy one can first , too make sure your dog likes it . ( because it is expensive , but ... your dog is worth it
4 #### Wish the little cans were bigger . The pull tab is convenient , but the remaining ridge around the edge after you pull off the top catches food . I would prefer to pull , dump , and be done . Instead I have to scrape and fiddle with the food with a spoon to get all the stuff out . Meanwhile the cat is yowling .. I liked the bigger cans , but apparently Amazon ran out of those . The food itself is just fine , the cat eats it and he 's healthy having eaten only this food for three years and more . I just do n't like the packaging .
1 #### Do not order this food ! There is a serious quality control problem . Some cans have very little food and are oxidized . Other cans are completely overstuffed . What a rip off !
5 #### I believe this food is the most healthy canned food my cat will eat regularly . He prefers some types that have the regular grains , etc . and not as good ingredients such as the veggies here , I like him to have a better quality and this seems to be the one !
1 #### This is second and last case to be ordered of Max Cat . Two adult cats who would not eat this product even when leaving out overnight as their hunger grew . After half of first case went down disposal , donated other half to Good Will . This case , different flavor , same thing , only 3/4 's of case going to Good Will . Only other food receiving same response was Natural Balance after bought out by non - pet friendly company while claiming same recipe . Corporate greed equals Wall Street 's .
5 #### Nutro Max with duck chunks is the only wet canned food my cat will eat . So that 's what she gets . If she is happy , I 'm happy .
5 #### My picky cats wo n't eat some foods and get tired of other foods they start out liking . However , they love this brand / flavor and have continued to enjoy it for quite some time now .
5 #### These dinosaurs are the perfect size for my Boston Terrier . She is a hard chewers and these toys last !
5 #### Definitely my dogs favorite of his nylabones . Definitely recommended . It is especially unique an interesting for a dog to explore with its mouth . Very painful to step on in the middle of the night though ... (as are many of the nylabones )
3 #### Well made , and I do like Nylabone products . Only our dogs wo n't have anything to do with it . I think perhaps geared more towards a chewer , that really is aggressive , and ours are not .
5 #### These are great chews for dogs and puppies . Both my older dog and puppy enjoy chewing on them . They have lasted quite a bit of time .
5 #### My dog loves this dog food and it 's the first food she ate when we adopted her from the Humane Society . Why mess with a good thing ?
5 #### Some cans were dented , not a big deal . Only harder to open with can opener . Food seemed fresh . No problems ... dog likes it
5 #### I have bought this two times for my cats so far . They love it and I love the variety choices they get out of it . Food smells good and is soft for them to eat .
5 #### My 4 cats have been eating this flavor for years and they love it !
5 #### Good quality kitten food . It is approved by the veterinary association that recommends healthy cat foods . My cat enjoys eating this food .
5 #### Moving 6 month kitten to cat food . SO far she 's chowed down the chicken faster than the kitten mix ( same brand ) . like most brands cat 1/2 price per oz .
5 #### My cat became ill and The Vet told me to stop feeding her normal cat food . My 17 year old cat seems to like and tolerates it much better . The price is expensive for me , though .
5 #### It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner , so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food . What I liked about it was the lack of by - products and cereals . Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls . It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores . I count on Amazon for the best products .
3 #### This is one of four or five varieties of Wellness canned food my dog has tried . At first she seemed to like it , and she ate it well . After a couple of packs(12 cans ) she refused to eat it at all . This was not the only flavor she was given during this time , but she knew when it was part of her meal . I do n't know what happened , but it is not on our menu any longer .
5 #### I am the companion to a small dog of unknown age and breed who has been troubled with a tender tummy for a few years . Her vet has tons of medications to give her , but I do n't need any of them since I tried the Wellness brand dry dog food and the moist . All her problems gave gone away . It is amazing . She has not been to the vet since her last yearly checkup .
5 #### Good product for good pups , even not so good pups . Price was right , packaging was good , cans were intact , not dented , as were the turkey / sweet potato adult cans ( 24 of them ) .
5 #### I have the pickiest eater in the world ! He loves it . Gilbert ( cockapoo ) , also had stomach issues . I 'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato , in addition to the Core dry food , Gil 's stomach problems are over . This is Human Grade Food for dogs . He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day . I also cut out all processed dog treats . We stick with fresh food treats such as : apple , sweet potato , egg , and some cheese once in awhile . Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great ! Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods ! Read articles on rendered meats , your stomach will turn . Take care !
5 #### My 13 yr old min pin suddenly stopped eating her regular brand food . She went many days not eating so i switched to this brand and she went BESERK FOR IT.I now buy it from Amazon because it 's a little cheaper and i do n't have to hassle running back and forth to the pet store wasting my gas and paying more . This is a highly rated pet food without the BY - PRODUCTS store bought dog food has . My little girl seems to be more active since i 've been feeding her this brand and I feel better knowing she is getting better nutrition .....
5 #### This is a favorite . They like it Pate style just works for them .
2 #### My cat hates this stuff , will barely even touch it . Ugh .
5 #### My cat loves this food . He says : " Meow meow , prrrr prrrr meow " . ( he wanted me to post that for him )
5 #### I was introduced to these very small doggie bones at my Vet . My 14 year old Springer who has never been much into doggie bones LOVES these things ! ! They make great pocket stuffers to carry around for incentive and motivation . My old guy has a hard time waking up to go outside and one wiff of one of these bones does miracles . I have a younger Springer who also loves the bones but she does n't need much motivation to do anything , ha , but they are also great training aids . I also sent home a handful of these bones with a painter I had at my home for his 3 dogs and he said they loved them too .... so I guess that 's antidotal but that 's 5 dogs that really love the things ! Oh , the bones are way more expensive when you find them at your Vet , about twice as much per pound , so this is a great buy . Buy a nice food safe container from Home Depot and fill it up . You wo n't run out of bones for a while and that 's a good thing !
5 #### I 've been giving these to my 3 Goldens for a few years now , but have only been able to get them in smaller quantities ..... the 20 lb box is GREAT !
4 #### These are one of the few chew toys my dogs will actually play with . I think it 's the little nubs all over the toy . They have been able to chew off quite a bit of the stegosaurus , but the T - Rex lasts much longer . Just be careful to pick these up when your dog is done - they really hurt if you step on them !
4 #### My dog loves it and she is a super chewer . The head does n't last too long but it 's one of her favorite toys . I buy these often .
5 #### I 've purchased a couple of these and they hold up well with my two VERY aggressive chewers .
3 #### They chewed a little bit but were n't that impressed . Get the flavored ones or actual deer antlers .
5 #### Just be sure to supervise when dog uses it . and no dogs over 60lbs .
5 #### I do n't eat this food so I ca n't say that " I " personally love it- it but my 16 year old sick kitty thinks it is better than sliced mice . He had basically lost his appetite and was very fussy and when I tried one of these cans he was THRILLED with the taste and texture ( and he has very few teeth left ) . We are very happy that we found something that he will eat and enjoy . Cats must eat no less than 18 hours or risk liver disease issues , so we are so relieved that he is definitely enjoying this food .
5 #### Great canned food for the kitties , I have two older ones that only like easy to lap up food . Several of Nutro Max flavors have a very smooth sort of creamy texture . They like this almost as much as the Gerber meat baby food .
5 #### When I adopted my cat she was eating Nutro Adult Cat food and loved it so we kept her on it . As a treat she gets wet food and the Nutro Wet food was recommended - ca n't say very much except that she knows when she is getting a can . She knows just when the lid is being cracked open and is there crying for it . And the ingredients are healthy for her . She does n't get the wet food daily but a few times a week and the fact that she has n't gotten sick from it , has a shiny coat of hair , is healthy and happy attends to me to continuing to feed this to her and not switching out . :)
5 #### LOL I see I 'm not alone . I found out about these treats when my UPS man left one for our new dog and she LOVED it ! ! ! ! I actually called him this morning and asked what brand the biscuits were because we wanted more . Sure ' nough , when we woke from our nap , here was a package with a note written on it telling us this was the product . I am so glad they are made in the USA and even happier that our dog loves it so much .
5 #### Our dogs love these biscuit treats . Buy them in bulk and you will save money .
5 #### My cat likes this . She 's a light eater . She likes it well enough to eat it at room temperature or cold from the fridge . So , I guess she gives it 5 stars .
5 #### My cats love it , and it does n't make their scent as bad . ( Cats smell worse with bad food ) And its grain free , they do n't need that stuff . :)
5 #### I think this is a great cat food and not to over priced . My cat really loves this food and is keeping him alive , he has kidney failure , I ca n't afford the vets food , this is the best I can do . It seems to be working
5 #### My 8 year old cat developed stomach problems and started losing weight . My vet recommended this food . After a few weeks on Wellness , Andy was back to his healthy weight . Now this is all I feed him . I feel like Wellness saved my best friend 's life .
5 #### My cat loves this ! So happy to have found a great brand .
5 #### My kitties love this interspersed with their raw diet about once a week .
4 #### Pate is great for the older kitties of the house and they love the flavors .
5 #### Decent ingredient for the price . Does contain meat by product . However , it does not contain plant protein which harded on cat as a carnivour . Also does not have much / if any carbohydrate . I used it as part of food rotation with pricier can foods . My cats do not have any taste preference between this friskies compared to pricier(x5 ) can food .
1 #### Makes my cats barf . Guaranteed . Oh , and it 's made out of crap ingredients .
5 #### This package gives me just the flavors my cats love . It is nice to find a selection that does n't include a flavor that my cats wo n't eat , leaving me with cans I ca n't use . As long as this is carried on Amazon , I will continue to buy it !
4 #### Wish they were just a bit bigger . My pit bulls go through them in 2 - 3 months . But ca n't complain bc the price is great for the time I do get out of them .
3 #### Compared to many other dog toys and chews we have tried , this thing lasted a long time . It is pretty hard and clunky , certainly not cute and fun like some other toys , and it is also single purpose -- you are n't going to want to use this for fetch or anything , it 's solely for chewing . While it is more durable than some , my dog did chew it up , and there was tiny white bits everywhere before we took it away .
5 #### My dog loves these and so do I. They really get the stuff off his teeth .
2 #### Bought two , my two dogs went crazy over them , then after a week , totally lost interest . Not sure why . Anyone know ? How they loved chewing it at first , then have n't touched it for almost a year now . Should just throw them out , but they still look new ! Wo n't buy them again as my dogs are n't into them . Not sure I 'm sold on the effectiveness on the teeth either .
5 #### These are a great ' babysitter ' for our active Border Collies . They last so long , and keep them occupied . Nylabone DURA are the only type I get and love that they make the DURAs in such great styles . Each of the three dinosaurs is unique . I only wish we would be able to select a specific dinosaur from the three styles , but -- we get what we get . And , although that is disappointing to me , perhaps not that much to our dogs . ( However , if I order 2 or 3 , I seem to get all the same style . Now that would be nice if I got one of each . Hint , hint . ) Otherwise , love these ! !
4 #### The qualitys not as good as the lamb and rice but it did n't seem to bother his stomach , you get 10 more pounds and it is cheaper wich is a plus for me . You can always ad your own rice and veggies . Its fresher that way and better for him in my opinion . Plus if you you can get it deliverd to your house for free its even better . Got ta love pitbulls
5 #### We have a 5 month puppy who does n't eat much and does n't drink much . We mix this with dry food and chicken and it really helps with the hydration since he wo n't drink too much . He 's healthy , has a nice coat , and seems to like this canned dog food .
5 #### After researching dog foods , I went with Wellness core and my little dog loves it ! ! I feed Wellness core and put 1/2 can of the canned in with it and am so pleased that my dog begs for " mealtime " .
4 #### I ordered the product based on the picture and then found out that they were the smaller cans and not the bigger cans when the order arrived . I should 've been more careful but please change the picture to show the 6 ounce can . Thanks .
5 #### My dog love all wellness tread so I decide to try this canned food beside to be very nutritional ( price is the cheaper on town ) , my dog did finish all 12 , I mixed with her orijen dry food , the first cans she ate them great but seems she got bored with the last ones , that does not mean the food is not good , like I said great food but not for the taste of my dog . Anyway went ahead to try different canned food ( Blue Buffalo Small Breed Canned Dog Food , Chicken Dinner Recipe)to mix with her dry food . this one seem like is of her taste . I recommended both canned food anyway .
5 #### My rescue puppy loves this food and what a difference it has made in his coat and all around health . Just a well balanced food .
5 #### My dogs and I love this food . They never leave a trace and I am happy that it is healthy for them . I mix it up with the Wellness Super 5 mix .
5 #### My dogs and I love this food . They never leave a trace and I am happy that it is healthy for them . I mix it up with the Wellness Super 5 mix .
5 #### My 20 year old cat gobbles this up and at his age is very fussy , just wish they came in bigger cans at a better price .
1 #### I have nothing against this food . However Charlie my cat would not touch it .
5 #### My cat loves this cat food . Wish she would eat all of the meat instead of mostly the gravy and only a bit of food . I like to spoil her so will continue to buy .
5 #### I have dachshunds who regularly destroy toys made for dogs who are strong chewers . They love these Nylabones . They can chew and chew on them without me having to worry that they are going to break off a piece and choke . Love these - have ordered them again , and will continue ordering them for my heavy chewers !
5 #### My dogs like these and they last longer than most other chew toys
5 #### My dogs love these , they last a while and they are a good price . My bare feet , on the other hand , are not the biggest fans . I recommend putting them up somewhere before you go to bed so you do n't get a rude awaking in the morning with bare feet .
4 #### Held my dogs interest for a while . He loves to chew .
5 #### very long lasting but can get sharp when dog chews enough of it
4 #### Smaller than I was expecting but dogs still chewed on it and it has lasted for around a year and still has life in it . Really would n't recommend for a dog bigger than 50lbs . Mine are 80lbs but do not try swallowing it , was very werry and watchful for a long time with it .
5 #### My puppy is a power chewer , first class . I 've had to phase out all plushies and go for something with a bit more substantial . Oh my gosh , she went NUTS for this toy ! It 's held up wonderfully and remains one of her favorite toys !
1 #### Do not order more than one box as Amazon does not take back even unopened cat food ... something to remember in case your cat does not like
5 #### My cats love this food . Perfect amount for them .
3 #### High Calorie but one of our dogs loves them . We need 5 calorie treats for rewards . With these , she gets 1 cookie daily as calories are almost 30kcals per treat .
5 #### My dog loves these treats . They are the perfect size to have on hand when we go on hikes .
5 #### L.I.T. are great for dogs with allergies or touchy stomachs . We have 4 small dogs and they all love these .
4 #### Great size package for the price . Some of the treats were a little crumbly , but overall good value .
5 #### My dogs LOVE these ! It feels good to give them treats that are good for them .
5 #### Love these treats ! Limited ingredients so I do n't have to worry about my dog but he loves them .
4 #### My dog loved them ! Limited ingredients and I 'm happy too !
5 #### My little dogs love these things . Will be a repeat customer for these bones .
5 #### My dogs love these and I love the price
5 #### Big box with very few broken pieces , and my dogs love these .
5 #### I live in NYC , and not all of the Pet Stores carry this specific cat food . The ones that do are getting VERY expensive . While this is FAR from the cheapest cat food , it is in both mine and my veterinarians opinion - is the best quality and best overall cat food . My cat LOVES it and this seller has a very good price . It is an expensive cat food , but this is at least priced in line . I highly recommend it .
3 #### I have two kittens that will not touch this food . The list of ingredients looks good and the food , while kind of pink , looks ok . I ended up having to give it all away . They would not one bite of it , smell it and then look back at me . They do eat blue buffalo , nutro , and a couple other brands of premium ... and of course the fast food brands like Friskies . But this product unfortunately is a no - go .
3 #### My dog is completely uninterested in this thing . I do n't know if it is just too hard for her ( hard as a rock ) or if it does n't smell interesting or what .
4 #### The Nylabone Dura Chew has lasted a long time ( T - Rex ) although it is not my dogs favorite toy . He gnaws at it every now and then for a few minutes and then leaves it alone . I think the material is too hard for his teeth . He likes his Antler a lot better .
4 #### Really cute but kind of hard for my small dog . Got scared of him breaking a tooth on it but now he sits on my counter and it looks pretty cute .
5 #### Our two 40 - 50 lb boxer mix puppies LOVE these . Mostly because of the little nubs on them , I think . Super cheap compared to those in the store . We go through about 10 - 12 of these a year .
5 #### Since putting our dog on the Wellness dog food , we do n't have any more diarrhea or upset tummy issues .
4 #### My dogs , Storm ( Blue Weimaraner 20 months ) and Riley ( Dalmatian 12 yrs)love this food . I mix in a little with their dry food . My only complaint is , it 's a bit smelly , but then again it 's the fish flavor . I prefer the Duck and Sweet Potato . I have not been able to find it on Amazon for the same price . They have never had stomach upset from this food . You save about 30 cents a can plus no tax and free shipping to your door when you order a case from Amazon .
5 #### My puppy had a severe diarrhea for weeks until we put her on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato . Just like a miracle , she is healthy and energetic .
5 #### My parents were having issues getting their Yorkie to eat Wellness dry and so was I with my Yorkie . They would eventually eat , but it was dragging down their routines . According to the Whole Dog Journal , Wellness Canned Dog Food Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe is a great food for your dog . The article stressed how gone are the days where wet food was worse for a dog than dry . As long as it 's a good , quality food , the wet is actually better for dogs than the dry . I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick . I can also hide my Yorkie 's morning pill with it and she does n't realize she 's taking her medicine .
5 #### My dogs have NO ambivalence toward their dinners when I mix this in . They absolutely love it . I am very pleased with this product . Lamb is very good for dogs , too . I love that this food is very healthy and has no grains . Awesome product . I will definitely buy again . A+++++
5 #### My puppy was having some tummy upsets . Wellness products were recommended and my dog is healthy and happy . This is really a top quality product .
5 #### This dog food is excellent ! My Shih Tzu 's are thriving on it , they are healthier and full of energy , no allergy problems that plaqued them in the past . Yes it is a little more expensive , but well worth it for the health of your pups ! I highly recommend it !
5 #### I was able to finish the Iditarod being pulled by 14 Chihuahuas eating this food . They really seem to like it .
5 #### This is pretty much the only food that my cat wo n't eat messily
4 #### It 's just okay , they eat it and I think it 's good for them .
5 #### My cat loves this food ! He looks gorgeous with soft and shiny hair . We 're very pleased !
5 #### This supplements my cat 's dry food . He will only eat Friskies pate ' .
5 #### Our cats ( 2 ) love the sauces and the variety . We love the Amazon price and prompt delivery
5 #### We have 4 dogs . They love these treats . One of my dogs is missing a few teeth from before we adopted him and these are easy for me to break into pieces for him . Our dogs like these much better than Milk Bone Dog Biscuits . They come in a big cardboard box and are loose inside . Some people complain about a lot of broken bones , so far in 2 boxes we have not had that issue . Maybe 10 % or less are broken .
3 #### My dogs love these . I love that they are made in the USA . I have 3 dogs so it was nice to buy in bulk . I will purchase again . I have purchased again and noticed the same problem as the first order . At least half of the biscuits are broken . They should be whole pieces , I am ready to order dog biscuits again but probably not these , although my dogs love them at least half are broken pieces . I am going to see if Chewy.com has better biscuits .
5 #### Love this product . Wonderful dog biscuit , good ingredients , excellent price , Prime delivery . Can not do better ! Will reorder again and again as my dogs love the taste . Excellent product and service
1 #### The box I receive contained beetles . The biscuits were loose in the box and were not contained in a plastic bag within . The box had holes in all the corners . I 'm not sure at what point the beetles entered but needless to say I did n't feed them to my dogs . I pitched all 20 lbs . This company needs to address this before I ever buy their product again .
1 #### Dogs love them , which is odd for a biscuit treat . Would be interested in knowing calories / day because sometimes they go though a lot . % of biscuits broken : 25 . Update : FLEAS . The treats were infested with fleas . I bagged all the treats in poly zip - lock bags , put all but one bag in the freezer . Fleas started a few weeks later , , on my counter top . I opened the freezer to check out the other bag , and there were quite a bit of dead fleas under the bags . Instead of leaving ANY bags out in the open , I now keep all bags in the freezer , until I find a new source of treats . No more fleas . Dogs never have fleas , since Frontline Plus used monthly .
5 #### I buy these in bulk ! Great way to occupy a naughty dog and great gifts for neighbor dogs
5 #### Tough ! Made of plastic so need to monitor dog !
4 #### I received the T - Rex shaped one . My dog love chewing on it and has n't managed to break off any large pieces .
5 #### My puppy loves this treats , he gets so excited when I give him one , highly recommend ...
5 #### Our dogs love these treats and since they are not chicken or beef we love giving to them . For skin and stomach issues we have switched our dogs to duck and salmon food and they are doing so much better . Perfect treat . They sit so pretty to get it !
5 #### My dogs love these ..... mind you , they seem to like anything ! ! ! I like that they can easily be broken into small pieces .... so I can give two treats from one piece .
5 #### Our kittens gobble this down several times a day ! Recommend !
4 #### My animals are all 18 years old and doing well . None of them eat grain in their food and I think changing to a raw diet would be difficult at this stage . I wish Amaon sold these in the larger cans . I have found a local pet store which does , so I alternate between Wellness and the excellent but pricey Addiction brand from New Zealand but made here in Washington state .
5 #### Squirt cat is fat and lazy so I did n't really expect her to play with this toy , but she loves it ! True to fat & lazy cat form , she lays on her side while batting at the ball until she ca n't reach it , but I suppose that counts as playing . She makes good use out of the cardboard scratch circle which has reduced her making use of the couch for claw sharpening despite having a scratch post . We ordered the laser light ball to replace the white plastic one that comes with it and she does n't seem to care either way , but the laser light ball looks hecka cooler . There 's nothing like waking up in the middle of the night to Squirt cat knocking the ball around the track . I believe you can also get a replacement scratch circle once it 's destroyed . No regrets on this purchase .
5 #### My cats absolutely love this healthier , canned food ! Worth every penny !
5 #### This is the only canned food my cat will eat . Will only eat one kind of dry food , too . The other 2 cats who have lived with me liked this the best , too . It 's a very high quality food !
5 #### Very good product , goes a long way . I have adopted an Akbash mix . Giant breed dogs age slowly , and he will still be growing for a long time , so although he is now 2 , I still give him 1 cup of this in his morning meal ( 3 cups ) . This has enough carbs to help puppy growth , not too much protein , which can cause stones and crystals in the bladder and kidneys , and has the calcium and omegas and other things puppies need for good mental development , as well . It does not require feeding a lot of volume and risking bloat .
5 #### Great biscuits my dogs love them . i will buy another box when this one runs out .
3 #### These are not exactly as pictured . They are 5 inches , in length and a half inch thick not what I expected . Thank goodness our dog is huge and they break up fairly easily . One biscuit every few days or so is way more than enough , too many calories . Next time the small ones for toy dogs .
5 #### Nice amount and shipped in sturdy box- good size for med dogs .
5 #### They keep her busy and chewing for ages . Vary scratchy , however , not a welcome item when she wants us to play tug with them .
4 #### My dog loves Nylabone chew toys , and since this one was so cheap I decided to give it a try . He 's a 75 lb . pit bull , so I usually give him the larger toys , but this was big enough that he could chew it . It 's not as good as the big knobby Nylabones , but still fun for him for a little while . I wish they would let you choose which type of dinosaur you got , because I wanted a T - rex , but got a Stegosaurus . He chewed the head and tail off first , now just the body remains . I might buy one again eventually , but I think he still prefers the larger bones to chew on and he usually goes for those before picking up this one when he 's in the mood for chewing .
4 #### Great treat ! Bags just came with the treats a little smashed up .
4 #### My dog that is on a low - fat restricted diet for gastric issues enjoys these and I 'm comfortable with the ingredients .
5 #### My six month old setter gobbles this up . I mix it up with his kibble but he manages to pick around it and just eat the canned food .
5 #### Breeder sent this with the puppy and I thought I would upgrade . When I upgraded the dog would smell his poop and eat it so quickly before I get to it that I get grossed out just thinking about it . Anyway , long story short , my puppy needs to be disgusted by his poop so I went ahead and ordered a bag of this product since I did n't know any tractor supply stores in my area .
3 #### I have been buying these bones for years but this last box was a disappointment . They have changed the recipe and I do n't think that it is as good as it was . The bones do not ship as well and as a result most of the bisquit bones were broken upon arrival . I order the small size biscuits to avoid the breakage , but it did n't work with this last box . I hope they go back to the original recipe ( so does my dog ! )
5 #### My dogs are happy , they seem to really love these " cookies . " I think that since they contain chicken meal that it would be better for the dogs ' health instead of other ingredients . I am so glad that I found these on Amazon . I have purchased Old Roy dog biscuits but they never seem to be in stock and shipping is a hefty price . Good compromise by purchasing from Amazon , just wish that I could get this as a subscribe and save item !
5 #### I have a very picky eater that weighs 25 lbs . and these bones are the only one he will eat we have tried a number of others but he sticks his nose up on them .
5 #### My dog loves these bones especially the peanut butter . My dog weighs 113 lbs . and usually get three a day .
5 #### My dogs love these . Each gets one as a goodnight snack . They 're very economical , and Amazon has a slightly better price than my local feed store . My only complaint is that many are broken in the box ( not that the dogs care ) , but this is true of the boxes I got from the feedstore , too .
5 #### Buy these regularly from this merchant . Great product / great price !
5 #### I bought two of these at Christmas for my two Weimaraner 's and am amazed how long they are lasting and how much they enjoy chewing them .. these are for back up when the other two are gone . Looks like I wo n't be needing them anytime soon . they are very durable .
5 #### my dog , a lab , destroys all her toys . These so far have been great for her chewing needs and still intact
5 #### Cat goes crazy with this good for some reason , I 'm guessing it 's because of the mixture of meats ... No byproducts , so it 's a decent food
5 #### Although the shipment was delayed for some mysterious reason , I was n't in a hurry for it . I have a finicky eater who wastes so much food . He begs for a can of any kind , licks off the gravy or broth , and leaves the rest . I tried a can of Nutro Max Adult , and he actually ate the food , not just the broth ! Since I got it on a lightning deal , this was a double good deal !
4 #### CAT DOES NOT LIKE AS MUCH AS THE CHICKEN
5 #### Before this year , my cat never used to be picky . He would n't touch most dry foods and would only lick the gravy off of the wet food , would n't touch pate . I was starting to really worry about his nutrition until I found this food for him . He loves the duck chunks in gravy from Nutro only , wo n't touch other brands ' duck cat food . I will be buying this product again .
3 #### The product does what it is supposed to , package is fine and cans are fine-- but my kitten will not eat this food willingly . I have to coax her to the bowl repeatedly Furthermore , the directions say to feed a 3 lb cat THREE cans a day ? That seems extremely excessive-- and she will barely eat one can spread out over three meals because she seems to hate the flavor so much !
5 #### Cat loves it . Packaged vertically instead of horizontally ( three columns , one row ) -- not that it matters . Just different , that 's all .
4 #### Our new kitties seem to like it and it 's a good addition to the Wellness dry food that we give them .
5 #### First , this is n't the world 's most premium cat food . But it does meet a pretty high standard for cat nutrition 1 . it 's wet food , 2 . it 's grain free , 3 . it is affordable , and most importantly , 4 . the cats EAT IT ! They are healthy weight , their coats are very shiny and soft , they have no dander , no hairballs , and their shedding is mild . These large , budget friendly cans that Wellness makes are perfect for multicat households , and you could hardly feed them fancy feast for less $ per day .
3 #### my smaller dogs do n't like it .... my larger dog does .....
5 #### My dog Dallas , is acting like this is raw meat . He will do anything for one of these . Great price , Great product .
5 #### SMELLS GREAT , LOOKS GREAT , GOOD ENOUGH FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION . MY LABRADOR LOVES THESE . SO MUCH NICER THAN THE PHOTO . LOOKS APPETIZING TO ME . IF I WAS HUNGRY ENOUGH , I COULD EAT THEM TOO .
5 #### These are very small biscuits ... My medium size dogs love them .. They make good training treats too ..
5 #### my cats love it . Even my dogs tried to play but I had to remove it form where they could get to it because they will " eat"it trying to get to the ball
3 #### Our old cat food , which we are dropping for nutritional considerations
5 #### All 4 of my cats love it as a supplement to kibble .
3 #### Dog is being funny and not eating it but the cat really likes it .
3 #### My pup would n't eat it for some reason . I normally feed him science diet but this is the first time I have ordered online . > <
5 #### My rescue puppy loves it ! He came to me malnourished with bony prominences visible all over his body . Within a month of this dry food and other supplementation , his ribs are far less visible to the naked eye . I gave Science Hill to my first dog and she is a healthy and active 2 - year - old dog . I feel pretty confident in this product delivering sound nutrition to my dogs .
2 #### its really not as good for your dog as they ll have you believe
5 #### My fur monster loves these ! The price is wonderful . She will do tricks on her own to see if her actions will get her one of these treats !
5 #### Made in America SPORTMix Puppy Buscuit Treats are a must have if you are lucky enough to have a canine companion . Small in size ( 1.25 inches ) for training and general treats , and easily snap in half if you want to make them even smaller . The 20 - lb box is a wonderful value , treats stay crisp and fresh . I also provide 20 - lb boxes to local animal shelters and a dog rescue group ; all dogs love these treats !
5 #### These have been a favorite of my large Lab , Jack , for years . He recommends them with a 4 Paws rating !
3 #### Dogs will chew on them if there is nothing else around but not for very long . They do not get excited about them .
5 #### My crazy chewer Ridgeback mix LOVES this . He will chew on it for hours and just play with it . Throwing it up in the air and really enjoying it . Only downfall .... it is LOUD when it hits a hardwood floor lol .
1 #### After a week of chewing , it became so ripped up , it was actually drawing blood from my dog 's mouth . Thrown away and stuck to the original Nylabones - still chewed up , but less pointy .
5 #### Our corgis love this chew toy ; they are usually very aggressive chewers and they have yet to annihilate this toy after months of chewing-- they get through the regular nylabones in just a few weeks .
5 #### It 's not just me who loves it , but my cats do too ! It 's a great wet food . People who have cats will understand this sentiment : this Savory Duck Chunk wet food is a cleaner meal than any other wet food I have ever given my cats .
5 #### One of my cats had dental surgery and had to have a soft diet for several weeks . I picked up some Max Cat Kitten food at my local Petsmart after researching wet cat food on the internet and based on the number of protein entries for the first ingredients . I bought " Chicken and Liver " and " Chicken and Oceanfish " flavors . During the time I was feeding him Max Cat Kitten , my cat 's coat became very noticeably more shiny and healthy - looking . My cat was crazy about both flavors , but it recommends 1 can per 2 lbs . of the cat 's weight , which for my cat equals 6 cans a day , plus another 6 cans for my other cat . It is just too expensive for me to do that . Buying a case of food on Amazon reduced the price , even though it included shipping . I now use it as an occasional treat for both of my cats .
5 #### I signed up for re - order . The food was fresh . And , it came when promised . I like the service .
1 #### Very Fatty , my kitten did not like it had GI problems
4 #### Please put a pop top on large cans ! Every single can distorts on opening with can opener , so the lid has to be bent back or pried open . Hazardous , messy , and time consuming . Otherwise this is a good quality canned food without carbs from any source . And the cats eat it
5 #### I recently adopted a Rescue Kitten that needed medication . Using this Quality Food along with mixing her medication worked perfectly !
5 #### My felines love the flavor and it 's healthy for them .
2 #### I read the ingredients and found that it is basically garbage . I purchased this because it was supposed to be healthier than other options , but in reality it 's just as bad . I was mad at my vet for recommending it until I learned that they pay to have veterinary schools teach that it 's good food so that vets recommend it . Now I 'm just mad at the Colgate - Palmolive company that uses unethical business practices to peddle this junk . Colgate markets Science Diet as boutique health food , but in reality it 's the same quality as the stuff you can pull off the drug store shelf . Do n't waste your money . Either buy something cheaper , or buy something that 's actually healthy .
3 #### 3 stars for typical commercial big brand quality . Noticed itching and more BM 's with my puppy though they were not unhealthy . Not terrible but not good .
5 #### This product and the dry food for puppy under one year is the reason why Flip 's " my dog " coat is extremely shiny and beautiful . No one believe that I do n't give him any extras . His weight is standard with the Vet 's instructions of the amount for him ... awesome .. i m so happy with it ...
5 #### My GSD has been on this dry food since 10 weeks old . She 's gone from about 15 lbs to 75 lbs now at almost 11 months old . Her bone development has been excellent , her coat is silky smooth , teeth very clean , eyes bright and her poops are properly firm ( as in easy to pick up ) . The dog eats about 4 big cups once a day ( late evening ) , plus a little hamburger I give her in the early morning as a treat . For a large breed dog , the bits are larger which prevents her from wolfing down the food , and choking on it . Also larger pieces are good for the teeth as she must chew the pieces rather than inhaling them . Very satisfied with Hills dog food , and will transition her to the adult mix once she 's about 13 - 14 months .
5 #### Buy these all the time .... you get a huge box , so I separate it into small plastic containers . Dogs love them . Easily break in half for doing tricks for treats . :0 )
5 #### This is the first time I have ordered SPORTMIX peanut bisuits and these , too , were a hit in our house . I break the biscuits in half as they are big enough to do that .
3 #### a little harder then expected but my dogs love it
5 #### My puppy loves this and I love that it 's a dino !
5 #### These dinosaur ' bones ' are my dogs favorite , for some reason , out of all of the shapes she has to choose from . She is definitely a ' power chewer , ' and these have ' survived ' her continuous chewing for months and months ... to present .
5 #### This is our Papillon 's favorite toy ! We 're on # 3 . He takes a while to really tear them up and he 's constantly chewing !
3 #### still have it the dog chews on every so often
5 #### My little girl loves these treats . And I love that they are not crammed full of junk you do n't want to feed to your dog .
5 #### Our cats are VERY picky eaters ..... currently the male cat will eat this brand ..... not the female cat however ! Seems like a good brand of cat food .....
5 #### Our cats also eat the wellness indoor formula dry food and enjoy the chicken wet food in the morning . They 're a bit picky about flavour , but they 'll consistently eat wellness chicken . I find that chilling the tin before opening it makes the liquid slosh around less immediately after opening .
3 #### When I first bought this online over a year ago it was 22 . and some change now it is 30 bucks . Why purchase on here when you can purchase it cheaper in the stores now ? ( for a pack of 24 ) . My cat loves Wellness and I 've fed him it since he 's a kitten but I have some real concerns about people 's comments on the quality changing and carrageenan in the can labeled as a " natural " additive . It 's been proven to cause inflammation . Of course , I am going to do more research but it is disappointing to me how you can not reach out to Wellness online here .
2 #### Subscribe and save delivered dented cans last delivery . They were replaced when I complained with more dented cans . I did not bother to complain second time around . It happened a few years back but all was good until now . If it keeps on happening , I 'll probably cancel . This is a premium cat / dog food and I 'm paying top dollar .
4 #### I only gave it a 4 star because they prefer Friskies / Fancy Feast , but do eat it , so worth a try , especially since it 's the better nutritional / quality canned food .
1 #### We threw this away immediately after our dog started chewing on it . It was too rough for her and caused her gums to bleed . I do not know how this is safe for any dog .
1 #### I have a small dog , but he 's a heavy chewer . I bought this because it was supposed to be durable , but my dog bit off a corner of it after about 5 minutes . I had to return it .
4 #### Great chew toy and very durable given that my dog destroys most toys quickly . My only complaint is that the many bumps / ridges will cause it to dent wood floors in your house if you have them . Better for a carpeted place .
5 #### Very , very durable . I highly recommend this for strong chewers ! The shape of them is adorable !
5 #### My Puppy Blue Heeler loves this but he is not a Picky eater but will stick with it for now will need to change to adult food in a few months .
5 #### I never have had a problem with Science diet , great food and keeps my dogs digestive system on track . Quick shipping and good quality . I will definitely order again .
5 #### I started my new puppy off on Hill 's Science Diet Puppy Healthy Development . She loves it .
5 #### we went through 60 lbs of this with our Boston and she loved it . She used to dance in the kitchen when she heard the kibble hit the bowl every morning . Vet said her weight is perfect . I like that her poop is well formed and solid so I can clean it up on walks very easily .
1 #### Horrible food ! Gave my puppy diarrhea . I thought it was stress related until I quit the food cold turkey and the diarrhea stopped . There is also been many recalls on this item be careful ! !
5 #### My 75 pound fox - red ( yellow ) lab LOVES these ! ! ! ! ! Great bargain . He gets one in the morning and one at night . 30 % protein . Wow . And it cleans his teeth .
5 #### 30 % PROTEIN ............... a biscuit that is actually healthy for my three min pins ! Real peanut butter biscuit !
5 #### They are really tiny , so you do n't have to break the bigger ones into little pieces so they do n't get overweight eating big biscuits . They really like the flavor of the little ones and get a lot more treats since about 8 of them equals one regular biscuit . It comes in a huge box , and will last for months and months with two dogs .
4 #### My cat likes Friskies , but his digestion has a problem with it . I have no idea how this stuff tastes ( I am not that poor ... yet ) , but he chows down when I put some out . The problem is that even with a good dry and wet food mix , there is usually a cleaning up problem if you get my drift . so best to choose on the basis of your cats digestion , like anything cat related ( especially since I am the cats sole staff person ... as they say ; dogs have owners ) .
5 #### My dog absolutely LOVES these things . Just be careful where they leave it . Stepping on it is pure torture . It 's like stepping on Lego 's !
2 #### My dog loved it but the head of the dinosaurs was small enough to get really far back in my dogs mouth and with the texture it tore his gums up . Vet said no more so in the trash it went .
5 #### We have multiple dinosaurs at home . They do n't last as long as the Nylabone knot bones but they do last longer than most toys . I do n't recommend them for young dogs . It gave my 1 year old bichon bloody gums because the edges can become sharp . It 's perfect for my 2.5 year old lab / collie mix though .
5 #### Both puppies love this . Nice bumpy surface for chewing and gnawing .
4 #### I have an English Bulldog puppy who is teething . She loves her stegosaurus ! The only problem I had is that she managed to bites it 's little head off within 48 hours of getting her toy . So if you have a dog with strong jaws , supervise them during use .
5 #### These Nylabones are great ! As a cheap add on Item I did n't expect much out of them . But these bones are one of the few things my dog does n't destroy within the first few hours of him playing with . I will buy these again
4 #### My 25 lb Boston Terrier is an aggressive chewer who is a pro at destroying toys . On my quest to find toys that he loves and that can hold up to his playing , I 've tried several Nylabone products and they work very well . I ordered one of these dino chews and got the stegosaurus , which my pup immediately began playing with . After a few days I noticed that the ends of the dino were getting pretty sharp , so I took a file and smoothed some of the sharpness and I 've done this a couple times as he whittles the ends down . He loves this toy , and I do supervise him more heavily with this one because it is such a hard plastic and has an unusual shape , although he has n't chewed any chunks of it off but he probably could if I did n't " fix " the ends for him . I think I may order another in hopes of getting the t - rex or brontosaurus , because those ones look like they would not get the sharp ends that the one I received does . That 's really my only complaint about this toy , and so far my dog has no complaints .
1 #### It is made sortof like people stew in that it is not all mixed up into one flavor . You can see small pcs of carrot , peas , etc . These are not what a dog would be drawn to in the wild - Therefore they do not like this stew . It would take time to train them to eat it , but my puppies would not go near it Such a waste of money , not to mention time and stress to replace it !
5 #### All of our dogs have been brought up on Science Diet ! Great company , great price !
5 #### My border collies love these treats much more than the ones I purchase locally at other stores . They are smaller than the ones I usually give them , but my dogs gobble them down and expect another every time I go outdoors . I will order again .
5 #### What a great deal for these treats . My dogs love them ! I am storing the extra in an air tight container for when I need them . And may even donate a few to the local humane society .
5 #### great peanut butter dog biscuit treat.if you go to your local pet store and use the scoop into plastic bag , then they weigh it you will pay around $ 9.00 for 1 1/2 lb.this box weighs 20lbs and it stores well.what a bargain.we use these to stuff the Kong .great value
5 #### My alaskan husky loves these treats . Very large box for a very large dog . I got the mixed flavor so he does not get tired of one flavor
5 #### These bones have made crate training a breeze . My dogs are happy to go into their crates and lie down when they hear the Sportmix box being opened . With all of the scares about poisons in the treats made in China I wrote to Sportmix before I bought their products . Here is the lovely reply I received . " Thanks for choosing to feed your dog our SPORTMIX dog biscuits . Our Sportmix Biscuit treats are manufactured in our company owned manufacturing facility in Monmouth , Illinois , USA . Midwestern Pet Foods was founded in 1926 as a miller of flour and corn meal . In the 1940s we began using the basic ingredients from our milling operation to produce pelletized dog and cat food .

" My UPS delivery man carries these treat biscuits and he is a favorite in my neighborhood . I recommend all of the Sportmix biscuit treats and am grateful to Amazon for carrying the 20 lb . boxes .
5 #### All three of my dogs love these puppy bones and none of them are puppies . Sportmix biscuit treats are made in the USA . With the scares about dog treats made in China I wrote to Sportmix before buying . Here is the lovely reply that I received " Thanks for choosing to feed your dog our SPORTMIX dog biscuits . Our Sportmix Biscuit treats are manufactured in our company owned manufacturing facility in Monmouth , Illinois , USA . Midwestern Pet Foods was founded in 1926 as a miller of flour and corn meal .

" I learned about these treats from my UPS delivery man . He carries a pocket full of the hickory smoked basted bones , which my dogs also enjoy .
5 #### Our cats love just about all of the Max Cat flavors
5 #### My cat goes nuts for duck . Glad we were able to find a good brand and the type he liked . Plus nice that it 's available via subscribe and save .
4 #### My kittens ate this , but preferred eating other food if given the choice .
5 #### These are wonderfull ! My ShiTzu loves them , and the ingredients are pet friendly .
5 #### My maltipoo and yorkiepoo are picky and they love this treat
5 #### Great for my dog who needs the limited ingredients . All other treats make him itch .
5 #### My dog loves these treats . Wanted to eat the whole bag .
4 #### Healthy treats which I always look for . But , they are rock hard . I ca nt break them no matter how hard I try . They are perfect for my big dog but a no go for my smaller dog .
5 #### My koi go crazy for this . It does not cloud water . Great price . Only kind I buy .
4 #### My cat has IBS and another condition . She is thriving very well on this food exclusively and she is 14 years old .
1 #### My 3 cats HATE this food ! Tried a lot of brands ( and they have loved them ) , but this one I put down and they still look at me as if to say : " Will you PLEASE put down something edible ? " Not even one bite eaten - tried 12 cans in 12 days . Threw the rest out . Should note that all 3 of my cats were feral rescues and are pigs when it comes to wet food - EXCEPT this brand . Caveat Emptor !
4 #### Took six cats a while to get used to it . Bought 5 flavors . Do not like the Turkey - at all . Love the Chicken & Herring and Turkey & Salmon . Jury is still out on the Chicken & Lobster and Beef & Chicken .
5 #### Bought this product the day we got our kitten because of the affordability . Learned it was no longer carried in store but then found it carried on Amazon by the case . Since our kitten was only 6 weeks , keeping her on a simple food she could tolerate was important . We are now mixing this with hard food but she still enjoys it and our adult cat has taken to it too . This product was actually recommended by my vet tech .
5 #### My cats LOVE Wellness wet food . This pack seems very fresh and great to have it delivered right to our door ! !
1 #### These are absolutely bad for dogs , if your dog likes to chew and a big chunk gets broken off and swallowed chances are the vet bill will be highly expensive
4 #### My dogs love these dinosaurs , just wish they lasted a bit longer through the constant gnawing of my dachshund . Guess its better the dinosaurs than my couch !
5 #### our puppy really likes this food - sometimes I mix it with kibble
5 #### My dog loves this food , with zero recalls and wholesome ingredients I love it too .
1 #### Puppy does n't like taste , neighbors puppy does so gave away ...
5 #### I have been feeding my dogs Purina for a few months now and they have been acting very hungry all the time and have not been putting on any weight . In addition to that , I have noticed that their coats are not as bright and shiny as usual . Due to these concerns , I have been on the search for a new dog food that would provide my puppies with the correct nutrition and allow them to be full after the recommended serving size . I began to see results with this food less than a week after switching food . They have more energy and their coats are beginning to return to normal . They have even been able to put the weight back on and their serving size has officially been cut back to what it should be . I would recommend this dog food to any dog owner looking for a healthy solution .
3 #### I have two Goldens . The one year old is fine with this food but the three year old got extremely sick .
5 #### I 'm happy with Diamond brand dog foods , my golden likes the grain free food and it helps with his allergies
5 #### My puppy loves it ! Was shipped quickly and packaged well .
5 #### If I put out a dish of these and a dish of another brand 's , this would be gone and my pets would be asking for more before they discovered brand X. VERY unusual for dogs ! !
5 #### our four legged family love this treats . they get them in the morning and when they behave .... and they always behave .
5 #### These basted biscuits are by far the BEST ! My two min pins love them and they are even good for them with added vitamins ! No by product meal ..... just meat and chicken meal , which means a higher protein content . The biscuits are nice and hard for help in keeping their teeth clean and shiny ! At only $ 1.59 per lb I figured I 'd try one box and I am so satisfied with my purchase I just ordered another box to keep on hand . Made in the USA too !
4 #### These treats seem fine . My dog likes variety and these are different flavors . Think they 're just the right size when you just want to satisfy them with a small treat .
5 #### Put the twinkle ball that lights up in it .... Nyx the cat rolled that thing back and forth all night !
4 #### One of my cat likes to sit on it , and the other likes to scratch . They are not into playing with the ball so much . Nevertheless , they seem to enjoy the product .
5 #### My vet recommended this food and I noticed an almost immediate difference in my puppies coat , so shiny . She loves the food .
4 #### The kitties still like it so I will keep buying it .
5 #### My cat likes the pate texture / style style best of all the Friskies ' canned food , but most grocer 's only carry one flavour . I like to think he would prefer a variety , so this multipack is great . Additional bonus : Not only do I not have to deal with unloading and stacking individual cans ( as you do if bought from the grocer 's ) , they are delivered right to me and I do n't have to carry them around the store , from the store , to the trunk , up to the house , etc .
2 #### Good food . Love dimond naturals . This bag was almost 2 weeks late . Beware of this buyer .
3 #### it was a good value when I bought it , but the price went up~~~~
1 #### dogs got sick immediately after having a sample of this . Further investigation showed this has been toxic to many other dogs and they had no company response getting it pulled or have alert sent out by other health sites .
2 #### These are just okay and the one Nylabone Chew toy I will most likely NOT purchase again . Although my dogs loved these , as they chew on them they get very sharp edges . And when you are walking through the house barefoot in the dark and step on one ... IT HURTS ! ! Also , these are small so do n't buy them for your big dogs . I bought one for my 20 lb miniature poodle and it was just the right size for him .
1 #### I did n't allow my dog to keep this toy long enough for her to do any lasting damage to herself . I should have read the reviews more carefully before ordering because , like a lot of posters have claimed , this product is certainly hard enough to break an animal 's teeth . There are plenty of safer alternatives available that wo n't injure a pet . Also , despite the rigidity of the toy 's material , it 's still possible for a power chewer to break off small pieces of plastic and ingest them , something I do n't feel is desirable or healthy .
5 #### Well , I wo n't write a negative review of this Nylabone Dura Chew Original Flavored Dental chew - but I have n't seen it since I gave it to him several days ago ..... so either he loves it and is saving it and trying to keep it away from the cat , or he does n't want it in his mouth . I 'll have to update when I find out . For right now , its hidden somewhere in a very large house ..... Hmmm
5 #### If I could give this 6 stars I would . i have bought several over the years and it is one of the only products to survive very adamant chewers . My dogs typically ignore bone shaped nylabones , but the dinosaurs are shaped and textured enough to peak their interest and they 've always liked these !
4 #### Not much to say , seems like good food and the fish like .
4 #### This is a good all around Koi food at a decent price that we 've ordered for years and which our fish happily devour . We do mix in food sticks and pellets from other brands to provide variety . NOTE : Strangely enough , our recent purchase of a 2.42 lbs bag arrived with a torn opening on the side of the zippered closure . We did n't discover this until we tore off the sealed top . Since there was no obvious visible issue with the food itself , we decided not to bother with a return .
2 #### Not sure how to review this . I have bought other flavors and it 's just fine . I did not realize this had beef livers and pork plasma in the ingredients . Skipped right over it , I guess . Absolutely do not recall reading it in the ingredients list . My one cat is allergic to beef and the other just wo n't eat this food . It 's my opinion a poultry product should just have poultry ingredients in it . That 's why the two stars , that and because my cats just do n't like it and I 'm stuck with a whole case of it . Twenty - four bucks down the drain . I ca n't shop at brick and mortar stores , have to order online . It would be better to be able to just try a couple cans at a time instead of having to buy a whole case just to try it out . Try to feed them healthy foods , get punished in the pocketbook .
2 #### My cats do n't eat it at all , it would be useful as they are fat
5 #### The ingredients in this are great , my cat loves it , and I could n't be happier !
4 #### The food is a lot drier than other brands we 've used , so I warm it up & mix in some water before feeding our cat . She likes Wellness , Evolve , & Newman 's , and she 's usually pretty interested in this one , too .
5 #### My dog loves them ! And they seem to be a healthier alternative to store brands .
5 #### I do n't love these but my dogs do , they go nuts when it 's treat time , even if they are going in their crate to get them . I now make sure I have several bags on hand so that I do n't run out .
2 #### Maybe it 's great , but my cats wo n't eat it . I think cans of this size are best suited to households with several cats . According to the label , one can is good for about 16 lbs of cat per day , if they are fed exclusively this food . If one feeds both wet and dry , as we do , a can could last two or more days , by which time it 's not so fresh . Anyhow , going by the label , the ingredients look good . To me , it does not smell awful . When I get the chance I am getting rid of it by feeding it to stray dogs . A few have eaten it , but none has seemed as excited as I thought they would . Cats do have their own tastes . Neither of ours will eat this , but yours might love it .
4 #### My vet deems it to be the healthiest thing to feed my kittens , but they are n't all that enthused by the flavor , and do n't eat it all in one sitting . The dry seems to go ever well though .
5 #### Our puppy LOVES this food ! We mix it in with dry food and she gobbles it right up . It comes in great packaging too . The cans are super durable and are easy to open .
1 #### This dog food did not sit well with my dogs . Both dogs had extreme gas , upset stomachs and runny poops . I would not buy this dog food again . Back to the Diamond Naturals for them !
1 #### My dogs ate it because they were hungry , but there was no enthusiasm . Their poo stank , and my oldest guy had loose stool ; what a mess to clean up . They were eating Diamond beef with rice , but got tired of it . I have found another brand that they like . I have to get rid of the rest of this large bag , a little at a time . I wo n't buy it again .
5 #### Our very chewy dogs love these and do n't destroy them ! Lots of nubs and strange areas for them to chew on . They want these over any " bones " we buy . Great for larger dogs or ones who demolish things in seconds .
5 #### I do n't know what it is about these chews that my puppy loves , but love them she does . I love that she gnaws on them instead of my belongings . I also sometimes spread peanut butter on them for when we leave or need silence .
3 #### I have n't noticed any improvement in their teeth , but they seem to like these chew toys . I have a 7 lb dog and a 20 lb dog and they both chew on these regularly , even though the toy appropriate for the 20 lb dog is a bit large for the little guy .
4 #### Dog loves it but a lot smaller than I expected .
5 #### Cats love it , it 's healthy and so both I and my cats are happy .
5 #### My Koi LOVE the Vibrance food ! I have to give them the Spring / Fall kind once I start feeding them in the Spring , which they will eat , but once I can finally switch over to the Vibrance , they act like different fish - way more excited about their meals . As a matter of fact , I 'm praying they make it through the winter because I overfed them a lot last year and they were FAT at the end of the season . I could n't help it ! They would get so happy - acting that I hated to stop tossing the stuff in the water !
5 #### I 've tried other foods with my Koi , but this is the one that they go to every time and apparently do n't get tired of it . No matter what time of day I feed them , the product does not remain on the surface for more than a few minutes . My fish are living in a large aquaponics tank , and they remain happy and healthy on this diet ( along with a great filter system ) .
5 #### This cat food is priced at a great price point . The quality of food that you 're getting at this cost is almost second to none . I did a lot of research into cat foods for my furry baby , and I can confidently say that this brand is one of the best . Your cat deserves a healthy diet and wet food gives that to them . It 's more filling than dry food , has more water content ( cats do n't like to drink water but need to in order to urinate properly ) , and this particular brand comes in many different flavors . At this price point , and the added convenience of Amazon delivery , there really is n't another option than to get this food for your kitty . I can assure you they will thank you for your decision .
1 #### I am giving this product one star not for the quality of the cat food but for the deplorable condition of the cans . I 've been ordering cases of this cat food through Amazon for awhile . Every case comes through full of dented cans and it seems to be getting worse . This is not a problem with Amazon 's shipping as the dented cans are all packaged in the interior of the case as if the manufacturer is hiding the bad cans from view . After many years of using Wellness I may have to switch to another brand .
5 #### I had a large breed puppy that was being bottle fed and we started weaning him onto milk from a dish at 6 weeks and introduced solids around that time . I did n't want him on the large breed puppy kibble because he was not big enough to chew the pieces at 6 weeks . But I could n't start him on small breed puppy food because then he would not be getting the nutrition for his size to grow and maintain a healthy weight . So I went with the general puppy chow for all sizes of puppies and the kibble was small sized so he ate it very well . He grew magnificently from eating this food .
5 #### Great puppy food . I fed it to a large breed puppy when he was weaning and it did him very well .
5 #### Fussy puppy gives thumbs up ( so to speak ) . What would it be ? Dew claw up ?
5 #### i bought this like forever ago and the dogs still love this bone , its mostly gone by now , but they wo n't give it up will get another soon
5 #### The bone is very good quality holds well the price is cheap
1 #### My dogs rejected these completely . I did n't want to have wasted the money so I even put peanut butter on them trying to entice the dogs to play with them . They licked off the peanut butter and ignored the toys . I do n't know why . They have many toys and are not usually picky , but just did not want these
4 #### My sweet little pitbull still has n't destroyed this dino yet , so I approve . He usually tears through his toys in hours , this thing has lasted months .
5 #### I 'm very happy with this product , my husky has a sensitive stomach and is super picky
5 #### Great puppy food .. We fed this to our Bulldog until she was 9 months old
5 #### Love this food for both indoor and outdoor . The product was estimated to arrive today by 8 pm but instead it is a day or two away and I ordered on 11/8 and today is 11/17 . Go figure .. and a separate later placed order has already arrived
4 #### Do issues with this fish food . Looks really orange , but the fish are biting , so they must like it . I like that it is an airtight resealable bag .
5 #### I purchased this for my mother 's picky eating cat . Her cat loves this pate and you ca n't beat the price ! I 'll definitely be purchasing more !
5 #### What a great deal on canned cat food ! ! My kitties absolutely LOVE this and I have nine of them ! !
5 #### This is the only brand of food i feed my dogs and I 'm very happy with it . My last dog lived to be 14 and my current dog is over 15 so I feel Hill 's must be meeting their dietary needs . It also keeps their stools firm and causes no stomach upset . Further , compared to many super market brands , Hills is much less greasy in the storage jar , which is a big plus for me when serving it . Amazon did a great job delivering this quickly and safely , but the shipping box was not well reinforced with packing tape and the seams were nearly open upon arrival .
2 #### While this food was highly recommended by 2 different vets , my 4 - month old Shih - Tz puppy 's stools were quite liquid - like for 3 weeks . I even added a probiotic recommended by the vet . I started transitioning to Nutri Source for Small & Medium Breed Puppy ( 25 % Nutri Source to 75 % Science Diet ) and my puppy 's stools almost immediately became normal ( no longer liquid - like ) . The jury is still out on Nutri Source as it 's only been a couple days , but I 'm hopeful this alternative will be our solution . BTW , I do not give our puppy any table scraps or canned food . The dry food is his only diet .
5 #### My daughter loves this ! She eats it for dinner every night !
5 #### Vet had me switch to this . Fixed her stools so there is no blood or mucus in them . Vet recomended
5 #### Puppy loves it . Small pieces and it seems to be digested easily . Plan to order more .
4 #### It took a couple days to get my kittens to eat this , since they like friskies , and fancy feast . I 'm so glad they finally came around ! This sutff is so much healthier for them , and their digestion has gotten much better .
5 #### My Momma Kitty and kittens seem to prefer this over plain chicken . It 's a high quality kitten food .
5 #### Excellent dog food for seniors but TSC sells the 50 lb bag for $ 25.99 . Amazon , what 's up with the higher price ?
5 #### This was a different gift for our dogs and they like chewing on them . Keeps them busy .
2 #### This one did n't pass muster . After fighting over possession for half a day , that was the end of it , and I have chewers ! Even being a cool dinosaur did not save this Nylabone -- it lives a very sad and lonely life in the toy basket now .
5 #### Dogs love these , they are very durable and interesting to the dogs and fun to look at , only draw back would n't buy them for very large dogs . 30 pounds and under should be fine but you know your dog . My dogs are small so they ca n't get these caught in their throat .
5 #### Good consistent quality . Both My Girls lvoe the food , and my " pudgy " kitty is dropping her excess weight and geting healthier . Most pleased !
1 #### I would buy it if it did not contain carrageenan .
3 #### The food is good quality , comes in big portions , and stores well . Unfortunately , after awhile , it made my cat throw up after each meal so I had to get rid of it . Initially it was great so I 'm not sure if I got a bad shipment or what changed .
5 #### Great brand for kitties ! They have been eating this canned food with the grain free dry for six months . Switching kitties to core wet and dry to switch things up for kitties , and giving them some variety . Cuts down risk for f po od allergies offering variety as well ..... thank goodness there will be more variety to offer when they are cats then kitties ! Slim picking now .
1 #### my cats will not eat this food . I put it outside for the stray cats and they will not eat it either . I find it odd since the dry food I put out is eaten very quickly . I tried to return it or get a credit but this item does not qualify for that . I bought the beef and chicken formula . I am disappointed because this is the second or third organic / natural wet food I tried for them . They do n't like any of them . oh , the dog will eat it though .
5 #### dogs loved it needs to be broken up for puppies with teeth
1 #### These are the only treats my dogs have all ever turned down .
5 #### My dog LOVES these treats , I break them up for her because she is a little older but they 're great .
5 #### I honestly do n't know what it is that my dog loves about these so much . He is a standard poodle - 65 pounds . These are a good size for a treat for him . I have n't actually measured , but I would guess about 1 X 2 inches . I 'm not looking to give him a meal ... just a treat . For training I will break them into several pieces . He is not a " chow hound " and does not get excited about food or most treats , but for some reason he absolutely loves these dry , boring looking cookie / bones . He will do anything for them . Go figure ... A friend gave him a bag for Christmas and after he had the first one , he started spontaneously doing every trick in his repertoire . He was sitting , standing , laying down , spinning and offering hand shakes . Absolutely unprecedented behavior for a non - food motivated dog ! I was happy to find these on amazon as they are n't in my local pet stores . Since they are dry " biscuit " style treats , they are also less yucky to keep in your pocket when you are out and about . I hope he does n't get tired of them !
5 #### My puppy loves this ! I can tell a difference between cheaper food , she stays fuller longer and it helps with the -ahem- gas issue ( got ta love those Frenchies ! ) This was recommended by my vet and I plan to continue with Hill 's Science Diet . Plus this is by far the cheapest way to get it , several dollars cheaper than the pet store !
5 #### Puppy , teacup poodle 2lbs , loves it ! I just have to chop up the chicken a little bit for him but he loves the all the flavors ! ! Will continue to purchase
1 #### So far I 've opened 3 cans and my dog will not touch it . It has a sour smell to it and the product looks like it has shrunken away from sides of can . It is the exact same food I 've always fed him just in a larger can . The other case I bought is just fine and smells like it should but SOMETHING is diffidently wrong with this food ! I will not buy this again ! You can see in photo below how it is shrunken away from can .
5 #### This product has allowed my little guys to grow and thrive into medium sized koi in a few short months .
5 #### Pate is best for older cats . My 19 1/2 year old loves it ! A small amount each day keeps her hair ball free and happy .
4 #### cats like it and it arrived in good shape
3 #### It is the best food on the market for the price that I have found . The cats are getting tired of it though . I need a suggestion for a different cat food .
2 #### Wish I had not bought so much . It is a pate ( mash ) that does not inspire my mutt - cats . They prefer kibble . However , my dog enjoys robbing this from the cats and scarfs it right down .
5 #### This food is great if you have a lot ( more than 2 ) of cats , and ca n't spend heaps of money feeding them . I buy the pt variety because the other kinds my cats tend to just eat the sauce / juicy bits . These are the larger cans - still the short cans , but the large version . Cat food people should know what I 'm talking about - there are the little cans and the bigger cans . Anyways , I love that these are on Amazon and on Subscribe and Save . However I am sure my UPS man hates me .
5 #### My cat loves Friskies ' pate , and is a pretty picky eater . I love being able to find such a great price on these !
5 #### My cat loves it but to be honest , she thinks anything that comes out of a can is a special delicacy ( she only gets one can a day and has dry food otherwise ) , so she may not be the best critic ; she 's more of a furry glutton .
5 #### Great product for Puppies . My German Sheppard loves it
3 #### I have over the past few months received cases with popped cans . I had to throw them out .
5 #### I got these for my " Elderly - Kitty " Trying to improve the quality of food Modifying to be free of Grain ( especially corn and wheat , as well as only NON - GMO foods ) to help Him live A Longer and Healthier Life with us ! He had been hving a sensitive Tummy frequent vomiting , so I got this to see if he could keep it down .. he loved it .. but I am using it as a supplement every 3rd day or so along with " CORE WELLNESS GRAINFREE KITTEN- PROTIEN FOCUSED NUTRITION with pre - pro - biotic Enzymes sprinkled -a Tiny bit on each ... AND HE HAS BEEN GIVEN A NEW LEASE ON LIFE .. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO LOSE HIM .. THESE , WITH colloidal Silver 30ppm in his water dish ( about 1/4 cap ) I THINK HE 'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY AROUND A BIT LONGER ... EVERY DAY IS A MIRACLE AND HE IS FEELING SO MUCH BETTER , EATING and only 1 throw up in 2weeks ! ! ! Thank You for Pet Food Manufacturers who have taken a stand for the rights of our animals and -Now provide healthy Alternatives to Enable them to Live Longer and Healthier Lives ! ! ! So He 's a Happy Cat Now ! ...

5 #### I have a Bengal and Bombay kitty and I love both of them dearly . I am the shopper who stands in the aisle and reads labels . I make sure the food I give them does n't have Carragenean , BHT or any other ingredients that have been questionable to give to cats . I am also cost conscious , I have two kitties to feed and I do n't want to pay $ 3 / can when they eat 4 cans a day at a minimum . I saw these in Petco and after being satisfied with the ingredients I bought a few cans to feed to my fur balls . They are big gravy lovers and hate pate style food . I have also given them Hills Science Chicken and Gravy and they would always leave a good amount in the bowl . When I gave them Nutro Max , they loved it ! Licked their bowls clean ! They seem to love the Lamb and Turkey and the Seafood and Tomato Bisque the most . At $ 17 for 24 cans , you just ca n't beat that . The ingredients are great and I trust Nutro as a company to ensure my kitties are getting a good diet . If your kitties are gravy lovers like mine , they also have a large selection which is nice because I do notice my kitties enjoy different flavors .
3 #### My cat only eat this . The tomato bisque is the only food that he enjoys , and I 've tried a lot of the more expensive fancy looking cat foods out there ! Update : 9/24/16 I had to change the food because my cat developed an allergy it seems . I do n't know if it 's directly related to the food , he had this issue before with another food brand- fancy feast . either way , he liked it for a long time
2 #### Our dog loves nylabone but she does not seem to like this one . She has hardly touched it since we got it for her .
5 #### Dog loves this ! Had it for 9 months now and he still chews on it every now and then .
3 #### My dog loves the plastic chew toys , but this one was never his favorite . Its nice because it does nt smell or leave behind an odor . It also does not leave behind large chunks of plastic as he is chewing . Its pretty durable and has held up well . Not sure I would buy this again as its not a favorite for him . He recommend the plastic wishbone
5 #### My dogs love this toy and it is super durable .
3 #### My dog ignores it completely .... asked me to give a mediocre review .
5 #### I have a 6 - month old Chiweenie puppy ( Chihuahua + Datschund mix ) and she absolutely loves this food ! Based on her whining and excitement when I feed her , it has a great taste to it ( not that I 've tried it ) and her coat is healthy and shiny too . I would n't expect anything less from a Science Diet product and this surely does not disappoint .
5 #### Science Diet dog food has always been my dog food of choice . Three little dogs were raised from puppyhood to adulthood on this food . Rarely a Vet bill except for the normal shots . Very healthy and beautiful dogs grew up on this food . However .. this last little one who will be 1 year in June , has stopped eating it and wo n't touch it . I am not sure why . I have tried all sorts of ways of fixing it . I feed both the dry and wet food .. in different bowls . He prefers the cats food to his own and I am at a loss as what to do . So .. reluctantly I am changing . That being said .. I would still highly recommend this dog food as it has served my pets well . I am now looking for a food that will appeal to my little Yorkie .. and so far .. nothing but the cats food will do .. and he CANNOT have that . Wish me luck !
2 #### Not sure why my cats do n't like this brand when it got the best reviews .
2 #### The products 's freshness is hit or miss . Some case show up looking good , but the last one and one other time , look old . When I opened it , it 's discolored . I wo n't feed old food to my cat .
5 #### This is a great cat food . Our very , very finicky kitty thinks it is wonderful and very delicious . What I love about it is that it is made from human - grade meat and made in the USA . I recommend this cat food highly- since it gets 5 stars from our kitty :)
5 #### My cat loves this food , and it 's really the best price per OZ I could find .
3 #### I like it cause it 's grain free , but the cat refused to eat it after the first can ! It 's kind of icky like peanut butter . So , it was a waste of $ 30 . You 'd be better off going to pet store and buying a couple different cans to test out first . Lesson learned ! !
4 #### I think this is a great product . It 's high quality nutrition . I am disappointed at the number of cans that were dented . I realize it 's " just cat food " , but it 's a bad idea to use food from damaged cans , so I 'm not happy about that part of it .... and thus the reason for less than 5 stars .
3 #### My dog did n't care for these much . They are also quite hard .
5 #### I accidentally wrote the review for these on the dry food . This is the only food my dog can eat beside the prescription kangaroo and lamb , so the fact that there are treats at all is incredible .
5 #### I have bought this for years . I do n't like the bag as well as bucket but because of price I buy this and separate it into other tight containers . Fish gobble this up
4 #### Works as advertised ! Puppy liked it in the beginning but I switched over to Earthborn . They are grain free .
1 #### I purchased this brand because it is what the breeder used ; so , we thought it would be good to continue . Not too longer after using , my Goldendoodle puppy began having diarrhea and frequent trips outside . We switched to Fromm Gold Holistic and my pup has not had a problem since . I do not recommend this product .
5 #### All dogs ate it with few complaints . I think they prefer the Diamond natural line better . Just was checking when I ordered last was very disappointed to see in just a couple of months price increased over 5 % !
5 #### 5 star rated food on dog advisor , my dog loves it , best deal out there .
5 #### Holds up to my pit mix ... Nylabone seems to be all he can have without destroying it in under 5 minutes .
3 #### I wish the purchasing person could pick the shape . After all , we know our pets best . This did n't work out .
1 #### its not destructible but she does n't like the lack of flavor of any kind . the flavored one she did n't respond to much better ...
5 #### These are great for the dogs to chew on and they are not real expensive . We have two mini - schnauzers and a goldendoodle who all like them . They have little bumps on them so they are n't smooth like some Nylabones . We ordered three of them and because you do n't get to choose what style you get , we got two of the same . It really did n't matter what they looked like because the dogs like them .
5 #### Of all the cat food brands and flavors this is the only one our picky little rescue girl will eat . After finding her and emergency vet care and fluids , it was important to get her to eat . Even after refrigeration it remains tastey enough for her and she is now recovering well .. She even preferred this over the R / D purchased at the veterinarian 's office .
5 #### My cats do like this food and it seems to be good for them .
5 #### My 6 month old kitten loves the beef and chicken formula . He eats all of it and licks the bowl clean ! I mix this in with his kitten dry food and he eats it all . No issues . Great price per ounce too when we order the 12 - 12.5 oz cans .
5 #### This is the only food my cats will eat . I buy several cases a month High quality at a price much lower than what I can buy in any pet store . Thank you !
3 #### Because I ca n't taste it , I ca n't give it less than 3 stars . I just have to give it 3 because my kitten did not like it much at all . He took a few bites and then walked away . I gave it a good try , but he did n't want anything to do with it . My kitten is 4 months , so his appetite is good . Just not his cup of tea .
5 #### Great price , comparable to cost of Unleashed & Petco . Thank you .
5 #### This is the third time i ve purchased this for my dog and every time we recieve it she reacts the same . She goes nuts sniffing the bag so excited . She still loves it !
5 #### I like that I can get flavors that do n't come in the variety boxes . Very convenient for an addition to my cats ' diets .
5 #### Good cat food ( for the cats obviously ) and at a good price
5 #### My cats are n't a huge fan of pate cat food but they seem to enjoy this one . They get 1/4 a can each nightly . Anymore than that and the litter box looks like a WW2 battlefield with many casualties . Quite horrific .
5 #### These treats work well for my 1 year old GSD . She has an extremely sensitive stomach and a chicken intolerance . These treats do n't contain chicken or egg , and they have n't upset her stomach at all . I went with the ones for small dogs even though she is 60 lbs , since I wanted them to be smaller treats . They will last us a long time too !
3 #### Thought these were great until I noticed my dog immediately drinking water after eating a treat . Never seen him do that before
5 #### Our new rescue puppy was raised on this food at his fosters home . To avoid tummy upset we continued him on this food . He seems to enjoy it and his stools are medium soft on it . We will eventually wean him off of this food and onto kibble but for now this seems to provide the nutrients that he needs as he grows . It 's a good quality food that is easily digestible . I 'd recommend it .
5 #### Good inexpensive pretty foods from the Diamond Company , I love their stuff !
5 #### food great the the prices on here just ai nt right they fluctuate way to much it should be like that for dog / cat foods
3 #### I have an Alaskan Malamute who is a heavy chewer . I threw this in my cart as an add - on and it 's okay . My dog does n't seem to love it , he does n't hate it either though . It is pretty rough and it has made his mouth bleed before so I ended up taking it away . Might be okay for another dog but it did n't really work for ours .
5 #### Our puppy 's friend had a " communal dinosaur " that was one of the toys all the dogs could share at puppy play dates and our pup loved it so much we got him his own . Still one of his favorite ones . The nylabones hold up so well , even for heavy chewers and through teething .
3 #### I love the idea but after a few mixtures I have to take this away my puppy 's mouth will be bleeding .
2 #### I have a 1200 gallon pond and 6 koi . one is a 2.5 ft butterfly koi and everyone else is around 14 - 18 inches or so . they Loved this food . I am no longer a fan . it took a few months of feeding but it has started to turn my beautiful white koi Yellow / orange . looking through the reviews I realized that this is a common thing . also , it turned out beautifully bright yellow koi a very " goldfish " kind of orange . even though I still have a fair amount of this food left , I wo n't be feeding it anymore . I hope their colors go back to normal after we stop ...
1 #### Package was impossible to open without tearing it up . Food looked like and supposedly was the same formula as the color sticks but my fish got sick and threw up the food after 2 days of eating it . One fish did not recover . Spend the extra money and buy the color sticks .
5 #### The fish go absolutely crazy over this food . They love it . From now on , we wo n't be buying anything else . And I love this big bag -- what a bargain . Only downside is the zipper broke pretty quickly , but no harm done . It 's just a zipper . The quality of food and the bargain is what we appreciate most .
5 #### Both our kitties love this ! The ball on the outside is just as fun as the scratch pad in the middle ! We sprinkled a little cat nip in the scratch pad and it is a draw for them to scratch and play . Definitely a good purchase and we recommend it !
5 #### My cat loved this as a kitty and even now as full grown
5 #### This turbo is really cute ! Though my kitten still did n't know that the middle part is for scratching , he certainly enjoy playing around the ball !
5 #### My dog loved this treat and he pretty much chewed it up in a couple of days .
5 #### My labrador does n't chew on things so I do n't know why I keep buying this kind of stuff .
5 #### My puppy loves it and I feel like she 's getting a quality food .
5 #### Our puppy has been eating this food since we adopted her and she loves it . The pieces are small and easy to chew .
5 #### I have used this dog food for a while now and it has served my adult dogs and puppies needs . I appreciate the prompt delivery through PRIME ; when going through the breeding stages with my Great Pyrenees twice a year , it has been a huge timesaver having it delivered to my door . At the height of the feedings for the puppies , I was going through 2 bags a month or more of this kibble . I do wish they could sell this food in larger quantities for those of us who need more than the normal bag . I use this as the base for the puppy gruel ( soaking the kibble in hot water ) , add in Oatmeal and closterium and a few other nutrients and it works great ! We fed 10 puppies and 2 adults during the post whelping periods . I recommend this kibble to our clients .
5 #### That homes in the border collie really like this product . Price could be a little more competitive or get the sales up on it . I love to getting this product when it was on subscribe and save but no longer since it 's not on the program .
2 #### We bought this because our puppy was eating this when we got him . It is very unhealthy as the first ingredient is chicken by product . It does not contain any real meat , yet corn and wheat , which is not good for dogs .
5 #### Great food for the price but TSC sells it for $ 28.99 less than half of what it cost @ amazon come on guys get it together .
4 #### The taste is not quite as high as some of the best out there - my other dog food is grain - free Biljac which seems slightly higher quality - but the added nutrients here can build a great base food for an athletic dog . A bit of a strange taste ( if you try your dog 's food , that is ) .
3 #### Unfortunately the pates ' are beginning to bore the crew --- nose in the air -- tail up -- walks away
4 #### My cat used to like it but no more . :-/
5 #### This is quality cat food that is much cheaper than Petco .
5 #### I can only speak for my cat , as I have not sampled this food . Milo gobbles it down with great gusto , and afterwards appears quite contented . He then retires to his bed to nap . So , I believe Milo would give this food a ringing endorsement .
5 #### I researched cat food for such a long time before trying out Wellness with my little Agent DiNozzo . I had a cat with urinary crystal issues in the past , so I knew it had to be grain free , I never wanna see a poor cat so ill like that again . I love the ingredients , the lack of cheap fillers , and I like the company and what they stand for . Helps that DiNozzo loves it , too . So glad to find it on Amazon , the price break is fantastic . I bought a tiny kitchen scale so I can use the larger cans for additional savings .
5 #### My cats like it , and the ingredients are what we were looking for .
5 #### My koi love this stuff . I do n't really notice any improvement in coloration , but my koi ca n't wait to eat these little sticks . They gobble it up like it 's their last meal .
5 #### When my dogs love something , I love it too . My dogs love these . I love that they are made in the US with limited ingredients ( not a bunch of " fillers " ) .
5 #### Aside from its non allergic properties , I know 3 dogs who love the biscuits .
1 #### I have been ordering these treats for years . This package of treats is so hard I am afraid to give them to my dog . Usually , I have been able to break them in half . These are so hard I am unable to .
5 #### Oh , wow .... I 'm glad I purchased this .... purchased it for a Chocolate Lab & a Boarder Collie .... both of them love to chew on it , it has last for about 2 months ! ! Great chew toy , it 's a very hard plastic so they can really get down and dirty on their chewing ! !
5 #### Our large dod has been gnawing on this for 2 months now & barely made a dent in it . Nice hard material , just watch your toes !
3 #### My dog has n't put this down since he got it ! !
5 #### I got this for my pit bull . She is a chewer but rawhide bones cause issues cause my 3 other dogs want them too and then they all get attitudes with each other for looking at their bones . This has no food flavoring that I can tell so she can and does chew till her heart is content and the other dogs do n't care . She will lose it and find it later and it is brand new all over again . I did worry about her injesting the plastic because she was actually chewing it up(the Dino lost it 's head and tail pretty quick ) but as my hubby pointed out she has passed much worse things than a little bit of plastic . Will be buying another soon .
1 #### Ridiculously hard . Dog wo n't touch it . Plus , its heavy for a puppy . A Doberman puppy . Pass this one up .
5 #### We have used all the Diamond dog foods -- from the time ours were puppies until now . I also buy and ship it to my sons . The dogs love the taste -- they used to be picky until we found this brand .
1 #### 1st ingredient soy products , meat by products . All crap for your dog . Cheap food with cheap fillers . Was so shocked after reading label . Strongy encourage if you care about your pets health , stay away from this food
5 #### Good Dog / Cheap , Better star rating then the High Priced Brands , Look and see .
5 #### I feed this dog food to both my mini doxie and my 80 lb pitbull and they both love it . I mainly have a hard time feeding foods to my doxie because he only eats really small chunks and this kibble is the perfect size for him . He no longer chokes on his food .
1 #### I mistakenly did not look at the ingredients before I bought this . The 2nd ingredient is corn which there is perhaps none that is not GMO ( genetically modified organisms ) free . I could not even feel right about giving this to shelter dogs . Since I 'd already opened it , I just put it all in the trash . If you are looking for even a moderately healthy dog food for your furry friends , I would choose something else . ~ and no corn , please , for your best friends . If there were a choice for no stars , I 'd choose that .
1 #### My original review of this product was my dogs loved it . Today I 'm changing the review due to concerns from our recent purchase . We have been feeding the pups this propac food for maybe a year now . When my husband and I first opened this new bag of dog food , we both said " oh gosh , what is they smell ? ? " It had a STRONG smell what I keep labeling plastic . I ca n't put my finger on it . I thought it was just us being weird . I proceeded to feed the dogs , they did n't eat . it 's been a few days now , and it seems as if they just hate this food . They eat what they have to and are done , whereas they usually clean the bowl . I 've tried it with coconut oil , their vitamin mix , and even cheese and they just will not eat it . I am not sure if the bag we received is expired or what , but it concerns me . I 'd love it if the seller would email me .
4 #### i like it to the extent that my dog has n't popped diarrhea and see her fur is healthy and shiny just the bits are small llike for small puppies
5 #### Our dog loves the flavor and the big meat chunks ! It has a pull top too which the ones at the store do n't offer !
5 #### Good quality dog food with hardy bits and chunks . Actually looks and smells appealing , even to people .
5 #### this is all my cats eat they love it
5 #### This is on my subscribe and save . I have never had issues with this product and it 's so nice to have this delivered at a reasonable price .
5 #### They go for it , seem to really like it .
5 #### CATS LOVE THESE - WILL BE BACK FOR MORE WHEN WE RUN OUT . THANKS ! ! ! !
5 #### My cat knows his package , he loves me more when he sees his supply
5 #### Bought as a Prime Day deal . My koi absolutely love this food the best . And you can feed this in spring and fall if you live in colder areas , too . I 've tried other foods , which they will eat , but if you want to see a feeding frenzy , feed this , om nom nom .
4 #### I am a veterinary technician , and I buy these bones religiously for my younger dog . She is a very high energy dog , and this works like a pacifier for her when she just gets too excited . She chews on it aggressively and obsessively , and it keeps her busy for hours at a time , if I need to get something done without her underfoot . Now - this bone is not good for all dogs . My girl is young with very healthy teeth . She 's a three - year - old Heeler mix on a special diet , and we brush her teeth daily . So , her mouth is in MUCH better shape than most . As a result , she can handle these bones without a problem . But if you have an older dog , a dog with weak teeth or gingivitis , or a dog with a history of infections / illnesses / complications , this bone is not a good choice and will lead to broken / chipped teeth and mouth infections . For those dogs , I would recommend buying CET Enzymatic Chews instead . But for my dog , this is perfect !
5 #### I mix this with Diamond Maintenance 50/50 to help put some weight on my dogs when needed . I just wish the prices were more stable . Sometimes I see it listed in the $ 40 range then all of a sudden it 's $ 70 .
4 #### my dog loves the diamond brand , its the best quality food for an affordable price and sense i have a BIG dog affordability is important . i want to keep her healthy and well fed and now i can do that with out going broke
5 #### This is by far an " undiscovered " kibble for many that are buying over - priced kibble . Was raised on a ranch & my parents bought this @ the feed store many years ago . Kept using it for my dogs ( typically Dobies ) and as always they live a longer , healhty life with lots of energy , shiny coats and enjoy the food . I have actually tried other , higher priced brands & some dogs got the " runs " , others threw up , etc . So back to a tried and true brand they love . Love the subscribe & save aspect as well .
5 #### I just recently bought a Maine Coon kitten whose breeder used this brand of cat food . The breeder specifically recommended the brand because of the high protein content . All I can say is that the little demon loves it so I guess I am happy .
5 #### Other than that this is n't raw ( which is what I prefer for my cat ) , this is great . It has a consistency slightly coarser than pate . It actually smells good , is made with human grade foods , contains no grain , and my cat loves it . He does n't like much , but loves this turkey and the Wellness canned kitten food . This actually smells yummy when I open it . Maybe it 's because turkey is my favorite food and I 'm a natural carnivore who is trying really hard to be vegan for humane reasons .
5 #### My kitty likes it and it seems like it has good ingredients for what it is . If Manticore is a fan , so am I !
5 #### I have been using this food for my cat who had urinary health issues and was on Hill 's CD prior to this , and I could never stomach the smell . This is great food and my cats have had no issues since starting this food . They love it !
5 #### Better value than our local stores and delivered to the door .
5 #### Good ingredients . My cats like it . There 's not many healthy foods they like .
5 #### My Maltese loves these treats and I like that they are healthy .
5 #### Always looking for a healthy treat for my two small dogs . They are both under 15 lbs . and this size was perfect for them .
5 #### I have a pocket blood hound , and he loves these .
5 #### So happy this is available through Amazon as I have a hard time finding it in the local pet stores . Effect for my dog who 's on a specific diet . And he happens to love them , so that 's perfect :-)
5 #### I am not a dog , so I ca n't vouch for the taste , but my dog loves it . My local source for this dried up , so this is the way I have to buy it now .
5 #### My dogs like this because of the mini size . They eat with relish !
5 #### I feed this to my Pekingese and he eats it all every time . I love to find higher quality food for our pets that is also affordable .
5 #### The best puppy food there is . Even the Puppy wet food ( chicken and barley ) is very good and easy to digest . Also , my puppy loves these two ( dry and wet ) a lot more than 3 other high rated brands that I 've tried .
1 #### Every can was damaged even though it was in the case . I did n't pay this much for damaged goods . I am almost afraid to give this to my dog . What if the damage is from bacteria from a bad batch causing the can distortion . If I wanted to buy damaged goods I would n't be paying full price . Not ordering this again . DISGUSTED ! ! ! ! !
4 #### Love this but more important , my furkids love it
3 #### Big dogs maybe , but not for my prissy little Shih Tzu , makes their face dirty from the gravy
5 #### My 11 puppies and their mother love this food . The mother more so than the puppies right now simply because the puppies are still in the beginning stages of weaning . Edit : Still purchasing this food for my 3 puppies and they 're still loving it . They can easily go through a bag a week . The grown dogs enjoy the food as well .
1 #### Dog refused to eat this one and other Hill 's Science products . They just do n't like the taste .
5 #### Great product . Lower price than local pet stores and much lower than veterinarian office . Expires in 2018
5 #### Great product . Lower price than local pet stores and much lower than veterinarian office . Expires in 2018
5 #### The ONLY toy that Daisy the Dog can not destroy in a day . A drawback is that one can not play " tug - of - war " with the dinosaur and the dog as its spikes are painful to humans . Note : do not leave this dino on the floor where one can step on it in the dark . That really hurts .
5 #### Always a favorite with the dogs and they last even with tough chewers . Ca n't beat the price .
5 #### Best value for dollar based on reviews / analysis of dog foods at Dog Food Advisor website . Right to the door for this price is amazing . Dogs love it but they eat deer droppings .
5 #### I do not know a whole lot about dog food , but I try to avoid corn because I noticed it makes my dogs stink . This very much looks like a quality dog food in its texture , from the ingredients listed , and the fact that it 's not bone dry like some of the cheaper dry foods . It reminds me of some of the premium brands in its color , texture , and .... this is a bit gross , but the compactness & darker color of what came out of the dogs after they started eating it ... ! I like it , the dogs are eating it and doing well on it . I will definitely be buying it as their regular dog food from now on . The price is probably better than the other store premium brands because there is no advertising . I recommend it .
4 #### I got this for a large American Bulldog . He likes it and it is good quality at a fair price . It does have corn in it but at least corn is not the first ingredient . This is good basic dog food , nothing fancy but it 's a bargain and it actually smells like it is edible . The cheaper dog foods smell vile and toxic , this smells like actual food and the dog likes it and is doing well on it .
1 #### This dog food has all the ingredients you do n't want in a dog food - corn , by - products , etc . For about the same price , Diamond has their Naturals line that is MUCH BETTER in terms of quality . Diamond Naturals Puppy food does n't have corn or by - products . I honestly do n't know why Diamond puts out this awful dog food when they can make quality ones for right about the same price - given the choice , who would take the one for less quality ? Our puppy was on this when we got her , we bought a small bag and slowly changed her food to the Diamond Naturals for Large Breed puppies , and the difference is fantastic . We 'll stick with the Naturals , and never have her go back to this variety .
5 #### This was a great deal as a supplement to and sometimes the main meal for my sister 's Koi . She has a little pond with about 8 Koi in it , and I ordered this to see how they would like it . It turns out that this economical package of Koi food lasted a very long time and the Koi love it .
3 #### If I feed this in the can my cats ca n't reach all the pate . For some reason they can never get to the lowest material on the opposite side . I switched to shreds , bits or any of the loose varieties and they empty the can .
5 #### I order this monthly via the Subscribe and Save program . All of my rescued cats enjoy the three flavors , and the price is very affordable . THe pates are not overly watery , and they can be thinned if needed for special needs cats .
4 #### Great value . My dogs get some of these each day as a special treat . I like that they are small , because it help prevent over feeding .
3 #### This is a product I 've ordered regularly because my dogs are on a limited diet , but the quality of the delivered goods is unpredictable . This time , as has happened before , most of the treats are broken . The dogs love them , but piecing together enough portions to make up a whole biscuit is annoying .
5 #### Bought this for the first time recently based on the reviews and they 're great ! My pup absolutely loves them , and it 's a good amount of treats for the money . I also like that it does n't have a bunch of fillers like some of the cheap brands of treats . Those kind make her have diarrhea later , these do n't . We bought the venison and sweet potato , ca n't wait to try more flavors !
5 #### He Loves it .. and I do to .. just right for our dog with allergies .
5 #### Great product . Lower price than local pet stores and much lower than veterinarian office . Expires in 2018
4 #### Not great for larger dogs or hard chewers . These are really cute and if you buy them as an add on are a great price . My smaller dog really enjoys them and they are safe for her to play with .
5 #### We have 4 of these dinosaur chews and all of my dogs love it . It holds up very well for heavy chewers .
4 #### This is a good strong toy for a dog that like to chew a lot . But I have a seven pound yorkie and this is a little too heavy for him to carry because it is solid .
2 #### Great toy in theory , buy my dog ( 8 month old weimaraner ) wo n't play with it . I 've even tried rubbing peanut butter on it , he just licks it off . I originally got him this toy when he was 4 months old and though he would eventually grow to like it as he become a stronger chewer , but no . He prefers pig ears , pizzle ( bully sticks ) , rawhides , and the rubber used to make Kongs and the like . YMMV
1 #### Too hard , dog ignored . Other reviews say their dogs cracked their teeth . Would not advise .
5 #### Everyone wants the T - Rex , but the dog is happy with her stegosaurus that she received . The thing is SUPER HARD SOLID PLASTIC and is actually quite HEAVY . I have no idea why she likes the thing , but she always chews on it . She loves the thing and will buy another once she wears this thing out ... it may be years ....
5 #### These are the favorite dog toy of all three dogs in the house . They love to chew these things for hours in the evening . They last much longer than rawhide bones do and provide excellent ROI . I only wish that when placing an order the seller would send 3 of the same design as our dogs prefer the T - Rex over the stegosaurus . How they can tell the difference is beyond me but our lab , Shepard mix , and husky always go for the T - Rex when available .
5 #### My dogs love this food , and the Newfie at least is a picky eater . It 's a high - rated premium food , and the cost here on Amazon , with Prime , is outstanding . It 's pretty much the best of all worlds . My dogs approved the preceding message . Well , they actually said " Woof . " But I speak fluent dog , so I can confirm that 's what they said .
5 #### I often struggle to find time to get over to buy a high - quality pet food at my local ' big box ' pet store ... no problem with Amazon Prime ! 33 # 's of great ProPac food delivered to my doorstep within 48 - hours . My full - blood mutt LOVES this stuff and I 'm happy with it based upon the ' end ' product and digestive ability . Her coat shines and she 's a happy pooch . Two thumbs up for high quality feed and for Prime !
1 #### I have four cats and only one of them tolerated this and just picked at it even when I did n't offer anything else for an entire day . The overweight one did n't even try it and she 'll eat most anything . I wo n't buy it again .
1 #### Unfortunately my last order of this came to my house rotten . I just thought at first I was extra sensitive to the canned pet food smell , but then one of my 3 cats had diarrhea , another started vomiting after eating it , and the third cat would n't touch it . I loved having the convenience of ordering online , and my cats loved this good quality food . But after one shipment being all dented up , and the replacement being rotten , I 'll buy local at Petco .
5 #### My cat loves this food and gobbles it down . In fact , I have to separate his feedings so he does n't eat too fast and get sick .
2 #### My cat did n't really like these . Sort of a waste .
5 #### My cat loves this food . I just recently switched to an all wet , grain free diet for my cat and she loves this food . I do wish this came in a variety of diets , not just all chicken .
5 #### The kittys that I am fostering love this kitten food . The price was great and I got it within a two days ! I am fostering two kittens and I only give them one can around 4 pm in the day , but leave out dry food so they can eat during the day while I am at work .
4 #### This food is a good value , and good consistency . Has good ingredients . My only problem is it does n't seem super appealing to cats . They will go for it if you heat it up a little , or mix it with other food , but they are n't overly enthusiastic about it . That 's good enough for me , but there are a few out there that my cats go nuts that fill most of those positives , except none of them have the value of this one . So yeah , trade off . Have n't found my 5 star yet .
5 #### One of the best foods for your cat hands down . You ca n't beat the price . If you go to Petco or Pet Smart , you will pay abut $ 3.39 a can depending on what flavor , this only works out to be about $ 2.29 a can , so a big savings .
5 #### Consistency is smooth and my kitten loves the taste . He never leaves any food in his dish . A winner for us . We will keep buying .
2 #### As other reviewers have commented , the quality is inconsistent . My cat LOVED 22 of the 24 cans and I had to throw the other two away . The texture / color was different and I assume the flavor was as well . She took two bites and opted for dry food .
5 #### Purchased this food for my Dog that just had puppies and she seems to love the stuff quite well . Hopefully the 11 little on s love the food as well as she does because the price is actually pretty decent compared to the stores in my area .

4 #### Good price for this food . My puppy loves it !
3 #### We switched to this food because our vet carries it , but it caused loose stools and our dog did n't seem to care for it as much . We 're switching back to Blue Buffalo .
2 #### One of my dog 's gums bled while chewing this sharp item . Another dog enjoyed it and it kept her occupied , butI am concerned about the pieces they chew off . They likely swallow those pieces and how safe is that ? There are better , safer things to chew and clean teeth . Look up the CET chews . Marrow bones in the butcher case are better and offer nutrients as well . I would not buy any Nylabone chews ever again . Do n't be swayed by the low price . You get what you pay for .
5 #### My medium and large dog always love these . I constantly and buying and replacing .
2 #### much smaller than I expected and my Dane is n't super interested .
5 #### My dog loves this stuff . He loves how it 's in such a strange shape . Bites it everyday ! !
5 #### I have a Lab / McNab cross who is a heavy chewer and needs a lot of stimulation to keep from getting bored . Nylabone is an excellent product and this toy in particular keeps her occupied for hours because she loves the shapes and edges to chew on as well as the little nubs . I know she wants to gnaw them off and works on it long and hard but the material is very durable and while she eventually is able to scrape a little off it takes a long time . She is n't able to get chunks off that could cause problems if she swallowed them . Highly recommended .
2 #### Bought this product due to positive reviews but my dog wo n't even touch it . He does like the chicken flavored Nylabone chew which he got to try out while on a doggie playdate . So I guess " the original flavor " on the Dino chew is either too bland or has no flavor at all .
5 #### I stock up on these multi packs when I know bad weather 's coming . I live in S.E. Massachusetts . So , it 's either hurricanes for summer or nor'easters for winter . That 's when these come in handy when I ca n't get to the store as readily as I want . The flavors are what I refer to as " basic " flavors . My flock likes all three .
5 #### I stuffed these into a plastic toy ball for my new puppy .
4 #### If you are tired of lugging around huge bags of food or not able this is not a bad deal . Our dogs responded well to the food . Did not over or under eat and looked and smelled good while they were eating it . If you are looking for really small kibble this is an excellent choice because the pieces are tiny . It does probably cost a bit more than it would off the shelf , but the convenience is great .
5 #### My vet offers this pet food along with another top brand . My vet of 14 + years suggested Pro Pac to me about 5 yrs ago and my dogs love it . I 've never heard a bad thing about Pro Pac : no salmonella scares or dogs dying from eating it like other brands you may have heard in the news . It 's all around a good pet food at a fair price .
5 #### 8 - 11 - 13 I have been using this for over a year and really like it . I put this out to feed some outdoor animals as well as my own and find that both the dogs and cats like it . The price is right so I can afford to feed the outdoor animals as well as a variety treat for my own cat and dog . Would recommend it .
4 #### Ok puppy food . There is better on the market . Grain free is best for Golden Retriever puppies .
3 #### My dog hates the food and throws up every time .
5 #### I 've tried cheaper brands and my cats ( Bengals with sensitive stomachs ) often end up getting sick . They do well on this cat food - they vomit less , their coats are shiny and they are generally in better health . I did try downgrading their food for a while to save money but it was not worth the vet bills that ensued . I have decided that it 's better to feed them quality food and pay the little bit extra . The only complaint I have is that for some silly reason , it is cheaper to buy twelve of these 12.5 oz cans than it is to buy a case of twenty - four of the 5.5 oz cans of the same exact stuff . I normally would feed two 5.5 oz cans a day .... so I am paying less money to feed them 12.5 oz a day in the large cans vs. 11 oz of the same exact stuff packaged in two of the smaller cans . In essence , I am paying less and getting more food by purchasing the larger can . That said , I do n't like having a can standing open all day ( even refrigerated ) and would rather feed them two fresh 5.5 oz cans a day - so would be happy to see the cost of the 5.5 oz cans come down to match the cost of the larger cans .
5 #### My cats love it ! It is expensive but healthy well produced product . Grain free is my preferred . The cats do n't always agree and they love this one .
2 #### for the price i think you can get a much better food for your cat - the ingredients are not the best and the cats thought it was ok tasking
5 #### One of my good friends is a top Persian cat breeder . We get all of our cats from her . As with a lot of older folks , our fur babies are treated as honored members of the family . They treat us as staff , as the old line goes . Nothing is too good to keep them in tip top shape . I do a basic " recipe " that they have eaten their entire lives . It has raw hamburger , egg yolks ( cats ca n't digest the white ) , Wellness chicken cat food , vitamins / minerals and V-8 juice . While my friend mixes it up " fresh " for her cats ( she has a lot more ) , I usually do a two can recipe and freeze it it smaller packages to defrost as need be for our two cats . They like it a lot . It subsidizes their dry food . One of our cats turned 16 years old in May and the other was 11 . They always get great checkups , so it must be working . This was a personal purchase and I paid full price .
4 #### Great when the price is right . Sometimes cheaper at the pet store . Cats love it .
5 #### My 5 year old and 5 month old kitties love this food .
3 #### I purchased the Savory Venison Chunks version of NUTRO MAX CAT . My cats wo n't eat the little spongy squares of meat , they will only lick the gravy type substance from it . Not a good purchase if they wo n't eat the cat food . I 'm still searching for a healthy alternative that they will love .
5 #### My cat likes it . :-) I have n't tried it personally
3 #### smaller than it appeared . more brittle than most nylabone chews
3 #### My large Lab was n't impressed with this . Might work well for a smaller dog .
5 #### My Bo.son Terriers have not been able to destroy this
3 #### was a decent price , dog became bored with it after a few hours and have n't touched it since .
2 #### Its durable , that 's for sure , but my dog quickly lost interest in it .
5 #### Nothing better than cat food on the doorstep in winter .
5 #### We have many cats that we have adopted . They this wet food . The 5.5 oz . cans are a much better value than the 3 oz . cans .
5 #### Better than Nine Lives any day . Great price too .
5 #### As I have stated before , this is my cat 's favorite cat food brand as long as is pate texture .
4 #### Puppy likes it , but she prefers her brother 's food , of course .
5 #### When my papillon puppy was very small , this was the only dry food that was small enough for him to eat . He loved it then and still loves it !
2 #### I did n't anticipate that the very first ingredient in this LID " Sweet Potato and Bison " treat would be " Potatoes " , with sweet potatoes later . I suppose that 's what I get for not examining dog food labels for a whole one second . Sweet potato comes later . BTW , skins of immature potatoes are a very bad thing for dogs .
4 #### Healthy option for treats and the girls love it .
3 #### My dog likes these but every time I buy them at least 30 % is broken pieces and crumbs . These treats are not cheap , so I would think that fewer pieces would be broken .
5 #### This is a great dog food . PRO PAC does not the mislabel its ingredients like Blue Buffalo . PRO PAC has natural ingredients . Dog Food Advisor gave it a great rating . It keeps my dogs ' poop firm . I love getting a healthy dog food for a great price . Now , I feed my dogs the PRO PAC Nut'R'Nipz Dog Treats , so my dogs can enjoy a healthy treat in between feedings . My dogs love the PRO PAC dog food and treats . I highly recommend both .
4 #### I have fed numerous dog foods , but when my normal bag went to $ 47 for 37 lbs , I tried Pro Pac . Pro Pac gets a great rating on dogfoodanalysis and at $ 28 & free shipping ( not normally available in my area ) I just could n't refuse . Everyone talks about corn being a cheap product - have they checked the grain markets the past few years ? My dogs do well on it & considering the price I do n't feel like I 'm " cheating " them . I 'm on my 2nd bag & ordered 4 from Amazon ; so far they 've retained their coat & tone .
4 #### My dog breader was using this food so I purchased it so as not to throw the dog off . But I later found out it 's not the best stuff for my chocolate lab . But it 's a big bag and last a long time . Price was good , and the dog ate it ! No negatives !
5 #### This is the 3rd time I 've purchased this product and its a no brainer . Why purchase over priced dog food in local markets when you can get the best quality at a lower price shipped to your door for free !
5 #### Cats are slowly warming up to it . Nice , but they may be too old to get real excited about it .
5 #### Kitty loves it very much , she even sleeps on it !
5 #### The color I got was pink - Purple - ish .... wish it was blue because I have a male cat but does nt matter because he finds it fun and its interesting to watch and play LoL good exercise for your feline cat .
1 #### sorry , a ; ; four of my cats will not eat this pate food
5 #### I only wish it was organic , i ca nt find any organic wet kitten food ?
4 #### my cats liked this ... they did n't do cartwheels over it but they ate it . The ingredients are very good
4 #### I really wanted my kitten to like this . I have always liked Nutro products and our dogs ate their food for years . The ingredients look great and flavor should have been spot on . But he would n't eat it . We tried a couple times and he just walks away . He is on the finicky side , wo n't eat any fish , and wo n't eat this either . I am bummed but do n't believe it 's the product , I think it 's my kitten . ETA : I contacted Nutro to explain how my cat wo n't eat it and they have a guarantee and will refund my purchase price . Fantastic company and customer service !
5 #### I have an older cat and two kittens . This is the only food that they will eat . They seem to love the chunks . I have paid lots of money for more expensive brands , but I go back to Max Cat since it is the only food that they will eat .
1 #### was not what I expected , dog does not even like it that much
5 #### At first when I saw the toy , I was n't very impress with what I get . This toy is tiny . But when I gave it to my then 6 - months old beagle puppy , she loves it . She will play with it everyday , even after a tiring day at daycare . My beagle is a powerful chewer , and I swear that she could be pretty destructive . But with this Nylabone Dino - bone , it 's still perfectly in tact . Be warned - DO NOT LEAVE THIS LAYING AROUND THE HOUSE . If you accidentally step on it , your poor - feet with suffer with the pain for awhile . Do n't say I did n't warn you . * winks *
3 #### My Shih Tzu pup did n't much care for it , but my dad 's girlfriend 's Collie shredded it to pieces ! , so I guess someone enjoyed it ! It was cool anyway .
5 #### Second time buying these . The first one lasted about 4 months ( 4 months to 8 months ) and was still about 3/4 of the way intact but the head and tail were gone so i decided to renew . They are very hard and knobby and my chocolate lab seems to absolutely love it . She has a hard time choosing between this and the nylabone tree branch .
1 #### My puppies hated these things , they would not pay attention to them and would run if I tried to get them to play with it .
5 #### Oh my , My chewer is happy these days ! She is tiny and this is a perfect challenge .
3 #### My dog loved this but she chewed through it pretty quickly . I loved the dinosaur shape , but it was too easy for her to chew through because of the shape .
4 #### My dog enjoys this food although she likes it when I wet the food and stir it . My vet recommended I purchase science diet . I buy from Amazon since it is cheaper . I am considering changing food since my havanese of 9 m does n't seem to be as interested in her food as she used to be . I 've tried science diet w / d prescription and mixing it too because she 's had loose stool with blood . All testing shows no problems . I wonder if it 's the food . I will update later once I try another brand with more protein and fiber content . Thanks !
5 #### My pup is not picky when it comes to food , but he does love it when I put this in his Kong and freeze it . I like that it has the chunks of meat that can fall out and the broth means it freezes really well . It keeps him engaged for a good long while so I can go to the store and he does n't feel left out . I like that he eats better than me . Lol
5 #### I have a 9 month old yorkshire terrier ... male ... He eats this every day twice a day . He likes the taste and the small bites .. which are easy for him to chew . Science Diet is the only brand of dog food I purchase for this dog and my small senior dog too . It contains quality ingredients .
5 #### I combine this food and another puppy food , and my pups do wonderfully on the combination . I have tried other foods , but my chihuahua babies , just do better on this food , and the other one I mix with it .
5 #### My kitties love the flavors - they love the pate also a lot
1 #### ... and they always conspire to steal the cats ' food . It 's probably not a good sign when your cat tries to bury it , litter box style , either . I only bought this , because being disabled , I ca n't always get out to a store . This was not worth the wait , plus the corporation that owns Friskies is all sorts of evil .
5 #### My cat loves this so this is what I get for her .
5 #### I order these all the time , my fur babies love them , big bag for a good price !
5 #### Heavy and so nice to have a clean one ! My cat loves it too . I use the plastic bag inserts which also came from Amazon , and I just pick up the bag full and toss it , never touch it with my hands .
3 #### My cat uses this box to pee in but insists on pooping on the floor next to it . I doubt it has anything to do with the box . The box is fine , it 's my cat that 's crazy . I do n't understand why she does that . The box is deep enough for even bigger cats .
4 #### For the price , a pretty decent litter box . Flexible plastic , but not as big as I had hoped . Great that the sides are " taller " than normal . Keeps the litter from scattering .
4 #### This is an excellent product , but be sure to check the dimensions well , before ordering . I eye - balled the dimensions and ended up with a box that was too big for my cat . No problem , as I gave it away to a friend , but just a friendly suggestion for future buyers - check the size !
5 #### My koi love this stuff ! I really do n't notice any change in their color , but they eat every piece in minutes .
5 #### My puppy loves this food . He has never had any stomach issues while on it .
1 #### Dog would n't touch this . Spits them out even if given as treats .
4 #### My dogs loved it at first , then after 2 weeks wo n't eat it any more . I fed it to them other night for dinner only .
5 #### My dog loves it best price you will find .
5 #### Great option for our puppy ! He loves his stuff . Plus , the pricing ca n't be beat by brick and mortar stores .
5 #### Nice a hard , but my Scotty is n't interested in it if she ca n't tear it apart or eat it , she loses interest .
5 #### You ca n't beat these little things . Our dogs are strong chewers and they love them . It takes a good year or so for them to whittle one down to maybe part of a tail being gone or something . It comes off little at a time so no choking hazards for us . We own several of them and they love them . I will always keep a couple around .
2 #### The photo is misleading ! I thought you would be getting a pack of these and you only get one .
3 #### Our dog was not too excited about this product , but he does chew on it a little
5 #### My cats love friskies & I do n't have to worry about running out by buying cases .
5 #### cats are not complaining - prices do change and need to be checked before re - order .
4 #### Mama cat and Little Bit enjoy this food ; but as their style some is left behind for the other cats in the area .
5 #### You wo n't find Nutro in the Supermarket , reason being - consistent quality costs . Excellent cat food . This particular flavor my especially likes a lot .
2 #### Only one of our 6 indoor and chubby cats even made an attempt at eating this ! I was shocked because their diet is usually dry kibble , and if they get canned food it is usually received as a treat and gobbled up . But the other five just sniffed at it and walked away ! I must say the food was rather chunky and I tried mashing it up a bit for them , and it did n't have a very appealing smell . Now I am left with about 20 tins of this stuff and only one cat that will eat it . Must say I am very disappointed and I wish I knew what it is that is turning the others off this food :(
1 #### This stuff is HORRIBLE ! ! I started using Max Cat when I got my new kitten and for the convince of not buying two different cats foods I transition my 5 year old cat to this ! Biggest mistake in the world ! This has grains and vegetables in it my cat over 4 months started a allergic reaction to this food and went from a beautiful ball of fur to a half bald cat with scabs all over his back and sides ! After multiple vet calls Meds and visits I 've went back to His GRAIN FREE cat food ! I am now transition the younger kitten away from this product cause He is now showing allergic reactions to this food now ! Cats are CARNIVORES they eat meat ! To this day I 've NEVER SEEN my cat go into a garden and pick a vegetable or eat grains so why do you put them in your food ! No wonder cats and dogs get diabetes now ! !
5 #### My cats and my mom 's cat , adore this cat food . It is a high qualify food , smells good and looks good . Even my picky Siamese goes crazy for it which is a surprise since he " hates " most cat foods , dry or wet . Price is good too . I order a few cases a month .
5 #### My adult cat was too skinny . She was barely eating so Vet recommended kitten food . This was the only kitten food she ate . Now this 12 - year old cat has been revitalized and has reached a healthy weight . She is healthier all around and eats regularly . This Wellness kitten food created a 100 % improvement all around in her health .
5 #### My 19 year old cat began having reoccurring bladder infections . I used Licks Urinary Tract Care ( comes in packets , which I squeezed into her mouth ) and HomeoPet UTI+ ( 10 drops onto her canned food ) . In addition , I changed her food to Wellness and Purina Pro Plan Focus Urinary Tract Health Formula ( both canned and dry food ) . Much to my surprise it worked !
5 #### I researched for months on a quality food to feed my cats . Finally settled on this . Wonderful brand with great ingredients . I feed them the dry food too . They love it
4 #### This is the only canned food I can find that addresses the issues of my cats with urinary issues one of whom has multiple allergies to foods . They seem to like it well enough . I will continue buying it .
3 #### Not a favourite with my three cats but this brand is often recommended by people in the pet food stores . My cats often would n't eat it so it was a bit of a waste .
5 #### Great chew toy ! This toy works great it 's been about a month and he 's hardly chewed off the head . My only complaint is that stepping on this toy is like stepping on 1000 legos , on fire covered in fire ants .
3 #### We 've gotten this style for years , but like the smoother ones with no bumps better
5 #### The pups love this dino - themed Nylabone , and we love it because it is much sturdier than the bone - shaped originals ! Will be buying more soon .
5 #### Oh my ! We got 28 goldfish in our 450 gallon tank pond and they turn into little piggies when we feed them with these sticks . I 've read some other reviews that say this food will tint your white fish a bit yellow . I can say that yes some of my fish to get a yellowish tint , while some do not . I am using less and mixing with other foods to reduce the yellowing . Although I do n't really mind and neither do the fish .
5 #### Awesome food . The fish live it . And especially great price .
5 #### My dog loves this food . I will purchase a larger bag next time .
5 #### My 3 month old pug Stella just loves this food !
5 #### Purchase this for our new puppy . She loves it ! Small pieces and is ok on her stomach .
5 #### This is good quality food for dogs . My dog loves it .
5 #### I mix a 1/4 can with my dog 's kibble from time to time and he just loves it . His sensitive stomach ca n't handle SD kibble , but is fine with the canned stuff .
4 #### Puts a different twist on the traditional nylabone . Always a great product . Only wish we could pick which dinasour is delivered .
4 #### My puppy did n't take to this in the beginning and after teething , he loves it . Because it 's random , we got a brontosaurus and a stegosaurus . Our dog chewed the heads and tail off the stegosaurus , so hope you do n't get that one .... brontosaurus still going strong ! Hoping for a t - Rex next time .
5 #### It has been great , our dogs love it . It 's so far lasted , we have a Cocker Spaniel and a Chi / Italian Greyhound mix . Although he 's only 20 lbs , the mixed dog has dagger teeth and ruins everything given to him . It has had heavy use for the last month -- and so far so good !
5 #### This is a great chew toy , the pup loses interest but it 's great for his teeth !
3 #### Depends on what your cat likes . Ours likes Fancy Feast better . She needs to gain weight so we feed her whatever she will eat .
5 #### My cats love this brand of canned cat food and the price is fantastic . This is where I will be getting all of their canned food .
3 #### Good price only on subscribe & save . Otherwise this is within 2 cents of Wal - Mart pricing . Since you can return dented cans to Wal - Mart with no problems this is an issue when paying full price on Amazon . Otherwise on Subscribe & Save Amazon recommended highly But Amazon seems to take this off subscribe & save at times which is frustrating . Only recommended if on subscribe & save as a 5 star . Otherwise as only 3star if NOT on subscrive & save . Product itself is good & kitties enjoy . Issue here is Amazon pricing if not on subscribe & save .
5 #### HUGE litter pan . That still does n't stop my cats from filling it up as soon as I clean it . Holds almost a full box of litter when plenty of room for your kitty to find the perfect spot to do their business .
3 #### It 's not very moist , but the cat loves it
5 #### Kittens love this food . Good Quality . And great price on Amazon . Just make sure you are home to accept the delivery ... you do n't want to leave the canned food out in the sun , as I did that once because I forgot about the delivery and the kittens would not touch it . It spoiled .
5 #### My dog that eats the same LIT Dog food by Natural Balance loves these . Really glad to have them . The other dog fight for them , but they are special for the one dog .
4 #### A bit bigger than I was expecting but my boys seem to really enjoy them . I have been happy with this brand as a whole for grain free treats .
5 #### Natural Balance LID Snacks for my puppies ! Glad I can get these online because my local pet stores ca n't seem to keep in stock !
5 #### I product I regularly buy . However , I should have purchased the one for small breeds .
5 #### I 'm really choosy about what I feed my animals , and Wellness is a highly respected brand , so it is one of the few that I will give my cat . I also try to avoid grain ( especially if not organic , but even if ) in my pets ' foods . Typically , I had been buying Wellness 3 oz tins along with Organix 3 oz tins , at Whole Foods . That was great for picking up a few cans at a time , but it was getting both pricey , and inconvenient . So , when it occurred to me to search on Amazon to have a case of cat food shipped to me , I was pleased to find this food that I was already using . That it is available on Prime , and is more than * 40 cents per can less * , was quite a bonus ! Of course , none of this matters if the cat does n't like the food - but happily he * loves * it . Great food , from a good company , at a good price , right to my door with no shipping . And the cat loves it . What more could I ask ?
5 #### Excellent quality ingredients ( fits vet recommended " first three ingredients must be meat , and not by - product or broth " ) . Cats love it . A little more expensive but it is so rich in real food that they will need to eat far less ( compare to cans with a lot of liquid ) .
5 #### The food smells very fresh and my two kitties absolutely love it . I was told by the foster mother of the kitten I adopted that she does n't like wet food of any kind , but ever since I introduced her to this when she turned 6 months old , she starts crying for it as soon as I pull out the can . No digestive issues or upset stomachs from this . I have a water fountain for them , but I added the wet food to their diet to ensure they stay hydrated . I have gone in stores and their prices are much higher and do n't come in a pack . I 'll continue buying these packs because the cats love them so much .
5 #### I have two 4 month old pups that are super finicky . it would take them an hour to eat the dry food and one of them was n't finishing . I started adding just a little to each pups food and now they finish all of it in less than 5 minutes . Also it looks like real food not the mushy stuff you normally see in canned food .
5 #### Have fed to three of our dogs over the last ten years . Dogs love it and they have always been pretty healthy .
4 #### Only the best for my pups . Vet and owner recommended
5 #### I have used Hills Science Diet for years but I may stop,,,For the second time several cans were dented . This was done inside the clear packaging ... not clumsy handling so it must have been done before packaging . The dog food is fine my dogs have always liked it . ( 15 years )
5 #### I actually use these for my cichlids and my huma huma triggerfish . I used to use them for shubunkin and had some leftover so i tried it with my other fish . All my big fish like them
2 #### Same as with other pet food cans . Some were damaged and leaked on the others . A real mess .
4 #### We have 9 cats , so we buy a lot of cat food ! We keep dry cat food available at all times , but also feed an evening meal of canned . I got tired of having to go to the store so often for canned food ... we were always running out of it , it seemed ! So , Amazon 's " Subscribe and Save " to the rescue ! Nothing can compare to the convenience of having a month 's worth delivered to your door ! The price is great , too , especially with the 15 % discount from Subscribe and Save . The only complaint that I have is that our cats do seem to tire of the brand and these 3 flavors . If I purchase something different from the supermarket , they seem so much more interested ... I think simply because they are tired of the same old , same old . I guess I just wish that I could order a bigger variety for the same price .
2 #### The package came as advertised . Same quality as always .
4 #### This is a bone our Golden Retriever has been interested in for quite a while now . Cute how he revisits it . Tough .
3 #### too small . I must have not payed attention to the sizing of the chew .
5 #### Great if your dog likes this kind of toy . My dog did n't care for it . Does n't make any noise.and she ca n't tear it up . LOL
3 #### My dog loves nylabone bones , but she does n't seem to like this one very much . She has chewed on it a few times but not nearly as much as her other ones .
1 #### My puppy hates these and refused to eat more than a bite but maybe you 'll have better luck lol ! The price was good , it arrived very quickly , and the product was just as described , as well as matched the picture- so no complaints , just so happened that my dog did n't like it !
4 #### I did not personally eat it but my puppies always seem to enjoy it ! !
5 #### Arrived ahead of schedule and exactly what I wanted . Thanks
4 #### Good quality food . My cats both enjoy it but sadly one of them seems to have an intolerance to something in this food and she ca n't keep it down . I 've tried a few other brands and this is the only one so far she has had a reaction to . If your cat has a sensitivity I would suggest a different formula . I think for now I will stick w/ grain free brands .
5 #### We have a rescue kitten who loves this kitten food .
5 #### My 3 cats love it and if they like it I 'm happy .
5 #### My cat had never tasted duck , as far as I know ( who knows what she does all day ... ) and is very finicky , often leaving most of a can behind for the garbage . She cleaned her plate the first time after her first serving of savory duck . She smelled it and was not one bit suspicious . Since then , she has left some on her plate but usually eats more than half . Maybe I need to get her more flavors . Maybe she wants more variety .
5 #### The cats seem to love the lamb and turkey . They eat it very fast . My cats give this a 5 star rating . Yum Yum ! I am very happy about the price I paid too . It is worth it .
4 #### Well my cats kind of liked it . The chunks are a bit too big for there liking . There not the greatest at chewing , To many trips to the dentist . So most of the food gets left for the pup too clean up . I 'm happy they tryed it though that 's a plus . I 'll try this brand in pate next .
1 #### My two kittens would n't touch the food . Love the Nutro Kitten Soft Loaf though . Not sure if they 're picky or something in the ingredients is off with Nutro Max Cat Kitten .
4 #### My 10.5 lb . cat is very fussy about using a litter pan . With his prior litter pan , he would not go more than once without meowing loudly to have it emptied . It was not possible for me to clean out the litter each time he used it . ( I clean it out once a day . ) Plus , he was making a mess scratching out litter all over the floor . This larger pan was a godsend for both of us . There is enough litter for him to find a clean area in which to poop / pee . And the sides of the pan are high enough for him to not scratch out the litter all over the floor . The pan is very durable and a good value . I highly recommend it .
5 #### This is a nice litter pan and I have two of them . However , I have just ordered two jumbo pans with hoods because my cats knock too much litter out of the box . They 're very large cats .
5 #### Good size treats , and it is nice to have the limited ingredients option .
1 #### Unfortunately our 10 lb 10 month old puppy wanted NOTHING to do with these treats . They 're hard crusty treats . She eats just about anything and it was a surprise when she rejected them entirely . We found a soft baked treat that she prefers . We obviously opened the bag so they ca n't be returned .
5 #### My kitty enjoys this food , and it 's cheaper than what I can get it for at the store . This makes a good meal for my cat along with dry food . I have ordered this many times and each time it has arrived in perfect condition without a single dented can . My cat goes crazy for this food every time he hears the can open . I am actually going to order another package now !
5 #### Five stars because my cats love this food . I 'd give it zero for myself because every single can was badly dented ! All 24 cans were bashed in .
5 #### Monthly delivery to a local animal shelter . No complaints .
5 #### I absolutely love prime pantry boxes ... don't have time to shop and do n't even like going out to do it anymore ... have a home business that keeps me working to much ... I shop for 5 to so it is a job in itself ... PRIME Pantry is a more than fair price ... just plan them right & it is wonderful ...
4 #### I have noticed the consistency differs between batches - sometimes it seems more " solid " other times more " foamy " . Other than that I am very thankful for this stuff ! My male cat was getting UTI 's because they were fed kibble and apparently not getting enough liquid in his diet . After switching to Wellness that has n't happened once . Only one problem ... he will ONLY eat the turkey version . And refuses any other brand even if it 's turkey . My poor female cat will have to eat this the rest of her life ( she 's fat , she 's ok with it ! ) because he loves it so freakn much !
5 #### My cat has been on this food for almost 7 years now . Had no problem at all .
4 #### This is a high quality , grain - free cat food that my cats enjoy . My only complaint is that the can does not have a pop - off lid , as most other brand current cat food cans do . And the lid is a hard one to open with an opener . It snags badly in two places and takes a lot of back and forth with the opener to get the lid free . The first two rows of ingredients are all just wonderful , which means the greater part of this cat food is excellent . The meats are listed first and are whole meats , not byproducts or meals . Excellent ! Also , this includes the most expensive , highest quality iron : iron proteinate . There were only two poor ingredients that I found : Dicalcium phosphate is a calcium supplement , but can cause digestive and intestinal problems . It is commonly found in prepared breakfast cereals for humans , in pharmaceuticals as an inert ingredient to bind tablets , and in toothpastes . It contains carrageenan , which is used as a cheap binder / filler in canned pet foods . This is also often used in almond and coconut milk for humans , and research shows it may cause digestive and intestinal problems . My cats did not show any signs of those problems when I fed this to them , so that is a good sign . I would buy this again , if it were not for the darned lid .
4 #### I judge cat food by three factors ; quality , price , and cat . Per all the research I 've done , this food gets high quality ratings . The apparent quality of the food out of the can lives up to expectation . Cats are sleek , healthy , alert , and energetic on this food . There have not been any issues with vomiting or bowel problems . The price on the large cans is excellent for a high end cat food . I 'd love it if I could get it at a grocery store price , but I ca n't reasonably expect that . Both cats rated it good but not great . They accept it , they do n't love it . I 've seen much better reactions from them on " whole " foods ( Soulistic and Tiki ) . It 's a pate food , so this is not surprising . One problem , and this may be a shipping not a supplier problem , is the dented cans . So far none have been more than slightly dented , however this alarms me .
5 #### My boys enjoy this the best of their dry foods . They are picky ! !
5 #### My new cat , Pepita , really likes this food , which was given to her in the Humane Society of Huron Valley . I could not find it locally , and am glad I found it on - where else- Amazon.com ! She also enjoys her wet food , but if her dry food bowl is empty , she will cry for me to fill it ! What really pleases me is that she likes both foods that are extremely good for her ! ! !
1 #### Bigger pieces than what I buy at Petsmart . Cat has been vomiting for 2 days . Will only buy from Petsmart from now on .
5 #### I 'm currently switching my dog over to science diet . It smells better than the food she currently eats and I know it 'll be good for her body and coat .
5 #### Love Science Diet for my puppy . Have used it for YEARS with no complaints . So much cheaper to buy it from Amazon . Add the fact that I do n't have to lug the 30 pound bag home from the store and we have a WINNER !
3 #### My terriers are strong chewers so I thought these would be ideal . As it turns out , these are made of a much harder material than expected so they do n't get much use . They would be great for dogs who are even stronger chewers than mine .
5 #### My dog absolutely LOVES these nylabone dinosaurs . I think we are on our 8th one in the past two years . It takes her at least a month or two to get to a point where it is not recognizable anymore .
5 #### Lasts a long time , even with my strong chewer . Other dog totally uninterested in it , however .
4 #### I 've been purchasing nylabone products for years now . Our 40 lb pit bull , Thunder Snow , loves them and this bone is no exception . It keeps her busy and out of trouble and helps keep her teeth healthy . She does prefer the more bones shaped ones with the colored , and texted middle section but this is a close second . The nylas can get expensive but amazon does have great deals on them . Sometimes I find little plastic shaving type pieces in / on the carpet but nothing a vacuum ca n't handle . Beware though .... if you step on this while walking through your house in the dark you will let out a string of four letter words loud enough to wake the neighbors 3 blocks over .
1 #### I NEVER GO THIS ORDER IT WAS SENT BACK FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON .
5 #### I love this because there is enough in a can for each of my cats to have some ! These are great flavors , and I prefer the pate because the gravy or sauce ones go to waste . My cats lick up the gravy and leave the meaty bits . Do n't know why , but I hate the waste .
5 #### My cats love Friskies ! I have tried many other types but this is always a consistent winner and you know how fussy cats are ! When you find something they like you stick with it . The variety pack keeps them happy . My one cat is over 21 and calls every morning for her Friskies !
5 #### My rescued from the street and a life of crime 4 month old female kitten loves this food , has gained an appropriate about of weight , plus a much better looking coat . My older cats try for a mouthful every now and then , so I know it 's tasty .
5 #### Cats never seem to tire of this and I rest easy knowing they are getting the nutrition they need .
3 #### My kitten likes it , but she is very particular .
5 #### My cat seems to be very happy with this particular moist cat food .
5 #### My dogs wait by the cupboard EVERY evening until I " fetch " their treat . Andy has food allergies - he can eat this combination of bixon with no problems .
5 #### All of the biscuits arrived in good shape . My 14 lb min - pin LOVES these . They are the perfect size .
4 #### These are some of the best hard treats I have found for my big dog . I like they have limited ingredients because so many treats today are just junk and full of all sorts of yuck that our dogs do n't need .
5 #### My cats are obsessed with this toy . They play with it constantly . Only downside is that the replacement cardboard inserts are actually more expensive than the toy itself .
5 #### My golden retrievers like these bones . None of my dogs are heavy chewers so the bones last for months . They are easy to keep clean . I hope the little " spikes " are helping to keep their teeth clean .
5 #### My 5 month old lab / hound mix loves this food . Vet was very happy to hear this was what we were feeding her . Arrived in a secure box in two days .
5 #### Maybe not grain free ... but my very expensive french bulldog has not stomach ache or gas with this old fashion , well balanced food
5 #### Use this to mix with the dry equivalent dog food . My retriever mix gobbles it up immediately when served . Hill 's makes excellent products and I know my pet is getting the best ingredients .
5 #### This is a very good product . My pup unfortunately did n't tolerate it well , but that is due to what we suspect is an allergy .
5 #### My Maltese and Goldendoodle dogs LOVE all things Nylabone , including this toy . And they have sparkly - white teeth ! The vet always comments on how clean our dogs teeth are , and we do not brush them , just rely on Nylabone and Booda toys .
3 #### Our 30 pound cockapoo really ca n't get into this , its for more serious chewers I guess . It 's also hard and noisy when he throws it around , and I 'm afraid it will scratch our wood floors , so we had to take it away .
4 #### So far this is one of the only dog toys that has lasted with my dog .
3 #### I bought this for my cats who usually eat 9 - Lives ; Friskies was cheaper . They do n't care for it . Back to 9 - Lives . Cats eating again .
1 #### This review gets 0 stars . The reason your cats like this food is because it 's basically like giving a child candy . It 's so bad for them and they make it taste so yummy that your cats ca n't get enough of it . If you read the ingredients you 'll see " by - products " . In case you do n't know what that means , it 's unspecified animal parts from slaughtered or diseased animals that 's not suitable for human consumption . Purina does n't care about your pet and what it eats , they care about making money off of you for their horrible product , do yourself a favor and do n't buy brand name food for your pet , there are much better brands out there that are way better and not badly priced such as Fromm , Precise Holistic , Nutri - Source , Zignature , and Natrual Balance . Do n't let your animal eat by - products , cause I 'm pretty sure you would n't eat it yourself .
5 #### we love our pate 's , they eat it all up , it provides the moisture they really need , the better brands that are grain free , or more nutritious if they do n't get eaten , it does n't help and cats need the moisture , dry food is not enough , older cats suffer kidney failure due to lack of moisture and good nutrition . I feed a high quality dry food grain free , and mix my Friskies with a higher quality can , we mix it up a bit . they love their Friskies .
5 #### My cat , Elizabeth , loves Friskies Pate and Amazon offers them at a great price .
5 #### My Koi scarf the sticks down , so it must be tasty to them .
5 #### If buying this size you know your fish already like the product . Advice : buy the product in the TUB version first and then use this less expensive bagged version to refill .
5 #### use this for my koi pond - their colors really do come out more with this food .
5 #### This is such an excellent source of nutrition for our cat . She has eaten this all her adult life and loves it dearly , especially the smooth " pate " version . This is the best cat food product on the entire market , hands down . There are NO by - products , no bones , no feces , no garbage in this . It 's 100 % pure meat , and we could n't be happier with it . We will never feed our cat anything but Wellness .
5 #### Kitties love it , and it 's good stuff . Stay away from dry food !
5 #### This is the only food we feed our ragdoll cat . He has had urinary problems in the past so we have eliminated dry food in order to keep him very well hydrated . Since starting his food several years ago , he has had no further health problems . He is always eager to eat this food and always licks his bowl clean . We feel that this food is made with good ingredients yet is still affordable , especially in cases of 12 large cans .
5 #### We have a fussy new kitten , and after trying all kinds of foods , we have finally found a winner . I swear that his coat is 100xs better ! Our little guy is about 4 - 5 months old , he started off with a quarter can two times a day , and is now on half a can twice a day , so the cans tend to last . It 's got loads of broth when you first serve it , so consider mixing it with warm water for the second feed . Amazon 's pricing is far better than what we spent locally .
5 #### It 's big and its sturdy . The sides are pretty high , no more litter all over the floor !
5 #### My pet loved these so much that we ended up getting one for all of our friends dogs as well . Great toy for chewers !
5 #### My dogs chew on these for hours . I have three large labs and they can make short order of your average chew toy . This seems to last forever .
5 #### My dogs love these . We buy more every few months .
5 #### Kitten seems to like the food ( so does the geriatric cat ) .
5 #### Rescue kittens at Joeys start their first solid meals with this product and they LOVE it ! Mixed with a little formula there 's nothing left over !
3 #### This review is for the MAX CAT Adult Cat Food Flavor Chicken and Lamb Formula . We purchased this for our 5 rescued cats as we have found the Max Cat Dry food , they absolutely love and it has helped their weight and coats dramatically . Because of that , we figured they would like the moist food as well , however every single one of them snubbed their noses at Max canned . We do n't know if it is the consistency ( Pressed not shredded ) smell , or what . On another note , we do have a set up to feed a feral on our back deck and when we put it out , he eats every single bit of it and leaves nothing behind , so it is being consumed . Have no idea why our kids wo n't eat this , but we do have one happy feral .

4 #### UPDATE , 20 YEAR OLD CAT HAD SEVERE REACTION ON SECOND CASE , FROM 2 TABLESPOONS.AND VERY ILL FOR 48 HOURS . CAT HAS ASTHMA WHEN SHE GETS GRAIN , GOT VERY VERY ILLL . BE WARNED , NOT FOR ALL CATS . WILL BE REHOMING MY CASE . MOVING TO TRIUMPH CHICKEN , BEEF TURKEY . GREAT PRICE FOR 13 OZ CANS . TOOK A STAR AWAY . OLD REVIEW The price is good for 24 cans , which the N BalanceI was getting went way up in price . The cats like it , the smell is fine . One cat is 2 the 20 , neither are picky eaters . This has some grain in it , I do not mind . update . the 20 year old cat can not tolerate the food , is ill and unhappy after eating . I have moved on to wellness and N balance for her .
5 #### My cats LOVE this food and especially this flavor . First they lick up all the gravy , but they come back to finish every bite !
5 #### Our little kittens from our local animal rescue facility love Nutro Max Cat kitten food . Would highly recommend these products to you .
5 #### Excellent product it has my German Shepherd puppy seal of approval !
5 #### My fur baby needed these for allergies & really loves them . This is a very good price compared to the pet stores .
4 #### Dog seems to like them , but they create a lot of crumbles to clean up . My dog has a gluten allergy though and most of the available treats are the same way .
5 #### I have a boxer who has a very sensitive tummy so it is hit and miss with what we can feed her . She LOVES this food , and so does her tummy ! !
5 #### My dog loves this food ! She was on trader joes before but switched her . She eats quicker and seems more energetic !
3 #### Smell is coming out , my dog like it so - so
5 #### My Puppies love this food . I mix it with the dry Science Hill for Puppies
5 #### helped our pit bull puppy 's stomach issues , we switched from blue buffalo to science diet and it has been fantastic !
4 #### My 3 cats seem to love it . Wonderful to have it arrive on my front porch and not have to haul in and out of grocery cart & car .
3 #### The cats will eat this too , sort of . I still am looking for a brand of wet food I can afford that they will eat . They acted like the Wysong was from Mars , or maybe Pluto .
5 #### fast shiping my cats love the pate and its great for my older senior cats ...
5 #### It does keep water clear compare with other food I had before . I do not have water filter for my pond and the water was very clear
5 #### I got the biggest package ... I always over do things . Good product , it just came in but the only thing that bugged me is that it 's not vacuumed sealed . I sealed them myself because there is no way I 'm going to use all of it this year . Update : they all love the food ! ! ! ! Best feeling ever .
1 #### Got these thinking they 're re just like the puppy versions the dogs loved ... They do n't bother with them much at all in comparison .
5 #### she loves these bones . They do not bother her stomach and keep her entertained .
4 #### Dog ate this entire thing in the course of an hour . Not for t he tougher chewers !
5 #### Dogs love these and they are a much better price than the same product at the local box store . They love to chew on them and they are not too hard so the dogs teeth do n't crack or break .
2 #### The dog really liked it , I HATED IT ! Blue nubs all over my light floors . Threw it out , behind my dogs back !
1 #### Not for powerful chewers . Breaks up to small pieces that they can swallow . I bought 3 for my English Bulldogs 60 pounds . Had to throw away after about 15 minutes .
1 #### I ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THIS WAS A GREAT ITEM BUT SADLY I HAD TO TAKE THIS TOY AWAY DUE TO A CHOKING HAZZARD FROM THE GNAWING TINY PIECES MAY RETURN IT
3 #### This is a great quality kitten formula ! We fed it to our kitten for several months before switching to the " core " kind from the same brand . He seems to prefer that .
5 #### My kitten loves this food , and I feel good feeding her this grain free formula , knowing that all the ingredients are good for her .
5 #### My puppy thrives on this food . I have been using it since he was 9 weeks old .
3 #### She loved the taste , but I think she must be allergic to wheat because eating this gave her loose stools , and dry food by the same company that was only chicken , rice and veggies did not cause that reaction-- we tried it over and over-- and had the same issue . She has problems with dog treats with wheat as well , so did n't reorder-- not sure why Hills is putting wheat in puppy food .
5 #### I ordered the Hills puppy food for large dogs the first time and then by mistake ordered the other puppy packaging the next time . The only difference seems to be the size of the food nuggets because the puppy eats this brand like nobodys business . The small nugget size does nt seem to bother her at all she still attacks the food bowl with a vengeance . This is the brand my vet feeds her dog so if its good enough for my vet and the pup likes it then that s all the endorsement I need .
5 #### I have a litter of 6 pups on the ground and they are growing fast . I recently switched them slowly to this food from IAMS puppy food . As soon as I opened this food , I could smell it and it smelled better than the IAMS . And boy did my pups really like it too . They acted like they had never eaten before when i fed them this food . Their stools have been nice and solid which is what I look for in a food . Their coats are nice and shiny . The kibble is very small so it is easy to eat . I am glad I made the change .
4 #### Does n't seem quite as durable as the regular bone shaped nylabone but my dog still loves it .
5 #### My 1 year old Golden is on his third one of these . Loves it ! !
1 #### Not as " Dura " or " Chew " as it says ... I bought this thinking it was a chewing teeth cleaner which the dog could eat - ATTENTION AMAZON SHOPPERS ! It is NOT . This is a Toy for the dog to chew on yet it is sufficiently chewable that the dor can eat it soon enough - specially if he is a dedicated expert chewer like my GSD - so really the toy beats its purpose if it ever had any . In less than thirty minutes my dog ate the dinousaur 's spikes ... I do give it to them under strict supervision tho , to throw and what not since I already spent the money - poorly- but what else can I do . Santa Clause through Amazon does not take returns . I do not recommend this product as it is not safe . It is made of plastic , do not be fooled like I did by its white color I really thought it was a sort of bone . So , if you 're looking for a good teeth cleaner , keep looking ! ! Here 's how I take care of my kids- Regular cheap rawhide still the best with Virbac 's mouthwash every other day , pedigree dentastix when I get to buy some and good raw bones and meat once a week or month . I 'll keep looking for alternatives !
5 #### Yes , it 's giant . It looks like a swimming pool ! ! ! ! But I no longer have litter all over my room . It 's a great size for my cat . He seems to love the roominess and I love the ease of cleaning .
5 #### This is my go - to litter pan for my 3 kitties . The large size is excellent . None of my cats are geriatric so they do n't have trouble climbing into it . I would n't recommend it for a cat that has mobility issues . But I just love this product especially for the excellent price . I actually have trouble finding good quality open - air litter boxes anymore at pet supply stores . They all sell covered boxes which I personally believe cats do n't prefer since they can feel trapped , and they do n't need " privacy " like humans do !
5 #### My dog loves these . She goes crazy when she sees the package because she knows its her favorite treat !
5 #### My Golden loves these . They are made of quality ingredients too , and that makes me happy
5 #### My dogs love these and they are grain free !
4 #### My dog likes them , but she is not crazy about them . I will be buying a different flavor . I love this brand because everything is natural and it contains no harmful ingredients .
2 #### I quit giving my dogs packaged treats like these .. they get diarrhea .
5 #### Love these dog treats ! Healthy ingredients , good size , and good price . I have two adult 35 - lbs dogs who are crazy about these . I keep buying more !
4 #### It 's just what I wanted , just what the picture shows . I would give it 5 starts if the cans were n't dented when they arrived .
5 #### Cat 's love the Taste- We love the price- Smells good , unlike other cat food
5 #### Only kind of food my cats will eat . Has to be pate .
4 #### My kitten liked it at first , but now she barely eats it and always wants dry food .
5 #### My cat just loves Friskies - especially the Pate pack ! ( And she is really picky )
1 #### I purchased this for my indoor cats thinking that Hill 's was quality food . Both indoor cats threw it up so rather than return it I decided to put it our for the ferals . I feed them daily a cheap food I get from Sams . I just went out front to add some chicken to the pan and more throw up ! ! ! ! I 'm pulling the food and trashing it . Something is wrong with this food . It might be tainted ! !
5 #### " I Love it " Well not me personally , our cats do , or so they tell me . Just the other day Felix was telling between stuffed his mouth for breakfast that this is his favorite food . Better than the dumpster junk he had to fight the other cats for and he thanked me again for serving his meals on time . Now Brad ca n't stop praising this food . It 's the only thing he will eat . Cheap food he can smell when you bring it into the room and he will not even get up . If he is really disgusted he will leave the room but this stuff is fresh and tasty and always gets him to the bowl . I would prefer a seal - able bag though . I have to transfer this to gallon zip lock bags to keep it fresh .
3 #### Pro : his teeth were noticably cleaner after chewing Con : he is n't even a tough chewer and this did n't last more then a couple weeks of occasional use . I d recommend for small breeds but not for a puppy or adult that is n't monitered .
4 #### My dog loves this thing ! Keeps him occupied all day
1 #### crap . Chewed up into large and small chunks within 30 minutes !
1 #### This bone tears way too easily . The majority of the bone was eaten in large enough chunks to send my little pup to the vet . Do not , not , not recommend this for any small or medium dog ! !
5 #### Our Bassett hound puppy is 10 weeks old and this science diet puppy food is working really well . Our vet had recommended this brand for our geriatric dog previously . So we went with it for our new puppy . He is able to digest it , his stool is great and the vet said he seems to be thriving . So I would definately recommend this for your puppy . We also bought the science diet grain free treats and they are small enough for him . He loves them .
5 #### My puppy was sick for a while and had to be on wet food . She really enjoyed this and it kept her very healthy . She has grown up nicely on it and I would recommend it to anyone who need a wholesome wet food .
5 #### What can I say ? It 's a great price for the convenience of having it delivered at the door versus having to go to the local supermarket for big items . We have seven dogs so we go through a bag a week , these are a small enough size that our 5 pound Chihuahua can chew it without any problems and our 50 pound lab swallows them without any problem . Bottom line : Great item and price !
2 #### It 's fine for what it is , but we 've switched to Orijen and highly recommend that
5 #### I have two Boston Terriers that destroy any toy that we get them within 15 minutes .. and we have purchased many ... now this product is a miracle because it is very hard and you would think they would not like it but they fight over it so much we purchased another one . Our Bostons are very hardy chewers and this toy holds up against their teeth attack . A perfect chew toy for anyone that wants their dogs to be happy and content with a chew toy that will last .
5 #### My dog loves it ! ! ! ! Drag it with her where ever she goes ! !
4 #### another favorite for the toothless ShihTzu ( puppy mill rescue with rotting teeth ) . we 'll hear the dinosaur drop from her cushion and hear her scoot it across the floor . I 've stepped on the dinosaur many a mornings too . it 's one of her favorites and helps her gums
5 #### It was smaller than I thought it was going to be . Hurts like hell when stepped on , beware .
5 #### the dogs love them . they r very hard . my big dog is a heavy chewer . the little ones play with them and try to chew them but i do n't think they get very far . the big dog has chewed them all . they get spiney / prickley after being chewed . last for several months . when u have a heavy chewer u need something like these . all nylabone products r the best chew products . rawhide is not and is not vet recommended . cheaper here than stores
4 #### This is smaller than I thought it would be , but , my dog has had hours of enjoyment out of it chewing and chewing quite happily . It does n't hold up as well as some of the other Nylabone toys we 've had in the past and the little nubbly bits come off fairly easily , It 's done what it was supposed to do and that is entertain the dog though . I do n't think I 'd purchase again due to the size but quality is pretty good hence that four stars .
4 #### Gosh my 16 yr old sick cat just loved this food . However contains carrageenan and looking for another food .
5 #### Cats liked it but when I was down to the last 6 cans they were not as excited to eat it . Just fussy cats I guess .
5 #### My cat loves this food almost as much as Fussie Cat .
5 #### My 23 Koi have been on this diet for 16 years and they are awesome . Great color on my Koi and they love the damn food . Now I wish the raccoons would go away .
5 #### Twice the name brand product for way less than the store ... even with memberships and coupons ! No muss no fuss !
5 #### I have been buying this product for years and grown some terrific Koi ! They were so healthy that a neighbor 's big old tom cat cleaned them out of my pond ! ! ! Now I have to start over . I will still use this location for buying the koi food in this larger quantity . It is the most economical way to purchase it . The fish love it ! ! !
5 #### Our cat loves the food , and it 's good for her . She was a rescue and the food they were feeding her was n't the best . After a few weeks on Wellness her coat was softer and shinier . I highly recommend Wellness brand pet foods , though remember - not all pets like every brand of food you give them .
5 #### This is the only food my cat will eat . It 's much cheaper than buying it in the store . Wellness is one of the higher quality pet food companies that has n't bent for the hype pet diets . Their food is always excellent . I 've had not GI issues with my cat eating this food , they have never had to recall it , and it 's not so rich that they are gaining extreme amounts of weight like many of the high protein high fat grain free diets will do . They also supply the kcal per can on the label for accurate feeding . Wonderful brand .
2 #### This makes my cats sick . The chicken is ok . But not the turkey . It took me a while to figure it out . I think it 's too rich .
5 #### great for rabbits litter box nice size easy to rinse off
2 #### Measurements were off and I could not fit a small pan into it
2 #### I was excited to buy this for my miniature Yorkshire terrier because of the limited ingredients that are used . Unfortunately these are the only treats that I have ever purchased that he wo n't eat .... bummer
5 #### This is a nice natural treat without all the harmful additives often found in treats . All my dogs love these which is n't the case with other " natural " kinds I 've given them in the past .
4 #### Our Pitbull loves them , he likes all treats our Bloodhound hates them and he is very picky
5 #### My dog ( a pitbull ) loved it but it was shredded into small pieces within an hour
2 #### Even being for big dogs , my 9 month old GSD puppy DESTROYED this bone in less than an hour . I 'm sure if works well for some dogs , but my strong jawed pup had blue poop everyday for a week after getting this bone .
1 #### Destroyed within 10 minutes - very dangerous as my dog tried to eat / swallow this . I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this . The standard / hard nylabones are the way to go .
5 #### All our dogs love this particular chew toy . We had a mastiff that chewed infrequently and they lasted about 6 months . We now have a pit bull puppy and they last a week . One caution ... with strong chewers you must supervise and not let your dog swallow the larger chunks . We have never had a problem with the small pieces they eat , but do watch out if your dog chews these up quickly because they will pull of larger ( 1/4 to 1/2 inch ) size pieces , which requires monitoring if your pup eats the pieces as ours does .
2 #### I should start by saying my dog LOVES these . She would chew on them constantly if she could . The issue is that it is readily ingested . My pit bull is a heavy chewer and ends up eating her way through these . Then her poo and vomit is full of white , mangled plastic bits . I ca n't imagine it is good for her . :/
5 #### I bought this toy for my two mini Schnauzers two Christmases ago . Even though it is n't a favorite toy , they do chew on it occasionally . For it being over two years old , it 's in great shape . The toy is heavy and made to last .
2 #### dog does n't chew on it .... but she chews on most everything else .
1 #### Miss prissy cat pants is not impressed ... LOL I was purchasing other brands and thought " hey , this brand is on prime , it 's got ta be good " . Nah , miss prissy cat pants begs , then you put the can down and she runs off . Seriously runs off !
5 #### Just what I wanted . As advertised Extremely pleased . Good service .
5 #### My cat prefers this over most of the Fancy Feast mixes .
4 #### My dog loves it ! Though you can probably buy better food than this brand if you want to pay a bit more !
5 #### I foster puppies for a local shelter and they absolutely love this food , and their stool stays firm with it which it does n't with other brands I have tried . Glad science diet finally came out with a canned version for puppies that are n't abe to chew the dry yet .
2 #### My cat is still having diarrhea - like stool after eating it for 2 weeks . The ingredients might be inferior ( even smells bad ) . My cat typically eats high - quality wet food . This canned food has eggs ( cats are allergic to eggs ) . I regret buying this simply because it was cheap and available for subscriptions .
4 #### My cat does not enjoy this food , however it was timely and after all , she is finicky .
4 #### Switched from Wellness and cat loves this so much more ... Taking off 1 star because holy crap they smell !
5 #### Firmed chunks of food with juice . Good for cats who like to eat pieces . One of very picky cats eats only this
5 #### I have three dogs and they all love these ! I have to keep them in stock at all times because let 's face it dogs like to chew and destroy !
3 #### Did n't last long m. My dog is a very aggressive chewer
3 #### Totally my fault for not reading the description more carefully , but these were a total waste of money . I buy nylabones all the time and my dogs love them . But they were chewing pieces off of these within 10 minutes . Packaging says not eatable and dogs should not ingest . So , in the trash they went . Just be aware that these are NOT for strong chewers .
4 #### My big chewers really like this one - it 's one of the few indestructible ( really ) chews that I can give them
4 #### Serving the purpose I bought it for . Dogs love chewing on the ' stegosaurus ' shape . Have to watch , though , the spikes are easily chewed or broken off and I do n't want them to ingest the pieces .
3 #### I wish I got the T rex but I got the stegosaurus . I think it said it will choose for us so I ca n't complain ... It 's pretty heavy though ! But my dog does n't mind ... just be careful not to have bare feet when they bring it to you and drop it ! ! My dog does n't really chew it though . She just fetches it and gnaws it for a minute . It pretty hard like a rock .
2 #### My dog loves hard chew toys , but does not seem to like this product . He does like other nylabones , but I think the little ridges must hurt his gums . Every now and then he will carry it around in his mouth , but he never chews it .
3 #### Our dog seems to really like this . It is a little small for those who may have big dogs , but for our little dog , its perfect . The only issue that I see with it is that it IS a little more spiky than I was anticipating . I know that its good for a dental chew to have those , but these are a little harsh . Just be careful and supervise your dog with it . I would suggest not letting them use it for long . Ours cut her gums on it pretty quickly , so I monitor her with it and only let her use it for a little bit at a time .
1 #### Nasty stuff . At the risk of sounding like the craziest of cat ladies , I can tell by the smell of the it that this wet food is inferior . Some cat food smells palatable ( I know , I know ... but really , some do n't smell half bad ) , but this gives off a rotten odor . My cat wo n't go near it . I thought maybe I got an old and/or bad batch , but the second go - around went no better . Now my cat is hungry and wo n't speak to me .
3 #### Things started out well with this food but my finicky cat grew tired of it and I started throwing too much of it away . I think it 's a matter or pusses preferences . Update 1 - 8 - 15 : I 've now tried several different varieties of Friskies wet food . Each time my cat says yum and within 2 days she 's sticking her nose up . I give up .
4 #### Purrfect size for a multiple cat household . I bought three of them .
5 #### GOOD PRODUCT BIG ENOUGH FOR BOTH MY CATS EASY TO CLEAN LIKE THE FRONT IS LITTLE LOWER THAN BACK KEEP LITTER IN FOR MY CATS LIKE TO DIG ONE IS FOR URINE THE OTHER IS FOR POOP BECAUSE DON'T LIKE TO USE JUST ONE FOR BOTH
5 #### I have a multiple cat household and so I change out my litter boxes quite often . I tend to purchase the larger ones at Walmart for under $ 6 . However they tend to get worn out very quickly with the scratches from both the cats and the litter box scoop . The color of these are very bright which I am not a big fan of but so far they are holding their own . When I order these it stated that I could select a color however that was not the case . You might want to contact the seller if you 're looking for these and want to order them in a different price . They definitely have higher sides on three sides but on the front it actually Scoops down a bit so keep that in mind if you have a kitty that tends to miss the litter box often .
5 #### Perfect size to hold the extra large disposable litter box . Due to health issue it has become difficult to periodically wash the litter pan . This is a great solution . The size is right for two cats .
5 #### I needed a larger pan for my 15 lb cat . This sure fits the bill . No more accidents outside the box since I started using this big pan . Thanks !
5 #### Our rabbit rescue group uses these for the bunnies ' litter boxes . Sometimes the rabbits will chew one up a little bit , but for the money we can just get new ones .
5 #### Nice size , easy to clean , easy for older cats to get in and out of .
3 #### Box is small in comparison to the other giant sized boxes I use . This box is not large enough for a two - cat household , especially when one of those cats is a big girl . Contoured interior makes it difficult to get clumps out of corners . Bought two , used one , returned one . This is an okay box for one cat or a starter box for a kitten .
3 #### My dogs like most everything . They did n't care for these . There was a gamy odor , but it I did n't find offensive .... just strong .
5 #### I have my dog on a strict limited ingredient , grain free diet ( due to chronic skin rashes and itching ) which includes a salmon based dry food , salmon oil , and now these sweet potato / fish treats . She loves them ! And they smell delicious even from a human standpoint - no fishy smell . More like jerky . My dog is a medium / large breed ( 60lbs ) and the treats are a good size for her . Not too big or small . I am happy to have found a treat that I feel comfortable feeding her that she really likes . The subscribe and save option is awesome for us . The price is way lower than you can get even at the local pet store , and it is an easy way to make sure we always have them on hand .
5 #### My dogs like these treats and they do not have a lot of calories ( 35kcal ) as compared to other treats . Also , I verified with Natural Balance and was told that all of the plants which manufacture the Natural Balance Dry , Canned , Treats , Rolls , Pouches are located in the United States , with the exception of our Delectable Delights Stews and Wet Cups which are manufactured in Thailand by a state - of - the - art USFDA - approved plant .
1 #### There is nothing with the product . My guy just does not like venison :-) he had never tried it . He will eat it but it will lay all day .. He just looks at it . He is a 6 month old lab pup . Thanks Patti Nippe
4 #### My two cats , ( one is SUPER fussy ) happily devour this stuff , and have never had bad experience with them " spilling " this food after their mealtime . On the side they get the FAT CAT kibble which I also buy here in a monster 15 - lb bag . Settled on this product after much trial - and - error , the quality is consistent . Recommended .
3 #### Wellness is a Great Company and the food is Really Great . The reason why I give it three stars is cause as in real life the Turkey is dry and sometimes they like it and sometimes they do n't . The quality is excellent .
5 #### Is fine fresh from the can , but gets pretty hard in the fridge overnight , more so than the chicken . Good to let it up with maybe a teaspoon of water per ounce , worked through the food as you serve it .
5 #### Wellness Complete has kept my indoor cat healthy for years . . .
5 #### Cats all love it And not too many pukes lol
3 #### not bad -- falls apart really easily for a moderate chewer-- my dog loved it though !
5 #### Our puppy loves it . It keeps her from chewing on our things .
2 #### our German Shepard ate it up in a minute . Then I saw that it was not for powerful chewers . For a small dog might be OK
5 #### My dog loves his T - Rex . It 's lasted a long time , though I 've found all Nylabone products tend to get gross over time . They are link magnets for hair , fuzz , etc . The dog does n't seem to mind , but I notice it from time to time and see all that 's its collected . # yummy
2 #### Just so - so - but probably my dog - he does n't really chew on it . It 's at the bottom of the dog toy basket .
3 #### We ended up with the Brontosaurus and my dogs have n't touched it . The nubs on the bone are very pointy and seem like they would be painful for a dog to chew on . Also it is larger than I anticipated which is n't really a complaint except it makes it heavier which makes it harder for my 10 lb dog to even attempt to move it . My 50 lb dog would have no problem but she shows no interest in this . Both of my dogs like Nylabones so I am disappointed that this has n't even caught their interest .
1 #### Because of the discription it is misleading when is says and assortment pack . It is only one . They are also tiny , which should n't be given to any dog near 50 pounds . As you can see with the other horror stories of dogs going to the vets . I sent mine back ASAP . No 6 dollar bone is worth a 300 if not waaay more vet bill .
1 #### not sure what the hype is . my dog loves toysl he 'll chew most to exhaustion , but this did n't even phase him
2 #### My dog played with it about an hour in the week I 've had it .
5 #### Cats love this food . Shipping was fast and the price was good . No problems .
5 #### I like this product . I live in a rural area so Prime Pantry is convenient . Good prices & fair flat shipping rate .
4 #### I get a 52 % better price for the same cat food I would have had to buy in the grocery store , and it 's delivered to the Post Office for picking up . I gave 5 stars for the price and took one star away for choosing Fedex for the delivery . Fedex delivered to my door the first time and after that delivered to my Post Office . If you 've ever lugged home 5 pallets of canned cat food home you know why I 've taken one star away . Felt like a ton instead of 45 lbs . Maybe it 's just my age group .
5 #### Pros : This variety pack offers enough variety to keep my cats from getting tired of any flavor . This pack is Pate , which is the only thing any of my cats have actually liked . They usually lick the gravy off of the other stuff and barely touch it . This has been a favorite brand for most , if not all , of my cats . Best price I have found so far . Cons : My cats steal one another 's food . Heh , seriously , I do not have a con unless it would be that I wish there was another flavor or two in the mix . But this is a great mix of flavors . My cats eat a small portion of this food with breakfast and dinner each day . They are very happy.with the flavors offered here , as well as the texture . I am happy with the price and convenience of getting it from Amazon . So far , it has not arrived dented which was one concern I had before I ordered it . And it does arrive on time ( I now get the automatic repeat orders ) .
5 #### Even when they get old and fussier , they always like Friskies .
3 #### My cats are food snobs , so they really did n't like this batch . OTHER cats like it , but the ' Pate ' is a whiff at my house .
5 #### 10 Koi ate it about 6 weeks until the average pond water temperature got below 55 degrees , then I switched them to wheat germ food . They seemed to do OK on this food . Nobody dead yet .
5 #### I have a picky eater cat . One day he likes something and the next day I get " the look " when I serve it . Those of us who are " cat staff " know what that means . ( Translation : I had that yesterday , I want something different today ) . Although Max Cat makes a lot of flavors , this duck is the only one my picky cat will eat every day . In fact if I try to serve him something else now and then , I get the " smell and walk away " thing . He now gets duck Max Cat every day and we 're both happy ! The other cats will gladly eat anything I serve , but they do love the duck the best . We do love our cats do n't we ? Amazon 's price is less than my local store too .
5 #### Very large chunks . I have to mash all the Max Cat chunky foods , otherwise my 2 senior cats will just lick up the sauce . When mashed , they eat every bite of all the flavors . One cat has early kidney disease and higher than normal phosphorus in her blood ; neither cat will eat the vet foods for cats with kidney disease . The Max Cat foods are on the low phosphorus list so I do n't have to give her the phosphorus binding medicine any more . We 'll see how her next blood test looks .
3 #### The cats will only eat this if I run it through the blender . It should be a pate .
5 #### I purchased this food to offer on days when I 'm not serving their usual Wellness canned food , and I think my cats prefer this Max Cat Oceanfish . As long as they 're happy , momma 's happy .
5 #### Good quality and the sides are high enough to keep the litter in the container .
5 #### The large size is great . Just what I was looking for .
5 #### good size pan - great for older cat to dig around and not make a mess
5 #### I like this litter box . I 've had so many different types of boxes and " systems " and now I 'm back to the basic no frills litter box . Its a nice size ; all my cats fit nicely and I have some big boys and girls ! It seems a littler larger to me than the average " large " litter box , but I 've never considered the large size of most litter boxes really that large ( is it just me ? ) The inside is very smooth and with the clumping pine litter I use , nothing sticks to the bottom when scooping ( which is one of my pet peeves ! ) You ca n't beat the price . Happy with my purchase .
5 #### For the price it works great ; would like it if it had an optional cover / hood but it gets the job done and I like the large size .
5 #### My kitten thinks this thing is fabulous . I have it on a slight incline and she loves whacking that ball and watching it zoom around behind her . She also likes sleeping in the center of it .
3 #### The cat likes it . One of the dogs like it . Well , she gets annoyed that she can not pick up the ball but I think that 's her way of liking it . I 'm almost sold on it . I do n't know yet if I am going to be willing to buy the replacement cardboard . Oh , and the feet . They irritate me . I can not get them fully into the frame .
2 #### Although at first I thought these were awesome , I have concerns about the way my dogs ingested and digested these . So Not for big dogs or those that the Kong is the go to toy for .
2 #### I was surprised that this was n't as durable as the shorter red version by the same manufacturer ( I purchase the red one from walmart ) . My 50 lb bordie collie had this in a hundred tiny pieces within minutes and small bits were passing through him for several days afterwards .
5 #### I have a 8 month old Boxer who LOVES these ! They hold up to his chewing and are lasting . Which is great , because he enjoys chewing . A lot .
5 #### Great for puppies ! Our dogs have many chewing toys , variety is key .
5 #### Actually my golden loves it . This is his third one in 6 months . He will spend hours nibbling each dimple off of both ends before chewing the shaft . One of his favorite chew toys .
5 #### Great way of quickly getting sweet potatoes into dog without having to keep a can open .
5 #### I was worried that my doggo did n't like these at first try - he was reluctant to take it from my hand , but I think that is because he had never smelled lamb before . Now , he gets excited to see them . They are certainly part of his biscuit rotation now . I often give him a biscuit with a little bit of coconut oil on top .
5 #### Natural Balance potato is such a great treat . I have used to train my ChinPin and he truly loves His rewards .
5 #### I like that they have limited ingredients compared to other treats . I break them in half to reduce calories throughout the day .
5 #### Our dogs -- lab and Boston terrier -- really love this for chewing . And it does n't wear out . Very durable .
5 #### You are looking for items like this because like me your dog chewed something up you loved . Well this thing works . Instead of it chewing on your 100 dollar loafers it will chew on this . Click add to cart and buy it .
2 #### My dogs have no interest in these . I think they need some kind of flavor .
1 #### I should have paid more attention to the material before purchasing . This product is a hard piece of plastic with sharp ends ( the dinosaur tail ) . It scraped against my puppy 's gums and would make him bleed all the time . Also , it was not very durable as the tail had warped within 5 minutes . Once I noticed this I threw it away before it caused more damage , or worse , fractures / broken teeth . Puppies need something a little bit softer to help massage their sore gums , not make them bleed . I 've switched to kong products and toys using similar material , which works much better .
5 #### Our very mouthy poodle loves to chew and we have come to rely on Nylabone products . He like this chew toy the best . I think it might be the texture on the Dino .
5 #### We use these instead of bones . My corgis love to chew on them and I do n't have worry about pieces breaking off them
5 #### My cats AND picky dog love this stuff ! I checked with the vet and she said it 's fine to give to the dog too , whereas some cat foods are not . It 's one of the VERY few that I can stand to open in the house . Most cat food reeks , as soon as it 's opened ; this does not ! All of the cats love it . They actually eat it , instead of just licking the sauce off , like with most canned foods !
5 #### great food , my cats coat already seems shinier and sheds left after feeding this to her for a week . Will buy again if price is decent
2 #### Stopped buying after reading the ingredients . they added carrageenen . No good . Switched to tiki cat
5 #### My cat loves this . Been using it for years .
3 #### Sadly , my cats just do not like this . I will be donating to my local SPCA .
4 #### My 13 yr old likes this every now and again ... I guess for a change .
5 #### My dog has incredibly strong teeth and loves to chew rubbery toys - to the point of destruction . The Kong toys are the only ones that can weather his chewing ... and this one is particularly strong . The grooves in the rubber seem to feel really good on his teeth because this is one of his favorites - he will go to his toy box and pick this toy up first most of the time , and just sit and gnaw happily on it .
5 #### This product is great my pet really enjoys it and it a great way for him to get exercise . It does n't seem to get damamged being outside or with him chewing on it all the time .
5 #### I have a Boarder Collie & a Boarder Collie / Lab mix . Both are heavy chewers and will destroy most toys within a few days . KONG toys are the only ones they ca n't destroy . I bought this one to have as an alternative to the other KONG toy we have . This WILL last for your dogs .
5 #### This is the food that our pup was on at the shelter . He seems to have liked it . He definitely acted like he was gon na call the ASPCA every time we were two minutes late on a meal . I do n't know how much of an endorsement this is , but this is the food that turned him from the cute little fluffy sausage link in the first picture into the lean 65 lb behemoth who takes up 3/4 of the bed .
3 #### I know this food is supposed to be great for my puppy but she really does n't like the taste at all . I always have to mix it with other things ( canned food , gravy , flavoring ) to get her to eat it .
5 #### Our cats still love this after months . Sometimes they need a reminder that the ball is super fascinating , but they scratch on it every day . One cat got the ball out once , which was impressive . Good toy .
5 #### Our cat loves this . We have a very old one - 12 years old and it is worn out . The minute I put it out - he has been laying on it ! Happy Kitty !
5 #### Cats like it .. better for my cats than other brands and I ve noticed the smell in the litter box is not as strong.glad I purchased
5 #### Even my picky dog likes this . She eats this along with her cat / lol
5 #### After long experience with 6 indoor and indoor / outdoor cats , Science Diet is the first food I try . I have never had to switch to something else , because none of my cats objected to or was intolerant of it . They all have had good physical and behavioral health . Cats are individuals ; even with a dry food diet , some like canned food as a treat or supplement . They will tell you ! My strongest evidence for this food was my beloved Suki , an 8 - lb female , who enjoyed 21 yrs and 6 mos of a healthy and active life , with annual checkups but otherwise few trips to the vet . Unlike my other cats , she ate only this food , having virtually no interest in anything else .
5 #### Two cats like it a lot , the other sops up the sauce and maybe downs a chunk or two of meat . Cats are every bit as bizarre as people .
5 #### My cat really liked this formula . The pieces are chunks , which she loved . Will probably repurchase .
5 #### Actually I have n't tried any myself ( it does smell good ) but LUCY LIKES IT ! Lucy is our 15 + year old calico who was always a finicky eater but over the last 3 months has " put herself on a diet " as my wife calls it . She 's tried to feed Lucy firmer food , softer food , meatier food , juicier food & even real baby food . Each one got sniffed , tested & then ignored . And what was scaring us was that she was steadily getting thinner & thinner . Today , this product arrived & Lucy finished her whole plate ! We know it 's too soon to judge the new cat food by one meal but we were really getting panicky & it looks like maybe we 've found something that 'll keep Lucy with us for a few more years . If she continues to enjoy it , we 're going on Subscribe & Save right away .
5 #### My kitten loves it . Of course he likes most food but he devours thus .
5 #### My cat loves this brand . It 's hard to find in local stores
5 #### Best Koi food around . Some of our goldfish are over 20 years old and nice and bright orange .
5 #### my 6th month lab loves it ! ! i got him several toys but he likes this one the most
5 #### Cat loves it , and that 's all that is important . It really is bigger than a standard tub you 'd use for a cat litter box . Being larger / taller helps keep the litter inside the box .
5 #### We have a huge Maine Coon who outgrew a regular litter box quickly . This was a good price , great size for our kitty , and durable .
5 #### I ca n't tell you how wonderful it is to find a litter box with lmost completely straight sides again . YAY ! Those molded , decorated , fancy litter boxes are just too hard to clean if your cat pees close to the side ( clumping litter ) you actually have to dig it out and it falls apart . Yuck . It is sturdy but If I need another box in future , this is the one .
4 #### Bought it thinking we would need a second one but have never actually used it . Looks like it would be just fine though .
5 #### This is a very adequate litter pan . I have a large long - hair and it suits her . I use pellet type litter that disintegrates to saw dust as it is used and when I empty the pan it releases easily and completely and the pan does not retain any offensive odor .
5 #### My kitties absolutely love these ! Pate over the gray and shreds it seems !
5 #### This is what we feed the feral cats in our area . Great price and the cats go nuts for it . The cats are in good health . No complaints .
5 #### This stuff was so delicious ! It was supposed to last me two weeks but I finished the whole box in the first week . Mixed Grill was the best , especially on honey wheat bread .
5 #### My cat LOVES this new toy I got him . It was the best $ 7.99 I 've spent on him in a very long time ! ! I sprinkled the cat nip provided around the middle and he really got after it ! He used to scratch ONE chair of mine and that has reduced by at least 75 % since giving him this toy . Also , he LOVES to play with the ball ! It 's great because , although I taught him to fetch , I do n't always have time to play fetch when he wants to and wit this toy he amuses himself by batting and chasing the ball around and around - he stalks it and when the ball finally comes to a complete stop , he pounces on it ! LOL :) I plan to order the other attachments for this toy in the near future ! !
2 #### Entertaining for a day or so but then ripped to shreds and pieces which I had to pick up . If your dog shreds - this is n't for you
1 #### Thought this would be tough enough for my American Bulldog but she ripped it in pieces in no time . Do not buy unless you want your dog swallowing this .
4 #### dog enjoyed it a bit , its good for their teeth , so I guess its worth four stars , my German shepherd just was n't crazy for it .
1 #### My 1 yr old German short hair pointer had the end chewed off in less than an hour . I would n't recommend this product .
2 #### Our German Shepherd starting chewing pieces off in about 5 minutes . I do n't recommend for big dogs or heavy chewers . I ordered the Giant size too so expected it to withstand more . We are sticking to Benebones for now .
5 #### THANK GOD I BOUGHT THESE , THE GIRLS LOVE THEM
5 #### Our dog LOVES this product and has been chewing on it non - stop since Christmas morning . The head , tail , and legs are gone but that solid main body is still taking a beating ! Would definitely buy this again !
1 #### I had to change this review and add this photo to warn people . My dachund / rat terrier had been chewing on this thing for about a year , off and on . He has a lot of toys so he rotates . This last month it was his t - Rex and as you can see , he ate the things head clean off and was working on the tail . Well I 'm watching tv while he 's gnawing away when he comes running over frantically to me and lays down . I figure he 's scared of something . I investigate and only see his t - Rex sitting there on his blanket . I come back over and he 's spitting something up . It 's his teeth . He 's spitting out pieces of his teeth that had broken on that toy . My question is , who would make a toy so hard that it can break teeth ? Do yourself a favor and do n't buy this piece of crap . In the picture below you can see the toy and the piece of tooth I was able to recover . He swallowed the other pieces of the teeth .
5 #### Christmas present for large dog . Hours and hours of entertainment for the dog . Update : A month later and the toy is still providing hours of entertainment for the dog . Will order again if this one ever wears out .
5 #### This food is awesome ! I love the ingredients for my cats !
5 #### My cat had weird digestive problems and $ 500 later , the vet still could n't tell us what was wrong . We switched from Blue Buffalo to Wellness and the problems are gone . My cats never throw up and have beautiful coats .
2 #### Cats were not a fan of this flavor , so I tried another brand all together . Wanted to see if a less expensive brand would suffice , and I believe it has so far .
5 #### We just started to give canned food to our 3 cats along with the dry food as suggested by our Vet to provide more moisture in their diet . They absolutely LOVE this Wellness !
5 #### My cat loves this food , and ever since I switched her over to Wellness canned a few years ago , she shed the couple of pounds the vet recommended , and her coat has become so soft and shiny . She also has a very sensitive stomach , and this food is very easy on her . I alternate the flavors between Chicken , Turkey , and Chicken / herring ; she 's allergic to Salmon , unfortunately . The only flavor her stomach ca n't handle is Beef , which is puzzling , but she seems fine with the other flavors . She is 16 and does n't look a day over 6 .
5 #### Great product from a great brand . My dog eats this brand of food and treats ; he has a sensitive GI system and allergies so this brand is perfect . He loves the treats !
5 #### One of my dogs liked these treats , and the other one did n't . Granted , the one who did n't like them was the one who is picky about his treats and only eats the soft ones lol . If you have a dog that does n't mind crunchy treats , I think they will like these :)
5 #### Dog loved them . They worked great as a training treat . He could n't wait to receive his treat . Easy to break and handle .
5 #### Great ! Though my fault for selecting the wrong size .
3 #### My dogs do not enjoy these treats . But , my foster puppies ( who have no preference or opinions about treats as long as they receive one ) seem to enjoy them .
3 #### This food is dense and well made but my dog does n't really like it that much . I have to work to get her to eat it .
4 #### Reccomended by my vet . Although my little cairn terrier pup does not like the taste of it much , i have to add beef broth in order for him to wolf it down . When we go to other people 's homes who have dogs , he completely cleans out their bowls . It tells me he does't like the taste of science diet much . I like that I can get this shipped to my house every month , it arrives just in time before the previous bag runs out ! It stays fresh , he has bowl movements every day . I hope its good for him .
5 #### On time delivery . My Koi really like this TetraPond Vibrance sticks .
5 #### Cat loves it and it does n't stink - what more could you want in a cat food ?
4 #### I got this because the purina pro plan that I was using was unavailable . My kittens actually prefer this .
5 #### Hard to find food and great price and delivery
5 #### My three cats all love this food . We call it , as well as the Chicken Supreme , " The Giblets " . It seems to work for the one who 's had a UTI , and the one who has hypothyroidism does not puke this food ! We also deliver his twice daily pills in it . The third , and so far problem - free cat , just loves the food . It is a bit spendy , but not as bad as some , and it seems healthy for all .
1 #### Cat hated it . Would not eat even a bit . Should be called Min Cat , because they will only eat the minimum , if any .
5 #### Love it ! Perfect size for two cat household ! So far they are happy sharing it . ( Mine came blue ) .
3 #### Beatifully made , but the sides are not tall enough for my adult cat who loves to throw littler around . We have now ordered a jumbo size .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R21IWL4QQXI9SD " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / C12h4LCElES.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1KA4uzU8PS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;This is one toy that is definitely kitty approved ( by one of my two cats ) . Many toys have come and gone , but this one has survived the test of time . I originally purchased this in December 2009 . I have gone through many cardboard refills , I have vacuumed up countless shavings , but here we are , 9 years later , and Delilah still loves this thing .
5 #### My cats love this toy ! A friend of mine had this toy and his cat hates everthing but this toy so I purchased one for my cats . This has brought many hours of great playtime for my 3 cats . I love that it has a scratch pad for the cats to use other than my furniture . Replacing the pads is a piece of cake . My cats like to lay on the scratcher and I had to get more replacement scratcher so the others could have their own to lay on . This toy has held the cats interest even over the lazer . I was impressed .
3 #### This toy is not for a big dog or one who loves to chew ! It was destroyed and in pieces in less than 15 mins after my lab played with this toy
5 #### this is that toy bone may have a very flexible nylon bone , this would be a good chew toy for a puppy , , , or a smaller dog
3 #### My kitty does n't like these as much as another smaller size name brand . I tried this brand in the pate style . Still not my guys favorite . He usually gobbles everything down . He eats both dry and wet cat food . I probably will try a different brand next time . I got caught going for a cheaper price .
5 #### My cat , Harriet , loves Friskies Pate . She wo n't eat any other canned cat food ! !
2 #### This is much smaller than I 'd expected based on the photos and definitely does n't stand a chance against my 50 lb Boxer mix . She IS a tough chewer but most of the other Nylabones do well for her . Just in general , the size and shape just do n't work ...
5 #### I 've bought these before and they are long - lasting for my rowdy chewers .
3 #### I do n't know what original flavor tastes like but it probably does n't taste like anything . My dog from the get - go was uninterested in his new " dura " chew . " Dura " which I assume stands for durable has sustained major damage to the dinosaur 's " nubs " over a couple chews in the past month . I 've only seen him bite his dinosaur once and it took off shavings of plastic . It is a cool looking toy but my puppy who chews up every toy he gets has never paid this nylabone dinosaur chew or regular nylabones any attention . I guess he 's been too spoiled with chicken flavored chews , rawhides , and bullysticks to go for nylabones . I would love for him to use these products but they are n't attractive enough to him .
2 #### You think Legos hurt ? Try stepping on this little beauty . My dogs will chew this if there is nothing available , but they tend to not enjoy it . It 's heavy , and they do n't like the points too much . they prefer the Benebones hands down .
4 #### My puppy loves this food . The small bites help her to chew easily . I think it 's a great deal for as much as you get .
5 #### Great dog food ! My Sadie is a happy dog ! !
3 #### Dog does n't like them very much . They tend to fall apart when he eats them .
4 #### These are quality cookies , poultry and grain free and my dogs love them . If they were smaller and easier to break in half I would give them 5 - stars
5 #### Dogs liked this And the treats did not upset their stomachs .
3 #### one loves it and the other wo n't touch it
4 #### Not a big hit with my cats , especially if cold . The oldest cat sometimes leaves it even if not cold but the youngest kindly finishes it for her , eventually , at least when it warms up . Since they have all - day access to kibble ( Blue Buffalo ) and mice and squirrels I do n't worry about it , and just give them a tablespoon full or so , for variety . Note : All three absolutely refused the chicken flavor .
5 #### We chose this because one of our cats has had a couple UTIs . So far so good and it 's been a couple years . They also really like it and are in good health .
5 #### My cat loves this food . Specifically in the chicken and herring flavor . He 's not a fan of the other ones . He 's been eating this for over a year and his coat is beautiful and he has a ton of energy . I had to switch him to wet food due to feline urinary tract disease , and I did n't like the special food the vet tried to put him on . He 's been doing well on this .
3 #### Every once and a while my cat will sit on this thing a little . If I put cat nip on it - he 's a bit more interested for a brief time . Overall my cat gives it a " meh " .
3 #### My cat does not use the scratch board which ia why I wanted it but he liked the spinning ball .
3 #### I realistically have to go by what my puppy thinks of this one and it usually sits on the bottom of the toy basket ... not a top pick . Durable product but does not keep him occupied . I have had this for several months and it still has not been a favorite .
5 #### I 've bought many of these over the years . The curves to the dinos make them easy to hold and interesting for the dog to play with and chew . Puppies to adults will like them . I have fairly large dogs and the size fits them fine . They last for a long time . In a year or so I will replace with new ones . They are easy to clean with an old toothbrush and then a quick boil . I clean them about once a month or so and the dogs think they are brand new .
3 #### The nylabone that I received was a dinasaur , but it was n't the one in the picture which at time of purchase was a TRex . The one I received looks smaller than the one I ordered .
1 #### Did n't like the one I received , description deceiving , said it was t - rex but did n't receive that .
3 #### Pup was interested only for a little while . Very small . More like 5 - 6 inches , not 8
5 #### My dog loves this bone ! It is super durable as well .
1 #### Lasted 20 minutes if that . Year and half old lab destroyed it . Too flexible for how strong our lab is .
2 #### My labrador will not play with or chew any nylabone products
2 #### dogs loved it , but breaks apart a bit too quickly ..
1 #### I have a 9 month old puppy . She destroyed this in minutes . Would not recommend for heavy chewers . Better options out there .
1 #### I ca n't imagine a dog that chews so softly as to not destroy this thing immediately . It 's really flimsy , tearable material . I could probably rip a piece off with my hands if I really tried . My small / medium dog had ripped / chewed off a chunk the first day and the little nubs were everywhere within minutes , including caught under her tongue , in her mouth , throat etc , causing her to gag and cough until she spit them out . Terrible product .
5 #### Arrived on time ( I really needed that in this case ) and the same quality as at PETCO for cheaper . Man PETCO is a racket . TetraPond is the real deal though , my Koi love it .
5 #### My fish love this food . I will usually mix other types with this to give a little variety . Will purchase the fall / sping food soon .
5 #### We 've been feeding this to our koi and goldfish for years . Great food and our fish are gorgeous and bright . Our goldfish are over 20 years old .
5 #### I was recommended to feed this brand by the breeder I purchased my puppy from . And my puppy is now 6 months old and thriving .
5 #### my puppy loves this flavor she ca nt wait to eat .
5 #### This diet results in easy refuse clean - up in addition to a healthy diet for a happy puppy . Healthy puppy + easy clean - up = happy life
5 #### Best cat food available . Made our cat 's fur feel like a mink coat .
5 #### My cat LOVES this more than any others I have gotten ! This is BY FAR his favorite ! It 's almost like giving him a treat !
5 #### This is the only high - quality canned cat food that my cat will eat . He loves it so I repurchase .
1 #### Sadly my cats would n't eat it . I tried to get them to like it . Even my dog would n't touch it . I ended up giving away the rest of the case on Craig 's List to a rescue group .
5 #### Our cat loves this food and I love the convenience and price getting it through Amazon !
5 #### I just transitioned my cats from their kitten food to this one as they are ready for adult food . They love it . I have been slowly transitioning by mixing it in with their previous food and they are eating these pieces , leaving the old one in the dish . I guess I will buy it again for them :-)
3 #### Was not well received just like most healthy diets .
5 #### Recommended for my cats by their vet . They love it . No complaints , unless , that is , the food bowl is n't completely full . In that case , watch out !
1 #### It came in a hills science diet bag but this food is not the original product . I 've been buying this food for years , this kibble is 3 times bigger than real product .
5 #### My cat cat is super picky ! ! ! Hills science is all she eats , she vomits on anything else .
3 #### The sides on this are VERY high . Not for small animals .
4 #### Somehow I overlooked the word Giant in the description . Nevertheless , it works fine and my cat prefers this one . For the price this was a great deal .
5 #### This litter box is large with high sides . Will definitely keep the litter in the box better than my old small one , and the price is amazing . The blue is different than the picture though , but does n't bother me ( see picture ) .
5 #### Perfect size for my closet . Cats like it , too lol
5 #### For $ 6 dollars this litter box beats all the other over priced boxes I 've bought over the years . It is pretty large as well . Fits my chubby cat really well so I wo n't have to deal with accidents on the floor or sides of the boxes anymore .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R21G8JYGUKDA9 T " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91TCBlheHFS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/716jd1K2NBS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Highly recommend ! My kitten is spoiled & has every toy imaginable , but This is definitely one of her favorites ! I bought the twinkle replacement ball that flashes on & off , which is made specifically for this , & she absolutely LOVES it ( I included pics and a vid with the twinkle ball incase anyone is interested !
5 #### The cats LOVE this toy - they play with it and hoard it as though it belongs just to them - but I bought it so it should be mine , right ?
5 #### Best puppy food according to our vet and about 40 % less cost than at the vet or Petco can offer . Will order again until puppy can be switched to adult food . Good quality dry food .
2 #### This product is advertized as " flexible " but its not . Its a hard , semi - soft piece of plastic . My dog does n't like it at all since it is not chewy .
1 #### My dog chewed this , then the bone tore to tiny little blue dots all over the house . Not safe for a dog that actually chews .
3 #### I got this bone for my 5 month old puppy . The bone itself was pretty tough , and stood up to her well , but almost all of the little knobs got knocked off and either swallowed or left all over the carpet to the peril of bare feet and my vacuum cleaner . The premise is that the knobs are supposed to rub against the dog 's teeth , thus cleaning them , but they are so poorly attached to the bone that they just came off . I finally knocked the rest of them off and let the puppy just chew on the bone , which lasted a satisfactorily long time . Overall : Like the bone , hate the knobs .
5 #### Great product . I like it . It is very useful . It 's a good price . I guess I would buy it again . Thanks .
2 #### for heavy chewers these are n't good . each of 2 dogs went through the thinner end pieces , like the heads and tails , within minutes . the main body can last a little longer , but more for a smaller dog . did n't seem of the same quality I 'm used too in nylabone products , and I 've bought dozens . a pitt and a mastiff boxer mix are my 2 chewers .
5 #### My dog loves these dinos . He is a 115 lb . german shepherd , and these nylabones really stand up to his chewing . It takes months to wear down to the point where I take one away and replace it with another just like it . He has a basket full of chew toys and his dinosaurs are always his first choice .
5 #### My dog loves the dental dinosaur . She is a fairly aggressive chewer , and safely chews on the dino for about a month or so . I have purchased several of these for my dog and have had no problems .
2 #### The cats like it but it is so bad for them , switched to Science Diet
5 #### Same price as off the shelf but I can get it delivered to my door .
4 #### My puppy loves these and they are great in every way , but the bag is a bit small and the price higher than Mother Hubbard of which I have now started buying instead . My puppy seems to love them both the same as well .
4 #### vwry good hard treat . herbs smell good in the bag . rosemary I sn't supposed to be good for dogs but my vet and I do n't worry about a few treats a week of it . I mix with other treats in a kong .
5 #### No complaints about this product ....... at least my Koi are n't complaining ..... and if they are , so what !
5 #### Great value . Fish love it . Best price that I 've found
5 #### Cats have eaten this once / day for 7 years and they maintain excellent health and soft , shiny coats . ( similar experience with the dog food )
4 #### This stuff is boring as all heck . Tastes good enough for my kitties , but I can tell they 're very uninspired by it ( as much as I 'm uninspired by it ) . They do n't run to gobble it down like other food I give them , so I 'm not going to repurchase unless somehow necessary .
5 #### My two Siamese cats ( especially my 10 YO ) LOVE this food ! They both only eat Wellness dry and wet food . It stores well in the fridge for the next day . I do warm it up on the second day ( a little water is added for consistency ) . I have repurchased several cases of this product at full price.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Wellness - Complete - Health - Grain - Free - Beef - Chicken - Natural - Wet - Canned - Cat - Food-5 - 5 - Ounce - Can - Pack - of-24 / dp / B000084ES7 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Wellness Complete Health Grain Free Beef & Chicken Natural Wet Canned Cat Food , 5.5 - Ounce Can ( Pack of 24)</a >
1 #### I ca n't 100 % say this was the reason but I should have done better research . Our cat just got home from the hospital due to having a urinary blockage . And for some reason even though Wellness brand is a great quality cat food , this brand has caused hundreds of pet owner 's cats urinary problems . I only feel like this is true because our cat was doing great with his other food and then him being on this for a month and a half seems to have caused crystals in his bladder .
5 #### My puppy is a heavy chewer and he loves this toy ! It is very durable - I do n't recommend for puppies with their puppy teeth still . My dog is the kind of dog that goes through toys fast ( he destroys them ) , so it 's nice to have a toy where little pieces do n't pop up all over the place .
3 #### My little cocker spaniel chewed through the head in a few days . Not as durable as I expected .
2 #### okay I have 3 dogs all over 50 lbs . I love nylabones . I do n't like this product . It is soft and flexible and has tons of little nubbies . The dogs will chew this apart it is a given but it should last a little while if they are n't an aggressive chewer . Mine are aggressive chewers and shredded this bone . Then the younger one proceeded to eat the pieces . This is not a hard nylabone so I do n't recommend to many people .
5 #### The Nylabone Dog Chew is precisely what was advertised . Our German Shepherds and Scotties all love the Nylabones.and gnaw on them frequently .
5 #### I have a Golden retriever and he loves this toy , is pretty strong and the quality is excellent , my dog destroy all his toys and this one has hanging there all his bites ... Be careful because is very hard and it hurts a lot if you are in the middle ! ! !
5 #### My Golden Retriever loves this particular Nylabone . We own about 30 nylabones , but this one is one of the most popular . My dog always digs through the toy box to find this toy ! It has a significant texture to it , so I was n't sure about it when I first purchased it because I thought the textured plastic would be easy to chew pieces off of . Luckily that was n't the case and it is still being played with serveral months after I purchased it .
4 #### I have a crazy - mad chewer at home , and an occasional chewer too . Upon arrival , I quickly unwrapped the toy and looked at it . It is covered in little bumps that look very easy to chew off , so I was a little skeptical on how this would hold up , but I like it because it cleans their teeth . I gave it to the occasional chewer , and she sniffed it before slowly grabbing it , chewed a little while , and left it alone . She has n't chewed on it much since . The crazy - mad chewer likes it , but not as much as the other bone . He was chewing it one night and from the sound I thought it would be gone in the morning , but no , it is still holding up pretty well . A few of the bumps have come off , and some are stretched , but overall it is doing well for my dogs ... and protecting things I do n't want them to chew on .
2 #### My 2 year old pit tore it to pieces in less than 5 minutes . NOT for strong chewers . Otherwise have fun cleaning up the mess .
5 #### Great dog food . Feeding two puppies . Kibble is small enough too for my 4 lb 7 oz and 6 lb and 2 oz pups .
3 #### My puppy loves the food but I find it does n't stay fresh in the fridge as well as other wet foods .
4 #### My cat is more of a run - and - fetch + stretch - and - scratch girl , so she got bored of this fairly quickly . But she did play with it for a bit and occasionally likes to sit on it . And I recently found that if you drop treats or dry food in the track though , it makes a great food puzzle .
5 #### My cats really enjoy this toy . For the price it 's definitely worth it . The young one plays with the ball constantly , and the older one uses the scratcher and occasionally bats the ball .
5 #### Our cats , dog , and umbrella cockatoo all love this toy ! We will have to purchase more for our mini zoo !
4 #### My cat liked the ball part for a few minutes then moved on to something else . She does nt use the scratch pad part but i like this toy anyway and think its just her ADD ways that keep her from playing with this . Good product even though its not for my cat .
5 #### My indoor , feral , calico , aged 16 , recently stopped eating . I had tried every premium cat food , only to have her reject it . Yes , I brought her to the vet . She is OK . My local pet store recommended MAX CAT . SHE LOVES IT ! ! ! !
1 #### Will throw this out after issues with other MAXCAT " Food " products .
5 #### My finicky Bengal enjoys it and is still thriving on it . However every cat has different tastebuds and mine prefers the morsel variety rather than the pate kind .
4 #### Good food as far as premium pet foods go . Not quite Wellness or Blue Wilderness , but very acceptable . Lulu the cat did enjoy it , but ate it as she tends to foods that are n't quite " it " for her . She is a little PIA with wet food . I ended up tossing out kitty dishes of the little square cutlets sucked dry of juice and gravy and not eaten at all . If you have a Picky Pants , buy a few to try before a case purchase
2 #### Again , like the Hunter 's Stew with duck , only the starving outside strays will eat this
5 #### Perfect size for my growing kitty , hopefully it will still work when she 's full grown .
5 #### Great for a senior cat who 's having trouble getting in and out of a high sided box
5 #### The cats LOVE it . ( But they could n't write the review ) ! !
5 #### No more sticky litter ! Had no idea this pan would be so useful . Not sure what the material is that is so magical ? ? ?
5 #### My dog loves these treats ! He drools for them . He also eats the dry food . Healthy and tasty food for my dog !
5 #### My dog loves these treats and they are made with good ingredients
5 #### Good size for the price and good packaging . Nice that it is limited ingredients . Much better than store bought bones .
4 #### It seems healthy and great , but my dogs did not like it . I recommend the quality and quantity you 're paying for - specially that it is limited ingredient .
5 #### Our German Shepherd can tear the so called indestructible Kong in a few weeks . The first one we gave her of this large dental Kong is still in good shape after about two months . She is constantly chewing it and carrying it around . We highly recommend this product .
5 #### Our hard - playing tough chewer loves it and has n't managed to take any pieces off it yet ! Will update if she does , but she 's been known to destroy " high quality " toys in minutes , and it looks great !
3 #### We have 2 yellow labs , and as they 've grown up ( they 're a little over 2 now ) we 've learned they are big time chewers . They do well with the original kong , but they managed to chew off one of the ends of this one even though the rubber felt as strong if not stronger as the original . If your dog is a big time chewer , he 'll probably eat this . It did last longer than some of the other stuff we 've tried with them , but they still managed to consume enough of it that we felt it was unsafe and took it away .
5 #### My cats love this thing . They scratch the cardboard middle section and love chasing the ball around
4 #### Both my cats like it but it moves around on the floor , and one of my cats can get the ball out of the track and then it rolls under furniture so its out of commission until someone finds it . Wish I could make it stay in .
5 #### This is exactly what you expect it to be . And exactly what your cat needs . A classic universal cat toy bringing joy to felines everywhere .
4 #### LIKE IT BUT DUE TO PRICE HAVE SWITCHED OVER TO ANOTHER TOP BRAND . I AM A BREEDER OF FRENCH BULLDOGS AND HAVE ALOT OF PUPPYS SO PRICE IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE
5 #### smells good , tastes good , and science diet verifies its ingredients are not poisonous from China
4 #### Good dog food for the price . Must work because the puppy is getting fat .
4 #### Okay - it 's not that I like it , it 's that my puppy liked it ! ONLY for his first 6 months ... then he went off of it . I do n't give his scraps and his treats are mostly training treats but he just stopped chowing . I switched food and he 's eating normally again . While on this , he grew like a week ( from 7 weeks to 6 months ) and was happy and healthy with a great coat and beautiful teeth so it seemed to work very well for him !
5 #### Nothing wrong with the food - cat developed allergy and had to switch from Science Diet . Otherwise , he loved it .
5 #### I am only basing this rating on how my cats joyfully eat this ( one of them a little TOO joyfully ) . The dry food they were previously getting brought them no joy . They are both gorgeous tabby cats with bright green - yellow eyes and nice coats . This is true no matter what they eat . But this food makes them happy and that 's probably making their eyes even brighter ! # calmdowncrazycatlady
2 #### Chunks of the stegosaurus were gone in minutes . Did n't hold up like I was hoping . I supervised my dog , so just took it away when I saw the damage - but then it went in the trash .
5 #### So cute ! And great shape for dogs to chew on .
5 #### my dog loves this toy . plays with it for long periods of time . is holding up well with her chewing it .
5 #### Three reasons why you should buy Friskies from Amazon : 1 . It is way cheaper than the store - seriously . Local retailers here have it priced at $ 12.99 ON SALE for the 24pk . Sometimes you 'll see a coupon on Amazon --which makes it an even better deal . 2 . Cats LOVE friskies . I am not sure what makes it so attractive to our three cats , but they all come running when they hear the pop of the lid . I use this as a treat for them - one can divided for all three . I tried other brands ( some famous ) and they actually turned their nose up at it . 3 . Quality is excellent . You need to read the label carefully when feeding your pet and do your research on what 's best for the cat 's coat , teeth , body , etc . Take as much care in feeding your pet as you do yourself . We all want our fur babies around for as long as possible , I 'm sure .
4 #### Food excellent as always but the packing was horrible AT LEAST 5 cans were smashed and open . I t was like 96 that day and OMG THEY SMELLED SO BAD . There were at least another 4 that were badly crushed and because of the heat and being slightly opened I did n't want to take the chance that my kitties might get sick . Gon na try one more time with food . If the same thing happens again , No More for me !
4 #### A good buy on cat food . Will buy more .
5 #### I have five cats and they all enjoy Friskies . They prefer the shredded to this but will eat this .
5 #### I happened to find this in a lightning deal . Before I purchased it , I checked out the reviews on Max Cat products and was pleased to find that it 's a good quality food . I like the wholesome quality of the ingredients list , and duck is a flavor that 's not easily found . My cat really likes the flavor , and I like that he 's eating good , high - grade food instead of cheap , fat - laden , cornmeal laden , by - products . This food consists of chunks in a thick , moist gravy . ( I do add extra water to the gravy only to make sure my cat gets extra water ) . And of course , the gravy is what he eats first . All of it . His second round is for all the chunks . All of them . His third round is polishing the bowl . Every inch of it . I have yet to throw any away , and we all know how finicky cats are . So , I 'd recommend this , and my cat surely does . UPDATE 2/6/15 : My cat is now scoffing at the xbrands , half - heartedly eating them , and getting loads of potent gas when he does eat them . He 's still cleaning his bowl spotless when he gets Max Cat Duck . So guess which brands / foods he 's not getting anymore ?
5 #### Great shipping - love this product . My beautiful young calico girl loves this food . Great price !
5 #### If only it did n't cost so much ! But the kittehs do love it best .
5 #### Even my picky cat loves this food . Smells HORRIBLE to me , but he loves it so that is all that matters .... and it is a nutricious brand , so everyone wins .
4 #### My cat really likes it , made a nice treat for him
5 #### This large , inexpensive pan is purrfect for my large cat . He took to this new box right away , and the sturdy , heavy duty plastic looks like it will last a good , long while .
3 #### Its OK but litter still sticks to the bottom - not per advertised
5 #### This is a nice LARGE litter pan with high sides to prevent " accidents " . Both of my cats took to this pan right away . What more can I say , it was inexpensive and does the job . Very happy .
3 #### Cat is not a big fan . Used to like it , now he eats it under protest . And it smells pretty fishy . OH well .
5 #### I had one of these years ago so I knew that my new kittens would love it . They are perfect for kittens because of its small size .
5 #### My cats love this . I purchased the same one , in - store , about a year ago and my cats liked it so much , the center scratch part has been fairly destroyed . It was definitely worth getting a new one . I also have two dogs who would love to get the ball out and destroy it but they thankfully ca n't !
3 #### I know it says colors may vary but the mauve is awful . Why ca n't these companies make things in white , the cat does n't care what color it is but the human does .
5 #### My cat loves the scratching material in the middle but not the ball circle toy .
3 #### It 's ok BUT in the long run I typically have to change out the inserts about every 3 months . I pour catnip over it and my cat does loves using it . Here 's another thing , the cardboard being scratched will fill the surrounding floor with bits of trash .
5 #### My Lab loves her new chew toy for treats . She is choosing it over her other treat toys .
5 #### Our Boxer LOVES this . Even our toy poodle drags it around ! Very sturdy and has stood the test of time !
4 #### Just what s needed . Downside is it rolls under everything .
4 #### This toy has lasted , but it is so sharp ! Seems like it should be an outside toy . Be careful not to step or touch it !
5 #### We got one of these ( the stegosaurus ) for our 2 7 - month - old puppies toy collection , and let me say , they love it ! So much so that we can rarely give it to them as they ( play ) fight over it until WE ca n't stand listening to them anymore and take it away . A great source to focus their chewing , rather than the furniture . It 's lasted 2 teething puppies for about 4 months with only minimal wear . We had to order another to give them each their own , though , they still opt to fight for each others .
4 #### Excellent product & my puppy loves it . It 's just a bit pricey .
5 #### My golden retriever loves the smallness of the food .
5 #### What a great buy as opposed to Pet Smart . A third less cost per pound to the retailer .
5 #### Our puppy loves this food . We used Science Diet in the past for our dog and would recommend this brand .
5 #### I have a swiss mountain dog who has a very sensitive stomach . These treats are perfect for him !
5 #### My dog loves these treats , just be aware if you get the bigger bag of the two , that they are actually bigger biscuits , made for a medium to large breed dog . I have a yorkie and I try to get the smaller ones .
5 #### My dogs have allergies and these are great for both of them but I see the price has went from $ 4.49 to $ 7.99 that 's a big difference
3 #### For some reason this - after being their food for years and years - is now making my cats projectile vomit daily . I have switched to another brand that rhymes with Miao Fix that has more protein and less fat and they are doing better now .
5 #### Hmm , well I did n't love it , but my cats do ! Makes it nice to be able to shop for all my rescue cats without leaving home . Seafood is NOT healthy for your cats ; buy the poultry meats , they 'll thank you for it with no kidney stones .
5 #### We are overseas and this catfood is of better quality than the local supermarket dried catfood . Our little garden cat has flourished on this and she likes it , too .
5 #### Picky cat with a sensitive stomach loves this . Only food he can eat and not get sick .
5 #### My cat loves this food she is 11 years old with a sensitive stomach . She does well on it and its not too expensive .
3 #### Neither of my cats seem to like this flavor much .
3 #### Ca nt say if the product is good or bad all I can say is my picky cat did not care for it . I would have to say it depends on the kittys tastes
2 #### My cats just will not eat this . I bought it because I have been told that wet food is better than dry food . I have been feeding them Max Cat dry food and have attempted to switch them to wet with different foods . Figured I 'd try this because it 's the same brand . No go . They wo n't touch it .
4 #### What can i say , it 's fish food , they ate it !
5 #### you should never feed your dog anything if you do n't know where the ingredients are coming from . I have had two fuzzbutts poinsoned from ingredients in dog food that came from China . Science diet guarantees and certifies the contents of their dog food .
4 #### Somewhat pleased . Some loose stools . Will continue to monitor
5 #### We started our Ladybug ( boxer ) on this from the forest day we brought her home at just 7 weeks old and she did AMAZING ! her skin was excellent her teeth were super clean ( we also brush weekly to keep her gums healthy ) and she was a bouncy and playful as can be ! And the vet was amazed by how healthy she was ! * please be wary of the mature adult when it comes time to switch ! we did not have a good experience to say the least please read my review for more detailed info *
5 #### My puppy has been growing healthy and strong at a great rate . She 's very active and this Feeds her well
4 #### puppys like BUT had the monthy delivery scheduled to save 15 % , but after 2 months of subscribtion , science diet raised their base cost by 15 % so it is no longer any sort of a deal and will cancel subscription . I am a breeder and have 10 dogs to feed and this is now much to expensive .
5 #### My vet recommended this brand and she said it was the best brand to feed your puppy . Do n't ever settle for the cheap stuff when it comes to your dog 's health . This small size kibble was perfect for my little 7.8lbs husky maltese mix .
5 #### even tho this is more expensive it is worth it .. my puppy poops much less . I tried switching her to something else and went back to this food .
5 #### The kitties love the size and shape of this kibble . I 'm pretty sure they like the taste too . We sometimes use this for treats because they enjoy it so much . And all the kitties love it . We currently have ten ( too many , I know ) and all of them love this kibble .
4 #### my elderly rescue cat ejoys this one . She does not enjoy all Science diet foods however . I mistakenly bough her a different one once and she refused to eat . I boughr this one hoping she would eat it and she did . This is great for old picky cats . My old lady will not even eat any form of chicken or canned tuna ! only fresh . Why she like this one I do not know because its made with chicken . She does and that 's enough for me , because this brand is supposedly one of the better ones and her health is very important to me . I do supplant her diet with wet foods because i have noted that if she does not eat wet foods her coat becomes more dull and course . My cat prefers tuna , raw over anything else . I do n't always have raw tuna on hand , but the wet tuna cat foods seem to be agreeable for her , but she wo n't eat the chicken . Who knows . I hope that 's helpful .
5 #### after 3 years of only eating snacks for his food , I bought this on a whim . he loves it . another cat in the house tried it and loved it also !
1 #### Foul odor . Does n't look like the normal science diet food . Made my cats puke and puke and puke . I 've been feeding my cat this brand of food for 7 years . This is first time they had this reaction .
5 #### My kitten loves to play with this toy ! I am happy with my purchase .
4 #### My Cat is obsessed with the little ball running in the sideway . He sometimes scratches the middle but he likes spending time with the ball more . Good product with a reasonable price .
5 #### All of our cats use this and even after having it for 5 months one of them still plays with it every day or so . It is fun to watch him play with the ball . And the cardboard scratcher is used every day by all of our cats .
5 #### Great choice for size ( 2 cats ) and easy to clean . The height is great but not too high for my fussy furkids . Good product and highly recommended .
3 #### Not really bigger , just deeper . But just fine for the price .
5 #### These are huge ! I use them for my bunnies as a litter box/ hay feeder and they 're litter trained to a T. Very spacious medium depth not extra tall but it 's big and tall enough for a large - XL cat or even multiple cats ! Thick plastic that does n't bend which prevents unnecessary spills or cracks from lifting . Love the lower front entrance , great for kittens or small animals to get access to easily . Not your average flimsy litter box , this one 's a very spacious keeper unless you have a high peeing animal then I would recommend getting a domed cat box to protect your walls . Hope this helped ! :) Let me know if it did
5 #### I actually really like it . It was a great price and no litter is sticking to the sides .
5 #### Great pan for cats . Really big ! My cat loved it .
5 #### The pan , itself , is great . Able to put in lots of litter . Large , so very heavy to move , with my arthritis . But , would rather have that extra litter . Seems sturdy , enough .... keeps it shape , with no rough edges . My almost 3 year old male cat fits into it well , to eliminate . Here is the dilemma .... if , you could call it that . I clean the litter , immediately , after he goes and covers . My cat is fastidious about elimination odors . He stays in the pan , to go . But , then gets out , like he used to with his smaller pan , walking around it SNIFFING and covering .. SNIFFING and covering etc . , until he has huge piles where ever the clumps are ... or , clump is .... litter all over the circumference of the pan , on the floor . Use less litter ..... pan should have taller sides ? ? ? It may be more that he wants there to be no chance he will ever step on any of it and is ensuring that . So , I will just be thankful .. It is what it is .
5 #### Quick delivery , as described , strong enough so my dog can not demolish it , it has been several months and it still has not been torn apart
5 #### Dog only plays with itbif I have begging strips inside
5 #### Kongs are the best . I 've used many products over the years and Kongs just keep on going and going . They are extremely durable . I have Pits , English Bulldogs and Mutts . They love them , especially with a medium Milk Bone stuff in them .
5 #### My cat loves this flavor . Pate . Perfect for cats that throw up with chunky food .
2 #### My fur babies have eaten this for years & loved it ... I love that it does n't contain any meat by products or any nasty stuff in general , lol & Amazon 's price is excellent ... however , I ca n't for the life of me understand why they messed with the original formula . It went from a nice , smooth pate with gravy to a loaf style with a nasty gel & now my cats barely finish it . Half of their bowls still have food left in them & before they licked their bowls clean . I 'm so disappointed . I really hope they change it back but until they do , I 'll be switching to another brand which I really did n't want to do . :(
4 #### the only wet food I buy my cats ; sometimes a few cans arrive dented , but it 's still a great deal .
5 #### Bought three chews at the same time .... other ones looked bigger and better but dogs liked this one best . Go figure !
5 #### My lab loves these and they last longer than most chew items .
4 #### This thing disappeared off the face of the earth in less than two hours . Either my dog ate it that fast or he flung it over into the next door neighbors yard . I 'm giving it the benefit of the doubt but be warned , it 's possible this might be easily chewed up by chewy dogs .
5 #### Our foster Great Pyrenees love these and they are basically indestructible and have survived months of chewing .
4 #### My dogs are ' chewers ' and love these . They last for a long time .
5 #### my dog loved this , very durable for about 10 months :)
4 #### Per breeders diet using Life 's Abundance All Stages . At veterinary request need to add puppy kibble ie Hill Science . Blending both . Puppy loves ! Also using Hills Science Puppy Small Bites for his treats during training . .It 's healthier than higher calorie treats when giving so often during training .
5 #### Seems to be a great dog food . Was recommended by my breeder / Vet . my pup a miniature Australian Shepherd has been on this food since birth . He will be 1 year , this week . He has exceeded his expected height and weight ! Not sure if it 's due to the food or just my dog . He is very energetic with a beautiful shiny coat . So will be moving on from puppy food . Highly recommend .
5 #### Our cats are fussy . In fact there is one flavor of Fancy Feast they like , and that stuff goes rock hard when left in the air , so one wonders just how good it is for the fur babies . They love every flavor of the Max Cat ( Nutro ) wet foot in chunks with gravy and will even eat some raw food when mushed up with this . I do n't know what they put in this but it 's like cat crack , so I 'm going to keep on buying it .
5 #### This food is great for an animal that eats wet food and is not picky . I bought it because it is the most calorie dense food I could find , and I was cat sitting a sick cat that was losing tons of weight . He ate this food , but it is much stinkier than typical wet food , so be prepared . Between this and fancy feast , which my vet swears by , he managed to put on a few pounds , so it did the trick !
3 #### My pooch liked them at first but now she does not care for these anymore . The cookie may be too hard to chew . Maybe ?
5 #### Great for my Dane who 's allergic to so many popular ingredients
5 #### My pups love them too much . So go easy . They wo n't want their other food .
5 #### My dogs love all the L.I.T 's from Natural Balance , and I am guaranteed a healthy grain free , soy free treat for my boys . I subscribe and save to 3 packs of these and 3 packs of the duck ones a month .
5 #### My cats favorite dry food . This product is $ 6.00 cheaper online than in the local pet store . I look for the best price because with 3 cats it goes fast .
5 #### My Koi ADORE this food , and it is indeed keeping the pond clear . I 've been feeding them twice a day , and they get VERY excited when they see me -- I stand by the pond until they 're done , and we enjoy each other . I think . I hope ! ;)
5 #### Yum . My pets love this and so I 'm happy . It was great ordering it online because I did n't have to haul it home from the grocery store .
4 #### Cats seem to enjoy it , the dog loves it
5 #### Super liked these . My can loves them , my son ( who feeds my cat ) loves them . I enjoy having this on amazon prime delivery system too .
2 #### My dog wo n't even entertain the idea of chewing on this bone .
5 #### A little larger than I would have liked for our two small dogs but they seem to do the job .
5 #### My pug puppy seems to love it .. Yet she also likes eating guinea pig poop , hay & all of their veggies ... So she may not be that picky .
5 #### I love watching my yorkie carry this around like he 's strong
2 #### This toy has a too wide cavity for putting skinny treats . The treats are easily accessible and taken out by simply bouncing the toy around . Toy provides just few minutes of activity instead of the hours promised . Other designs are better .
5 #### My 11 month old cat loves this thing ! She was a little unsure about it at first but after a couple days , she was scratching it and playing with the ball , saving my carpet and curtains from further harm .
5 #### Great ! Better than the 3 tiered ones ( which I also have ) , because the cat can SEE and play with the ball from all angles . My cat even sits on top of the scratching area to play . The scratch pad is also great , plus durable and replaceable . Only thing is that amazon will send you a random color ( apparently there are 3 colors ) , you can not select it .
5 #### Love the cat toy for my little monster - she destroyed the mouse one in 24 hours . This one she ca n't ruin .
4 #### No lid with it and not much a step out for the cat drops a star from the review . It 's also not that giant . Maybe an inch or two bigger than our original litter box . Price sure is right though .
5 #### I have a male tiger Tabby named Fat Jack and this giant litter box is exactly what he needed .
5 #### Ordered this box to accommodate 2 cats . It works well holds enough cat litter to keep every in check for a week
5 #### Really this is the only thing my kitten can eat without getting diarrhea . Tried the dry food , did not work out . This food is a lifesaver .
4 #### Hands down , my cats love this food and will eat nothing else . I do water it down in order to introduce more water into their systems and they love that . They wo n't eat it normally anymore . My cats have been eating this for 10 years with no ill affects .
5 #### We already have 2 for our cats and they love them . So we bought / gifted one . Their cats love it too . This toy never disappoints !
5 #### this is an excellent toy for cats of all ages ; got to get one if you do n't already have one .
5 #### I know not all cats love this , but the ones that do REALLY love it . I have a few in the house , and they get a lot of use .
2 #### The hole to insert the treats is the same width the whole though . I have no idea what to put in here that would actually be a challenge .
5 #### My Englis Mastif still has his and has not destroyed it ! Love KONG toys ! ! ! !
5 #### The fur babies love Max Cat with Savory Duck Chunks in Sauce Cat Food Cans . Again , duck is n't a meat they are usually offered and they eat it up ! I do n't feed my babies dry cat food unless , I 'm going to be away an entire day .
5 #### My cats like food in a sauce and Nutro Max Cat Chicken Supreme Entree Chunks in Sauce Cat Food 3 oz is one of their favorites . I only feed my fur babies wet cat food to promote healthy a healthy urinary tract .
4 #### It 's hard to tell if they like it or not . They eat it , but are n't eager to chow it down . Not surprising , since they seem that way about everything .
5 #### Even though my lil feline children are quite picky , I usually give them a half of a can and although they do like the junk food cat food the best , they have decided to like this one every 4th meal ( You cat owners will totally understand ! Great price and fast shipping ! THANKS !
5 #### They might not eat the entire bowl , but they will eventually finish it . I think they simply get full . for my 1 + yr old cat 4 - 5lbs . She adores this brand and flavor and I feed her nothing else . I fully trust nutro and have been feeding it to my pets ( dog and cat ) for years .
5 #### High nutritional food blend for cats under one year . Helps with growth and overall health . Nutro makes three MaxCat Kitten varieties in 3 - oz cans ( 24 / box ) . Our cat likes all three and we trade off . Turkey & Giblets ; Chicken & Liver ; and Chicken & Oceanfish . The Turkey & Giblets is currently hard to find -- and is sometimes priced much higher by vendors .
4 #### The three Nutro MaxCat Kitten Food cans are on our Vet 's recommended nutritiion list for kittens thru one year . Our 4 - month old kitten has gained weight nicely even while being extremely active . She seems to like all three varieties , but " prefers " to have changes from one to another on a regular basis . Product seem NOT to be available at all common outlets but can easily be found on web or thru Amazon suppliers .
5 #### We purchased 2 of these for our new mini awesome Australian Shepherd , cause she loves to chew even now @ 8 months old ! ! ! ! She took it out of my hand immediately , and we did n't see her for about an hour ! ! ! ! She still goes to it @ least once a day . And she has a long way to go before devouring the first one .
1 #### We bought one of these from a local store for our 4 - year - old 70 lb black lab . We 're not buying the hard plastic nylabone chews anymore ; we should have stopped after we had problems with the first , but we figured it could have just been that particular product . He chewed chunks off these toys and choked on them . He did n't get hurt , but we did have to throw out a toy that lasted 20 minutes . What a bummer .
1 #### The dog really does not like it and refuses to eat it .
5 #### My dog loves these and he 's very picky about treats and food ! He developed food allergies recently . He might be allergic to peas and it 's very hard to find treats and dog food without peas . I also buy grain - free food and treats . This does n't have any peas or grains in it and has limited natural ingredients . They 're big enough to give him one after his meal . Also , it 's a larger bag , so I do n't have to buy that often . The price is great !
5 #### These are a favorite for our rottweiler - lab mix ! I love the ingredient list and he loves their flavor ( apparently ) . BONUS these fit into the rubber KONG toys perfectly and will keep your dog busy for a while trying to get the treat out !
5 #### The pups love them ! They are big enough for big dogs too .
5 #### I got this for our cat that has a hard time with most food , this was perfect for her and out other cat likes it just as much . So if you have a cat that has a hard time with some foods , try this . I do not think you will be disappointed and your cat will love you even more
1 #### I have purchased this item a total of 7 times . Until this last order , I have had no issues . This last order was different . When I opened the bag , there was a strong almost ammonia smell . My 2 cats wo n't eat it . They have never turned their noses up to this flavor before . It has n't expired . The expiration date is Jan 2019 . I do n't know what is wrong with it , but I ca n't use this and I 'm going to have to find something else my cats will eat instead .
3 #### This cans do n't have easy self opener . My dog like the food but get stuck in his palate . Is it too greasy ? I am afraid he will stop eating this ground food because of this issue . I try to mix with dry food . I will not buy again so many cans at once . It is more expensive to return .
5 #### used for over a year . Dogs love the taste
4 #### would of liked to of seen a resealable bag like the 4.5 pound bags which have velcro .
1 #### This product is NOT GENUINE ! I noticed that the kibbles were 3x the size they normally are from the exact same bag I get at pet smart . My cat would eat then violently throw up afterwards . I had to take her to the vet because this gave her an allergic reaction and was having problems breathing ! My vet figured out that it was the food . She said ahe gets a lot of issues from people ordering off of Amazon lately . There must be some scammers on here . I love Amazon , but this really hurt my cat and cost me a ton in vet bills . I bought blue buffalo from pet smart and my cat loves it and has n't had any problems at all . Buyers beware on Amazon !
3 #### I ordered this to get away from CORN being used in the product , but sorry to say it also has corn in it . So I 'm feeding it but still looking for a more approate food for my cats .
5 #### cats will love was for a recuse I sent as a donation
5 #### My cats love this food . The value is great buying it on Amazon & I do n't have to haul it home .
3 #### Product is good . I 've ordered cat food a number of times and it always comes down to price / shipping . It just comes out cheaper to buy local .
5 #### good buy on subscribe and save , always arrives as expected
3 #### The cats like it , and this is a convenient way to buy it .
5 #### Cats enjoy the choice and I am glad for the service .
5 #### Most reliable kitty food . I have multiple cats at home . When one of my cats became asthmatic , and my vet advised me to give one kind of food only to see any improvement . In my cat 's case , wellness chicken formula worked like a magic . It minimized her symptoms .
5 #### My cats love this food . I started buying it because one had a tooth removed and needed wet food while recovering and now I give them wet food in the morning and dry food in the evening since they like it so much . I 've tried a few different flavors , but they seem to like the chicken the most . I bought them the sliced meat version of this same brand , but they did not like as much . Apparently pate is a more appealing texture ? Either way , they horf it down as soon as I put it out .
3 #### One of my two cats likes it . It does n't smell nearly as offensive as many other brands , so that 's a plus . I like the idea of it , just with both cats agreed .
5 #### This is perfect for our 15 lb . rag doll . No more missing the pan . I already ordered a second one .
5 #### This is a really good litter box . It 's hard to find ones that my cats seem to really like , but this one was a complete success . Reasonable price as well , so I would recommend !
5 #### I got a bigger cat box because I have a big cat . It still does n't help he still poops outside of his box anyways . But at least you could fit in the box . Good price and a fast ship .
4 #### It 's a decent size , but I would not call it giant . Only have one cat , so it lasts a day until it needs to be scooped
4 #### It 's a great and well - sized litterbox for most cats , but this is not what you 're looking for if you need any sort of scatter control . Somehow I get piles of cat litter 4 feet from the box - raining litter . My next purchase will be one with a high back .
5 #### Poo started smelling better once I switched to this brand .
5 #### My girls love these and so does Santa . He brought 2 bags at Christmas . There are no grains in them . Potatoes , sweet potatoes , cane molasses , canola oil etc . and the size is just right for them to have a treat but not feeling like they are getting a meal . They have a crunch to them which the dogs love . My dogs are very elderly . I do try to give them things they like and when it is also good for them , it is a bonus . My dogs love these and the sweet potato and bison also . I think you will be pleased with any of the flavors .
4 #### Second time buying these . My dog loves them . Only complaint is that their seems to be quite a few crumbs at the bottom . ... but still worth the price !
3 #### My little Wicket was not at all crazy about this product , will have a hard time getting rid of them without having wasted our money .
5 #### my dog loves these , and they are good for him
5 #### My beautiful perro loves the treat ! ! Do all kinds of tricks to get it .
5 #### I have a tough chewer , a labrador . He has n't broke this one yet and he LOVES it . We hide it from him so he 's not constantly chewing on it , but I feel like this will last us a very long time ! Great buy .
5 #### This a Great toy ! You can put treats in it !
5 #### pups love these , last a long time for hardy chewers
5 #### My siberian husky loves this ! Has had it for months and has not torn it apart .
5 #### My Large 80 lb Pit will chew threw all toys including every other Kong in days , we have had this Kong for a couple months and he has not ripped it apart yet ! !
5 #### Got this for our senior kitty after our new kittens had been on the pro plan for kittens . Her coat is nicer than it 's been in many many years , and no problems with hairballs . Also she has n't been running outside to eat grass like she used to !
5 #### I received the long neck dinosaur . The large / giant one . My 6 month old , 30 lb Shepard mix likes it . It 's too big for her , but I like that because she ca n't demolish it too quickly . It 's good for when her nipping / chewing gets aggressive because she can really go to town on it .
5 #### My Labradoodle absolutely loves this and the texture / roughness of it gives him great chewing joy ! He is a powerful chewer and this has lasted for a while without too much damage ! Just bought another one to give him for Christmas ! He ca n't have too many chew toys !
5 #### Both cats love all of the Max Cat Nutro chunks in sauce , and usually eat all the food instead of licking the gravy and leaving the rest . This has also helped Cavity gain some much needed weight to help with his Thyroid condition . I fully recommend this !
5 #### My cats love it , some flavors better than others , depends on your cats tastes
1 #### Kitty hated it to be more exact I had to give away the rest of the case to a cat who did like it , so maybe my cat was just being ' cat '
5 #### The pate is happily devoured by 5 furry " babies " .
3 #### Doing subscription . All cans dented . Humph . Cats finicky and like grocery store brand better .
5 #### My kitties love this . Om nom nom nom nom . They are on a ( mostly ) all canned food diet per our veterinarian 's recommendations and they like all the variety .
5 #### I adopted my cat from a shelter and they sent me home with a smaller bag of this and he seems to like it and doing well on it so i decided to buy a bigger one ! My cat eats it so i m happy
5 #### The cat likes it and is supposed to be healthy for him This is s a supplement so he gets one small spoon full twice a day
5 #### Have a very picky cat and she loves this .
5 #### My cat can finish it in two minutes ! Love it so much
2 #### pro : - good sturdy plastic - really big , ( it 's called GIANT for a reason ) , note the dimensions given and measure your space carefully con : - in my case it 's TOO big ( my own fault for not noting the dimensions carefully ) - the side is a bit too high ( does n't really have a lower side for easier entrance ) , obviously the cat can jump in , but I think it creates negative experience for her ( at least for my cat ) that it requires some " work " to go to the bathroom ( as in , she ca n't just casually walk in ) Final note : if you have a large cat this could be for you ; my cat is only 8 lbs so it 's too big for her .
5 #### So far , doing fine . The size of it seems to work better for my cat . She was knocking litter everywhere ( outside the box ) before , but with this one , the surrounding area is kept mostly clear . She just needed more room , I guess .
4 #### I wish the box was just a bit bigger and the interior sides were smooth with out a ridge . Other than that it works great .
3 #### This food smells funny , and has wheat . Not for my puppy !
1 #### My dogs wo n't even touch this . If I add it with wet food they actually spit these nibbles out . On dog food advisor website this food received a score of 2 out of 5 . I have since switched to Earthborn Holistic , which has a much higher rating and they love it !
5 #### My pup has been on this food since we brought him home 6 months ago . He is happy and healthy . Hill 's has done more research than just about any other company out there . Also , do n't get so hung up on the " chicken meal " aspect-- it is an efficient way to include chicken . Think about it-- how do these companies like Blue etc . actually include wet chicken into dry food ? They do n't . They process it . People knocking Hill 's for including chicken meal need to get a grip . Let your common sense be your judge . This food is balanced , not over - proteined like a lot of other brands , which can actually do long term damage . My dog is energetic and goes # 1 and # 2 just fine . He loves his Science Diet . I do n't plan on changing any time soon .
4 #### This last a long time my dogs just keep playing with it .
5 #### One of my retrievers has officially claimed this as her own . She 's a strong chewer and has began to decapitate dino . The pieces that she chews off are very small , but you may want to supervise your strong chewer at first to gauge their chomping power . I pictured this somewhat bigger in my head , but it 's no smaller than a standard Nylabone . I have no second thoughts about ordering a second or third if that time ever comes .
5 #### My dogs love this thing . Through some peanut butter in there and it keeps them busy ! Great for their teeth with the grooves .
5 #### Works with milkbones or any similar sized treat for larger dog ( perfect size for my parents lab ) . We started by putting kibble in it , which the lab easily figured out you just tip the toy over and there 's the food . When we put a milkbone instead she had to chew a bit to get it out . I have n't tried it with whipped cream or peanut butter yet but I imagine they 'd be chewing a while in that case . It has grooves which i suppose are designed for tooth brushing .
2 #### Or rather my dog does n't . He chews on EVERYTHING Kong branded I buy , but he wo n't touch this one .
2 #### Decent item , but not as well made as the red cone we had before . While our dog is a strong chewer , the cone lasted for 6 months . She is constantly biting off small pieces off on this one .
5 #### The dog loves them ... She knows when they have arrived before the packing box is even opened . Then she waits and watches until I pull the bag from the box and then I swear she smiles . Before the bag is opened , her excitement overwhelms her and she starts to salivate puddles of expectations . I should make a small video of her ritual .. if a picture says a thousand words ..
5 #### My dogs love these and come running whenever they hear the bag open !
5 #### My mom 's dog BO absolutely approves these treats . But so does my friends 2 dogs ... The company seems to take pride in its products :) Hope this helps with your buying decisions .
5 #### My cats will only eat this ! They have more expensive food but wo n't eat it .
3 #### Cats did n't like it and would n't eat it . Not much else to say here . Looks like a quality product , just did n't impress my cats .
5 #### My cats love this food . It 's their favorite . I like that it 's a pate .
5 #### I 've had three cats for 15 years now , and have always fed them Friskies wet and Whiskas dry . My 15 year old loves the chicken filet in gravy and the senior salmon . I have tried a lot of other brands over the years , but always come back to Friskies . My three are doing great .
5 #### My Ginger Pie , eats this original formula . She gets 1/3 cup roughly 2 times a day or less if she is not really finishing . Crumbs go outside for birds ( she is an indoor only cat ) My other Cat , Hogan , prefers the SD hairball formula . Neither will touch the other 's food . I do n't know why this should be . She does seem to have more hairballs than he does . I brush them both . I 've used SD for many years , for many cats while doing rescue , unless a cat has a special need and something else is called for . I had one cat live to be 26 . I have happy , healthy cats . I like that this does not have too much protein , and we do n't seem to have too many kidney and renal issues on it . They can only metabolize so much , as they are domesticated . I tend to feel many people overthink the cat food , and underthink enrichment and spending time with the cats , entertaining them , brushing , etc . Play with your cats .
5 #### Great nutrition for my cats . They have sensitive stomachs and it does n't make them vomit
4 #### Feeding five cats and they all love this food .
5 #### I was n't very hopeful about it being a hit when I bought this , but I was pleasantly surprised . My one guy plays with it every day and the other has now found the perfect thing to scratch instead of my sofa ! Best money I spent on pet items in a long time !
5 #### cats love this and I m glad i can buy replacement cardboard for it
5 #### keeps the idiots entertained but add a twinkle ball and there all derp !
4 #### Seeing as my dog eats it I 'm not sure if I can accurately rate it . She does n't punch me when I pour it into her bowl so I figure that 's worth a good rating .
5 #### We 've branched out to other foods , but always go back because our puppy likes this the best .
5 #### Great price for this dog good . My puppies love it
5 #### One of my local rescue organizations uses this particular canned variety to entice sick puppies to take their medicines . The consistency / texture is firm enough for us to scoop out a spoonful to form into a ball encasing a pill , and the puppies gobble it up ! Much more effective than using pill pockets , which a lot of dogs ( including mine ) refuse to take .
5 #### This was what our breeder gave us when we took our puppy home . I automatically assumed that it would be too expensive and began looking around for other choices , but was bummed because pup seemed to be thriving on this brand . So glad to discover it here on Amazon at a reasonable price !
5 #### Bought the 33 lb bag for our MaltiPoo puppy because the breeder recommended it ! Puppy loves it , and never has digestive problems . Her coat is gorgeous . Her eyes bright . She 's smart and alert ! THIS is a Good Thing ! ! :-)
5 #### Our dog loves this stuff , and the ingredient panel shows this to be an above average dog food . It 's not grain free , but unless your dog needs that for allergies , then you should be happy with this . The kibble size is very small , but out dog seems to love it .
4 #### My red - nosed pit bull 75 lb puppy loved this food , and not only that but some of my finicky cats also enjoyed it , which says a lot . The kibbles were small , which I like , and dark in color , and smelled really good , good enough to attract the cats ! Now that says everything , right there ! ! ! !
5 #### Our year old puppies ca n't destroy these toys . They provide lots of fun chew time and can be cleaned up in the dishwasher when needed . We love this brand . Only toys our dogs do n't destroy . Highly recommend ! ! !
3 #### Pretty durable , dog loves to chew(teething ) , but watch the foot section has started to splinter . Prefer dogwood sticks that do n't splinter into sharp pieces . Make sure to supervise your dog with this and discard when is starts to become worn !
5 #### My dog , Willow , loves this . It can get noisy when she 's really gnawing on it though .
3 #### my pup is more interested in toys that dispense some rewards .... I see this lying in the yard more than in his mouth
3 #### seems like a tough toy but my dog had ignored it .
4 #### Even though I like it , because of the ingredients and size ; our kitties are not exactly thrilled with it .
5 #### Kitty had chronic diarrhea . Bought this food and within 3 weeks she had normal bowel movements , and stopped begging because she was still hungry . HIGHLY recommend for cats with sensitive tummies . Wish it was n't so expensive though .
2 #### When I bought this at a local store , my cats gobbled it up .... so I bought a case of the 12 ounce cans from Amazon and my cats ( all 4 ) wo n't go near it . They hate it ..... this I do not understand ... this batch is kind of like mud , not moist .... i will try adding some broth since it 's not very wet and see if they will eat it .
4 #### This is a great quality ingredient cat food that both my cats love , even the super picky one ! I also like that it does n't have an awful smell that many of the other canned cat foods do . I 've ordered several cases and do agree with other reviewers that the texture / consistency sometimes varies from case to case but we have n't had any issues with it .
5 #### Cat was having litter problems until we added second litter box adjacent to old one . This did the trick . Litter box is standard size but extra deep . Cat goes to this one first - probably because it is cleaner !
5 #### My cat needed an XL Litter Pan because he does n't know how to keep his litter in the regular size pans , and scratches the sides instead of the litter . This makes it easier on him since he 's large .
5 #### Second time I 've ordered this litter pan . It is the ideal size for my non - spraying male , large Siamese . It 's sturdy enough to pick up with litter inside and not be wobbly . The edges and bottom are smooth - unlike some other brands I 've seen in stores . Both times I have received blue which is just fine . This will be the pan I will continue to purchase as needed for as long as it is available .
5 #### Great for my large cat ( 18 pounds , long and tall ! ) .
5 #### This is the longest lasting Kong I have purchased . My Belgian Malinois has chewed the regular extreme Kongs in half in a day . This one has lasted 2 months so far .
5 #### My dogs are chewers and they absolutely love these ! !
3 #### Not her favorite toy . Mostly because no treats fit in it and the Kong spray only last so long . She chews on if for a few mins and moves on .
5 #### The dogs love these . I have found them indestructible , even for our big dogs that really like to chew .
5 #### One of my dog 's favorite toys ! So far pretty indestructible and she destroys most toys in minutes !
4 #### Very strong , but my dog does not play with it . Very heavy .
5 #### I have fed the Dry Food , Soft Food , and the Treats in this brand and flavor to my dog for years now . Our vet first recommended it years ago because he has allergies . He loves them all and it helps with his allergies to have the limited ingredients .
4 #### Dog do n't mind these treats but they are not one of their favorites . Will not purchase again , no point if dogs are n't crazy about them
5 #### My dog loves these . I carry little bags of them in all my pockets ! !
4 #### These treats are fine , but too big for my medium - size dog . Had I realized that , I would not have ordered . They are probably good for a large dog .
1 #### I need to add this to my review I wrote before . The cat food is fine , but Amazon ca n't meet it 's obligations to send it when you subscribe to Auto Ship ! Two months now it 's ' not in stock ' and I have to go out and buy it . And if I did n't check my account I would n't even know . No notice that my cat food is n't coming . NOT cool , Amazon . Do n't get too big , customer service is your bread and butter . Take better care of loyal repeat customers . Here is my first review where I gave it 5 stars ....... I have 5 picky cats and for once , I found a food they ALL will eat ! I like that it 's not full of nasty stuff like byproducts and animal innerds . it 's guilt free to feed to my darlings . And the price is very good , too . Nothing else to say , it 's good , healthy food for them and they EAT it . I 'm happy with it and I have the auto - delivery so I wo n't run out of it . Thanks , Amazon .
5 #### Love ordering online , instead of driving to Pet shop to get it ... price is better too !
5 #### What my vet recommends delivered to my door . What more can a girl ask for ?
5 #### Been using this since he was a puppy . He 's healthy , great coat and the price is reasonable for a high end dog food .
5 #### Since we got our puppy in Aug. 2014 this is all I buy and only here at Amazon . I get this because it is a higher grade of healthy food for a developing puppy . He loves it and I feel good that it is of a high quality . With Amazon Prime I get it very quickly .
5 #### Best puppy food we have found . No diareaha , digests good , love it delivered to the door .
5 #### great dog toy ... good for teeth and a hit with my dog ! Looks like a barbell and holds treats ... Recommended by my German Shepherd ...
5 #### My sheperd loves this . Very durable . He has n't chewed any pieces off .
4 #### Good distraction for my dogs when we are away . I stuff it with meat scraps and freeze before giving it to them . Only problem is that the hole through the center is too large for most treats to stay inside . I use peanut butter as a glue ...
5 #### Daisy Dog told me to give this Kong 5 stars ! She loves it ! ( Especially with treats inside ! ) She is a Boxer - Pit . Toys usually do n't stand up to the " Daisy - Test " . But this Kong certainly does !
5 #### My 50 pound Golden Husky mix loves this toy . His favorite of all his Christmas gifts . Never out of his sight for long . At first I thought it may be too big for him but he has no problem to carry it everywhere he goes ! Chews away ..... and it stays unbroken . He is a very strong chewer .
2 #### My dog does n't like to chew this , so it 's not a great hit .
5 #### This is amazing for the puppies but I think that is may hurt a little more for them since there are so many ridges . Also pretty hard to clean if anything gets on it while in the kennel but hey that s exactly what I ordered !
1 #### Dog on package / picture is a large dog . My 40 pound puppy ate the feet in about 2 min .
5 #### great koi food , been using it for 10 years .
5 #### The fish like it and that is what I care about
4 #### Too many calories , 504 cal / cup , so I give my cat only about 15 pieces a day , mixed in with Halo kibble . Good nutritionally .
5 #### love it ! I have 2 eight month old cats , did n't realize I bought the adult cat formula but they love it ! They wo n't even eat their old kitten food !
5 #### This brand was recommended by my Vet and my cat has been getting this formula for a few years now .
4 #### Cat loves it . Corners at bottom somewhat hard to clean .
4 #### very large . a little bit high for my bunny but its ok .
3 #### Has a plastic smell , unlike other ones like this . Very slowly improving , but may never entirely stop smelling .
4 #### This is definitely giant , compared to other litter boxes I have . There 's nothing wrong with it , but I think my cat is just a little too small for it b / c he 's not a huge fan . I do n't think it 's the box 's fault though - just my cat 's preference .
3 #### Ingredient list seems great and this brand has a good reputation . It is pate like in consistency so unfortunately my cats would n't eat it .
5 #### I have two Maine Coon rescues . Both are fed twice a day . I score the food in four after opening and remove 1/4 of the pat which is then halved . Each gets 1/8 in the morning and 1/8 in the evening . The food is gone and they beg for it . The female put on a lot of weight despite eating such a small amount and the male filled out . Both are supplemented with kibbles .
3 #### Make no mistake : Friskies is a bad food for a cat . If you want to feed your cat expensive , quality food , you should feed your cat something like Merrick . And then you can enjoy the experience of your cat staring at you blankly and allowing $ 50 worth of food to dry in front of you . While Friskies is NOT a good cat food -- it really is n't -- it 's the only thing my cats will eat . Unlike dogs , cats literally will starve themselves into kidney failure when they dislike their food . They are that stubborn . I compromise by feeding them an expensive dry food and I just give them Friskies as a treat . With all that in mind , PLEASE do not feed your cats ONLY Friskies . Supplement with an expensive dry food ; even an expensive dry food is n't as expensive as wet food , will clean their teeth , will reduce their breath smell and will last much longer than a cheap dry food because they will eat less ( less fillers ) . On a quality food like Taste of the Wild or Merrick or even Blue Buffalo , your cat will have a smoother coat , a healthier weight and more energy .
5 #### My cat loves nesting on this thing and rolling around on it . He scratches the cardboard and smacks the ball around every time I come home from work .
5 #### Cheaper than Petsmart ! The vet recommended it as my Keeshond may have a sensitive stomach ...
5 #### My puppy loves this food ! I mix a little in with her dry food and she eats it right up !
5 #### Good nutrition . My terrier liked this one for 2 - 3 weeks and that 's really good . She tires of most of them after 2 - 3 days .
3 #### Nylabone is great for any dog other than a strong chewer . This did n't last too long in our household
5 #### Very durable . After months of chewing from one large , very powerful chewer dog and three small dogs , Mr Rex is still going strong . He 's only lost some of his head . These are NOT fun to step on with barefeet first thing in the pre - coffee morning when they 're chewed on a bit . :)
5 #### Our Husky , John Denver , loves these and they last like nothing else .
3 #### This particular Nylabone did not hold up as well as others . Lasted only about a week . I now look for Nylabone rated for strong or aggressive chewers . I think they are a great product and my dog loves them . She is a yellow lab mix .
3 #### dogs do not care for as much as some others
5 #### Great product . My vet highly recommends Natural Balance and my dog loves it ! Pricing out beats feed stores and chain stores ! You can really tell the difference in over health of your dog while using this product . I have always used Natural Balance since my veterinarian recommended it .
5 #### Dogs love them and so I love them . Trying to eliminate chicken products due to skin problems so hopefully these will work . I love the limited ingredient products .
5 #### These are the pretty much the only biscuits we give our dogs , as one of them is allergic to grains . They love these treats , though Labradors will eat just about anything ! A couple of our friends ' dogs wo n't eat them , though , so if your dog is fussy , it may not work for you .
4 #### Good for cat litter and great for letting doe rise . This is a remarkable multi use product .
1 #### Nature 's Balance is best . No chicken by - product blah blah , which my cat was allergic to . Saved my cat 's life . They also have grain free .
5 #### Only cat food my 1 year tuxedo cat will eat . I switched from the same kitty version to this and it was a seamless transition . She loves it ! Great choice for an every day dry food . I do n't feed her any additional food other than treats throughout the day and the vet continuously says she 's amazed I leave out so much food and that she self regulates with it considering she 's a 100 % indoor cat . Will be buying this food the duration of my cat 's life , it 's so great . Now I just need to find a good storage container to put it in ( make note this bag is NOT resealable ) , I use one of the chip clips I have at home to keep it closed .
5 #### I had been using Purina One until recently . Purina added some pieces , lighter color and softer texture , which both of my cats actually spit those pieces out . My cats have never done that before ! I wrote Purina about it . So I switched to Pro Plan and they really love it .
5 #### My two indoor ragdoll cats love this food . I also have a feral cat that is becoming tame and she loves it too . Meets me at the front door every morning meowing to get her food . I would recommend this
5 #### Slowly transitioning my cat to Wellness , so far she loves it !
5 #### I have 5 cats eating this food and what I like about it is that my cats who need weight control can eat it , my petite " queen of the hairballs can eat it " as can my cats who need a regular diet . Everyone likes the taste and very little is left behind . It 's much easier than buying three different bags of food .
5 #### I have purchased this product before . Of the variety of foods that I have tried , the fish really go after it ! One of my fish is about 12 years old now . I had as many as 36 fish in the pond once , until the great blue heron discovered a new restaurant .
5 #### Fish love this stuff and you ca n't beat Amazon price
5 #### I have had my koi for years , and this is the only food I have ever feed them . Raised my koi from babies and they are huge now , so the food works for us .
5 #### We have an aggressive 50 lb pit mix and she needs a toy that can stand up to her chewing as well as be a little softer on her poor teeth / gums . We do fill it with treats from time to time but also let her just gnaw on it . So far it has stayed fairly in tact
2 #### He likes the Mixed Grill only ; wo n't buy this mix again . I guess I 'll have to just troll the local pet wharehouse to glean what he Will eat ......
5 #### We tried a few types of canned food . Friskies was less expensive than Fancy Feast . The cat refused to eat the 9Lives brand . Advice is to try a can from the local store before you order a case . Cats and dogs can be picky eaters .
4 #### The cats are happy with it . Same varieties you can get in the store . I like the subscribe and save for this product , it 's one of those that 's nice to have delivered to your door .
5 #### This is the first time I 've ordered cat food online , it 's a great product , the delivery time was excellent and my cat really likes the pate .
4 #### Great price . Replaced the ball with a heavier one .
5 #### Dogs love it and it stands up to strong chewers !
5 #### These things simply rock ! Have gone through a few of them with my dogs , they love them . Purchased them as gifts for others dogs , they love them . Where other chew toys get lost and forgotten , these dinosaurs have some kind of magic in them , the dogs keep coming back to them over and over . They do wear after time and will need to be replaced , but I have 70+lb strong chewers and they last a very long time . Even so , the pricing is awesome so you do n't feel bad about buying more ... One BIG drawback that I 've heard from multiple people . Do n't step on them when its dark ! ! Ouch ! !
1 #### My dog liked it ok . Enough to chew a thousand tiny razor sharp points into it for me to lacerate my toes on repeatedly .
5 #### Only canned dog food I buy . Causes no excessive gas or belly problems for my three dogs .
5 #### My dog likes this food . Small bites are easier for her to chew . I am on the Amazon plan to get this every few months and I am happy not to have to carry the heave bag from the store .
3 #### its o k but I prefer all natural precise .
5 #### My puppy LOVES this food ! ! He goes crazy for it ... thank you !
5 #### Wonderful to have a treat that is limited ingredient for dogs with sensitive skin or stomachs .
5 #### my dog has allergies and he loves these limited ingredient treats . Vet recommended and there is no more scratching .
4 #### great dog treats ! our pup loves these . they 're a bit large to be used as training treats and they 're hard biscuits so our puppy could n't eat these right away , but once he got to 10 weeks or so he gobbled these right down .
5 #### Great treat sizes for the Newfoundlands and I usually break them in 1/2 .
5 #### My dogs LOVE these treats ! My smaller dog has food allergies , but my big dog does not . They both prefer these to anything else I 've purchased . Very pleased .
5 #### my dogs love them . NO chicken products which is important to me as my dogs are allergic to chicken
5 #### The vet asked what kind of food we are feeding him because he has such a beautiful coat she said to keep doing what we 're doing
5 #### This product is a little cheaper than buying at Petsmart ( unless there is a sale of course or a coupon ! ) . There is a ton of information on this product , so I 'm not going to any more details about it . You can look online or even google to product to get the nutrition facts . But overall the most important thing to know is that this is a mid - tiered Purina product . Not the best and not the worst out there . Yes , there is grain in the product ( not great for your cat ! ) but it has all the nutritional value that your cat needs . Some cats will thoroughly enjoy this product and others will not . Some will happily eat this and get sick for higher end products like the Buffalo Blue or the Science Diet products . It all depends on your cat 's digestive system . I definitely recommend this product for anyone under a budget , but wants something that has some nutritional value for their cat .
5 #### This is a good size ! Mine came as a darker blue than pictured . No complaints , just an observation .
5 #### The pan is well made and last a long time but is MUCH bigger than I expected . I thought it was the large size so make sure you measure before ordering .
5 #### These are the perfect size for me ... two of them fit in the bathtub perfectly . I have two cats , and two medium size boxes works better than one huge one . The material is great , and the sides are the right angle for maximum scrape and scoop efficiency .
4 #### No more cat litter outside of the box . It features a Sloped end that allows my 16 year old cat very easy access to the box without being an issue for spillage . He is a happy kitty , and I am a happy " person who cleans up after said kitty ! ! " Seriously , a good product , especially for a multi cat household . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .
5 #### Great litter pan . I have 2 cats and they both seem to like their own litter pan to go in . I love the extra large one . The sides are high enough that it keeps most of the litter in the box . I have cats that like to kick litter all over the place so this helps keep " most " of the litter in . I have larger cats so this size is perfect for them . Another thing I like is that scooping pee and poop is easy in this pan . Even if you have cats that like to pee in the corner of the pan , this one is so much easier to clean than other pans .
5 #### Great quality cat food . My 2 cats love it . Recommended
5 #### So good , even my dog loves it ! This has worked on my cat for 10 years SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE IS NOT REAL . NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY , YOU WONT GET ANYTHING TO WORK . I HAVE TRIED FOR A YEAR .
5 #### Very easy switch from the Hills Science Diet Kitten to this adult package . My cat loves it . No issues at all . Will purchase again
5 #### This is very good food and my cats like the taste
5 #### We have 3 rescue cats and they all like this kibble .
5 #### Love this toy ! Just got it earlier this evening ! She has n't played with the ball yet , but she has scratched on the scratch board ! She even took a nap on it ! So its a hit , nd I m sure she s going to have a ball with it !
5 #### My cat loves this food . Comes in many flavors and gives her the right variety .
5 #### Wish it were possible to buy a variety pack so the kitties did n't get bored of the same flavor every day .
3 #### I like the Wellness foods , but the cans are always dented . This time there were 4 dented cans . No sharp edges and probably no breaks or leaks , but still get nervous using them . Other reviews have complained about this , so why is n't something done to protect them . I suspect they 're packed that way , because the box they arrive in is always fine . Just want to add that Wellness sent me coupons to replace the dented cans at a local retailer .
5 #### I have very picky eaters , and they absolutely love this food . I try and feed them food that is a better quality than the foods found at the grocery store , as I believe that will help them live a longer , healthier life . I switch up the flavors to keep things interesting , but I consistently buy this brand because they enjoy it .
4 #### Came early and my kittens loved it but got tired of the same one flavor .
5 #### I switched to canned food exclusively after joining a Facebook group where I was educated on feeding only the best . I felt like such a failure having used dry exclusively for YEARS ! More than 30 years ! Mainly because of cats ' great need for liquid , and the lack thereof leading to Chronic Kidney Failure , I made the switch . It is no small hurdle analyzing brands for quality ( grain free , of course ) , price , and most importantly tastiness . All along Wellness rated in all three categories , the only hang up being the carrageenan . MANY cat owners WILL NOT use a cat food with carrageenan and I put Wellness aside for a while because of it . But IT IS the cheapest of all the best rated cat foods ( 20c an ounce compared to 50c+ ) AND it is the favorite of cats most of the time . All cats are going to have picky spells from time to time , but they are always happy to come back to Wellness ! I have 5 cats and all have settled on Wellness ! That 's amazing in and of itself ! I have been feeding Wellness for a good while now and there have been no complications of any kind . However , there is still the carrageenan and about that , I just do n't know . Additionally , Wellness has just been included in Subscribe and Save , so now I can save even more . I just ordered 72 12.5 oz cans !
5 #### My cat loves this food been using it for 8 years
4 #### Our dog is an aggressive chewer ; this works well ; she has not torn it up . I put pork rinds inside , and often she ca n't get them out and after a while , she gives up . That 's the only reason I have it 4 stars . However , she does chew it and has not torn it up :)
5 #### Great toy , our pit / lab mix loves it . Indestructible so far .
5 #### Absolutely the best kong toy I 've ever purchased . Puppy loves it , carries it everywhere and it 's very very durable . GREAT for strong chewers .
5 #### The toy is pretty big and super durable ! ! I have 3 dogs about 70 lbs each and they have not been able to do any damage . They also like to roll it and they seem to be enjoying it . Great for the price ! ! !
5 #### Very happy with this . My dog loves to chew on soft squishy things but not the antlers and bones I get him to clean his teeth . He does chew on this and it seems to be working . He teeth look much better .
3 #### My dog is n't impressed ... he has n't played with it at all . Perhaps he will though when he gets bored with his other toys .
2 #### very well made toy , can stuff it , but not easily . VERY heavy , my dog does not really like it . One thing for sure , I would not want to drop it on my foot !
5 #### My puppy loves this food so I just bought 2 more cases of it . I tried other puppy food and he did n't like it so I am a happy camper .
2 #### Unfortunately , my dog has no interest in this toy .
5 #### Great toy for my dogs . It 's hard to find things that they ca n't destroy in seconds , plus I love that it 's a dinosaur .
5 #### I 'd say he likes it ... It 's head has been chewed off ... This has held up over a week ... Trust me fer him ... That 's a good thing ... He is a small dog Jack Russell ( or Rat ) Terrier mix ...
5 #### This is my Koi 's favorite food ! They love it and my dogs even try to eat it !
5 #### wish had ordered in a smaller quantity , will be using for years
5 #### we have been buying this for about 3 years , great product fish gobble it up .
5 #### Great Products and Great company to deal with . 5 Stars+
5 #### These are wonderful for my allergy dog , she loves them and I love the ingredient list !
5 #### Simple list of ingredients , good digestibility for my dog that has a sensitive tummy . Good amount of ' crunch ' as well !
4 #### Bought this so my pups had something relatively healthy under the Christmas tree ! To my surprise - they like it ! !
4 #### My dog really loves these yummy treats . And even though she 's a bigger breed dog [ choc . lab ] , she likes these sized treats because she feels like she s getting more treats than giving her 1 bigger one :) A huge hit for my dog , for sure ! ! ! !
4 #### The toy itself is fine . But , the cat never took to it .
5 #### Another powerful chewer toy that survives the jaws . This is another one that is unpleasant to step on and is a good idea to replace regularly ( we replace ours annually ) , but a great choice for the powerful chewer in your life
5 #### best nylabone out there , my dogs are not on their 15th one but watch stepping on these suckers in bare feet , its like a lego only sharper .
4 #### We ordered and received the stegosaurus ( which if you read carefully , it does say they ship a random assortment ) - and we like it . I have 2 pitbulls , it seems that this toy took a while to draw them in but we have a lot of bones in the house . So , every once in a while they will really start in on this toy , specifically the tail end where it 's skinnier . They 're able to hold the Dino in their paws to keep steady , which is nice about the length and size .
5 #### I always buy this so I 'm not sure what to write ! Great product !
4 #### Some of my cats like it , but Jiji , one of the cats , would n't touch it even if he was hungry ! But to be fair , Jiji is a very finicky kitty .
3 #### My cats do not like to eat it , but the white cat that lives outdoors just gobbles it down .
5 #### Four cases arrived on time , No dents , Have been feeding this for about 6 months and 3 cats eat 2 cans a day and leave not a morsel . After as much research as I could do - feel that I 'm doing the best I can for them . Thinking that the cost balances out in very few vet , visits . Always reading and researching though and am very pleased with this cat food . Thanks .
1 #### Pieces are too big and like everyone else - my cats are throwing up and no way to get a refund . This will be my last bag of this . Will switch to another brand .
4 #### Cats seem to like it , they are very picky !
5 #### Our cat has been taking # 2 outside her other boxes . The vet had no suggestion , since she was n't ill . She is a portly feline and I read on the intraweb that fat cats should get a larger box . Since we got this last week , she has moved her dumpage back into the box !
5 #### Very large and very easy to clean . I have a few cats and one is pretty big . He has claimed this one as his and he looks much more comfortable using this versus the other smaller boxes .
4 #### I personally have n't tried it but my fish seem to like it .
5 #### My Koi love it . Nice large bag , should last a while !
5 #### This is a good product for my new puppy . He dives right in and seems to love it .
3 #### Our Yorkie seems to like the food and you ca n't really beat the price . Although I accidentally bought puppy formula ; I Will plan try adult small breed in the future .
5 #### My dog LOVES this ! We stuff of full of treats when we put her in her kennel and she 's occupied for at least an hour . Great buy and very durable ! My pit / lab mix is ~40 lbs and this is a great size for her . She can destroy toys within seconds and this has held up . I will definitely be sticking with this line of toys !
4 #### Expected them to be slightly larger as they are advertised as Extra Large . Our very large dogs do love to chew and carry them around so the Kong reputation is safe .
4 #### My dog and I both love this product . It withstands his chewing very well and keeps him involved in safe play options . The only reason I gave it a four and not a five is because it is either too hard to get items to stay inside or too hard to get them out -- it is hard to find that goldilocks zone . Because there are two large holes on each end , stuff falls out quite easily . So , to make things stick you have to moisten things or add " sticky " stuff ( i.e. peanut butter ) to make things stick . But then it is too hard for the dog to get them out . If I had the option to purchase again , I would rather buy the regular Kongs over this design .
5 #### My dog likes this and plays with it . I have n't put any treats in it like I did with his other kong toy he does n't play with . So I think he thinks of it as a toy and not just a food dispensing thing .
5 #### My dogs love these treats and they are healthy for them
5 #### Excellent dog treat and a nice medium size . Has a strong smell my dog loves .
5 #### I was displeased when I saw these treats are cookies because my Toy Chiweenie is not fond of dog cookies . However , after I broke the cookie into smaller , more manageable sized pieces , she took one quick sniff & immediately began devouring the treat . SHE LOVES THESE ! And I am very pleased with the limited list of grain - free premium ingredients . I 'm shocked to find a 14 ounce bag of such high quality treats for the low add - on price of only $ 4.49 . I will definitely be reordering these treats ... even if the price increases to three times what I paid for this bag . And I will also be ordering other types of treats from Natural Balance 's LIT line .
4 #### My dog did n't particularly like these and she likes most treats . But they were fresh and a good price
5 #### My dogs love theae , and they are limited ingredient treats which make them healthier . These are my new biscuits for my four legged children , and they could n't be happier .
5 #### Ca n't complain about these - simple treats that my dog likes .
5 #### We save these for special occasion treats - she loves them !
5 #### Our dogs love these treats . They seem to disappear in about 15 seconds when it is bone time !
4 #### The packages are well protected in bubble wrap and in a good size box . No need to worry about damaged goods . Always on time so I do n't have to worry about running out .
5 #### This new pre chopped cat food is 100 % easier to give to your cat to feed with a great price Pros : Already chopped up , better taste , About $ 10 for a 24 pack using Subscribe and Save with a 15 % discount Cons : none
5 #### The kitties love it - what more can I say ? ? Their basic diet is Science Diet dry food . This is their Treat food and they love it .
4 #### My senior cat likes the classic style of Friskies best ; this item gives the best value per can . I only wish there were a different combination , not including salmon , but if I wait long enough , the cats forget they do n't like the fish ! They go back to eating it .
4 #### My cats do n't love pate food , but they will eat this if I do n't put anything else out . The price is so great here that I still purchase .
5 #### Mix Pate with water ... And walla ! Cat worthy ! I tried the bits , the shreds , the bits and shreds .. you name it . They would lick the gravy and leave the meat . So I discovered witht the pate , with a squirt or two of water ( which I control better from a small empty dishwashing liquid bottle ) I can make the mush that they love ! They love it so much in fact , both will lick the slop up and leave a pile of waterless mush ! They wo n't touch it again until I add more water , and make more mush . Do we own the cats or do they own us ? Silly question ...
5 #### My cat is willing to eat it . It has good ingredients . Good price for the quality of the food .
1 #### Not sure what is in this food but my cat will not touch it , have n't seen her react this way to canned food before . Donating the rest and going back to the other brand she loves .
5 #### Four cats get this food log in the morning , along with a scoop of wellness dry food . One cat meows all day at us if we skip a food log , and just feed dry food . It 's safe to say they find this food utterly delicious , it is n't difficult to see why cause it smells utterly delicious .
2 #### Smell is pretty bad - cat eats maybe 1/4 of the can while fresh then - will not touch it .
5 #### I love buying my dog food online . This product was just as it should be .
5 #### Recommended by two of my vets and loved by my Boston Terriers . It is so convenient to have shipped to my home via Prime .
1 #### My cat does nt play with this ... catnip does nt help . I thought he does nt like catnip at fist but he loves the catnip toy I bought him later .
3 #### I have literally dozens of Kong toys in every shape , size , and variety . This one is not a favorite for my two dobermans .
3 #### I really like King products and was very interested when it said for the " hard chewer " . I have 5 dogs and two are Pit Bulls who seem to chew everything up in a matter of minutes . This lasted over 3 hours - the longest one yet ! While I am pleased with the Kong products , I am certain this would last for other dogs who are less inclined to " seek and destroy " any toy in their path . Would hold up well for others , not suitable for a Pit Bull !
3 #### So my dog only chews toys if they are filled . This one is sort of hard to fill given the openings on both ends being pretty large . oh well .
5 #### Our dog loves most all of his Kong Toys .... made in USA which I am thrilled with !
5 #### Pup 's happy , so am I ! Heavy duty kong toys are the only toys my pup wo n't destroy .
1 #### 7 month old Labradoole chewed of off flakes of material within hours , yet his Puppy Kong is still all in one piece . When did Kong products become hit or miss ?
5 #### My doggie loves it ! Better price than anywhere else .
5 #### My mini Goldendoodle loves this toy . Has lasted a long time . This and his hollow stick toy are his favorites .
5 #### My dog chewed up the first dinosaur she got so I reordered . She is going to be so happy to see that she is getting a new one . Good girl ! !
1 #### Dangerous for strong chewers . My Lab destroyed her second one in a day and then began vomiting and pooping out plastic bits .
5 #### My dogs love nylabones . They are perfect for our little destructive chewers . All three of our dogs love chewing their nylabones every night after dinner or when they 're bored . They get them out of their little basket , have them a nice afternoon chew , and then leave them on the floor for my wife to step on . I think its funny when she yells out about these $ % & @ break - yo - foot - a - saurus toys . But I like it better that our little furry babies love these things .
5 #### What else can I say ? This plastic box does a great job of holding cat litter and cat poop . The sides are high , so unless your cat is doing some crazy acrobatics in the litterbox , all the good stuff should stay inside . Aesthetically , it 's a litter box . Ai n't much you can do about that . Functionally ? Perfect . 5/5 would scoop again .
5 #### Great large size that I could n't find in the pet stores . I recently moved my 8 year old cat 's box to the basement . He 's a big boy , ragdoll weighing in at 18 lbs , and insisted on using a tiny litter box he had as a kitten . The little box was in the bathroom , and I use flushable litter . His tiny box issues included lots of misses , and poop in the hall when his tiny box was n't clean . Fast forward and thanks to Amazon , I ordered two of these large litter boxes and mats for the basement box move . Believe it or not , I could n't find this size in any local pet store - I have no idea why they would n't carry them , but they did n't . My big boy is happier with two big boxes ( one for poo and one for pee ) and the mats keep the litter mess contained . I do n't remember what I paid for them , but whatever it cost , it was worth it .
5 #### Great food . My Koi love it . Truly enhances color and helps keep water clear .
5 #### My cats are indoor overweight cats that Only ate meow mix . I tried many healthier foods but they would nt eat or coulnt keep down . I tried proplan savor because a petco lady suggested it . It has helped them lose a little , and they 're not hungry all the time and seem calmer and more relaxed , those omegas are helping . Just my opinion .
5 #### My kitties absolutely love this food and I 'm happy because chicken is the first ingredient . For those that do n't know , the healthiest , best quality cat foods start with the main source of protein as the first ingredient in the ingredient list . I 've never seen my kitties love a food as much as this one . Purina , please do n't change the product at all .. will be reordering indefinitely ! !
5 #### My cat is fussy about dry food , this is a winner .
5 #### My 3 cats are very partial to this cat food and prices at Amazon are noticeable better than I find at my local Petsmart .
5 #### Buying my cat food from this seller from Here on out . So happy with the quality and the fast shipping . Price is fantastic !
5 #### Chloe loves these and has no allergic reaction to them ! Great product ! But beware they come in different biscuit sizes and I did n't look and did n't know so I have to cut these up and it 's a little messy . I put the crumbs in with her breakfast or dinner but would have preferred the smaller size as she is havanese .
5 #### My two small dogs have difficulty with treats / GI issues . Not with these ! Good product , good price .
5 #### We have four dogs , including 14 - month - old puppy , and they all absolutely love these .
5 #### Love Science Diet dog foods . Have used them for 20 years or longer for all my dogs .
5 #### My dog loves this brand and since he 's a small puppy the size of each bite is just right for him .
5 #### Not sure if it 's just a puppy thing , but this food disappeared so fast . She loved it !
4 #### I normally get my herding dog the extreme version of Kong products but he has made it clear that the red ones are more fun to chew . This one has stood up well to my powerful chewer . The opening is large which makes it hard to get treats stuck inside that are not immediately dislodged , reason that this product did n't get five stars . After experimenting , spreading peanut butter along the length of the inside works the best .
4 #### Seems to be ok . My dogs are n't really interested in this toy .
5 #### LOVE this and way cheaper purchasing here than in the pet stores .
3 #### My dog adores these toys . Unfortunately , she adores them so much that she tries to turn them in to food . They do not hold up against strong chewers at all . She loves to turn them in to tiny little pieces . However , until she destroys them , they are a lot of fun . This one was her favorite for quite a while because her mouth fit perfectly around the middle . I just wish they were a bit cheaper since $ 10-$20 for toys that only last a couple of weeks is a bit ridiculous .
5 #### Our dog loves this toy - it 's been a few weeks , and he has yet to chew through it ( which is a record for our aggressive chewer ! ) We recommend using Kong treats for this toy , as sticking a normal treat inside is no challenge for our dog to get out ... and subsequently less chewing .
5 #### Pooch loves it . My full time job is putting peanut butter in there for her
5 #### My dogs ( two , and yes I had to buy two of these ) love these ! Does help keep their teeth clean . Just do n't step on one in the dark .
3 #### Sent the wrong one . Do n't expect to get the one you see in the picture .
5 #### This is my 3 Basenjis all time favorite chew toy . This is their 3rd one ( once the head and/or tail come off it goes in the trash ) . They will chew this one before any of the others . If you run a sale on this , please let me know so I can stock up .
5 #### We lost this toy two times , I keep buying it again , the dogs love this dinasour .
5 #### Dog loves it ! It 's a little smaller than I imagined it would be , but it is great .
5 #### Just what the vet ordered ! Cats still a bit picky . But they would nt be cats if they were not picky and a bit on spoiled side !
5 #### My cats really like Hill 's Science Diet cat food - However , I have one cat with a serious hairball problem , so I switched to the Hill 's Science Diet Adult Hairball Formula . They still love the food , and the hairball problem is solved .
5 #### My cats love this wet food . They are not crazy about other flavors but love this simple chicken flavor . I think it is very healthy and a great price if you buy the cases with the large cans . I store the leftover food in the fridge . My two cats go through just under a large can in a day ( two meals ) .
3 #### A good quality , but contains dangerous persersatives . Switched to Nature Variety 's chicken Instinct and turkey Instinct .
5 #### This is my cat 's favorite flavor of this brand . I did a lot of research and have found that although this costs more than the cans you buy at the grocery store , in the long run , the cost is comparable , because the cats do n't have to eat as much in order to satisfy their need for protein . I also noticed that the local pet store charges for one small can , what one of these large cans can be had for online . I have two cats of my own and three foster cats ( one will have babies soon ) , so I have to have a good quality food to keep them all healthy .
3 #### I have purchased this item at local stores in the past . In the interest of saving time ( that is a valuable thing lately ) and money ( by not being tempted by impulse purchases at the store ) I decided to try Amazon out on this . I have been using Amazon for years and have mostly good things to say . I will continue to make purchases through Amazon . That being said , this time the box of litter must have been bounced around during shipping pretty violently . The UPS driver delivered it to me with litter spilling out as he walked . Upon opening the outer shipping box , I found that the product box was split open and most of the contents were scattered about . I was able to salvage most of it for use , but will think twice before repeating this purchase .
5 #### What to say about cat litter ? My kitty likes this brand better than any other and it 's good at what it 's supposed to be good at -- we do n't have an odor problem in our house , thanks to A&H Super Scoop Clumping Litter . It really does a good job of clumping and as the one who has to clean the litter box ( grrrrr ! ) , that means a lot to me .
5 #### I rated this product as I did because it may have a little dust but not near as much as others I have used ... The price is right on this product being it is delivered in 2 days to my door ... I choose the 14 lb box as my litter box is upstairs and it 's a pain to haul the bigger boxes up the steps ... One other thing I find the smaller box good for is storing the used litter until I fill the box .... I can then carry the used litter downstairs to dispose .... I wash the litter box a couple times a month and 14 lbs fill it nicely ... My cats are not picky about scented or unscented and I have used both with good results ...
5 #### My house is a mult - cat household and I do n't want it smelling like a cat box . With the Super Scoop I and my guests can enjoy my cats without smelling the box . While all clumping litters clump , some better than others , not all are suitable for use in an automatic , self - cleaning litter box . The Super Scoop excells at this . It clumps firmly and stays hard so the automatic box can do its work . It also absorbs nearly all of the odor so the cat box can been seen before it can be smelt . I 've used this product in a prior LitterMaid unit and now in my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/PetSafe - Simply - Clean - Continuous - Clean - Litter - Box / dp / B000GF0X38 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">PetSafe Simply Clean Continuous - Clean Litter Box</a > . The Super Scoop has worked flawlessly in those applications . When I adopted a new cat recently , I set up a seperate little box until she could be accustomed to my house and other pets . It was the low - tech variety needing to be scooped on a regular basis . Once again the Super Scoop made the clumps easy to remove and the cat box itself was nearly odorless . The Arm and Hammer Super Scoop is now my preferred brand .
4 #### Smells good ( as far as a litter box can ) clumps well , cats like it and it does the job . Just clean box daily
5 #### I did buy this litter and it 's great and I love it . It really does deserve the 5 stars , but what I 'm really here to tout is the product description ( unless it 's changed from the time I write this review to the time you read it ) . When I was here purchasing , it said : Product Features Pack of 14 - Pounds box Good source of fiber Low fat content So , that 's good to know . In a pinch , my cats can poo in high fiber , low - fat litter ... and I can have lunch . Not necessarily in that order .
5 #### Our Koi fish loved it and I feed them regularly with this product .
5 #### Great price on this and my KOI have lived off this for years and are huge now . I pay more in the stores around here for the 1 lb bag .
5 #### $ 61 shipped for this is an excellent value . My Koi 's love them .
5 #### I ca n't personally vouch for this product , but Cocoa , age 14 says , " more please right nowwwwwww " She used to like kibbles , but as an old girl , the pt is easy to chew and helps her to maintain her weight . ( She has always been a slim kitty , but got thinner as she aged . ) Even though it has the cat desired strong odor , she likes it stirred to release more of that smell .
4 #### I hate going to the store to stock up on pet food , so when I saw the price of this item and the fact that it could be delivered free , I bought it . The expiration date is on the package . I was pleased with the quick service too .
5 #### One of my cats favorites , although they always eat " the gravy " first at superspeed and then the shreds . Love ordering cat food and supplies through amazon makes it so easy as I live in a big city and walk everywhere .
5 #### We buy this stuff all the time from our local grocery stores . It is the only stuff our picky cat will eat these days , and she wo n't eat dry food , so we go thru A LOT . It made sense to try this on amazon as a subscription - coming in at very close to the same price as the grocery store . Well , for whatever reason ( kind of surprising , really ) this stuff coming from amazon is way " fresher " than the stuff we get from the grocery store . It comes out of the can way easier . The stuff from the grocery store has to be violently shaken , or scooped with a spoon , while the stuff from amazon just plops right out . Our cat tends to eat the amazon stuff more quickly , too . Thanks again amazon .
5 #### My furry friends love the flavors in this mix pack . They were delivered on time and not damaged . I will order them again .
5 #### My cats love it and its a good quality cat food . Some canned food is mostly gel , but this is solid food and a great value . It smells , but my cats love that . I do n't think any cat could refuse it . My dogs love it too . My cats will wake me in the morning because they want this food .
5 #### I have five cats and two fancy litter boxes and this one . There is no reason to spend more on something fancy . This one work fine . Our little kitten has no problem getting in and out , the larger adult cats have plenty of room without kicking littler out of the box . Plus , easy to clean . Fitss neatly in a garbage bag to remove old litter .
5 #### I love these boxes ! I have a " larger " and " older " Bengal girl and most boxes do not work for her . Before I found these I was using under the bed storage boxes . Price is great as well !
5 #### This is a good size for the older cat , in that it is n't too high for her to climb in . It 's also big enough so that she does n't pee over the side of it onto the floor .
5 #### It 's a litter box . Does what it 's supposed to .
5 #### As a veterinarian , I can tell you that cats do better using their litter box when they have enough space . This works quite well for that .
5 #### Fast delivery . Our cat likes her new litter pan . As long as the cat is happy we are too ! :)
5 #### When I lived in the city , I had no problem buying this cat food , but now that I live in a small town , there 's no pet stores around . It 's easy to order from Amazon , it costs less , and ships for free if you have Amazon Prime . My cats wo n't eat any other dry cat food .
5 #### My cat loves this food . So happy to get it delivered .
5 #### We have always gotten this for our cat . She loves it and we have never had a problem with it . Its hard to find pet food without all the crap in it and this is top rated .
1 #### Even the stray cats did n't like the strange faux chicken bits .
5 #### This has provided hours of entertainment for our kitten .
5 #### Having a Rottweiler , I need durable chew toys that can not easily be destroyed . Kong products are exactly that . If Kong could develop a tire larger than the one they sell now ; my dog 's toy collection would be complete .
4 #### Very big for our 7 month puppy but she likes it . Wish they made one a little smaller for medium sized dogs . She does enjoy chewing on it though .
5 #### No longer use after I saw a story of a rottie who got his tongue stuck and died .
5 #### My dog chews on his kong every morning and every night in the vehicle when coming home from work with my husband . I think it 's like a pacifier for him , he just holds it in his mouth and constantly bites down on it . It lasts about one year until it is falling apart and then I buy him a new one .
5 #### My dog ca n't wait to open her stocking to get to these . Arrived quickly too
5 #### These are meant for small dogs , but I use them as treats for my larger dogs ( 50 - 75lbs ) . It 's a treat , not a whole meal , like some of the larger biscuit treats . Also , one of my dogs seems to have a wheat / grain allergy , and this does n't set him off scratching for days .
5 #### These are awesome and very well priced . My dog loves all the flavors , we are loyal customers . The only downside is that they 're hard to break ... although with our large breed its not an issue ..
5 #### These are a little stinky but all fish treats are . My dog is allergic to chicken so fish is a favorite . They both absolutely love these . My dogs are small so I break them in 2 . They are very crunchy and even my old dog that is missing teeth manages to crunch the down because she loves them .
5 #### A lifesaver ! Puppy really enjoys her new teething buddy .
4 #### It actually came as a brontosaurus , not a t - rex . But extinct is extinct , I suppose .
5 #### The cats are thrilled with this - and it 's one of the first kibbles that actually smells wholesome to me . Thanks !
5 #### awesome food . purchasing this brand for awhile . she use to have a little blood in her stool . that all stopped when i started using this product . i also mix this food with another , its science diet Perfect weight . I recommend BOTH products .
5 #### My cat loves this food ! He has quite a delicate stomach and is very prone to hair balls but after I started feeding him this a couple of months ago , he s had far fewer problems . The food itself looks and smells far better than other cat foods I ve bought and I really think the quality of the ingredients is pretty high ! Very happy with this food !
5 #### this food saved 2 of my cats lives before they were sick throwing up diarrhea the vet said the other dry cat food CONTAINED WAY TOO MUCH JUNK .its poison ... the one that start with the letters F and P
3 #### As I have said before my inside and outside cats are extremely fussy and opinionated . . It seems to be their mood or their sudden desires that either enhance or delete their love to this cat food and the Pate processing . Maybe some day it will be a complete must for my cat menu , but not as yet . Renee Evers
4 #### I like for my cats to eat specialty canned foods but my cats do n't . They have refused plenty of " great ingredients " cat food in favor of Friskies and Fancy Feast . Friskies fits my humble budget and the cats seem healthy and happy . We switch around some but all in all , Friskies foods are welcome in our cupboards .
5 #### These are the perfect size for our cat , he gobbles them up ! The variety of flavors helps him not get bored with them either . I would highly recommend these !
5 #### I purchased this food and donated it to the Idaho Humane Society and I am sure the cats loved this product .
4 #### Good Budget Priced Food That My Cats Like . And I do n't have to lug it home from the store if I buy from Amazon .
5 #### If your reading this you have a cat or your very bored . My cats like the pate vs the chunky stuff much better , they eat this vs just licking off the gravy off the chunky . No matter what your going to get at lease one dented can amazon has gotten better over the years on shipping cans by wraping them in padding but they can never predict how the USPS will handle it after . Price fluctuates a lots , it can be .42c to high .60c a can so you have to keep an eye on it every shipment time , I have the auto ship and save for this . I had stopped it at one point because of price then just started back up a few weeks ago , it was .17c less a can then the cheapest market around here .
5 #### Needed some wet food for my underweight kitty . This is perfect for him . The Pate is the only type of cat food he really enjoys , and this brand is his favorite .
5 #### This is an amazing deal for healthy dog food . I subscribe to get it every other month and I am at ease that my dog is eating healthy and I am saving money . He loves this food ! !
5 #### Jack the Nipper loves this food . It 's firm , not runny , which makes it nice to scoop out just a little from the can and smash in to some dry food .
2 #### Does not contain the healthiest ingredients like the name would make you think . I do n't think I will purchase again . My dogs were not crazy about it either .
5 #### This puppy food has always worked great for us . Puppies eat it well , and have always done great on it . We have used Hills science diet dog food for years raising yorkshire puppies , they have always done better on science diet , than any other food we tried .
4 #### Good toy , always nice to have ones by Kong that are harder to destroy like this one .
5 #### Came in a timely fashion . My dogs love it .
5 #### Dog loved it but is a little small have a 50 # dog but she loved to chew on it .
3 #### Well , the dog likes it . He 's pretty much destroyed it and I have to keep taking pieces away from him so he does n't swallow them . If you are looking for something " indestructible , " keep looking because this is n't it .
5 #### Our cats love it ! Works nicely as both a scratching pad and a toy .
5 #### my cat plays with this a lot . seems sturdy .
5 #### Fun , fun fun for my cat . She runs around the house and dives on this game to make the balls go around . Then she lays on her side and swats them , stops them , ( I purchased the Bergan twinkle ball for it as well ) and swats them again . She uses the scratcher as well . Best toy ever for her , and no we do not use any " wacky weed " ( my name for Cat Nip ) , to cause her to run around , she just loves this toy .
5 #### I have a kitten who loves to dig and usually makes a swinging mess when he 's in the litter box . This has helped a lot keeping the litter in the box and the large size makes it a good fit for a 2 kitten household .
4 #### Perfect size box for my four adult cats , i ordered four . They are n't pricey which helps as i like to replace them at least once a year along with faithful daily scooping and monthly scrubbing they hold up well .
5 #### Exactly what I needed . Delivered quickly as promised . Very pleased .
1 #### Like this --- have several for our three cats
5 #### My dogs love these ( and the other flavors ) and I buy them regularly . They 're great for training and as an everyday snack . The best part is that they 're grain - free , which is perfect for a dog with a grain allergy . They 're perfect size for large dogs and can be broken up for smaller dogs . My cats even enjoy nibbling on the fallen crumbs . I feel good about giving them these , too .
5 #### I love that these have limited ingredients and seem to be good quality . These are my dog 's favorite treats .
5 #### We Rescued 2 cats a few months ago & were feeding them a more expensive " high end " cat food because we thought it 'd be better for them . Well we were wrong . They hated it , would n't touch it & ended up losing weight . We reluctantly switched them to Pro Plan & they LOVE it ! Everyone is happy , should have made the switch sooner .
5 #### My cats love this food and it 's much cheaper on Amazon than in the stores .
5 #### We were on vacation and she had some of this . Now she wo n't eat anything else
5 #### This is our cats ' go - to food -- one Savannah and one Calico . They have three varieties of dry food available at all times and also get wet food for breakfast and dinner , but they love their Pro Plan .
5 #### My cats love it . It has a good , strong smell .
5 #### Cats love it and it has the best quality ingredients .
5 #### I 've been using this for a long time now for my cat , we alternate between chicken and turkey . She eats a dry food along with this wet food daily . I like the small cans , she eats a half can a day - she 's a small cat . On some previous foods I had seen her gain too much weight and/or get dry flaky skin . This kitty started life with very delicate health with respiratory infections and tested positive for the feline leukemia virus . Happily she tested negative at 6 months but it 's always been important to me to feed her good quality food . She looks healthy and maintains her weight on this food .
4 #### I love the Friskies and my girls ( cats ) love the fish flavors , best . It is nice that I can have it shipped to the door and the price is slightly less than the grocery store .
4 #### MY CATS , BEING VERY FINICKY , WILL ONLY EAT THE CLASSIC PATE TYPE OF CAT FOOD . SEVERAL CATS ARE OLDER , THE PATE IS AN ADDED PLUS FOR THEIR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM .
4 #### With subscribe and save ; end up saving lot of money . Feed 11 ferals and like to give them more than dry . When buying by the case , Amazon delivers a much higher quality canned cat food than the cheap stuff at the big box pet stores .
1 #### I messed up . This cat food is a serious reject for all my 6 cats and even the ferals wo n't eat it . I put it out and then have to throw it in the trash the next day .
5 #### We feed our ' little darling ' the pate form because she turns her nose up at shreds or gravy type foods . She also has begun ignoring the fishy foods . so we bought this once from amazon because it was cheaper even than Walmart , but have since gone back to buying single cans in order to get the flavors she will eat . The product itself is great ! !
3 #### My two monsters really do n't like any of the three varieties of the pate version of Friskies . I split a can between them and there 's still food in their bowls hours later . They love the meaty bits kind , and lick the bowls clean in seconds , so it 's not their eating habits , it 's the pt . They will eventually eat it , so I 'm keeping the rest of the case for emergencies . Bummer .
5 #### Good product , excellent price . Came as advertised . The cats seem to love this and they sometimes can be picky - I just bought lids in case I did n't use a full can , as these are ' full cans ' not the mini cans .
2 #### this is a junky toy and my cat does n't know what to do with it but she likes it as a scratcher
5 #### cats are using this all the time and try to pull out the ball
5 #### Cats love this toy and have been using it daily since we got it . We especially enjoy them playing with it at all hours of the night !
3 #### It is a nice , well made product but my cats were only interested in it the first day I took it out of the box . Since then they use it only as a scratcher .
3 #### Arrived promptly . Packaged appropriately . No issues with the transaction . My Doberman does n't really chew this like I thought he would . He loves when I put peanut butter in it but he quickly cleans that out and then he does n't bother with it . It truly seems indestructible though .
5 #### This is the second version of this toy ! My dog loves it when I put a whole large milk one or other " like - sized " dog biscuit inside to keep her entertained for 20 - 40 minutes .
5 #### Apart from temptation cat treat this is the only product I feed my 3 cats . Their coats are so silky and healthy .
5 #### I have been feeding my cats Hill 's Science Diet dry food for over 10 years . They always eat everything in the bowl . If they like it , then I like it .
5 #### This was very inexpensive and is definitely a dog favorite .
2 #### My dog destroyed it to unrecognizable in a very short amount of time .
5 #### Our rescue loves this stuff . I even have to stop my older dog from gobbling it up , and she 's always turned her nose at dry food .
5 #### My dog love it and it comes to the house-- no lugging it home or not being able to find it when you need it . Thanks for the delivery
2 #### My new puppydog hated this . Do n't know why-- he loves the dry food .
5 #### The only kibble that our very finicky dog has liked so far . And we have a ( literally ) world - class veterinarian who is also a fan of this particular kibble . Everybody is happy , including the dog .
5 #### Quality food , especially good for growing pups . limits stool and regulates them making it easier to house train .
5 #### Used several litters for my cats . Love this as no dust to contend with . Cats seem to really like it too !
5 #### Best clumping litter : makes scooping easy , and I particularly like that it eliminates odor due to the baking soda ( much better than some artificial chemical component ) .
5 #### I have another use for them , I will make grass beds out of them !
5 #### these are larger than some other pans and at least do n't have any ridges in them like my others do , but the normal size high sides you can order are smaller than these pans , but if you have some big kitties these are wonderful .
5 #### its a box , and it holds litter and poop . Really no complaints . Tiny kittens can use it no problem , and I do n't have to clean it everyday . Which is nice .
4 #### Sturdy pan but unfortunately I did n't read the dimensions properly and was unable to use as a high - wall box for a cat that always manages to go on the outside of the box while standing inside the box .
5 #### Gives a full grown cat plenty of room and the high sides protect the area around the pan .
4 #### This seems like a pretty good litter box . A litter box is a litter box ; this is nothing fancy . However it is way too big for a kitten , which is what I bought it for . I do n't know if the little guy will even be able to climb into it . Somehow I missed the word " Giant " right there in the product name haha . My fault . No worries , I am saving this for when the kitten grows up , or I will just use it for my cat . Just note that this is probably not good for kittens , if you 're an idiot like me and read reviews but not the actual product description
5 #### I buy these constantly . We have a 78 LB white shepherd . I buy the regular and small size . She likes the duck flavor also but we try to keep her on LTD .
5 #### My dog loves them . Acts like they are crack .
5 #### Actually , I 'm not that excited about how these taste ( haha ) , but one of our dogs is on a restricted diet , and they LOVE these biscuits . They 're pretty hard , but I can break them into smaller pieces for training . So we 're all happy .
5 #### Our cats love this toy ! They chase the ball and do summersaults over the thing !
3 #### I see videos of this wonderful plaything all over the internet . My cats are SO strange . Neither one of them care much for balls , and even the ball with lights does n't seem to help . My one cat uses the scrather area and lays on the ball .
5 #### Always a cat 's favorite I 've had several cats since I bought this years ago and all of them have loved this . Then do n't play with it every day but all I have to do is swipe that ball and it stirs their interest in it all over again . So happy to finally find the replacement inserts on Amazon ! I 've been without one for a while now and I 'm very eager to put that back in for a scratching spot . Put a little catnip under the cardboard and it 's a fiesta . It stays under my coffee table and it 's unobtrusive .
5 #### Love it , my cat loves to play with this .
5 #### My dog likes it and it gets delivered to my house at a price I like . More food for your buck .
5 #### Recommended by my veterinarian and my puppy loves it . Small bites for puppy mouths , easily chewed . No bad smell so all is good .
5 #### my puppies love science diet . It 's canned food made to order for dogs with sensitive digestive and instetinal system . Super wo n't change it unless the doggies ask for that .
5 #### My dogs are thriving on the Hill ' 's Science Diet . They are pretty old but love the dog food I feed them . Thanks .
4 #### Shyloh , seemed to like this food . Such a controversy with selections . It is vet recommended . I feel science diet is overated . I feel there are much better foods for the price .
5 #### Purchase this food for my indoor 16 year old cats - of which I have 3 ; they love it ! Thanks Purina - how about some coupons !
4 #### My cats love this food ! Unfortunately this bag , the coupons where not in a protected pouch , so all the oils from the food had made the coupon transparent and the ink had started to ooze . I still give it 4 starts due to prior quality of the food . Must have been a glitch in communication with the advertisement and Purina .
5 #### 90 pound Lab that chews everything apart in minutes ca nt make a dent in this thing . We put some peanut butter in it every night and he loves it . I buy him a new one every year . Holds up incredibly well to lots of chewing . He much prefers this over the original Kong .
4 #### It is easier for my labs to get treats out of this compared to the original Kong toy , so it does n't keep them entertained as long . It is still a good , durable toy though !
4 #### I ordered one of these and got the T - Rex . My pup is a very heavy chewer , so I 'm always looking for things that will hold up . This one definitely does . He has had it for months and it 's still going strong . I can see some bite marks on it , but nothing has come off . He has lost interest in it over time , but I 'm glad I found something that wo n't put him at risk when he does want to chew on it . I would highly recommend this for dogs that chew a ton .
5 #### My mom 's dog is obsessed with his dino . Whenever he stays with us , he chews on this toy all day long . It 's his favorite toy ( except for the ones with treats in them ... ) .
5 #### Great chew toy for my doberman . He got the brontosaurus and has chewed it relatively frequently for the last week . There is really minimal damage to it so far . Great toy to put in the basket for him to pull out on a rainy day .
5 #### For some reason the dinosaur nylabones are my dogs favorite . They have other nylabones , but their favorites are the dinosaur shaped one .
5 #### Nice size bits , hoping for great color in appearance of fish ...
5 #### Switched from a cheap brand and my cat really loves this food . After a couple weeks of use she has more energy , plays more and appears much more healthy .
5 #### Wow - my cats love this ! What else can I say ?
5 #### I have 3 adult cats and 2 of them are very picky when comes to wet food . I did n't want to feed them those cheap low quality junk food ( even though I know they love it ) but at the same time I do n't want to spend too much money on it . I gave Wellness a try . I could n't be happier . My kitties love this product . The texture is great - not too runny , not too pasty . I keep it in the fridge after I opened it . I find it more appetizing for the cats when I heat it in the microwave for 8 - 10 seconds before I feed them . I guess the heat brings out the irresistible smell . They clean out the plates every time and beg for more . The ingredients are great ; the first 3 ingredients are chicken , chicken liver , and turkey ; those are good enough for me . I would totally eat it if I every run out of food during the apocalypse . I buy a case of 12 of 12.5 OZ can for 3 cats and it lasts me about 3 weeks . For around $ 30 , that 's not too bad at all . I will keep buying Wellness for my cats because I know they 'll love it . No more searching !
3 #### I have a healthy siberian kitten and we had been feeding this to her since she was around a month old . She was very indifferent to it and only ate some , then stopped eating it completely . She loves her wellness kitten dry food but were switching to a different wet food , as this one is not working for her !
5 #### My current kitties LOVE this recipe ! My family and I rescued a young mother cat and her 8 babies ( 4 weeks old ) from a car . Neighbors actually alerted us to this car and said the kitties had been in there for 5 days , I ran out of the house to check it out . We called the Police who came promptly and found the person responsible . We took in 2 kittens , our neighbor took 1 kitty and my older son came and took 1 kitty . That left the mother and 4 kittens . The lady whose cats they were convinced the Police that now she could take care of the rest . Well , the next day the mother and 4 babies were left on our porch ! We took the two we had taken to our Vet who immediately put them on Hill 's Science Diet for kittens and soft food . They adapted very well and now with them turning a year , we are going to the next step of the Hill 's Science Diet . THEY LOVE THIS FOOD !
5 #### I ca n't even begin to descible how great this food is ! Prior to getting Hill 's Science , I was feeding my cat that junk / cheap food from the grocery store that was equivalent to eating air . That food never filled him up and I was always over feeding him while constantly waking up at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning to feed him because his 9:00 pm feeding could n't carry him through the night . While he never gained any weight from that method , it was n't the best for either of us . His vet gave me a list of foods that he recommended and I decided to give this a try . He 's been on it for about 2 weeks now and I ca n't believe the difference ! He sleeps thorough the night and his morning feeding will carry him up until dinner with no problems ! Without a doubt I will be purchasing this again , and again , and again !
5 #### Arm & Hammer litter has a lot less dust compared to fresh step so I am changing to this litter for now .
5 #### My cats like this product . Thank you Amazon . Char
4 #### the shipping took really long that was the only problem other then that it came nice in a big box safe and it was big and not damage I use this alot it last for a while and I keep buying more i would definitely recommend this
5 #### MY CATS WON'T EAT ANY OTHER FOOD BUT FRISKIES AND THIS IS A GOOD DEAL FOR MY TWO CATS . I LOVE THE PRICE AND IT COME RIGHT TO THE DOOR .
3 #### Friskies is not great food but my ferals eat it up . This was a good price and variety is always good .
4 #### I find this to be a nice middle of the road food for my cats . Reasonable pricing . Lots of flavors and styles . My cats have all day access to dry food . Wet food is a once a day feeding . I use one , easy to open can , for all of them . I empty the food into a cup and add 3 cans of water to it . After mixing it up a bit , I pour the contents into a few different bowls . Something for everyone that way . Some cats seem content to just lap at the water mix . ( Another way to get water into these creatures ) Some look only for the clumps of food . Another one uses his paw to reach in and grab a clump and eat it off his paw . Rarely is there any left . I have tried more expensive can foods and saw no change in their reaction . If I was only feeding wet food I would probably ind a better quality one . As I do a mix , I am comfortable that they are getting the nourishment they need . The less expensive canned food was always greasy feeling . I will stay with Friskies .
5 #### My kitty seems to like these Pate 's okay . They are new for her and she is eating them like they are most delicious !
5 #### Have plenty of chances to test different cat foods as I feed eight cats ... this is a major favorite and a good healthy economical choice for cats of all ages
4 #### My kitty has n't shown much interest in this , but my 80 lb doggo goes wild for the ball . He desperately wants to get it out of the track . It is HILARIOUS . Has stood up to his rough play , so that 's definitely a bonus .
1 #### Cat has a great time plucking the ball out and slamming it aroud the master bath , apparently tile floor makes the most satisfying crash - bang destruction noise . At 4 am . When this bear is trying to sleep . I m pretty sure Cat is trying to sail this ball through the showed door , a window , the mirror , or all of the above . I kinda hate this product .
5 #### Love this .. I wish it was a little bigger but it serves the purpose and the ball keeps her very happy . She is also sleeping on top of it often LOL
5 #### We love the KONG brand toys because they 're the only ones our dog does n't seem to be able to destroy . I fill this one with the freezable treats , and my dog loves them .
4 #### We are a family that really depends on the Kong brand . We have 3 dogs , the little one is not much of a chewer so we purchase for the 2 labs for the most part . We have a few Kong toys that have lasted for years ( at least 5 years ) . This toy is tough but not quite tough enough . The older lab mostly wants to retrieve so this toy is perfectly suited for him . It is a great weight for throwing , easy for him to pick up , and has a varied bounce for extra challenge . Our lab mix is less that 2 years old and still a serious chewer . This toy did not survive her love . She has been able to destroy it . I am not really bothered by this because it has brought her hours of destructive joy . It just may help you to know it 's possible your dog may be able to shred this with effort .
3 #### My 100 lb American Bulldog went through this in 2 weeks ...
3 #### The dog plays with every other toy he has more than he messes with this one . For whatever reason- it could be it 's large size , but he does n't mess with it a lot . He likes his x - large kong , and his westpaw bones more . It 's good for stuffing a treat into - kind of - with large holes on both sides it does n't take him long to empty it . It 's lasted and not come apart in my large dogs jaws so far . ( 4 months ) . He does n't nip and pull , he chews and gnaws - so I expect it to last for a very long time .

5 #### Purchased this as an every 6 weeks order . 20 lb dog loves it and does not cause intestinal issues . Price paid ( around $ 26.00 ) is a significant savings over regular retail stores plus do n't have to haul it home in this never - ending lousy Midwest winter !
5 #### Much bigger than I expected . My other litter box with the side extenders is still a little shorter then this box . This box also holds a lot more litter than my other litter box as well . I was really hoping the bigger sides would help stop the cats from throwing out so much litter but I think that s a lost cause . I can literally hear my cats spend 1 - 2 minutes scratching in the litter to cover something up which of course some goes over the edge and onto the floor . I m starting to think the only litter box that will stop that is a huge tote box . This box works well , not really any flaws that I can see .
3 #### Update 2016 : My dog is now a year and a half old and has gnawed the T - rex 's head off lol . I only let her have this toy if I 'm home because it 's a little smaller than her mouth and that makes me nervous . I 'm happy she came around to this toy and it was n't a waste of money in the end . * Hard plastic * Smaller than anticipated * Pup lost interest after the first day Maybe this chew will be more interesting to her when she is older , but for right now my pup does n't seem to care for it very much !
5 #### Holding up well to my year old catahoulas . They seem to enjoy it .
5 #### The PERFECT toy for gnawing when those dratted molars are coming in . My puppy can get the T - Rex right to exactly where she needs it . She likes chewing this and it spares the corners of all my furniture : BONUS ! It is also super durable . She has had it for 2 months , chews on it all the time and it still looks pretty much like new .
5 #### Dog is happy , they must taste pretty good . I 'm glad they are no grain , formulated to keep the dog healthy and satisfied . Good value for money , this 14 oz bag lasts quite a long time .
5 #### The dog like these or course he eats anything but peanut butter . Usually by the Salmon treats .
5 #### Love all the Natural Balance Limited Ingredient products and Amazon has reasonable prices . Best of all is my dog loves them too .
5 #### Took her a few days to adapt but so far she loves the new food Edit 1/16/17 : Sprinkles still loves her new food as indicated by her increased waist line !
5 #### Our cats loooove this food . Helps give them shiny coat
4 #### Very nice product . Cats love it ! It was packaged well and came promptly . Thank you .
5 #### My cat , surprisingly , likes this better than the brands at the store . He eats it right up . Good for him too ! Also , this is WAY cheaper than PetSmart ... They charge about $ 35 for a 16 lb bag and this is way cheaper and with a coupon this time too .
5 #### For once , all the cans were intact . None of them were ruptured , and the price was very low , although the prices on these cat food cans fluctuate more dramatically than gold prices . I got lucky , so did the feral cats who ate the food .
4 #### kitty likes Friskies classic pate over more expensive brands and I really liked not having to lug it in from a store .
5 #### I guess I love it too since it saves me bank from the high end stuff they used to get as well . They love the stuff and eat it all , so I am a happy cat mom . Moist food diets over dry any day for the difference it made in their overall health . Even cheap moist food beats dry I was always told by veterinarians . Something about how their kidneys process water anyway and I guess moist food is more like a mouse than dry kibbles . My finicky felines do n't like shredded or bits type as much as the pate though . Your mileage may vary .
5 #### I have 2 golden retrievers . One does n't really play with toys . For the other , this is his favorite style of Kong - and he has several . I had to replace the old one after an unfortunate run - in with the lawn mower . He was actually smiling at me when I pulled this out of the shipping box . I was the best dog - mom ever in that moment !
5 #### Put some treats inside and enjoy watching your pets have fun . Kong makes some of the only toys by dogs have n't been able to destroy .
5 #### Our dogs , a large Doberman and a Dutch Shepherd , LOVE these . We keep careful watch because occasionally they bite through the toy . Replacing once in awhile to make my dogs happy is no problem
5 #### Have always had one of these for our cats . Well made product , do n't buy the knock offs , make sure it is the authentic brand .
5 #### My puppy love this stuff , usually when you get a pup they will not eat very good but she at this from the beginning
4 #### Puppy loved it ! Had good volume stool not excessive . Mixed can with dry food of same manufacturer my picky eater could n't resist it .
5 #### My American Bulldog pup has been eating this since she was 5 weeks old . I have had no digestion issues , no allergies and it was recommended by my vet . My baby is 5 months old now and healthy ( strong ) as a horse .
5 #### Our Westie puppy has been raised on Science Diet dog food , but we have used the " original " size bites . We were hesitant to try the small bites . But based upon recommendations of other purchasers we tried it . No problem .
5 #### I always buy Science Diet for my dogs . They look healthy and have nice coats . Would n't buy any other brand !
5 #### We adopted our 4 month old shepherd mix pup at the local humane society . They gave us a free bag of Science diet puppy food because this was the food they were feeding him . We stayed with this brand because we 've heard great things about it . Our vet also promotes this brand of dog food .
5 #### My puppy transitioned from Tiny bites to Small bites without any problem ; loves each meal and I know the puppy is getting the nutrients it needs for growth and development .
5 #### I have always been a Science Diet fan . My puppy loved this chicken flavor entree . I also have an elderly dog that was not wanting to eat anything- until he smelled this chicken formula . He started eating it , and we have been able to move him back to dry food .
5 #### Our 3 year old , 60 pound Choco Lab loves it and her coat is so shiny that people actually make it a point to stop and tell us how beautiful she is ! ! She gets 1 1/2 cups 2 times a day and sometimes she does n't even finish it all . It is very cost effective this way and this bag lasts us 6 weeks ! ! Her stools are never liquid / mushy and she has a set schedule of when she goes # 2 so she is n't ever constipated . And it has a 4 star out of 5 rating on dog food advisor .
5 #### I bought this food for my adult male chiweenie and two female chiweeniepom puppies . I researched for a while before finally deciding to get this particular brand . I 'm glad I did get this brand . My dogs absolutely love it . Before buying canidae my puppies were on purina puppy chow and my adult was eating kibbles n bits brand . They were " healthy " , but their poop smelled horrible and I knew there was much healthier food out there for them . I gave this to my adult to see if he liked it and indeed he did , I attempted to try and feed him his last bit of " junk " food he had left and he would not touch it . The only dry food he will eat is canidae and nothing else and the puppies love it too . I read all the bad reviews and chose to still buy it and hope for a good outcome and it was good . My dogs are healthier than ever , they have n't had any diarrhea , vomitting , weightloss , unhealthy weight gain , or anything that I have read on the other reviews , but my dogs also have no allerges that I know of either . Another plus is that their poop does n't smell as bad either , I mean in still stinks but nothing like before . I started feeding them canidae on Thursday July 26 , 2012 and two months later they are healthier than ever with no adverse effects and my veterinarian likes it too .
5 #### My pup , now an adult dog of 11 pounds wo n't eat anything else . I am a dog lover and owner for over 50 years and I know how to slowly switch from one food to another . WELL .... forget that . We were doing fine until about 2 months when the food became a little more than 1/2 of the " new " food . That 's when the pooch sat his self down stared at the bowl and then at me and ..... kept sitting . He refused to eat in the am and only ate 1/2 his evening meal out of shear hunger . This went on for 3 days . So , I dumped out the " Mixture " and replaced it with nothing but this Canidae dry dog food topped with a dollop of plain yogurt ( yes he 's absolutely spoiled - great for digestion ) and he stood , cocked his head and promptly ate his breakfast . I could n't believe , still ca n't , that Amazon actually carried this Canidae food . It is the best price I have found and obviously will be continuing to purchase it here .
5 #### Cats like it . I 've been feeding science diet to them for a long time and have had no issues .
5 #### I am so excited that I found this product on amazon , I do n't drive and I am disabled , and this is my favorite product for my cats , even better since they improved it .
3 #### I think it would be hepful to know that while the super scoop part works , it is extremely " dusty " ! You have to open a window or a door whenever you refill or clean up the box . Wish they would improve on this .
5 #### This is my favorite litter , and have used it for a long time . No odor from the litter box in my house !
5 #### Fresh Step recently changed their cat litter and the scent is far too strong . So I decided to change cat litters and get Super Scoop litter instead . I 've been very pleased with it so far and the scent to me smells like baby powder . Very mild and not overwhelming for kitties and me . This litter is more expensive but I find it is more pleasant to use . I also find this is not as dusty when I 'm filling the litter boxes . Also the scent does n't travel to other rooms every time the cats use the box like the Fresh Step did . So I 'd say this is worth the price and works well . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### I read reviews and thought my cans will come bent too or that my cats wo n't eat them . Nope , all good
5 #### My cat is very happy with this food . I 've been feeding it to her for a few years now . She likes most of the formulas too so I can give her a little variety .
2 #### Not the best . Some of the coffee included in this package has a very bad chemical aftertaste . I would say about 75 % of the coffee is included do not the greatest
4 #### My old man cat that does n't have a lot of teeth needs the soft food every day . I picked this up with the subscribe and save and he gobbles it right up . I like that I 'm not going to the store all the time picking up more .
5 #### We are foster parents to cats and kittens . Many of them have colds , these flavors and in pate have appealed to the cats and kittens .
5 #### Well , I actually do not love it , but my cats do . I tried them on all the health food brands : raw food , low ash this , high glucosamine that , and what they want is this . Okay . Be that way .
4 #### My cat loves Friskies . The variety pack gives me choices each day . The price value is good . He is an older cat , 15 years old . I put a little olive oil into the food at times to keep down hair balls .
4 #### HERE WE GO AGAIN .. I SIGNED UP FOR SUBSCRIBE AND SAVE AND NOW THE FRISKIES CAT FOOD IS $ 19.00 NOT $ 10.00 .. IF YOU SIGN UP FOR THIS SERVCE HOW CAN YOU KEEP CHANGING THE PRICE ? ... I JUST CANCELLED MY NEXT SHIPMENT BECAUSE OF THAT .. WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE AT AMAZON ? ? DO YOU THINK I AM STUPID??HOPING I DON'T CHECK THE PRICE ? ? ? ? WHEN THE PRICE GOES BACK DOWN ( AND IT WILL ) ... I WILL ORDER AGAIN ... I PURCHASE THIS FOR MY 4 CATS AND ALSO SOME FERALS THAT LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD .. THEY ALL SEEM TO LIKE IT ... TOO BAD THE PRICE IS SO INCONSISTANT ....
5 #### Its been a month and my cat is still playing with this daily ! Its been a big hit in our house but be prepared for a little noise and lots of laughter ! !
5 #### Cat loves it . Would definitely recommend . Loves the cat nip too .
5 #### switched from solid gold to merrick wilderness when solid gold was sold . dogs had terrible gas on merrick ( most likely from the unnecessary fruits ) . switched to canidae and all is well . ordered from amazon . free shipping . was about $ 25 cheaper than getting it from my local store .
5 #### I have been using canidae for 5 years now along with nuvet vitamins and it has been a wonderful product . After the ingredients change I have not noticed any sort of change in my siberian huskies what so ever . They still have high energy , very lush coats , white teeth and great done density . I am very happy with this product i have had no problems !
5 #### I am surprised at a lot of the negative comments on Canidae . I have a 2 year old German Shepherd who is a picky eater and has sensitive skin . I tired 4 other brands of food : Innova , Natural Balance , Taste of the Wild and Evo .... all of which she scratches and bites herself constant . With Canidae , she has a beautiful shinny coat , does n't itch and she loves it ! It 's amazing the difference . Her stools sometimes are loose , but nothing to complain about or worry . I 'm not putting down those other foods , I 'm just saying that this Canidae food has down wonders for her ! I 've gotten wuite a few comments on her shinny coat . Every dog is different and you just need to find a perfect dog food like I did for her . We use the Chicken version on her . If you on dog food analysis , you will notice it has a 5 star rating . Jetta and I are both very happy with Candiae ! !
1 #### WARNING ! ! ! ! ! they do n't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it does n't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was 1 either completely ignored 2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they would n't even tell me the company this is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing
1 #### Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here . So after delivery , I decided I would make the transition slowly . A week and a half later , I was feeding approx half old and half new , and one of the dogs started vomiting / had diarrhea , had no appetite , and was lethargic . I 'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet , but if he does n't get better soon , I 'll have to take him to the vet . Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine . UPDATE : Took the sick dog to the vet . He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated . $ 150 and one day later , he seems a little better . But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x - ray and recheck . I 'm going to hold off because I do think he 's improving on the bland diet . The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night . She seems fine today , but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae , I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well .
5 #### Excellent substitute for antlers / bones . Due to the cost of buying bones and antlers we have been searching for another hard chewing toy that will last longer than a week . The Nylabone holds the current records at several months before our corgi reduces it to a small hunk of plastic . She does not loose interest over time and continues to enjoy using it to satisfy her destructive chewing urge . Great product . Will be buying again shortly as her last one is getting a little small .
5 #### My dog loves this chew toy . He always takes off the heads first .
5 #### I thought these would be too hard for the dogs , but they love them and they are very durable . They are tough chewers and most other chew toys do n't last long . These are great .
5 #### My dogs LOVE these . I bought one , they actually fought over it , so I had to immediately order another one . It is their favorite thing . And the plus side for me is I do n't have to pick stuffing up of the floor anymore since they could n't care less about those toys . The texture of these dinosaur bones is great . But watch out for them in the middle of the night ... it 's hurts when you step on them .
3 #### Our vet told us it 's bad for dogs ' teeth
5 #### My pugs love this , they almost fight over it .. Guess I should have bought 3 . Do n't step on it though , it looks like it would feel like stepping in a pile of legos .
5 #### For the price , this toy has held up to my crazy chewing lab who normally destroys chew toys in a matter of minutes . We still have this after several months and she still enjoys it .
3 #### Meh - my pups immediately ripped the " ribs " off this one ... then never touched it again ... yet they LOVE the traditional Kong shape ( just make sure to get the " extreme " version ) - go figure ! Quality is not as strong as the original Kong shape toy ...
3 #### My princess Hazel loves carry around this item , while I play fetch with her
5 #### This was a great investment ! Our 65 lb boxer / american bulldog absolutely loves it ! He is a big chewer and it still looks brand new after 3 months . We fill it with treats when we leave the house as well and then we throw it in the dishwasher to clean it .
5 #### MY 5 cats love it ! I love no litter on my carpet . I 'm getting this one for another room .
5 #### This is still not quite big enough for my maine coon Moe =(
4 #### It is a very large pan . My two cats are a good solid 25 lbs . They do kick the litter out and I have to broom it daily but this seems to be the best solution for my giant kitties .
5 #### Large pan is great for bigger cats . I was having trouble getting my cat to use his old box as it was too small . This did the trick . It 's a great size , not thin at all . Will definitely hold up well for a long time . Ca n't beat that price either .
5 #### Our dogs love these treats and come running at the crinkle of the bag
5 #### OK ... So my cats favorite wellness flavors seem to be turkey and chicken . They do n't like all the flavors but they seem to both like the turkey and chicken flavors . Recommended ; even if your cats do n't like one or two of the other flavors they might like these .
3 #### Cats like it , but its surprisingly expensive for a bulk can of cat food . Their are other brands , like Canidae , that are far cheaper and my pets like the flavor just as much .
5 #### My cat likes the taste of it . He prefers it over more expensive ones and less expensive ones . I think he likes it just as much as he likes wet food .
5 #### Cats love the dry food from hill 's science diet food
3 #### My cats like this food . However , this package was lost during transit .
5 #### My cats love this food , and the price was great .
5 #### A vet recommended this when I first adopted her at 8 months , and my vet here now wants her to stay on it until at least age 2 . She loves it . She was getting half this and half another high priced brand at humane society where I adopted . But he suggested just this . She loves it , I love it , no smelly " doo " to pick up . And she is doing great on it . She was badly malnourished when I got her . She was at her ideal weight for a Cairn Terrier Mix , by 3 weeks .
5 #### I bought this for my puppy as Science Diet is hightly recommended . I went on the automatic delivery program with house training pads and it came every 2 months . I was notified by email it was coming and if I needed to change the order time or amount it was easy to do though the order screen at amazon .
5 #### The puppy loves this food . She has never eaten anything else . It helps with her going to the bathroom not as often .
5 #### This has been a huge hit at my house ! I have a multi - cat home and foster kitties through the local shelter , and this thing seems to draw them all in . They love tapping and chasing the ball around the loop and use the cardboard scratcher in the middle . I m glad you can turn over and replace the center scratcher because my cats will wear it out ! It does nt seem to leave a huge mess like other cardboard scratchers I ve used . Very happy with both the entertainment value and functionality this offers my kitties .
5 #### Cats loved this and played together with it for long periods of time . Joy to watch . Advice --- put it away for a week then bring it back out when the kits are bored . Just like in real human life , it will seem new again .
1 #### This is way too hard and our puppy ignores it completely . I am disappointed . No more Dental chews from this company .
1 #### Not as durable for my breed as I thought . My pit destroyed this toy in a matter of a couple days and the spikes were falling off and being eaten which I was afraid due to the sharpness of the pieces . Some were eventually passed through but my vet recommended against toys that may hurt the lining of my dogs intestines
5 #### My Bichon loves this toy ! He chews on it for hours .
5 #### Our puppy chews on everything . When I pulled this out of the box he knew it was perfect ! Be careful if your dog had issues with his teeth . We have another nylabone that he was able to dent with his teeth but this one hits his gums between his teeth . It has intense ridges molded on it and if you grip it too hard is painful . The dog wo n't give it up .
5 #### Shipped quickly ! received next day in perfect condition . This is the second one I 've ordered , My Dog loves this . Great for strong large dogs over 95 lbs . Lasts for a while .
5 #### Makes cleaning your dogs ' teeth easy . Way easier than trying to teach her to hold the toothbrush herself !
1 #### My 100 lb Shepard chewed the head off in less than 5 minutes and I had to throw it away
3 #### Super Scoop formulas do the job , but they are also trackable . Since I walk in barefeet this can be treacherous . I 've cut my big toes several times on the sharp edges of nearly invisible , tracked - in Super Scoop .
5 #### What can I say ? It 's clumping cat litter . It does exactly what it is supposed to and the cats do n't run from it howling . This is not my favorite brand , but that just speaks to my preferences and not the quality of the litter . If you need litter delivered , this is a good choice .
4 #### I have several cats , so a litter that clumps quickly and well is really important . This litter did really well in those areas . The one area that I was n't crazy about , but the cats did n't seem to mind , is the scent . It was borderline unpleasant , I wish this litter came in an unscented form with just baking soda in it .
4 #### I have a dog who can destroy anything except the Kong toys . He gets the treats out of this kind more quickly than with the round ball .
5 #### Great product ! My 80 pound pitbull loves this Kong toy . I stuff a large size MilkBone in it and smear some peanut butter inside or dunk it in chicken stock and give to him in his crate after dinner . Takes him awhile to work the MilkBone out . He also loves to just carry it around , chewing on it and playing " keep away " with me . So far , no damage has been done to it and he 's had it about 2 - 3 weeks . He also loves his smaller Extreme Kong , original shape . In general , I do n't think you can go wrong buying a Kong ! :)
5 #### Dogs love it . Seems to be tough and withstand my pit 's chewing . So far so good .
5 #### My cat has less " misses " with this larger pan . He was raised outdoors and now has to be confined indoors due to an illness and the larger pan seems help to eliminate the little smudges and droppings outside the pan .
5 #### Great catbox , durable and sturdy , has n't cracked or broken like most others which are flimsy , this one stands up to the heavy sand , even when overfilling accidentally , easy to clean and a larger size to accommodate two cats , good choice if you are looking for another box
5 #### My vet recommended this and my dog loves it . My dog was malnourished and weak . This food got her back up to speed . Highly recommend .
4 #### When I adopted my puppy this was the brand that she was being fed at the shelter and was also recommended by the vet . I was provided with 2 2 - lb . bags when I adopted her , she was 10 months old , and so I needed just enough to get her through to 12 months . She seemed to enjoy the food and , after some research , while it 's not the best brand in terms of ingredients , it is better than the grocery store bargain brands , so I still feel like a decent dog owner . Basically , I think this size is good for transition into adult food or even other brands if you wanted to switch .
5 #### I mix a few puppy foods together and this is one of the products that I feed my puppies . They love it .
3 #### I chose this bag because it was a great price . My shih tzu liked it but she poops right away not sure if that 's a good thing . Then she wants to eat it . She has been doing it for two months so I 'm constantly on the look out . My friend had her dogs food left out she ate it and she pooped and left it alone . So now I 'm switching to that brand . Once I find out I will write it .
5 #### Two cats and they go wild for this toy . The ball wo n't jump out of the track like a lot of other toys , which is nice . You can sprinkle catnip on the cardboard scratcher for a bonus treat . It can be a bit loud , and caught me off guard when I heard it one night , but they love it and still use it regularly months after purchase .
5 #### My kitten loves this . Such a great price and she 's getting hours and hours of fun out of it . Well worth it .
1 #### I have a new Akita puppy , and bought the Canidae ALS for him since I could n't get the breeders type of food in my area . After transitioning him to the Canidae , his stools were loose and yellow . I looked on - line , and saw that Canidae switched their formula , and my puppy 's symptoms were mild compared to some I read about . I immediately switched my puppy to Wellness Puppy , and everything has been coming out fine since .
3 #### I have purchased these treats , sweet potato and vension and the duck with potatoes alot . So much so I started buying by 2 's . Up until this month when I received them , the sweet potato and vension were crummy and my 2 little shih tzu 's would n't eat them . In the past few months these have been so hard , I could n't hardly cut with a knife . I wo n't be buying these anymore . I tried to see if I could get in touch with the seller and could n't find the link , so I just decided to write a review . The duck with potato was great . All the products that Natural Balance have are wonderful and I have no complaint with them . My 2 little doggies love what they eat . When they refused to eat this treat this time , I knew something was n't right . Hope this helps anyone who is thinking of purchasing the Sweet Potato and Vension treats only to be aware their might be an issue with the texture of the treat .
5 #### These treats get the Dakota stamp of approval ! Dakota is my pup and he is quite the expert on dog treats . He is not picky , but he eats these treats with enthusiasm . I will break treats up for training sessions and also will put a couple in his Kong toy . They are the perfect size to fit in a medium Kong . The treats break easily so I can make one biscuit into two or three . Dakota will do almost any trick in the world for one of these . Dakota has allergies , so I am very happy to find options that are grain free . He still willingly eats grain , often behind my back , but I would prefer no itchy dogs .
5 #### Our dogs love these , which makes them obey a little bit better when we 've got some .
4 #### Good healthy food , and one my cat will actually eat
5 #### for larger cats , fast shipping cat food has large pieces , not for kittens
5 #### This is my cats favorite chow , although I do feed them another Purina Pro Plan also . With 5 cats , I serve two varieties for them .
5 #### My cat LOVES this stuff . She thinks it 's treats so she goes nuts for it . It 's a huge bag , so I use the food sealer to create smaller bags to keep it fresh .
5 #### My 11 year old cat loves this food , and so does my 9 month old kitten .
5 #### Good food but turn the white fishes to pale yellow ! Also turn water yellow ! But fishes are healthy and grow really fast ! My kois grow to 20 inches in 6 months !
5 #### I received the product on time and in perfect condition . Tetra is the only Summer Pond Food I have used for my outside pond fish for 12 very successful years . I use the Tetra Fall / Spring mix starting in late September to bulk up my fish and prepare them for winter . We had over 100 Koi and various species of babies born last 4th of July who made it through a bitter PA winter and who are thriving thanks to this product . You ca n't go wrong and I have n't been able to find a lower price anywhere .
5 #### Excellent brand of koi food that is well packaged for shipping .
2 #### My cat loves this food . But the cans have arrived dented several times which is really disappointing .
2 #### Too hard for doggy gums . Took it away after only 2 days play and tossed it in the trash .
5 #### With 2 labs hard to chew toys are a must ! ! ! We have several of these , ones for inside and outside . Our puppy keeps one in his crate .
5 #### Its still around ! ! not her fav but she plays with it . and she ca n't chew it up ! !
1 #### My dog has chewed on all sorts of toys , and this one is NOT safe . I got the stegosaurus one for my 4 - year - old lab mix today and she loved it ... but within 15 minutes , there was blood all over the toy because the tiny raised parts had irritated and possibly poked her gums . I initially thought maybe that was just because they were sensitive ( like how humans ' gums bleed if they go a while between flossing ) but then I noticed that the two ends of the toy were already chewed off , and she had ingested the tiny pieces . The instructions say that small pieces " should pass " and I was watching her so she did n't get any big pieces , but seriously ... I would n't consider her an extreme chewer , but she was already biting off and ingesting pieces of this thing . It 's a shame because it 's a cute toy and I hoped the raised parts would fight tartar . But I 'm not willing to have her bleed and ingest plastic pieces . I generally love Nylabone bones ... just stay away from this particular toy ! Not safe ! Imagine those little pointy pieces brushing against your gum , and you can imagine why my dog 's gums were bleeding !
4 #### My dog has used this a lot . I try to watch to be sure he does n't swallow anything .
5 #### This is a great chew toy for our five - old puppy . With its shape , she can easily hold it in place and chew . It seems to really help her with teething .
3 #### I bought this because my cat likes the mixed grill classic style , will tolerate the turkey and giblets classic style , but will hardly eat the salmon classic style . I 'll spend the next year or two getting her to eat all this cat food between the cat food she likes .
4 #### This food is cheap , and cats like it . No , it is n't the most nutritionally fabulous food . Yes , it has grains . Yes , it has meat byproducts . But not everyone can afford to feed cat food that costs $ 2 a can . We work in rescue , and while I would love to feed the super expensive wet food , the reality is that it would cost me $ 50 a day and that is insane . So we feed a lot of friskies pt varieties and the cats do well on it .
5 #### Right now , this variety pack costs less than $ 11 , which is pretty good , considering the size of the cans and the fact it 's a 24 - pack . My cat really seems to like it , and she eats each can of food pretty quickly .
4 #### Kitty 's like it or they prefer what they do but will eat up on something Friskies sell 's as the company goes , my Cat liked Salmon , would n't eat Turkey & Giblet at all , he 's ok with the Mixed grill most times , Friskies , get large can , quality old time brand name , pay less . Delivery on time no probs .
5 #### Just what the cat ordered . she will spend hours playing on this thing .
5 #### really fantastic , all the kittens love it and the older cats play with it to . a great buy .
4 #### only giving four stars because we got the pink - i knew the color may not be as shown but that was probably the last color i would have chosen . Anyway - my cat is an older guy and so he does n't play much with the ball but he loves to scratch it and rub his face on it . He enjoyed the included catnip but only briefly .
5 #### Dog who destroys all toys is still playing with this one intact months later . Plays with it daily . Only toy that has ever survived .
5 #### our dog loves this dental toy and it has proven to be very durable . a well thought of product . aloha and mahalo from hawaii .
1 #### Not very pleased . The snack fit very well inside , but our dog was not motivated to extract it from the toy . It sat on the floor for over a month and our dog never bothered it .
5 #### I 've tried different foods with my puppies . This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy . i 've tried science hills diet , purina puppy chow , and Iams . Finally , I decided that I needed to find something that did n't have all sorts of fillers in it . So I decided to try Canidae . Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop . With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours . Plus , Purina gave them the stinkiest , biggest , most icky poop . With this , their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much . I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time . However , I 've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago . They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler - less food for the price .
2 #### Misrepresented as Giant unless you view your cat at 8lbs a Giant . Very , Very disappointed and unfortunately , too bulky to send back ! ! Makes great toy bin for grandkids ! !
5 #### This pan is huge ! It does it 's job , and my kitties have no issues with it . They are using it just as much as the $ 24 litter box I purchased before ! The only negative , of course , is that it takes more litter to cover the bottom of this one . Otherwise , I am very happy with this purchase .
5 #### I little bit small , but it does have a surface that mainly prevents the stuff from sticking .
5 #### MY DOGS LOVE THESE . THEY ARE VERY SMALL . PERFECT FOR A LITTLE SHIH TZU MOUTN
5 #### I thought these treats were smaller . They are medium - large in size for a French Bulldog . My dog still likes them ... I just usually break them up into smaller pieces .
5 #### My dog has me trained to give him one of these treats every time we come back in after a walk .
5 #### We got these for our dog and they are pretty good . We have pit boxer mix and he has skin allergies . These seem to be made of pretty good ingredients . He does not break out in the rashes he does when he gets subpar or cheaper made treats . He does seem to really like the flavor of these . I think the only bad thing about these is that they are biscuits , which of course get very dry , so our dog can only have one or two before he gets tired of them . He also tends to not drink until he 's dying of thirst , so that just may be a personal problem of his , ha ha . So , aside from that , these are great treats . They seem to have good flavor , so he will do all his tricks for him that he can think of . They do make him happy , they just maybe are n't the best treats for walking , or after much physical activity as they are on the dry side .
5 #### My dog is a 15 year old pomeranian and has an extremely delicate system . He has skin issues and is on a very clean , chemical and by - product free diet . I make real chicken for him and watch any kind of food he gets to avoid his allergy breakouts . It has always been hard to find him a treat or snack that does n't freak him out ( too concentrated ) or that does n't upset his digestion and skin allergies . This product seems to be working well ! He gets only about 2 - 3 of these little snacks a day as a diet supplement . They do not break him and out they do not cause him to freak out ( some high protein or high fat snacks wig him out and break his skin out ) . These are good and I noticed his digestion is better and his poo is better , without the side effects I have seen in other dog snacks . So its five starts thumbs up !
5 #### Hands down the best commercial food available for growing French Bulldog puppies like mine . Their growth spurt between 2 - 6 months requires full nutrition and palatable taste . She gets that with this food .
5 #### I have 2 senior dogs ; one is 14 and the other one 13 . They are both very healthy and have eaten Hill 's Science Diet their entire lives . They started with puppy food and moved up as they aged . I 'm raising my new puppy on Science Diet Puppy food . What else can I say ? Someone wrote that the first ingredient in Hill 's Science Diet is CORN , and that 's not true . The first ingredient is CHICKEN . My puppy loves this food!&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Hill - s - Science - Diet - Puppy - Small - Bites - Dry - Dog - Food-15 - 5 - Pound - Bag / dp / B003YLHQ8Q / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Hill 's Science Diet Puppy Small Bites Dry Dog Food , 15.5 - Pound Bag</a>&nbsp;I feel good knowing he is eating quality puppy food .
1 #### I thought this brand was healthy for my dog since it is vet recommended , but once I gave him this food , my energetic 6 month old puppy became very lethargic .
5 #### We use this food for our small dogs ( 3 ) which are under eight pounds . Great for their digestive system and they love it .
5 #### Finally , a toy our Golden Retriever likes but has n't been able to destroy . It fits nicely in his mouth and he loves to carry it around .
4 #### I loved this dinosaur , but neither one of my miniature dachshunds really care for it . They like orther Nylabone products , but this one just stayed in the toy box .
5 #### Cute chewable but more importantly the dog seems to like it . He carries it around from room to room as I move through the house and it has still taken him weeks to gnaw off even the top of the head . Not as large as I had expected but he still seems to chew out the side of his mouth so it is not an issue . It is heavier than other brands we have purchased and is holding up well with a fairly aggressive chewer . We paid more money for the one laying in the living room floor that he wo n't touch .
1 #### I did n't hate it , but Sir Purrsival ( my Ragdoll master ) totally rejected it ! We are not purring with this mush , aka pate ' - that not only looks disgusting , but obviously my classy cat would have none of any of the varieties . Yuck !
5 #### The classic pate . Why deviate from good old cat food ? My kitty prefers this stuff to other canned food , even the fancier stuff .
5 #### I have an old cat who does n't eat enough so he gets supplemented with canned food . This pate is the ONLY type he 'll eat . When I have a sick cat ( or dog ! ) , this works very well . No " extra " chewing so even when they do n't feel like eating , I can usually get them to swallow this as it 's soft , juicy , and smells good ( which I assume because all the animals come running and start yelling every time they even think I 'm going to open a can ) .
5 #### It is so handy to be able to order these online , especially through Prime . It delivered quickly and there was no damage to the cans . It was just like picking them up at the store , only without the store . I will be ordering these again .
3 #### these were on a fresher side on some of them than what i have bought for home delivery from a local grocery store ...... my cats would tell me which they preferred by the how much they would eat that i put in their dish .....
1 #### How do you review cat food ? ? ? ? My cat ca n't speak so she ca n't participate in this . All I know is that she wo n't eat this product and she eats grocery store brand product .
5 #### Works great for small dogs . Keeps their mind active while they try to dig for the ball . Funny thing is : I bought it for the scratchy surface
5 #### I bought one nearly 18 years ago for one of my cats who really never played with it . Next cat comes along and she did n't play with either next 2 cats come along they kind of played with it . But my ragdoll she loves it ! and I adopted two more rescue kittens so I need to order another one because I keep one upstairs in their room when they 're not downstairs with the ragdoll . They love it
5 #### Great fun for all of my three adopted cats , especially when their kittens . They can spend hours trying to get that ball out and then they can scratch their claws on the middle part . One of the better toys I have ever bought for my cats .
3 #### somewhat durable it be nice if it had a flavor to keep him attracted to it
5 #### This toy is wonderful ! The dog loves it and it has lasted forever . It is hard , but not too hard for the moth to chew on . My dog is a very aggressive chewer , so I am thrilled when I find a toy that lasts . I have a Labrador Retriever .
3 #### this Kong is better than i thought - the girls took to them well nice to throw , bounce and fetch - but within half and hour they were pulling them apart there is a hole down the centre ( which could have been good for treats ) but this was the area they started to pick at - a few small chunks - i d buy another one of these - it took them a lot longer to destroy than the kong detal sticks
5 #### loves it when other favorite toys not available . Great with putting goodies inside , keeps busy for a long time , Loves it this way
5 #### Our power chewer ( German Shepard ) has yet to make a dent in any Kong product . And he literally sits and chews on this thing like it 's a lion he brought down in Africa . The squeak of teeth against the rubber can get on a person 's nerves , but it 's not the furniture so you take what you can get !
5 #### My fish love it and their color is more vibrant . Also the price is reasonable .
5 #### I purchased this item because of the exceptional $ $ $ . I have been using this brand for the last six(6 ) years at 3lbs for $ 26 . My two Koi fish are really healthy & thriving . It does not cloud water at all . Tried other brands resulting in cloudy water after 3 - 4 days . Give this one a try !
3 #### My cats do not care for this food at all ! They hate it its so sad !
1 #### Three cans in the case were bad ( the cans were bloated even though i could n't see any damage ) . i had to throw them out as i did n't even want to open them , and certainly would not feed these to my cats for fear of making them sick . So i wo n't buy this again . i buy the single cans at the pet food store and they like it fine . It also contains carageean ( sp ) which is bad for animals , but i am tolerating that fact for now . But anyway , it is too costly to order a case when there are bad cans ... i do n't feel safe buying this again .
5 #### My cats love this food and I love how well it makes them look and feel . They have lost weight and have glossy , healthy coats and skin . Grain free is the way to go and Wellness is an excellent brand .
3 #### I would have given this product 4 stars in regard to the good ingredients and it is grain free with no by - products . But for whatever reason , my 4 month old kittens do not enjoy it and leave most of it in their dishes .
4 #### the cats seem to like it ... after a considerable tryout time
5 #### Have cats with health issues so need a quality food at a reasonable price that the cats enjoy . This fits our needs very well .
4 #### My cats wo n't eat it ... so what more can I say ? :/ Edit ... I think I had a bad bag .. I 've since purchased this again and all my cats seemed to like it well enough !
5 #### This is my cats favorite dry food . they will not eat any other flavor .
4 #### The cats will eat this one , and Purina is a brand that I have trusted for a long time .
5 #### Bought this for a local animal shelter as this is what they commonly use ! ! ! !
5 #### Great , healthy cat food - it comes highly recommended by our vet , and all our cats enjoy it . We have two who are over 14 years old and going strong and have eaten science diet nearly exclusively .
1 #### I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available . However , over the last few months ( late 2007 ) something has changed . My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it . Upon switching to another quality food , the problems stopped . I tried another bag last week-- same results . Other dog owners / breeders / vets / handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months . No one , including myself , has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas , ingredient suppliers , etc . I 'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few ' quality foods ' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners . Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address . I 'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems . I 've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects . It 's more expensive , but they are back to their old selves-- healthy , no digestive troubles , and great coats .
5 #### My dog was sick for 2 months and lost 20 % of her body weight . Her coat was falling out in clumps and she was still barely eating , eventhough the vet could n't figure out what was wrong with her . We switched her to Canidae based on a friend 's recommendation . She has gained half her weight back in 2 weeks and her coat is improving , as is her energy levels . For a siberian husky , this food ca n't be beat !
5 #### When our pets are happy I 'm happy . The whole HOUSE is happy . They like these so I like these - NO I do n't eat them , the critters do !
5 #### My Frenchie loves these treats and they are ingredients you can pronounce .
3 #### These Duck biscuits used to be good and hard . Good for my dog 's teeth and cleaning . They have changed recently and crumble too easily . They also do n't do well in shipping . ! I have purchased them for over a year and a half now , and they are always my ' go to " brand . Something seems to have changed recently . UPDATE : Have bought several more recently . They still break apart too easily .
5 #### Our 3 mini dachshunds love these treats . Then again , they love anything eatable .
4 #### Good , but upsets my puppy 's ulcers if he eats them late at night .
5 #### I was looking for a healthy and yummy puppy can food since my puppy is a picky eater . After opening the first can I new that this was the right product ! She sat next , patiently waiting for her yummy meal . I am happy and she is happier !
5 #### We adopted a puppy at SPCA and the veterinarian there recommended this food so we bought a bag there . A few days later we went to a different veterinarian and he also recommended this food , according to him , it is one of the best products . We are very satisfied with the food , our dog likes it and it seems to be developing with no problems . Each bag has a chart that tells you how much food you should give your dog and how often depending on the dog 's weight . So you have to be weighing your dog every week ( at least we do ) to make sure the quantity of food is correct . When your doggie goes to " do his business " the " waste " comes out in a defined shape so it is not messy or liquid and the amount is not much , and not very smelly , easy to pick up . This is due to the all natural products , no dye , no preservatives in the food . Dogs are better able to digest and really benefit from the food . Sorry to gross you out but as a pet owner you do want to know this facts . After all , you will be the one cleaning up afterter the pup .
5 #### MY DOGS HAVE ALWAYS USED THIS BRAND , SO I TRIED THIS AS A CHANGE OF PACE FOR THEM . THEY LOVE IT .
4 #### Prompt shipment on the cans ! Used these for my pregnant girl at the end of pregnancy ... she liked it pretty well . It is a bit dry and dense . Firm stools though and no problems . Pups have firm stools and little smell as well .
3 #### This is an OK product . My puppy eats it ( but he eats anything , literally ) I am giving it a 3 star because it 's highly priced considering there are plenty of ' filler ' ingredients . Now , I do n't really make it a high priority to feed my dog the best in the world ( my last dog did well on beneful ) this dog does well on Natural balance . I am giving it 3 stars cause for the price you can actually get a better dog food with no fillers ....
4 #### My dog does n't like plastic toys ... Even filled with peanut butter , this Kong did n't interest him for very long , and I 'm considering trying a different Kong . It looks like this would be fantastic for dogs who like to chew , though !
5 #### So far so good . Our 5 mos old lab ' destroyed ' the Kong Genius - line toys ( in less than 1 hour ) . This toy has lasted a week so far . I would recommend it .
3 #### My dog likes this if I put treats in it , but otherwise does not choose it as a favorite . So far she does n't chew on it much .
5 #### I have had the pleasure of owning two rescue dogs in my life . My first Beau loved soft plush toys . He never touched any hard toy I got him . When he passed I adopted Benji . Benji tears apart any soft toy with surgical precision - so hard toys are a must . This one has held up well for the month or so we have had it . He carries it around the apartment and I end up finding it everywhere from the bathroom to my bed ! If you have a big dog who loves to chew this one is a winner .
5 #### for some reason , my dogs love and prefer this shape but it is a little small for my Great Pyrenees and I wish they made this dinosaur in an extra large
5 #### My dog has had hers for 2 years and still goes back to it once a month or so .
5 #### I wish you got to specify the dinosaur type , but my dog sure does n't care . Has lasted several months with my lab chewing on it , and he still likes to take it with him everywhere .
5 #### It 's a magical litter box that makes the poo and pee dissolve into a fine mist and float away on the evening breeze . In all seriousness , it 's a plastic box you put your cat litter of choice into and then scoop it back out as the need arises . Does it really need a review ? Well , for those that answered with a resounding " Yes ! " , this is for you . I order 2 . They both arrived sporting the same lovely shade of blue pictured above . I would not consider it GIANT by any means , it 's simply an average litter box . It holds the litter . It does its job . It fulfills its purpose in life . Buy it . Use it . Rather , let your cats use it . Is it a cure for world peace ? No . But it is a solid piece of plastic . Enjoy .
4 #### I bought these cheaply to turn them into a self - sifting litter box . By themselves , they 're a basic litter box , and I would n't necessarily use them . But buy three of them , drill a bunch of holes in one , and you have yourself a sifting box . It 's fantastic .
5 #### Great box . It was the one that finally got my bunny to understand litter box training . Good size . Great quality .
5 #### We have a 19 pound cat and he has plenty of space to use this litter box . No more pee on the flour . He tends to perch off the side of the box and he 's able to do so with this box -- easily .
5 #### Giant pals work well with the iumbo Johnny cat liners . This makes cleanup so much easier .
4 #### Koi took a few times to get used to liking it- but now they feed easily . Was using Kay Lees Koi Choice which is smaller pellet , denser and a slightly higher protein content- which they / I prefer . Larger pellet size was not a problem as my Koi are 18 - 24 " . Good food though and fish are healthy with great color .
5 #### Great food and a wonderful price . Shops great . Very happy will continue to buy more .
4 #### This is a pretty good food for force feeding through a syringe , an unfortunate thing to have to do to a cat in the first place . Adding a little bit of water makes it the right consistency , not too messy , a few little clumps here and there . It has more calories than the usual prescribed force feeding options and is a bit cheaper , though not by much . It took 55 force feedings to bring our cat back from the brink after a sudden onset of fatty liver disease ( hepatic lipidosis ) , so I 'm glad for that .
5 #### We have a nonprofit feline rescue , and this is the food we feed our adult cats . It 's an excellent , affordable profit . Grain free and high quality .
3 #### cat does n't seems to like it very much , maybe its flavor is not so inducing to her .
5 #### Well My cats love it and it was n't broken when it got here So I gave it five stars
5 #### I have 3 of these . My cats favorite toys !
5 #### This is what we 've fed our cats since we adopted them 5 years ago . Our trusted vet confirmed that Hill 's Science Diet gave them all the nutritional values they require .
4 #### My cat 's digestion does better on this than with other brands , I 'm guessing because it 's high in fiber . The only thing I REALLY do n't like is that the individual pieces are huge . They are bigger than pieces of full - grown , large - breed dog food ! My cat has to gnaw at them and then I end up with little half chewed pieces on my floor . I do n't know why they would make them that big for cats . The resealable bag is a plus , though !
5 #### My cat asked for it by name , you know Me - Purina Pro Plan Dry Cat Food , Savor- ow .
5 #### My cats love this food ! I 've spent a lot of time comparing ingredients to other brands and I think this is one of the healthiest options out there . Affordable too .
5 #### This dog food is a very high quality dog food . I used to buy it at a discount store , but I get it at a better price and shipped thru Amazon .
5 #### This Hill 's Science Diet Puppy Savory Stew Chicken and Vegetables Dog Food will supercharge your pup . It is pumped full of nutrients and extras that you can only find in this foo . No fillers , just nutrient rich dog food . Keeps bowel movements nice and firm . The utmost in puppy care .
5 #### My Maltese luv this food will be getting the beef flavor next ! They like the chicken , so I know , they will luv whichever I get .
2 #### She will eat everything else but she does n't like this type of food . She has never been finicky before . Just with this . Ordered it accidently will go back to her other food when this bag is done
3 #### I originally started my puppy on Castor and Pollux which I love the ingredients but my Boston terrier had loose stills no matter what I tried . Once I switched to science diet he got a lot better . I do not like the ingredients at all and do eventually plan on mixing it with castor and Pollux and Swithing 100 % and hopefully everything goes well . My boston does not get excited about this food at all , he eats it because he 's hungry , but he actually loved Castor and Pollux .
5 #### I purchased for my new pups . I have been a long time fan / customer of science diet for 11 years . My babies love the food ! ! Actually cheaper online them in stores . THanks ! !
5 #### I have tried several dog foods for my puppy . this is the only brand and type that he seems to love . my puppy had an issue with eating his poo , so i tried all these other brands and he would continue to eat it . i finally put him on this and sucess ! he stopped eating his poo and he eats all his food . i have also given him other science diet wet food with the meat and gravy but he does nt like it . of note , this food will make your dogs poo extra stinky . which is good so he wo n't eat it but bad for when you pick it up .
4 #### My dogs do n't RUN to this food or get exited about it ... yet it makes a healthy stool . Science diet is a good product . I like Royal Canin too so I mix the two together ...
5 #### The Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate is a long standing favorite at our house .I really appreciate the selections . I have n't come across a flavor she ( Sissy ) wo n't eat , yet . Makes shopping easy ! I really appreciate the care Meow Mix and Friskies put into their products . It is really a comfort to know that people who CARE are in the labs all the time , working on making their products better . Thank you !
4 #### i like to buy in bulk . my cats love to eat this at least once a day and seem very satisfied .
5 #### My cat is 24 now , can barely walk , but he loves his frisks ! The 3 flavors are enough variety to keep him interested .. his sense of taste and smell are almost gone , so they are potent enough for him to be able to smell and enjoy ... I have this on subscribe and save , since most grocery stores do n't have the cases , and they cost much more - It 's so nice to not have to worry about getting cat food , each month , getting enough cans , looking for the sales , and hoping they have the case ... This gets delivered once a month , saving on gas , time , lines ... and my cat really enjoys it . I mix in some veggies now and then just to give more vitamins to the diet ...
4 #### I 've been feeding my cats Friskies for a long time . I buy the pate because they prefer it to the chunks or filets .
3 #### The toy looks and behaves exactly as pictures , but my kitty is n't into it . I gave the scratcher to my mom , who has a kitten , and he 's not into it either . I the toy is fine , it 's just not going to appeal to all cats .
3 #### I thought my cats would play with the ball , but they do n't . They do use the scratcher .
1 #### One cat played with it for 5 minutes , the other is n't interested and the baby one comes and plays for a minute than leaves and comes back . I m hoping they find more interest in it as time goes on . Might need to put it on carpet so that it does nt just slide around everywhere . 4 stars for now because there was an initial interest . Will update . Update : played with it for two hours the first day . Never been touched since . Going in the trash .
3 #### My dogs are n't overly fond of the KONG Dental Dog Toy . My dogs prefer the black sized Kongs that hold treats . They ignore this one .
5 #### Arrived on time . Packaging was solid - excellent . Easy enough to clean and when filled with treats it keeps my dog entertained for a long time . Since it rolls it is a great distraction and play interaction for my dog . So far has withstood numerous hours of serious chewing . I love KONG products as they are done very well - especially these natural rubber toys .
4 #### Both my dogs loved both as a throw toy and a chew toy . Great for hiding treats for more entrainment . Proved to be indestructible . Red color easy to find in the yard .
5 #### We call our dog The Shredder because she has destroyed every toy we have given her during the year we 've had her . This is the one toy that has lasted , along with another , smaller kong toy . She has chewed them around the edges , but ca n't destroy them . She loves to chase them and play with them . The only complaint I have is that when she slings them around , they hurt when they hit my legs or land on my feet .
4 #### my dog enjoys this toy and loves pulling out the treat in the middle , it 's not quite as much fun without it , but still good
3 #### I bought 4 Kongs , this one seemed thin as far as Kong strength . It 's mearly to clean their teeth as u pick up pieces of the toy everywhere if they do n't swallow them . I do have 3 100 + lbs dogs , that CHEW so take this in stride .
1 #### dog hates it i put it in the garbage
5 #### Love Nylabone brand items ! I was worried about what kind of chance this toy would stand in our home , but it has so far withstood our cattle dog , who has made it " her job " to rip apart all toys we give to her ... I had visions of her chewing this dino apart in minutes , but so far she has only been able to rough up his feet .... if she chews on it for too long , it does seem to wear on her gums , but I only let her have it supervised , and pay attention to when I need to take if from her and put it away for the day .... works very well to get out that some of that heeler energy :)
5 #### Dog loves it , what more is there to say ? ! Great exercise for those teeth and gums . Good price and effective .
5 #### This is the perfect sized litter box for my cats . They have no problem doing their business in this box , and with the Pureness litter scoop , cleaning up is a breeze . And for the price , it was just the thing I needed for my cats . I got two and I could n't be happier with my choice .
3 #### Not as big as I thought it would be . Sides are n't really that tall . It will do but I would ve rather bought one with taller sides if I knew it was going to be the same size as the one I have now .
5 #### cats love it , good sized and easy to clearn
5 #### FYI this is a lot bigger than the average size cat box . When it came , i was like : whoa . That 's a big box . The cats love it , so all is well .
5 #### I 've been feeding Wellness grain free to my cat for a few years . Before I started feeding her grain free she had been overweight and constantly was scratching . With the Wellness , she lost three pounds and no longer is bothered by itching .
2 #### I ordered two cases of the 12.5 oz cans of Wellness cat food . The shipping box was not damaged . The cardboard trays that the cans were packed in had the Wellness logos on them and they were not damaged . However , several of the cans were badly bent .
5 #### My kitten ( he is 6 mo old now ) grew up with this , and he loves it ! No eye discharge . Somehow this cat food makes him very energized .
5 #### My cat had horrible problems with the wrong pH and struvite crystals in her urine on her old cat food . My vet recommended this in addition to methionine pills and my cat is much happier .
5 #### 24 cans for $ 29.90 from this seller , compared to 1 can for between $ 1.50 and $ 1.75 around here in the stores ( $ 36-$42 ) is excellent ! ! The bigger cans are always a better bargain , but I hate putting half - used cans in the fridge , and the cats do n't really like cold food , so these small cans are perfect . If you 're new to this brand , cats really react differently to the flavors . Mine either throw up or avoid the minced , cubed or sliced Turkey , but their total favorite ( and mine because no throwing up ! ) is the Turkey called Turkey Formula in the green can , which is just mushy . Weird . But if you like the cans and ease of opening , try a few textures .
3 #### My cat did n't like it and refused to eat it - other wellness she loved , but not this kitten one .
1 #### The Tetra Pond Koi food is great , BUT THEY KEEP SENDING ME THESE DAM 5 POUND BAGS OF FOOD EVERY 2 OR 3 MONTHS I 've called AMAZON and ask them to STOP send this and they keep sending me this dam Koi food . I 've had to put a stop on my credit card ! And they still keep sending this DAMN CRAP !
5 #### We 've been using this for three years now , and our fish are healthy and happy and , they seem to enjoy it . As regards the " vibrance " part , I 'm going on faith here ; my fish are colorful and look great , but since there is no control as to what they 'd look like if they did not have the " vibrance " food , I ca n't compare . But , they are healthy and happy . I switch to the fall feed when the weather gets cooler .
5 #### we ( cats and humans ) love this . cats did get tired of this after a while . humans then put it in a brown paper grocery bag ( half in half out ) and cats went crazy for it again .
5 #### My cat loves this . Especially in the middle of the night .
5 #### I have 3 adult cats and they are always playing with this thing . Even the fat lazy one . So much so that I had to get several for multiple rooms .
5 #### great product . my cat absolutely loves this thing . only complaint is the ball is a bit noisy as it moves . the cardboard insert is still going strong after a few months .
4 #### I would like more than anything else to give this a 5 star rating . However , I 've tried 4 times now , from multiple sources , to find this elusive T - Rex version . I think they only offer the Stegosaurus and " Brontosaurus . " I only ever received one " Stego " and 3 " Bronts . " The two extra Brontosaurus ended up being gifts . Atlas , my now 7 month old pit has had this since he came home with me just before 2 months old . The toy can stand up to a LOT of tough love .
4 #### i 'm sure dogs like this , just not ours . it was exactly as pictured and what we thought it should be , but our dog just does not want to chew it much . oh well .
5 #### This stuff made my cat jump up and down like a freaking dog ! !
5 #### Pure luck , perhaps : I got this and another brand recommended by my cat 's veterinarian who said they are good for dental health . My cat disdained the Other Brand . But she loves this one ! ! One out of two is a success when you 've got Miss Picky Eater ! Thank you .
5 #### My fur babies love this , and so do I since it was recommended by their Veterinarian .
5 #### This is a quality cat food . It is the only food my cat will eat . Amazon is the cheapest place I have found to buy it .
4 #### They do n't like the savor line as well as some of the others . however , my cats are healthier when they eat pro plan . In fact , one of my cats tends to have health problems if I do n't include pro plan dry in his diet .
5 #### I have n't yet given my cat any of this food but before I put it away she was clawing at the bag trying to get it open ! Love the ingredients and ca n't wait to use this !
1 #### If you love your cat , do n't feed her this garbage . This food contains organ failure diabetes stroke heart attack skin ulcers dandruff dental decay shorter life span oh and meat - by - product I think my title explains enough but really READ the label and if you do n't understand what it is , look it up . But you say " my kitty loves it " I say " I love twinkies , still not a good diet "
5 #### My Cats really like " Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate , Salmon , Mixed Grill and Turkey & Giblets one of the many Flavors that are Good for Cats and I get Locally . 100 % Completed and Balanced Nutrition for Adult Cats and Kittens . These Foods are Formulated to meet the Nutritional Levels established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials " AAFCO " I have tried to give my Cats other more Expensive Gourmet Foods from Specialty Pet - Shops or even the Pet Hospital , however , they do n't care for any of that Food , my Cats like to Eat Friskies . They always have Dry and Wet Food available to them all the time . I even feed several Cats outside with Friskies and they Love It ! ... Thank You D.D.
5 #### I was hesitant to buy this as sometimes the cans are bad but this was really good . It comes in two 12 - packs . The cats love this stuff , especially the Turkey ! Yum - Yum ! ! ! I liked buying online . It is better than running to the store only to discover they are out of stock . Very good deal !
5 #### This was the best way to get their favorites . Plus - less hauling heavy item around in a store , into a car , out of the car and up into the house . Thanks .
5 #### Cats love this stuff , I like the ingredients better than 9 Lives . I put it out and they chow down happily .
5 #### This is the best deal I can find anywhere for my cats and both the eight year old and the four year old truly enjoy it . :) I can not recall how many times I have gone back to my Purchase History to look for this Variety Pack so I can buy it again .
5 #### Cat likes them , what more can I say . I think it was a fair price , and very convenient to have it show up on my doorstep .
1 #### Corn is the number 1 ingredient . If I wanted to feed my dogs corn , I would have went to Wal - mart and grabbed a bag of Ol' Roy . My dogs refused to eat this " vet recommended " crap .
3 #### She loved it for a couple of days then would n't eat it . She seemed extra gassy from it as well .
3 #### Our dog does not like it at all . Had to buy some sprinkles ( beef liver ) here at Amazon to make our 8 - month old , 18 lbs Terrier mix to like it . And even then it takes her a long time to finish a cup of it on a twice a day feeding . She does get a few treats in between so that could be messing it up . Our vet recommends it so have to view it like vegetables to a child . It 's good for her even if her tongue and taste buds disagree . UPDATE : 01/15/2013 [ ... ] only rates Science Diet - puppy as 2.5 stars . We mixed it with Eagle Pack dog food - Puppy which is rated 4 stars in same website and our dog loves the combination ( 50/50 ) . She eats it fast and we do not even have to put the beef liver sprinkles anymore .
5 #### I give this to my 5.5 month old Chihuahua puppy . He really loves this and eats all his food . He seems very happy with his food . In fact one of my cats also enjoy trying it . My dog seems to be thriving on it .
5 #### Both my girls love this mixed in with their food . ( I 'm sure they 'd love it more NOT mixed with the kibble , but they tolerate the kibble just be eat this . ) Great service , reasonably priced . I 'd gladly use seller again .
5 #### My puppy has had much better success tolerating and thriving on Science Diet compared with pricier " all natural " brands ... you know ... ingredients that people would also be happy to eat . But she is a dog , not a human and so if ground up chicken beaks are one of the fillers , but she is healthy and happy , I do n't worry about it period . At the shelter where I got her they sell Science diet for half the price of what it is available elsewhere ... gotta go get some more . Why , because my dog loves it and is healthy and happy and seeing is believing . Cheers !
3 #### It has n't broken since the dogs do n't use it . Nothing good or bad to say about it . It came as posted .
5 #### Costco 's Kirkland Dog Biscuits fit perfectly ( tight enough to stay in ) in this toy , and is n't easy for my pup to get it out . She 's a labrador . She works it for a while before she starts slamming it to the ground , thus breaking the biscuit up and allowing small pieces to come out at a time . I can see it working even better with a smaller dog maybe , although it is quite a large Kong toy . My dog does n't have separation anxiety when I leave for work anymore , because she knows she 's going to get her Kong with a treat inside every time I leave .
5 #### I love the kong products . We have agressive chewers and these are the only thing they have not destroyed . Plus the price is very reasonable considering what local stores sell them for .
3 #### We have a one year old shepherd , boxer , pitt mix and he liked this toy a lot . But then we left him alone with it one day ( as we often do with his Kong toys ) and he ripped it to shreds . I did n't know that was possible with Kong Toys . We 'll stick to black Kong toys from now on . The good news , my husband put the bulbous end of using a saw and now we use it as a somewhat durable ball for play in the backyard . So we still got some use out of it , just not its intended use .
5 #### I was using Purina One when one of my male cats had a urinary tract blockage & had to have a stent put in . The Vet Tech said she used to have that problem and since she switched to Hill 's Science Diet food , she has n't had any other problems . That is when I changed foods and now I use Hill 's exclusively with no other problems .
5 #### Hill 's Science Diet Adult Optimal Care Chicken Recipe Dry Cat Food how this food has transformed my shorthair cats coat is amazing ! highly recommend it , but i do prefer their .6 phosphorus food better . chose this food because needed a high calorie food to put weight on the cat . also wanted as low a phosphorus content as possible . this was the food . the cat had been a stray . coat was wirey . in less than three months , this food transformed the coat to sooooo soft ! the coat along the spine was the last to become soft . after getting weight ideal , will be switching to science diet adult light . it has the lowest phosphorus content ( without an Rx ) , which i use for all cats for kidney heath regardless of their age . it produces just as good a coat , but is much lower in calories .
5 #### I have been feeding this cat food to my beloved furbabies for over 15 years now . It is a well balanced nutritional food . I would recommend it highly ! !
1 #### It gave two of my cats the runs . I gave it away .
4 #### my dog will eat these treats , but does n't seem to like them as well as the mini sized ones .
4 #### I give it 4 star , just because my dog does n't like it , it does n't mean it is n't goon .
5 #### Cats loved this ! Works well , hard to clean , but its a cute toy and fun to see the cats play .
5 #### Kitten is having alot of fun with ths . Cost alot more in stores .
5 #### My cats do n't seem to use the ball ( cats are all over 6years old ) . They love the scratcher and to nap on this thing though .
5 #### Tried to . Uh expensive cat food or fresh meats but my cats only like friskies and will only eat friskies .
5 #### arrived fast- all the cans were intact-convenient.just what me and my cats needed for a snow day --- if I ran out of cat food
5 #### I 'm not sure what I could possibly say about these flavors , but that my cat loves them . Of all the Friskies offerings , these three are his favorites . ( Especially the salmon . ) I 've tried more gourmet cat foods of all kinds . He 'll try them for a while , but he 's always happy to go back to these . And his finicky !
5 #### My cats never turn this down and it is a great value . I supplement with dry food but have one cat with urinary tract problems so he needs more moisture / liquid in his diet . This food works well to combat that .
3 #### We split a can of this among our 3 outdoor cats daily , along with generous helpings of dry food . The ingredients are nothing special and there is added food coloring , but the label says it is manufactured in the USA . The cats love the fishy flavors , but are n't too keen on the mixed grill . The variety pack is a good value from Amazon , and I will probably buy it again .
5 #### Great toy for dogs who like to chew ! Very durable and tough .
5 #### Perfect for hard chewers , my dogs love them , last forever .
3 #### like the nylabobe , but the shape is difficult for my pup and my 28 lbs dogggie to hold to chew
5 #### We got the stegosaurus and it 's my dog 's new favorite toy . He 's only 6 months old and a very heavy chewer , so this is perfect for him . He likes this one even better than the flavored Nylabones he has . Very durable , highly recommend .
5 #### This litter pan is super , my Burmese loves it he very rarely misses the tub now , and he fits it good too ! !
5 #### Sides are higher which has helped keep my 1/2 maine coon from overshooting .
5 #### This is definitely a quality litter pan with a raised back side and lowered front side for ease of entry and exit while increasing the ability to keep litter inside . The size is quite big and is generous enough for larger tom cats . I find that one full 20 pound clumping litter is enough to cover this large pan fully . Made in USA and the plastic is excellent without any detectable smells .
4 #### This is one of the best food for my Koi . My Koi love it a lot . The only thing I do n't like is the price . It 's expensive . I alternate this one with cheaper brands .
5 #### Used it for years always satisfied so are the koi
5 #### I buy these sticks every spring for my koi . They have a good balance of protein and other nutrition elements . They saturate and become soft easily , and do indeed float . My koi love them ( as do my dogs when they fall on the slate around the pond ! ) and they do a good job for vibrant color and nutrition throughout late spring to fall , when the temperatures drop .
5 #### We 've been feeding this to our pond fish for several years , and they do very well on it . The " Bonus " is the quick home delivery and lower price than at pet store . The fish get excited at feeding time - the big orange koi always has its mouth open for food .
5 #### We have been using this for years . My cat lived to be 20 1/2 years old-----good genes and no dry food . This is the only food she would eat .
5 #### I purchased this for my kitten . She went for kitten formula straight to this and she loves it . it 's also reassuring that it 's good for her with no grains at all . She has n't had any problem with using the litter after eating this and her poop has been solid . She has yet to have diarrhea , but then again , she 's still really young ( 13 weeks ) .
5 #### Milo loves this food ! I 've been trying to feed him dry food too as a supplement , so he can eventually get used to dry food for when I have to go out of town for a weekend . But he begs for this stuff and hesitantly will eat the dry food ( if its the only option ) .
3 #### It 's a bit expensive for what the ingredients are , however , cats liked it .
5 #### great food at a great price . My cats love this ! Quick shipping too .
5 #### We switched from a higher priced specialty dry food to this . All four cats have adjusted to it and like it . It keeps their coats beautiful , and they do not have as many stomach upsets with this food . We will continue to feed this to them . Our daughter , who is a veterinarian , recommended Purina since they do a lot of research on all their foods . Several of the other pet food companies do not put any money into researching ingredients and their foods .
1 #### Our dog had the ridges on this half chewed off on the first day . He is n't necessarily what you would call a super chewer so I 'm not convinced this is safe for the average chewers . It took him months to chew holes on his other kongs and even then he was n't pulling pieces off them .
4 #### My shepherd likes this toy , but it is not his favorite . He will chew on it occasionally . He has not torn it up as he does the others . Good quality though
4 #### I bought this for my one year old husky . It definitely stands up I the wear and tear , like any long , but be careful as it has two very large openings so food or kong filling does not stay contained inside . It leaked out and got on the rug !
3 #### I bought this toy for our new rescue pup n maybe it 's him ... but will not play with this toy at all . Just wants every other toy but this ... crazy since u read reviews n saw that everyone was raving about the toy , guess he 's weird just sad I wasted my $ when I could of gotten him more bones .
5 #### Cat loves this ! The catnip more than the actual toy but he still enjoys it :)
5 #### My boyfriend bought my 2 kittens this and they absolutely love it . They bat that ball around and flip themselves all over on here chasing it . The scratching section in the middle is good too , but they usually need me to put a little cat nip on it to get them to use it more . Once they get at the catnip though , they 're completely insane for this ball , it 's hilarious . Great purchase especially for the price .
5 #### I have five cats , all of them love this food , the price is right for me . 100 % recommended . My cats confirm product quality
3 #### I had two cats but one had to be put down . He was the one who liked the pate . The female I have left does not care at all for the pate in any flavor so I will not order again . I found that if I mixed a can with other food she would eat it but it is too much work so this is the last order of pate for me .
5 #### Not sure what people except to read here . It 's a common brand of cat food , that I am certain most cat owners have tried on their cats already . I 'm sure it is n't high quality , but if you have 10 cats to feed , and are n't wealthy , then you stick with what s most affordable .
4 #### My vet changed my cat 's diet to pate - type canned food . Luckily , she loves Friskies . It 's almost half the price of Iams and she 's doing great ! Her weight is down , her activity is up and she loves this stuff . The only flavor she did n't like was the Salmon . Yep , a cat that does n't like fish . . . go figure !
5 #### They totally gobbled it all up ...... quickly :D I am definitely purchasing this again today if it 's still available !
5 #### Wonderful products , wonderful price ! I feel I will buy this product again in the future . I hope this company never stops making this wonderful product !
5 #### Wonderful product , wonderful price ! I feel I will buy this product again in the future . I hope this company never stops making this wonderful product !
4 #### My cats like these three flavors . There are 12 cans in the box so it 'll last for awhile . I would recommend it .
2 #### I read the reviews and thought this would be good for our Alaskan Klee Kai . She is a chewer but was not impressed with this toy . The only parts she chewed was the had and the legs . She did not like the little beads on the body and tail of the toy which is the main point of this toy . Maybe other dogs will like it but mine did n't .
5 #### Its been a month and my dogs our still chewing on it ! ! ! Last long and the dogs seem to love it
5 #### I have a big dog and she loves this little bone , it 's not so big so medium small or large dogs could probably should it 's very hard nylon so it 's hard to destroy
5 #### The price is good and my cats love it .
5 #### My special diet dog loves these and so do all the other dogs in my household . A great treat .
5 #### These are enjoyed by my 7 lb dog and my 50 lb dog .
5 #### My dog was just diagnosed with diabetes and I had to look around for treats for her ( we give them to her after her shot twice a day ) - so these are perfect for her ! Thank you Nature Balance !
3 #### Very happy with treat from he beginning . My dog loved them , had a low order , and were sized perfectly for my medium to large sized dog . Unfortunately , my dog ended up having an allergic reactive to the formula and we had to stop using them . I 'm not sure what ingredient she reacted to , so if your dog has allergies or sensitive stomach , make sure you read the ingredient list before purchasing .
4 #### Love Kong products . They really stand up against the teeth of 3 Labradoodles . Having said that , 2 of them have n't gotten much use from it as the smallest , Scarlett , took it outside and hid it ... as she does with all of her favorite toys . I 'm assuming that they are still playing with it ... just do n't get outside that often to see them do it . :-)
5 #### I love this for my 80 lb puppy ! He chews but does n't destroy & it 's great to put in treats as a project toy .
2 #### My dog is slowly , but surely , chewing the ends of this toy off , and without much effort because he does n't like this toy very much to begin with . This is not made out of the same material as a traditional Kong toy .
4 #### At first i thought it was way to big , but after giving it to my grey hound lab mix it was great . I fill it with treats and peanut butter and he s occupied for a while ! It also helps him stop chewing on our furniture !
5 #### I was really surprised when I saw the quality on this toy . It was way bigger than expected , and it came with cat nip ! The ball is pretty heavy so it keeps rolling with minimum effort . Considering you ca n't get any kind of scratching mat for less than $ 20 , this is a great buy !
5 #### My 1 - year - old cat loves this . She plays with it a lot , and sleeps on top of it all curled up . Great toy .
5 #### Excellent value and the fish look brighter than ever !
5 #### I 'd say it 's large size I 've bought larger but a good Pan either way :)
5 #### The cats use it ! As long as they use it and there 's no holes , it 's 5 stars .
5 #### bought this to have a spare box for traveling . Works great !
5 #### My dog loves his brontosaurus ! There is texture all over the toy regardless of the breed of dinosaur you receive , which encourages chewing . I 've already ordered more .
5 #### These hold up to pitbull puppies . She chews these all the time . Great price too
5 #### September 10 , 2014 My dog is in love with this chew toy . He actually prefers it over natural antler chews . I did n't think he could like anything more than his antler , but I guess I was wrong . This chew definitely looks worn , and as the packaging says , small pieces ( the size of a grain of rice ) do break off . I 've never had any large pieces come off though , and it has never led to illness or injury . January 17 , 2018 Over 3 years later , this is still my dogs favorite chew toy . He s ground down the entire head , but for 3 years of daily use , it has held up really well .
5 #### This is a great favorite with the many dogs in our family . I recommend it .
3 #### I thought the shape of this dog chew was clever . My dog did not seem to care for it even if I let him know it was okay to eat . Thank you .
5 #### Cats love their new cat food . I had received a Purina Pro Plan bag through the Vine program and I did n't like the food because of fillers . Was contacted by Purina and was told there were n't any fillers . My cats ( all 5 of them ) really like the food and if they are happy I 'm happy too . They get 2 cups of it a day and they love it !
5 #### have fed my cats pro Plan since the late 90 's when it came out ... will feed them nothing else
5 #### I adopted a cat for years ago she has a delicate stomach I try to turn on four different foods and the wellness chicken and turkey the ones that she does n't get sick and she does n't have the runs so it works out for her she loves it I 'm glad they made the cat food so if you have a finicky Kat this is a good product by highly recommend it
4 #### My cats favorite food , hands down . They tolerate some of the other Wellness flavors , but this is the one they lave . Unfortunately , it has a high amount of carrageenan so I can only feed it every 3 days or so as the carrageenan tends to have an unpleasant effect on their tummies . I would not feed it at all because of that , but it is had to find any cat food without carrageenan and my furry fiends ( uhm , friends , I meant friends ) love this , so I still feed it on a limited basis . Except for the carrageenan , the ingredients list on this food is excellent .
4 #### Cats like it so far . 4 stars instead of 5 because 1 ) the cans do n't have handles and require an opener 2 ) my clumsy kittens seem to make a bigger mess on the floor with this food , perhaps because of the shape of the fish bits .
5 #### This may be my kitties ' favorite meal -- other than people 's chicken , beef and fish
5 #### I switched my cats to a grain - free diet , as recommended by my vet . Since I have done this , their coats are much more shiny and rich . Their gastro - intestinal problems that were aparently caused from eaing cheap wet cat food have disappeared . I do mix this with a bit of water , as my cats like that consistency better and my vet said that was better for their hydration .
5 #### My kitten loves this toy ! In fact I have the scratcher a few years ago with an older cat and he loved it just as much . I did find it two dollars cheaper ( at Walmart ) after I ordered it on Amazon . However , I also found it for $ 10 more At my local feed store . So prices can vary between $ 8 and $ 20 for the same product .
4 #### I 'm glad I brought extra cardboard inserts and balls to keep it interesting for our cat .
2 #### My lab chewed right through it . it is too soft and some big dogs will destroy this in 2 minutes .
1 #### I bought this toy for my one year old lab / pit . She chewed the end off within 30 minutes . Same with the ball . I now know I can only by the black Kong toys for aggressive chewers - Wish I would have know before I purchase these s toys
4 #### My 7mo Lab has n't destroyed it .. he gets a little bored with it tho .. but all the kongs we have.have outlasted all the other toys .. good product for my power chewer .
1 #### Dog destroyed this in seconds ... I think I will stick to the Extreme Kongs ! Too bad they do n't make an extreme version for this toy , I would have liked to try it ! ! It was lame of me to try it , I should have expected this , tbh .
5 #### My rott loves these things , and has yet to completely destroy the xl ones . She gets the ridges all ripped up and the ends chewed down - but they last her a couple / few months before i replace them .
5 #### Our cat transitioned from Hill 's kitten to adult cat food gradually . Started mixing small amount of indoor adult food with kitten kibble then shifting the ratio until all adult cat formula . No digestive issues experienced . Gert prefers the chicken flavor .
5 #### Love this cat food . Since I changed to this my cat 's litter box does n't have to be cleaned but once a day . Before I was cleaning it several times a day .
5 #### My pit mixers love these ! They 're a great size treat for good behavior or bedtime . They 're not too small but not full size either . The dogs do n't eat grain and they love all flavors of these ! I must say they even have an enticing aroma for humans :) Great value for high quality product .
5 #### My dog loves these biscuits . This is a reorder
4 #### Only con is that two of the corners have a sort of ridge that makes it hard to scoop in this area . Other wise they are good . Easy to clean and fit well in the area I use for a cat bathroom !
5 #### What more can I say , except it 's big enough , it 's strong enough , and it cleans well . I have two of them to switch off . Great buy for multiple cats .
5 #### Big , deep enough . Good for larger or multiple cats .
4 #### Too hard for them to actually CHEW on . . .
5 #### Purchases nylabone dental dinosaur for 3 month german shepherd . Came in as pictured . Since he is teething this chew toy works well . He takes it with him into his crate .
3 #### A little too big for our 10 lb Pomeranian , who is usually an active chewer . We donated it to a larger neighborhood dog who seems to love it .
5 #### The dogs love this toy . It is a hard plastic toy for chewing or when a dog is teething .
5 #### My dogs love these and they really last . I got 2 so they would n't fight over them . It 's the luck of the draw on what shape you get .
5 #### Awesome design , the durability of nylabone .... just do n't step on these , worse than stepping on Legos !
5 #### My koi love this food , and will not eat wardley 's version of pond food . My wallet likes that it is about 40 % less than buying locally . My cat will run from 1/2 a block away when I feed the fish , just to get a few pieces . I think this is cheaper and healthier than the treats I feed her now , and she prefers Koi Vibrance over her normal treats . Both of my dogs love this stuff too , have to keep them inside while I feed the fish , or they 'll swim for the pellets . No ... I have n't tried this myself , but could because it is made with human food grade ingredients . Versatile stuff , excellent prices , no reason to buy anything else anywhere else ...
5 #### Great deal on fish food - convenient resealable bag -
4 #### cats love it . The price is so good that I ve put off trying to make them vegetarians tho I do feel bad about the critters .
5 #### My cats diet is solid food . I bought this as a treat for him as he gets a little grumpy when we bring the dog in from long walks or trips to the park . I figured a spoon full would make a decent treat and each can would last about a week . At first my cat looked at me like I was nuts and he was n't overly fond of the stuff . I thought that I would end up giving it to my friends who have a ton of cats as it would n't go to waste at their house . in the meantime I still kept giving my cat a spoonful every time the dog got to do something fun . My cat now loves this stuff and i m ordering my second 24 - pack . Highly recommend .
2 #### tried the shredded type first and the cats would not touch any of the three flavors sooooo i tried the Pate type and they disliked these 3 flavors toooo . i sure was disappointed because the subscription price and convience is so nice --- but if the cats wo n't eat it --- the subcription had to be cancelled . i gave it 2 stars because of the convience and price of the subscription service .
5 #### I bought a case of it because we were having a major snow storm and we were running out of cat food - same price at the local grocery stores but so easy to just buy it online . All the cats loooove it !
5 #### This critter serves several purposes . First , as my cats will point out if you sit on the box you own it ( cat rules ) . Second , when the box is empty , and if you are big enough you can be stuck in it . This tasty meal in a pop - top can , reminiscent of C rations takes some strength and skill to open so you will not hear the sound of lids pealing back in the middle of the night and cats slurping the juice . Some cats rub on the hand that opens the can . Others wait until you are out of sight before you hear them devouring the tasty can innards . Bottom line is this product is part of a balanced diet and has yet to encounter any detractors .
5 #### My cats love this cat food ! The package arrived on time , and in good shape . I checked the expiration date immediately , and there was plenty of time left to use this food . This cat food has plenty of protein for my kitties . The food was delivered to my doorstep . I will certainly order again . Good job !
5 #### The cats love it , their coats are shiny , and the litter box is less full than when we feed them the cheap stuff .
4 #### Cat loves it , but the ball pops out too easy . Gets lost under furniture .
5 #### My cat is in love with this toy , and so am I. I would probably purchase the one with the ball that lights up for added extra fun !
5 #### Our kittens love it and it 's big so will be great their whole lives . They spend a whole changing the ball .
4 #### Just what we wanted . Our dog has had the toy for almost a month and no damage . She can destroy most toys within hours . Kong is great for the chewers in our lives . She now has 3 , but one is put up for Christmas .
4 #### Great chewing toy . Great quality and after 3 weeks of playing with it my dog did n't even scratch the rubber .
5 #### My pup is a 120 - lb beast and she has finally met her match ! ! She has n't managed to destroy this yet , and I have it on good authority that she has spend many , many hours chewing on this . I often come home and find it buried in my couch as though it were a rawhide . Extremely happy ! ! ! I would recommend not spending money on Kong brand treats , however . They are very crumbly and Milkbones stuffed into each end worked out better .
5 #### Our 11 month old male English bull terrier loves this toy , and our female of the same breed loves to play with the toy and chase with the toy . The toy is very rugged , yet soft enough to interest them . So far neither of them have chewed any pieces off of this toy . We have used the tougher black rubber Kong bell shaped toys also . These red rubber ones are a bit softer and easier for them to play with if you can keep them from destroying the red rubber toys . So far so good with ours .
5 #### My cats love this food . I love that it is so good for them ! ! ! I highly recommend this cat food ! !
5 #### Good quality , the cats likes it very much . It 's high protein so we can feed her a little less and is helping in our weight control efforts .
5 #### This was a food my cat loved . However , there had to be something wrong with this batch . It is the first time I purchased a case and the first time I purchased it through Amazon . He would not eat a morsel of it . In fact , he would rather starve ! So I am now sitting here with 10 unopened cans . Do not buy this product from Amazon .
5 #### My cats LOVE this food and it 's grain - free - I have one kitty that is grain - sensitive and all 3 eat it ( too hard to separate their food ) and ALL of them are in better health . They have been eating this for over a year . They wake me every morning meowing like crazy until they get their breakfast . They have glossy coats and vomit MUCH less and when they do it does n't stain the carpet because there are no added dyes to it . I wish I 'd switched them to this years ago . I have n't had any problems as others post about dented cans or runny food and it always seems to be the same consistency when I order it . I will say that NONE of them ( all 3 of them ) like the chicken or turkey flavors - when I bought them I had to mix them about 1/3 with one of the others that 's a combination of two meats . Neither of the 3 would eat chicken or turkey by itself . They like the ones that are a combination of two meats - beef and salmon is their favorite . One did n't like beef and chicken at all . I mix two of the combinations half and half and everyone is happy .
5 #### Our cat kept peeing next to his litter box and it was driving us crazy ! I purchased this box thinking maybe he needed a larger one . I left his old one out too just in case , but he took to this one right away and he 's stopped peeing next to the box . I still have both boxes out and he occasionally uses the old one too , but mostly this new one . I might order a 2nd so he has these two larger boxes to use .
5 #### This is an excellent litter pan . Large for one of our large kitties . Easy to clean . High quality plastic .
5 #### Great size . Very sturdy . There was a tussle in the kitty queue to see who would get to " christen " it . Haha !
5 #### This is exactly what my twins wanted ! Its pristine and matches the hood I have , perfectly for my twin cats privacy .
5 #### My cats love this cat food I buy it almost monthly on subscribe and save .
4 #### Good quality food , but my cat did n't like the large kibble size and would n't eat it . We had to switch back to a different formula , but like Hill 's .
5 #### highly recommended for dogs with sensitive tummies . my puppy loves the taste . he actually performs his tricks before I tell him to as soon as he sees the biscuit .
5 #### My pup loves these , I usually use them for training or stuffing into kongs .
5 #### I 've been using these for a few years now . I have SIX Golden Retrievers , ranging in weight from 75 lbs to 120 lbs . They all love these , and we 've had no issues from them . In fact , they are a big factor in helping to keep their teeth clean from tartar ( they have very healthy teeth and gums ) . Gum disease is serious for dogs , and these Nylabone Dino chews are a key part of my pups having a healthy mouth ( and clean smelling breath ) . The pups that chew on these more than the others ( in my pack ) , have the cleanest teeth . The ones that chew on them a bit less , require me to clean a bit of tartar off every 6 months . As with any new items I give to my dogs , at first they only got them while I was right there to monitor . It did n't take long for me to know that I did n't need to do that , and that this was safe for them . I keep a few extras on hand to replace the ones that are chewed down . Just getting ready to place another order of them .
5 #### Our dog loves it and it keeps his teeth clean . Great for dogs who swallow those denti sticks whole
3 #### Not my favorite Nylabone . My dog does like the taste and texture , but there are too many parts to wear down and break off .
5 #### This is great for cats of all ages . We have one for our resident cat that used to always scratch our carpet and now he loves using this . Our foster kittens also love it and the center piece is replaceable which is great for sanitation between fosters .
4 #### Fish eat it right size and they pop up to feed so they like it really well and is sized right for medium sized goldfish , koi and Shebunkins .
3 #### I thought that this was Tetra Pond Sticks and not Vibrance Pond Sticks . The fish do n't like it !
5 #### Good for the cat . My chubby cat who was eating fancy feast kibbles had slimmed down . It does not smell as good as fancy feast but seems to be healthier for the cat . Both cat eats it without spitting it out like they did with the Wellness .
5 #### My cats love this and price was awesome , not sure where it came from but thank you .
5 #### This cat food is pretty good in terms of ingredients , particularly for a non - premium brand . My VERY finicky cat loves it , and I 've had a difficult time trying to find a dry food that she 'd eat , to supplement the canned food I feed her . I have n't seen a price this low anywhere else .
5 #### I 've had my cat for 5 years & when I first had him , I started him off on only dry food then switched to only wet . He has gained quite a bit of weight , so I wanted to balance his diet with wet & dry . I was worried because I 've tried to change his food in the past & he does n't take well to change . However , when I gave him Purina Pro Plan for the first time , he loved it ! He still loves it today .
1 #### Despite many positive reviews indicating that this toy could withstand aggressive chewers , it definitely can not . I originally wanted to order the " Extreme " product , but it was not available , and this one got great reviews from dog owners with big dogs ( including my breed ) who are aggressive chewers , so I felt confident . I gave this to my 75lbs three year old Lab , and he damaged it within minutes . I had to take it away so that he would not ingest any of it . I am sure it is a great product for the right dog ( moderate chewer ... and it does say " average chewers " on the package - I guess this should override reviews ) , but do not be deceived by reviews , this toy is not for big chewers . Go with the " Extreme " products only if you have an aggressive chewer !
2 #### Our 130 # rotty chewed it totally up in two days ........ need a much harder one next time ...... not for strong aggressive chewers .......
5 #### I should own stock in these , they never tire of them and they are one of few toys that last a long time .
5 #### Have mastiff & this is one of the few toys that can survive his jaws . Very durable & long lasting .
5 #### Another really good product by Wellness Core Grain Free .
5 #### Both of my six - year - old cats seem to prefer this food over most other brands , and over other flavors of Wellness . One of them eats it straight up , and he does so with gusto . The other has to have medicated food ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Royal - Canin - Urinary - SO - Moderate - Calorie - Morsels - in - Gravy - Canned - Cat - Food-24 - 3 - oz / dp / B005XY2WM2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Royal Canin Urinary SO Moderate Calorie Morsels in Gravy Canned Cat Food 24/3 oz</a > ) , which he is not fond of , so I mix a rounded teaspoon of this food into each serving , which adds enough appeal for him to stay at his own bowl instead of stealing his brother 's . A 12.5 - ounce can lasts us about three days , under these conditions . I mix water into it for both cats , so between the wet food and the added water , they hardly drink from their bowl or fountain at all anymore . Their coats are shiny , they seem well hydrated , and they hardly ever puke . And I feel pretty good about giving them this stuff , because it contains far less garbage than a lot of other cat food does . It 's probably way more healthful than what I eat . . .
3 #### My cat used to love this . It 's people - grade food , very safe and fantastic moisture content to keep your kitty healthy . Unfortunately , my cat just plain does n't like Turkey & Salmon any more . Nor does she like the chicken formulas . I do n't know if the ingredients have changed over the past 3 months , or if our kitty ( older ) has just decided it 's tasteless or boring . IF you decide to feed it , and IF your cat likes it , you ca n't go wrong . I used it for years before this recent bout of " Meow , I do n't like it meowwy much . "
5 #### My cat loves this stuff and it 's very convenient to have it delivered to your door ! Also cheaper than buying it at a pet store chain .
5 #### Arrived in good condition and my cats love it !
4 #### This is the only cat food my cat will eat , unfortunately . I like that it can be delivered and the price is right most of the time . I would have given it 5 stars except for the price that is not always the same . And over time it has increased more than I would like . I guess he likes it so I will continue to buy it .
5 #### The Nylabone is indeed durable . This beast is made out of very hard plastic , not rubber . This is the first toy I have bought in six months that has lasted over a week with my GSP . It does get a bit sharp as he chews it , but he has never been injured . He spends time with it almost every evening . Totally worth the money . I will buy another when this one finally goes .
2 #### After a little bit of chewing , this toy developed sharp spots and started breaking apart . After I started finding bloody spots on it , it went straight into the trash . My dog did seem to like it , and dinosaurs are awesome . But if sharp plastic shards and bleeding gums concern you , avoid this one .
5 #### My Labs take turns chewing on this . They love it .
5 #### All of our cats love it ! from young to old and feral to tame , someone is always playing with them .
5 #### I have had this for over a year and my cat continues to play with it daily !
5 #### Great toy to place Catnip on . This toy with have your cats scratching this and not your furniture . Loved it so much bought my son one for his cats too
1 #### Not only is this not giant , it 's really flimsy .
5 #### This is a nice big cat litter pan . The edges are very high so it minimizes the amount that gets kicked out when your cats are burying their business . Would buy it again . Absolutely a steal at this price ( ~8 $ ) .
5 #### I use these all the time for my dog
5 #### I have always watched the ingredients on the products I buy for my pet . I have had pets with epilepsy , one with diabetes and one with a rare skin disease . I am determined to give this dog / pet the best of everything to hopefully insure a long healthy life . I do n't regret for a moment looking after my other pets but truly hope being picky will give a longer heather life . They are just too hard to loose ! I searched for healthy ingredients and Nature 's Variety was perfect for my pet . No salt or sugar added . Natural ingredients and oven baked . The BEST part is I can read all of the ingredients ! Shipping was quick and product came as whole biscuits and not broken . I love this quote from the manufacturer : ' We stand behind our products with a 100 % satisfaction guarantee ' .
4 #### These smell so good I want to taste them !
5 #### This is the 3rd flavor I have tried ( I usually buy whichever one is cheapest . ) I like that they are healthier for our dogs . The dogs love them ( no surprise there . ) This is a reasonably priced treat that I feel good giving our pups .
5 #### My dog has food allergies and these are great for her -- no tummy upset or itching . Very nice size for small dogs . I got it at the add on price , which was very affordable . Highly recommend .
5 #### The koi and gold fish love it ! Noticed deeper reds after weeks of feeding . Floats better than most pellets and is easily eaten by fish 3 to 4 inches in size or larger . The sticks are a bit small for some of our larger koi , 18 + inches .
5 #### my cats actually play with this daily and its good exercise too i think its the smooth surface that makes the ball go really fast and the wide center .ive given many away as christmas gifts love it blaze
5 #### Bought this for my youngest cat , he 's not a year yet , he loves it , sat in the middle & swatted at the ball
5 #### It makes my pittie happy . I think he lost it though . He was happy , until he lost it .
5 #### My pitbull pup loves this toy , she 's 7 weeks and really does chew this . Its not flimsy and it ca nt be ripped up . Her teeth are pretty needle - like haha and this toy has the feel and weight of a bone except its pointy which helps pups . Strongly recommend this .
1 #### Much to hard . If it dropped on your foot it would hurt it . I took it away after a few days . I was so very hard , it was impossible to chew . I was so surprised with this dog toy . It 's impossible for any dog to chew this toy . It 's in my junk drawer now in case any of my friends want to try it with their dogs but I do n't think so ! !
5 #### My baby loves her nyla bones . They 're pup pacifiers .
5 #### My dog loves this toy . He is a corgi / german shepherd mix and destroys toys in seconds . So , it is quite a relief to have nylabone products that can withstand his chewing . Dirt and grime can get in the grooves so I would wash it with mild soap and an old toothbrush .
5 #### i fill it with peanut butter , kibble , bits of hotdog , or whatever dog safe food i have lying around 10 month old Black lab puppy at around 65 lbs can chew on it all day and not damage the rubber
3 #### Pro : nice & flexible , my doggie loves it CON : Ca n't let your dog alone with it unless you are SURE how much they chew . I have to supervise my pup or she will chew out chunks of it ! She shredded the edges after a few days , taking out small chunks - even with nothing stuffed inside as an enticement !
5 #### My 8 cats love Purina Pro Plan dry cat food . This is a premium cat food that I 've been feeding cats for many years .
5 #### Purina Pro Plan really did make a difference ! We noticed how are cats began to show a softer , shiny coat within a week ! It is all we purchase now !
4 #### These litterpans are nice and large . I found that it is necessary to use a liner with them . Perhaps most people use the liners because I did not see comments about the problem that occurred without the liner , ie , liquid sometimes leaked through the bottom . When I added a liner , it did not happen .
5 #### This litter box is nice and deep we have had cat litter on the floor of our bathroom until we bought this box . At night I do n't like walking with my bare feet over litter box tidbits . We 've had far less litter on the floor now . Like it very much , made very sturdy . Would buy again
5 #### That 's one big litter box ! My kitten loves it ! ! Highly recommend it ! !
5 #### i love these pans and so do my cats . They clean up very well and they look nice . A great buy !
5 #### My kitty loves this .. less expensive than my local pet store .. delivered !
5 #### Great food ! ! ! ! ! Recommended by my vet and Amazon price is better than my vet office .
4 #### Since the kittens need special food , this is fine . But they grew tired of the taste , I guess , after several weeks . Eventually I had to switch .
5 #### This review is for the ( pack of 12 ) 12.5 oz cans of chicken flavor . My sweet , elderly cat loves this food . I just wish I had stopped feeding her dry food much sooner . I started feeding her Wellness Grain - Free canned food about a year ago and I 'm convinced that 's why I still have her with me . She rarely vomits anymore , which she used to do daily . Her fur is very soft . I highly recommend this cat food ! !
5 #### Our Kitten love it ! We were feeding our new kittens a much lower quality food . We noticed additional weight gain and they seems to beg for food constantly even though the old can contained twice the volume of food . Now we upgraded to Wellness brand after learning that it was one of the best quality foods on the market . No more fat pouch , no excessive begging and they love the taste . One can per cat per day . Kittens are now 3 - 4 months old .
5 #### We have four kitties . One with diabetes , so he needs Grain free food . Another with food allergies so turkey is perfect . All four love this food , and it is high quality . Much research went into finding a good food , and we trust the Wellness brand .
5 #### If you have kittens or young cats you need this . They entertain themselves with it and love the scratching pad . Spin it fast and the attack it . It was a good purchase .
4 #### Our Kiki Kat wore out the last Turbo scratcher cat toy she had , so this replacement was her Christmas gift . The new one is pink and Kiki loves pink , so she 's very happy about the new color . The label that was attached to the toy indicated that it came with catnip . Since the toy came wrapped in cellophane , we knew the catnip must not have been included because it was missing from the package . Kiki was not happy about the missing catnip . Catnip is her favorite thing about the scratcher part of the toy . If we have it , we usually put some catnip on the corrugated wheel and she rolls around on it before getting real excited about the rolling ball . This is one of the very few toys she will continue to play with over and over . She loves hitting that ball around and around .
5 #### Our cats both love this product . We sprinkle catnip on it and one cat regularly sleeps on it . They play with the ball only occasionally but they love the scratching pad .
5 #### The best toy / scratcher you can find out there . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Our puppy has been chewing on this since the second we got it .
5 #### Still have this one around the house , my dog does nt personally like it , but I can see it as being a good toy if your dog likes it . Fees cool to hold too .
5 #### Great toy . Made my dogs mouth bleed a little bit , but probably good for hiss gums
3 #### My dog ( and therefore I ) loved these treats when we first got them , and for the price / quality they could n't be beat . I could break them into smaller pieces or give whole . Added them to my subscribe and save which is a great option , but then second bag arrived and the treats are super stale ! So hard my large dog can barely chew them . What happened ?
2 #### In all honestly my dogs seem to enjoy spitting these out .... Update , dogs seem to vomit this up now after consuming them . Have been trashed . Not a great product at all .
5 #### We have four cats and all are just over 15 years of age . We use Purina Pro Plan dry cat food along with their Purina Pro Plan wet cat food . Additionally , we use another wet and dry cat food for renal health . 90 % of cats die due to renal failure of their kidneys due to high levels of protein , which does not work well with older cats . By using Purina wet and dry for our older cats , it gives lower protein content with great flavor and palatability for their entire feeding program . I recommend both Purina Pro Plan adult wet and dry cat food for older cats to protect their kidneys for longer healthy lives .
5 #### Good price These kong products do not break I have three medium size dogs They enjoy playing with them . Good buy
3 #### It is OK and seems to be long lasting . It took a while for my dog to get used to it and now he likes it more .
5 #### Amazon has the best prices on these , some about 1/3 of Petsmart price for same product . we have 2 yellow labs and they love it , younger 1.5 year old pup chews on it all the time . Great .
4 #### We have n't figured out what kind of treats to put in this one . Everything we 've tried falls right out , but it is well made .
4 #### this product came just like described . i was very satisfied with the speed which i received this item . i recommend this to anyone .
5 #### Cat 's love it , will need to buy a new one soon .
3 #### Cats were a bit indifferent to this ... sorry to say .
4 #### These are nice and big ; however , they do n't lay flat and spin around when I 'm trying to scoop or cleane them . Not sure why the are bowed on the bottom ? I use pellet litter and it still does n't weigh it down to flatten it out . For those of you looking for LARGE litter boxes , these are large ; however , if you have a standing kitty I would suggest buying the puppy pads and overlapping 4 underneat this box . That 's why I do for our hospic foster who is lame in her back legs and ca n't squat . She actually thinks she 's getting it in , but she 's not . The puppy pads catch what shoots over the sides without any damage to floors or carpets .
5 #### They are plastic litter boxes . Easy to clean with soap and water , and our cats seem happy with them . Not sure what more to add ? The price was right .
2 #### Not really clean this is a nice quick chez buy if you have kittens multiple cats but not long lasting
1 #### My cat has been eating the chicken and herring formula for years . And it makes me crazy that 85+% of the time , he loves it . And then I will get a shipment and he will not eat it . A couple / few years ago I stopped buying it from Amazon thinking maybe they were storing in a hot warehouse or something that was causing it to go bad , it definitely had a different look to it . I found it at a local privately owned pet supply store , and it was great . When they closed their doors I had a hard time finding it nearby so tried Amazon again , and it was fine for awhile . And then this most recent batch I got , this time in the smaller 3 oz cans , he sniffs it and then looks disgusted and walks away . I read another review saying it seems to have something to do with which plant manufacturers , my stamped code on the bottom of the can is 7WCHC1 . I will have a hard time finding another food that he likes , he is not one for change . But I do n't feel comfortable feeding him this food when it is so inconsistent , and I do n't know what is causing the difference from shipment to shipment . Is it harmful ?
5 #### I have a kitty who is allergic to many many things and since we 've been buying this Wellness food , she 's been fine . It is the only food we 've been able to find with none of the ingredients she 's allergic to . Hoping they never change the formula on it !
4 #### Once the family tasted this one , I do n't serve anything else .
5 #### Our vet recommended this food for our cats . They love it !
5 #### Very good for our little boy Homer . Even though it is expensive I will continue to feed it to him . He has a Hole in his heart and is now 2 yrs old . He has been eating Science Diet since he was able to eat solid food .
3 #### It is an OK food , RICE based . Some cats like it , ours did not . Passed the remainder on to friends whose cats loved it .
5 #### Both cats love this and they look healthy . Spent a lot of money on special , expensive food but neither of them would eat it .
5 #### I have 2 cats and have been looking for a replacement food for royal canin maine coon since they cheapened it down quality wise but not price wise . My big cat is a picky eater I have tried a bunch of high quality foods to no avail . But when I put this done they took right to it .
3 #### I gave this to my lab mix , she starting breaking pieces offin 45 minutes , not recommend if you expect it to last !
1 #### We have had a regular , large size red Kong for months . It 's still going strong . We put a medium size Milk Bone in it and he loves it . He 's now fully grown at 70 lbs and I figured I 'd upgrade to a bigger size and get some teeth cleaning done at the same time . NOT an upgrade ! Short version . I put a large Milk Bone in it . I 'm in the room with him and I look over and see him with his head up proudly looking at me chewing , but the Kong is on the floor . I figure he got the bone out of it already , but there is no crunching . Turns out he 's eating a piece of the Kong and there are other pieces missing that he must have already swallowed . I do n't know how dangerous that could be but it seems pretty bad . What if I had left him alone with it . The story ends ...... Ten minutes from Amazon package to garbage can .
5 #### This is a good product . Durable . I was n't able to find a suitable snack for it yet to have it fit perfectly , but my dog still likes to chase it and chew on it , and so far this is the only toy that was n't destroyed in 1 day .
4 #### My dog likes to chew on this toy but does n't really like anything put in it so I 'm disappointed with that aspect of it . I could have just got a regular chew toy . It 's held up nicely to a pitbull 's jaw .
5 #### Our dog has had this toy for a couple of weeks . He 's pretty tough on toys , but this one is holding up great . And , he loved it from day one . Great product ! ! !
5 #### I was surprised that our 11 month old cat played with this as much as she has . She is so funny to watch as she lays upside down and bats ball around .
5 #### This is GREAT ! My cat is so finicky about toys , rarely likely them , but immediately took to this and loves it ! We sprinkled some catnip on it for initial attention . He s a larger cat , I kind of wish we had found a bigger one bc he sits ON THE THING , and spins in circles chasing in , so cute ; by the size does nt seem to bother him ! Great buy , so far seems well constructed !
5 #### my cat 's favorite toy ! i put it down and she immediately started playing with it . she has torn up the inside part so i flipped it over . you can buy replacements at walmart once they get really torn up . overall , a great toy !
5 #### My Maltese and Chihuahua love these ! At first it was only my Maltese that ate them , but once my Chihuahua tried it she Devours them ! The only problem with ordering through Amazon , they do n't protect them during shipping and a lot of them are crushed .
5 #### my dog loves these s. there a softer bone and easier for him to chew . he is 13 years old .
5 #### Excellent dog food and treats for dogs with allergies and skin problems . Highest quality ingredients and free of the major allergens like wheat . High recommended .
3 #### My dog was n't wild about these . He likes sweet potato treats better
5 #### Best healthy dog treats . My dogs usually do n't like healthy things just like humans we like the junk food but my dogs love all of the different flavors . I only buy these treats for him and he never complains .
5 #### Another great item by Nylabone . I have had their products for decades and my dogs love them and most of them ( them , the one 's that are designed to ) last basically forever . With their products you get your money 's worth .
5 #### Perfect for my aggressive chewer ! He ca n't get enough of this toy .
1 #### It is way too hard . my dog gave it thumbs down .
5 #### very durable and indestructable . perfect for my puppy with razor blades for teeth .
5 #### held up well , and I think it really does clean my dog 's teeth .
5 #### Our older water guzzling male tuxedo cat needed this box badly . The enclosed Omega ( rolling self cleaning ) model he used just was n't working for us . He tends to pee in the same spot so the urine clumps were the size of a softball rendering the Omega roll feature practically useless . The Pureness Giant Litter Box is indeed the largest litter box I 've ever seen , with approximately 1/3 more space . Very slippery as well which makes servicing quicker and easier .
5 #### Great price and works well ... especially for cats who need an uncovered box . Just would like to be able to pick the color ( you ca n't ) . We received blue , when I would have preferred green or purple .
5 #### Exactly as described and very large . Love it cause its perfect for my 2 fat cats .
1 #### Cheap , thin brittle plastic . I have always kicked the sides of the litter box to dislodge whatever is stuck to the sides . Had this box for less than a week when , after kicking it , it cracked rendering it useless ! I wear Crocs indoors for foot protection and that 's what I was wearing when I kicked the box , not expecting any damage . Have at least 3 boxes for my 4 cats , treated the same way with no damage , replaced this , I now have a higher quality , more durable cat box .
5 #### It 's the perfect size for two kittens or one cat to use at a time . I will be buying another .
5 #### My kitten is much more excited about eating this than she was about both Nula and Canidae wet food . After a few weeks , so far , so good .
1 #### Something seems to have changed about this flavor during the past two years or so . My cats always loved this flavor but about 2 years ago they began to stubbornly refuse it . It does n't matter how hungry they are , they smell it and refuse to even taste it .
5 #### Use with dry cat food . Cats eat all of it
1 #### Cats would n't eat it ; preferred dry food ( I offered both ) . Ended up giving it away to a rescue group
3 #### I started feeding Wellness brand because my cats were getting sick off what I fed them previously . My cats are healthy . I love that they are happy and healthy . I 'm glad that Amazon has this product available for purchase . I 'm able to buy several months of food for my two fur babies . What I do n't like is the dented cans that are in the packaging . It makes it difficult to use a can opener on these dented cans . I would like to continue purchasing from Amazon just without the damaged cans . Three stars for the dented cans . There was a lot in my latest shipment . Very annoying to try and open .
5 #### They eat it and the vet does n't fuss at me . My criteria for cat food has been met .
5 #### My adult cats , who 've never met a toy they do n't hate and ignore , actually love this ( it 's a miracle ! ! ) . Although I have to admit what they love most is the cardboard scratcher in the middle . Two of my three kitties just sit on it as if they are on a throne . And , of course , make sure to scratch it up . Great product .
5 #### He loves it , but we keep losing the ball ! Haha
5 #### This seems like a great buy . My fur babies will play for quit a while with it laying on it & spinning the ball around . I have to keep catnip in it for them to have continue play .
5 #### I purchased this as a gift for my furry god son and he loves it . I am very happy because he is very happy . It also arrived very quickly !
5 #### Good quality ingredients and my dog goes nuts over them . Nice size as well .
2 #### My dog does n't care for these but item arrived fresh maybe your dog will like it
5 #### My dogs ' favorite treats . I like the small size , crunch , and limited ingredients . For a while when you bought these the package would be full of crumbs but they seem to have fixed that problem .
1 #### am trying many diff treats and snacks ( most are amazon add - ons ) for 4yr old new adoptee . he prefers the moist snacks and buries most dry treats . his 1st pkg of this type - lamb and rice , went over well . but ... he wo n't touch this flavor , even to bury . out of 10 diff brands and flavors of dry treats in his morning dry treat bowl , this was the only bone left . 2 days in a row . this bison formula he obviously rates 1 star .
3 #### I purchsed to stuff treats in before I went to work . It is way to big for that purpose . If your dog likes to play with Kongs this would be great for a large dog . Mine is only 65 lbs . and he is only interested in Kongs stuffed with things he can eat . This would take an awful lot of treats .
1 #### I have read that KONG is one of the best toys for dogs with a chewing habit . I bought this item becuase I wanted to get a chew toy that I could put treats inside so that it would keep my dog occupied for a bit . He was occupied for 20 minutes ... it too him 10 minutes to get the treat and then he continued to destroy the toy for the next ten .
5 #### This will be my dog 's 4th Dental Kong Toy and I have been buying them for her for a while now . The ridges on the Kong are not as durable as other types of smooth Kong 's but I think the ridges help keep her teeth cleaner . She plays with this toy everyday and she jumps up and down everytime it 's Kong time .
3 #### My dog usually loves toys , but he could really take or leave this one . I have even filled it with peanut butter trying to get him to like it because I want his dental hygiene to be good , but he could really care less . Hopefully he will change his mind and start to like it ...
5 #### It works ! It holds in litter and poop like a champion .
3 #### Big Cats . Did n't know they would be so small bought 3 and they have been replaced
4 #### My puffy terrorist like this food well enough . I switched from Friskies wet food in order to give her the best quality I could ( aside from feeding raw . Not interested in grinding rabbit ) . Switched her off of dry food at the same time . She seems more energetic and her coat is in better condition . Also , smaller and less stinky poops .
2 #### I agree with many of the other posters . My cays love this food and the price is , great . However , both shipments arrived dented and some cans were open as well . There is no packing material on the box as opposed to other things I 've purchased from Amazon .
1 #### I have three cats that I used to feed Fancy Feast . Once I started feeing them Wellness they GAINED a CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT .
5 #### Our youngish cats love it ( ages 3 - 4 , female , indoors , spoiled rotten ) .
5 #### New to her , my cat loves it . Likes it better than her high - end moist food .
3 #### My 2 cats seem to be much thirstier with this brand than with Hill 's . Also my orange tabby 's fur has lost its smooth , shiny coat . I do n't plan to buy this brand again . There has also been some vomiting , which had not occurred before . The ingredients in the list seemed to be fine , but it does n't seem to agree with my cats .
5 #### My 2 Maine coons love this food and and are both very healthy !
5 #### this food is great for the outside cats that I feed !
5 #### I bought this because it was what my cat ate while at the vet recovering from an illness and gum injury . I usually feed my cats Purina Cat Chow , but vet recommended a dry food that is more round [ unlike Purina Cat Chow stars ] . Cat Chow is stars AND round pieces , but I can tell you from my experience while waiting for this order to arrive , that separating the round pieces for the kittie , and sorting out the stars gets very old very quickly ! ! . Cat loves this Pro Plan . He does n't really need it anymore , and does like the Cat Chow also , but likes this better , so I will probably buy more .
2 #### Not good for a 50 pound chewer ... he destroyed this way too fast
5 #### Our dog absolutely loves this toy . Normally , she favors stuffed animal type toys , which she absolutely destroys within minutes . She has been carrying this toy around for the last two weeks and working hard at destroying it with no success .
5 #### My dogs LOVE these . They 're a bit sharp if you accidentally step on them , but ... my dogs love them so I ordered another .
3 #### Cool dog chew toy but wish you could pick which shape you got !
5 #### Per Dog , she loves the Dinosaur and it will last her a while .
5 #### I always worry about wasting money on chew toys because they do n't always appeal to my dog but he immediately starting using this .
4 #### My kids play with it more than my cats . The cats do n't play with the ball , they just lay on and rub themselves all over the surface . ( I have n't even added the included catnip yet ) . Construction though seems to be good and durable . A fun toy for the cat that seems to grasp what to do with it !
4 #### Decent cat toy . Reasonably good construction . My only complaint is that the ball in the track does nt move as rapidly as other similar toys I ve seen . I m getting at four stars because everything works OK , if the track with smoother and the ball rolled more swiftly , It would have five stars from me .
5 #### Both of my cats love this . I sprinkle a little catnip on the corrugation , and they rub against it . My smaller cat sits in the center and bats the ball around herself ( it occasionally gets stopped by her tail , but usually goes all the way around ) . Love seeing them play with this .
5 #### This is the product I 've been feeding my Koi over the past few years . They gobble it up , it floats and does not sink to the bottom and is good for all pond - style fish . Amazon has the absolute best ( lowest ) price I 've found and combine that with Amazon Prime free delivery means no more trips to the expensive pet store .
4 #### My dog gets a little bored with this but I put peanut butter in it and freeze overnight and its a good treat . Plus , he is a heavy chewer and has not destroyed it yet .
5 #### Kong makes the best chewable toys ever . Got this big one by mistake but my little doxie takes it on likes he s a big dog . He just luvs it at night as I stuff it in the morning with raw veggies with an added treat hidden inside , put into the freezer . He will tell you when its time for his frozen treatie after our dinner . Kong is King !
5 #### We purchased this dental Kong version as an alternative to our dog 's regular Kong toy . We stuff either this or one of the other Kong 's for him each day and give it to him when we leave for work . The large size is perfect for our 60 lb . American bulldog / lab mix . He will get it to play with and chew at other times of the day . So far , after two months , it has n't worn out or fallen apart . He seems to enjoy it just as much as his regular Kongs . It favorably compares to other Kong products and it 's a good value for the price .
5 #### Our 5 month old Weimaraner loves this - to chew on , to fetch and to play tug of war with when we run a rope or some old socks through it .
1 #### My dogs were not interested in this toy at all such a waste of money . It 's really hard and spiky and my dogs hated the texture and these were n't cheap -_-
3 #### I would nt get again for my dogs . They are pretty intense chewers and by the first day , they bit the head off . The body and tail stub are still intact so it keeps them busy
3 #### This has been able to withstand some chewing , but my bulldog is not a fan of it .
4 #### I bought it because it was cute , my dog loves it because he can destroy it . After an hour he had the head chewed off , but the body is holding out to some very aggressive chewing . The price was reasonable as well .
3 #### Had to throw this chew away after a few times-- it seemed to splinter
3 #### My chihuahua steered clear of this toy . But , my daughter 's pit bull mix fell in love with it .
5 #### This toy is missing in action ! ! My little guy - dog of questionable parentage - grabbed this toy from my hand and proceeded to chew it for over an hour . It hung around the house a few days then disappeared . I think the Dinosaur crawled away to escape the inevitable . I would recommend this toy for training dogs or pups to chew on toys not shoes , furniture , etc . It should be used for large breed dogs , say 40 to 70 lbs . [ I know most puppies are n't close to those weights , but they can grow into it . ] I would suggest this would be good for labs , golden retrievers , German Shepherds ...... that size dog .
5 #### Re - order all the time , dogs love it , plus it 's low fat ( one of our dogs has to be on a special diet ) .
5 #### Dog loves them , never had any digestive issues form them .
5 #### My 50 pound dalmatian loves these . I break them in half and use them as training rewards .
1 #### My cats used to thrive on this but the last few months something has changed . The vomit after eating it so we switched . Unsure if it is the product or cats . They are much better on Wellness core
4 #### My cat loves this brand especially the kitten chow now i m mixing this with it
1 #### PetSmart and Petco seem to have replaced Purina SmartBlend with this and I 'm not liking it . I used to be able to free feed the cat , i.e. always have food available and let him eat as much as he wanted of the SmartBlend and he always ate just the right amount to remain fit & trim . But ~3 months ago the food stores ramped the upcharge and channeled us into ProPlan . Kitty now waddles instead of slinks and I 've had to initiate a new program of doling out tiny bits of food piecemeal throughout the day . A huge pain in the butt . Sure he likes it , but that does n't mean it 's good for him , in fact it very likely means the exact opposite , like maybe it 's infused with whipped cream or something . It ticks me off when these companies have a good thing going and then they decide to " new & improve " it for more money and less satisfaction . Not happy .
4 #### Cats liked it and I like the ingredients . My 2 cats would finish a can over a day or so . They liked larger quantity of wet food , but still preferred fancy feast brand .
5 #### Kitty gained a lot of weight eating this product . She never left any in the bowl .
1 #### This is the second time I 've purchased this kitten food . The first time the kittens loved it , and I would have rated 5 stars , but this time something has changed with the recipe . The pate 's texture and gravy / sauce are different , and both kittens turn their nose up at it unless they are quite hungry , and even then they do n't finish it . They devoured the first case ! Now they will ignore the wet food and beg for dry . Very disappointed and doubt I 'll even make it through 1/4 of the current case unless I feed it to the dog . I 'm tired of trying to force it on the kittens . I will be searching for another wet kitten food brand .
5 #### my cat loves this , it has everything the cat needs
5 #### Good size and shape ! Easy to clean and get into the corners .
2 #### This is huge , much bigger than I expected , which is fine . It also looks durable and smooth . The problem is that the bottom is n't flat , so it tips like a boat . That scares my rabbits , so they wo n't use it . What a disappointment . I really wish I could return this thing .
5 #### Nice basic litter box . We needed to two because of the moving . The cats used it without any issues . Not heavy and easy to clean .
3 #### Not as deep as I expected it to be . With the sloping sides , it 's easy for kitty to kick stuff out .
5 #### Kitten loves it ! Much cheaper than buying in store .
5 #### Great value . Came in two large poly bags and was fresh .
5 #### This thing is STILL floating around somewhere the house . Durable ! They meant it . Nylabone is the best .
2 #### Nylabone * used * to have a great reputation for quality , tough products . This , we had to take away from our pup . He had it chewed to a dangerous pointy edge in no time . I contacted the company directly , thinking as they used to , they would send a new one ; they wanted me to jump hoops first ; send in receipt ; well , I do n't HAVE a printer .. send in toy ; we had that set up , but without receipt , it did n't matter . The rep was condecending and just had me frustrated . Threw the toy out for the safety of our pup ; wo n't purchase any more nylabone products nor recommend then any more as I used to do being a former vet tech and humane worker ; they lost more than ONE customer by not helping me with this dangerously made toy . Shame on you nylabone ; guess things just are n't made as they used to be ..
4 #### My three Pit Bulls really like playing with this . It 's still pretty much together after many months so I like it too ! Great for strong chewers !
5 #### Durable . If you have chewers , this is GREAT ! Hold up and is a desired toy by my dogs ranging in size .
5 #### Nylabone finally made one that my dog likes .... she used to chew on the regular ones for about 10 minutes and then never again . ( Like bazooka joe gum ) I think she likes the spikes and keep coming back to this one .
5 #### Many years ago we had a cat with kidney problems . The vet said to feed her Hills Science Diet . We have fed that to all our cats since then . They are healthy .
3 #### I am sure this is healthy as my vet uses it for his kittens . But my cats are not crazy about it .
3 #### Science Diet is good cat food but my new one would n't eat this - not even a nibble ; guess she does n't care for chicken . The bits are larger pyramid shapes which seem more dog - size to me than cat - size .
2 #### I have used Hill Science Diet cat food for years with no problems . No that they changed the formula to Chicken , one of my cats simply pukes a lot . Please go back to the original formula Hills !
4 #### The price is good , the shipping is quick but My cats do n't care for it .
4 #### My cats hates the taste so i mixed it with other Science Diet cat food . Now they both eat it witout any problems . Its also helps keep my Maine Coon cat 's weight in check .
2 #### Since Purina discontinued Chicken & Rice , I 've been looking for a replacement . They hated the new Chicken & Turkey , they wo n't eat this ProPlan version either . I ca n't keep spending $ $ for bags that I end up throwing away . Too bad Purina does n't make small sample bags so I could try different formulas . Iams offered me free samples so I 'm going to try those . I wish Purina would just bring back the Chicken & Rice .
5 #### My cat seems to really enjoy it and the ingredients seem to be top quality . There 's not much more to say .
5 #### My three cats are thriving on this food . My vet recommended it , and I was skeptical because we had always spent $ $ $ $ on food from the natural stores . In an effort to save money , we gave it a try , and are very happy we did ! We alternate between 2 flavors and the cats seem very happy . They have no behavior problems , and beautiful coats . What more can you ask for ? !
5 #### Bought these to help fill my Prime Pantry Box bc I had a credit ( of course it makes sense to spend money to save money ) . Glad I did . Dog loves them and they fit well into Kongs and wigzis ( the greatest dog toy ever that they no longer sell except for a few random places in Canada and the Midwest where they have jacked - up the price , boo bring back Wigzis ) . They are Biscuit type things so they do n't take long to crunch but add some peanut butter and or freeze and the pup is happy . They smell great although I have n't tried any yet !
5 #### I love these treats because they 're all natural and the sweet potato is great for keeping my girl 's digestive system in check ! These are her nightly treats before she goes to bed . I 've never had an issues with anything from the natural balance brand .
4 #### My parents ' dogs love these treats and this bag comes with a lot of them . They have sensitive stomachs so it can be hard to find treats to give them fairly that does n't upset their stomachs . These are very good daily treats to give them without having to worry about tummy issues .
2 #### I purchase the wrong kind . My dog would not eat them , so I gave them to a person with a dog who is not as fussy as mine is .
5 #### This brand , the turkey or chicken recipes , is supposed to be really good for diabetic cats .
5 #### I bought a couple of these at Petsmart just to see if my kitten would like them since he did n't seem to fond of the brand he was fed at his foster home . The second I opened the first can he went crazy , he could n't wait for me to put it in his bowl . He loves it ! He starts licking his whiskers when he smells the air , he licks the bowl clean every time . I think the combanation of ingredients makes it smell good to him , I mean , personally I do n't think it smells repulsive . But forget what I think , he loves it . Love that it 's on Amazon.com .. it 's a little bit cheaper than at the store . :)
5 #### My cats love this toy ! They play with it every day . Great purchase ! !
5 #### Our Jack Russell 's like to chew and these Nylabones are well received by them and last longer than any other chew toy . Be careful , after they 've chewed on them a while they are prickly to my fingers when picking them up ;)
1 #### My 8 month old Aussie reluctantly chewed it briefly and has no interest in it . It is sturdy toy but she just does n't seem interested in it .
5 #### I have one aggressive chewer and 2 that are occasional chewers . I ordered 3 so they could each have one . There is n't a nylabone they do n't love ! We have them all over the house and car ( for long trips ) . It 's definitely cheaper to order them on here than buy in store
3 #### How can you go wrong with a dinosaur nylabone ? I loved the idea but my dogs did n't seem to agree . Not sure why but they do n't play with it .
4 #### Not my dogs favorite but it has lasted 3 weeks with only a tail chewed off . It is very hard and has nubs all over so it may hurt to chew too hard , but it is lasting so that passes my test
5 #### More important , my puppy loves it ! The nubby texture and easy to grip shape is perfect for my Cavalier puppy . Ended up buying a second one for her dog cousin since they kept fighting over it . So far , this dinosaur chew seems pretty indestructable .
5 #### perfect . seems like there is some sort of coating on it or something because when they go in the corners i do n't have to dig and scrape like i do with my other litter boxes . comes out easily . good big size too .
5 #### I purchased 2 of these for our Ed and they work extremely well . Prior to these , Ed refused to use any other box except for the one that he had had since kittenhood . Unfortunately , though , he was much too large for it and was forever straddling the sides in order to go . On a happy note , he almost always had good aim . Every few months , I would try a larger box but he always refused to transition to it - until this one , that is . With these boxes , he can fully stretch out and still have room to spare . They are also deep enough that very few pellets escape . So , we are both pleased .
3 #### Its ok , but when the cat really gets to digging , the cat litter will fall out . I had to put up some cardboard around the sides to stop all the cat litter falling on the floor though . But this is good for the larger cats .
5 #### My dogs are crazy for these things . They seem to really like that there are different ways for them to hold and chew on them . First they go for the feet then the head and then on to the tail . It usually takes at least a month for them to get all the way through so it 's an excellent buy for the money . The favor the t - rex over the other ones .
5 #### I have a 5 month old chocolate lab who loves to chew . This toy is great he has gone bonkers over it . He likes it much better than the standard shaped bones . I just wish it came in a larger size , he is 40lbs and will out grow it soon . But it is perfect for him now !
1 #### Please fully read the product 's warnings ( detailed in full product description ) about how this can be used as a chew toy for pets meeting specific criteria . I copied what I feel is most important : " ... Products are specially designed for young teething puppies . They should not be given to a dog with ANY permanent teeth , regardless of age . " I am sorry if this does or does not apply to this Nylabone chew toy . My dog loved it , but I threw it away .
5 #### My Big Dog had it destroyed by 3 days . But its great for Dogs that are starting to chew because of teething .
5 #### Great price and my cats L - O - V - E this food . In fact , I need to reorder !
5 #### They love the taste ( I assume , as they eat enough of it ) . They never throw it up , and from the evidence in their litter box , they digest it completely .
5 #### My cats have been eating this brand for years . They never tire of it and I like the ease and lack of odor .
5 #### I do n't have cats- but I get this for my sister and her cats seem to enjoy this food and stay healthy on it .
5 #### Good quality item . Was n't quite the right size for what I needed ( the bottom is smaller than the top - the top flares out ) , but someone else will be very happy with it .
5 #### I love this litter box . I have a very large chubby cat . This is the only box she can fit in , without leaking over the sides . It helps from litter being kicked out when they cover up . Great price on Amazon . Will def buy again ! !
5 #### I have a BIG Maine Coon Cat and this litter box is the perfect size for him . This would also be a great litter box for other large breed cats like Savannah Cats and Norwegian Forest Cats . The color makes it easy to see what to clean . The build quality is nice . I have no doubt that this litter box should last many years , since it is being used indoors .
5 #### I have 2 large cats ( 14 lbs ) so this box really is just right for us . It is large enough for my cats to get in comfortably & no misses like with smaller boxes . It is also deep enough to fill up halfway & leave room for the cats to dig , which mine tend to do . Over all this is a great product , I 've had the first one I ordered for 2 years & recently ordered another just to have an extra box up . They really do clean easy to dump out all the litter , spray with cleaner & wipe down .
5 #### Really nice sturdy kitty box . The size is very large and would work for multi cat needs . Carefully wrapped and shipped fast .
5 #### Best value anywhere . My koi love it and are very healthy w / this - They eat so much every day this is the best way to buy it - This and Tetra freeze dried jumbo krill in the 14 oz size from Amazon is all I feed them
5 #### I have been using this food for years . Great color for my koi fish . Some are over 18 inches in length , having been raised entirely on Tetra . Well over ten years , coming to think of it , I have bought many large quantities of this food . It is very consistent , always best quality . The koi love it . They eat it enthusiastically .
5 #### These are our dogs ' favorite treats . They are a nice size for our medium sized dogs . I appreciate the quality of the ingredients .
5 #### 3 out of 4 of our doggies liked it
5 #### I have a very picky senior 12 lb poodle who is on a limited ingredient diet due to her allergies and seizures . She absolutely loves these s treats . They are also very easy for her to eat and break apart nicely which is great since she is lacking most of her teeth . They are large treats and if your dog is on the smaller side you will have to break them in half .
5 #### Small treat , tasty treat for my medium and small sized dogs . They love the treat and they tolerate it well . They both have food allergies , and eating the treat gives them no problems at all . So glad I found it .
5 #### I have 2 cats that absolutely love this food . I love that it is one of the healthier options available at a reasonable price . I am definitely willing to spend more money on quality and this is quality .
5 #### I 'm trying this higher protein canned food for my cats . I have a mama and three 4 month old kittens . They love it ! All four share a can every morning and it is apparently so filling they do n't eat it all immediately , but they later go back and finish it . I like knowing it 's a more healthy and nutritious food for them without grains . As the kittens grow bigger I 'll probably increase it to 2 cans at a time or get the large cans . I also give them a can of a different variety at night . I plan to reorder this . They like the turkey best .
5 #### My cat , born in 2008 , has been raised exclusively on Wellness canned food . At 17 , he 's showing no signs of aging or disease other than some tooth and gum trouble , possibly due to an almost all canned food diet . He does need to have his teeth cleaned every year .
5 #### This toy is huge . I suppose it says that somewhere in the description , but I did n't expect anything this big . However , my little kitten has n't let that stop her from playing with it a lot ! I guess it works for her , so that 's five stars in my book .
4 #### great - standing up to our pups aggressive chewing ...
5 #### When I first opened the package , I kind of wondered if I 'd made a mistake in ordering this , but glad I did as it 's turned out to be a favorite chew toy . She 's been chewing on this for a while now and it is lasting well .
3 #### she really not interested in this :( but it is still around that has to be a plus . not destroyed .
5 #### Nylabones are the best ! One of the only chew toys by dogs do n't destroy in minutes . Nice size for a beagle / hound .
4 #### All my cats seem ro really like it . Chicken first ingredient . Only negative I see is the " animal " fat , would prefer it be poultry fat . But my cats finish all of it ( not so with Blue Buffalo , Wellness and other brands ) . The kitten formula of Purina Pro Plan stopped the diarrhea in my foster kittens .
4 #### My cats like Purina Pro Plan Dry Adult Cat Food , Chicken and Rice Formula but they do n't love it . That is fine with me because they tend to be little chubby . Still , dry food helps cats keep their teeth clean . I am concerned with the fillers such as rice , oatmeal , and corn in dry cat foods because cats are pure protein ( meat ) eaters unlike dogs . Wet cat food is the primary food source for my cats .
5 #### Not only do my cats like this food , but a neighbors cat slinks over to swips the food I put outside for a feral tomcat .
5 #### I have a many cat home . All my cats eat this product and they are all over the ages of 10 .
5 #### My cat scolds me if I do n't get her food as quickly as she thinks I should have it served to her . She really likes this flavor of Purina . Do n't know what 's changed but , the bits do look different . I would recommend this to anyone with a cat .
5 #### I had a feeling my blind cat would love this toy . She plays with it a lot and even lays on it . I am so pleased to watch her enjoy herself . She is 3 years old . I adopted her a years ago . Thanks
5 #### One of my cats loves this , she plays with it constantly . Great toy , it gives her lots of enjoyment .
5 #### My puppy seems to like it although he hid it yesterday !
1 #### Beware . I do n't normally write reviews but felt obligated to this time . This item would be fine for a small dog , but not aggressive chewers like advertised . I have a 65 lb shepherd , whippet mixed breed 15 month old and she LOVES to chew . She has had other nylabones that have worked well for her and have lasted months . However , on her 2nd time to chew it , a very sharp piece broke off . Fortunately , i saw it before she decided to eat it . Again , it might work well for smaller mouths , but I advise to keep a close eye .
5 #### small energetic chug loves to chew on this toy
5 #### My 7 month old Pit Bull pup loves this !
2 #### I purchased this for my 8 month old Labrador Retriever after reading several excellent customer reviews . This product was also rated # 1 in dog bones . My puppy is a powerful chewer but given all of the positive feedback on the product , I ordered one for her . Within 15 minutes she had chewed off the head to the dinosaur ( I received a stegosaurus ) and I had to take it away from her . This is a non - edible chew product according to Nylabone and the instructions state that although it is non - toxic , it is NOT intended to be consumed . the instructions also state that your dog should not be able to break off larger pieces of a Nylabone non - edible chew . This was not the case with my dog . I would recommend this product for some dog parents , but if your dog has a powerful bite , I would steer avoid this product .
3 #### I bought these because they were such a good price n wanted the dogs to have something to chew on during our quiet time . They have chewed on these some but do n't seem to find a lot of satisfaction with them . Their attention span with this chew toy only lasts a few minutes . I 'm accustomed to buying chew toys that keep the dogs entertained for hours then no more chewy . Nylabone does n't qualify a real entertainer .
4 #### Pros : - Dogs like the taste and smell ! Very motivating treat . - Grain free . - Tolerated by the fussy tummy of my greyhound - Cost is excellent for a grain free treat Cons : - Strong smoke smell - Physically hard . Difficult to break treats into individual pieces , takes a while for dogs to chew up
5 #### He goes nuts for this specific treat ! The ingredients are great too .
5 #### Our dog has food allergies and really likes these treats a lot .
3 #### My dog ate it but its not like he loved it .
3 #### My dog is fussy and did not care for these biscuits . I gave them to a friend .
4 #### our dogs like them ... which is really all that matters
5 #### what a huge savings over the local pet stores . It 's a little bulky but we 've found a place to store it so we 'll enjoy the savings and convenience of not having to go back to the store
5 #### My koi 's like this food . That 's all we feed them . The bag was huge ! ! Great price too . Buy if you can ! !
5 #### Durable , and plenty big enough for my 13.5 pound cat .
5 #### I thought because this litter pan was inexpensive , it would be perfect for the patio for my two outside cats . It could get beat up , no problem . Well , this is not a cheapie litter pan . It is sturdy , deep , and if I ever need another cat pan , this will be it . I highly recommend it !
5 #### These are wonderful and I have ordered more today . Hi sides for large cats who need the room .
5 #### Both of my cats LOVE this one and gobble it up . I use this small sized can and split it between my 2 cats for morning and the same for night . Perfect amount and keeps my cats healthy and not overweight . :D :)
1 #### I wanted to give my cats the best and decided to take all " meat " out of their diets . I ordered a case of this and Oh .... what a mistake . They looked at me like I was crazy when I fed them their first meal . Although , they are now eating it ... somewhat , I ca n't wait to finish this off . The food shrinks from the side of the can and is very hard and sticky . I wo n't order this again . In fact , I have n't had good luck with Wellness Complete for awhile now . It seems when you open the can , they all seem short filled . Looking for a new alternative .
3 #### the product may be good but my cat wo n't eat it . I am mixing it with friskies just to try to get rid of it .
5 #### Let me be clear . It is not I who love this but Bob , my cat . Nothing else blows his hair back . For a while , anyway , the fickle little beast . I need to change it up with other grain free stuff .
5 #### We switched our cat to this as his dry food when he turned a year old , per our vet 's recommendation . He 's an orange tabby , and we 've noticed that he can get allergic pretty easily to foods , but this one has worked well for him .
5 #### This has been awesome . My dog continually chews it and has barely done any damage at all to it . I will definitely purchase this again when I need another .
5 #### Positive review here from owner of crazy coonhound seeking some respite from baying . Our dog LOVES this bacon flavored toy and spends hours chewing them -- yes -- them . I 've bought 3 now and just replace them when they get so small she might swallow them .
3 #### No problems with it , but my dog has virtually no interest in it whatsoever .
5 #### My puppy loved this item . i would highly recommend .
4 #### My cat does n't seem too interested at all with the ball , but she does love to just sit and hang out here .
5 #### My cats love this toy ! However , the dog has become obsessed ( without catnip added ) and was easily able to destroy the disc , so it 's perhaps best in non - dog households .
5 #### This product is a new favorite toy for my cats .
3 #### Weaning our cat off of the clearly more tasty purina one kitten ' chow . She eats this and acts healthy , but she is not wolfing it down like she does the kitten chow . We have tried four different types of adult food . This goes down about as well as the rest .
5 #### Did not buy this for my own use . Purrfect Pals pet shelter near Seattle , WA had this on their Amazon Wish List for their cats . They were running low on food so we sent this . They say the cats and kittens there do very well on this formula . So , remember the charities when you are shopping on Amazon ! It is one sure way to know that your contribution is going directly to those in need .
4 #### All the new litters of kiitties at Purrfect Pals love it ! They really go through it like it was water .
4 #### All the new litters of kiitties at Purrfect Pals love it ! They really go through it like it was water .
5 #### My dog has a sensitive stomach and new food / treats tend to give her the runs and/or gas . ( You 're welcome for that . ) I chose to buy these treats specifically because Natural Balance Limited Ingredients wet and dry foods are what she normally eats - she loves them and they do n't make her sick . I 've never purchased Natural Balance treats before but I figured it was worth a shot ... especially at this price point . They do n't smell bad . Kind of like a peanut butter cookie . They 're a nice size for a medium dog . My dog definitely likes the way they taste and they do n't upset her stomach .
3 #### One of our schnauzers loves these treats , but then again he 'll eat anything . Our other schnauzer sniffs the treats and then looks up at us like we 're imbeciles ...... she 's a bitch ... literally ....
5 #### My puppy loves them , Not sure why the 28 oz bag was cheaper than the 14 oz , but I 'm not complaining I received double the treats for less ! I will be buying these again .
5 #### My dog really liked these treats . She ate them as though they were the last food on earth . She is accustomed to more filler treats and I was pleasantly surprised that she liked these so much ! I was happy with the ingredient list and it made me feel like I was giving her not only a treat but a good , healthy snack . I have added these to my monthly subscription box since she liked them so much !
5 #### These treats are perfect for my two Bull Mastiffs one of whom is allergic to chicken .. so many put chicken by product in every type of food / treat they make .. even if it says beef , fish , etc . So good to find one that has healthy ingredients as well .. no junk !
5 #### I 've tried many fancy litter boxes and always go back to this one . It is large and deep and the cats prefer it over others .
5 #### Despite having several litter boxes for my two cats , they both decide that they must both use the same one , what seems like 683 times in the 8 hour work day . This litter box is literally giant , and has suited our needs perfectly . Now I can come home from work and it does n't look like the box had n't been cleaned in 4 days .
5 #### I foster kittens for a local shelter and feed this food to almost all my kittens . They all seem to love it and I know I 'm giving them high - quality food , so we 're all happy !
5 #### Excellent Product . Taste tested by 8 cats -- this is the flavor they ALL agreed upon . The high quality makes it cheaper than the lower quality , lower nutrition types . GRAIN FREE -- is a must . Wellness is wonderful --- Solid food so I add water ( filtered :) ) to this for a treat and to make it stretch for two days . Please refrigerate any not eaten in a few hours , but serve at room temperature to avoid upset tummies . Dry food is also given .
5 #### I HAVE BEEN USING TETRA PRODUCTS FOR OVER 40 YEARS ! I MUST SAY THAT VIBRANCE IS A WINNER ! THE FISH LOVE IT . IT IS FUN TO SEE MY FISH TRY TO ATTACK SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST TOO BIG FOR THEIR MOUTHS . BUT THEY SOMEHOW DO IT . I HOPE THEY KEEP IT UP ! ! I AM WAITING TO SEE HOW BIG AND COLORFUL THEY BECOME . THE PRICE IS SO REASONABLE FOR OVER 5 POUNDS . IT SHOULD LAST ME ALL SUMMER .
4 #### Fish it and it works like it suppose to . The one thing I did n't realize is that an 8 lb bag is huge and will last me at least two years .
2 #### Our Koi do well on this food , so I ordered several 5 pound bags to get us through the summer . However , the actual bags have changed from last year . Whereas before they were easy to zip open and closed , and had a handle built in , now they do not have either of those features . In fact , the bag is practically impossible to seal between feedings . And it is very bulky and awkward to carry out to the pond now that there is no handle built in to the bag . I do n't understand why the company would change these two features , it does n't make any sense . I am going to have to find a suitable container now , to pour 5 pounds of fish food in to , that will have a handle and that I can close properly in between Koi feedings . Very disappointed .
5 #### My adult cats have eaten this for years and are healthy , at a healthy weight , and like the food just fine . The vet seems unconcerned at the checkup when she asks us what kind of food they get .
5 #### So originally I was skeptical , I had n't heard much good about Hills . But my vet recommended it for my indoor cat , so I agreed to try . She came to me with long hair , but not much shine . She 's been on this food for 2 years now , and she 's gorgeous . She has a soft , shiny coat and great teeth . She loves her Hills and comes running when the bag is delivered . The UPS driver is her favorite now because he brings her " yummies . " I ca n't say enough good about this food . If you want a brand that will keep your cat healthy and happy for years to come , I recommend this .
5 #### My cats love it so ... that 's all I can ask for I guess haha .
5 #### All 3 of my cats love this . And I love how soft their silky coats are . One is long haired and she has the most soft coat ever . She has been getting hairballs recently though . My shortest haired cat has really fine hair but it is still very soft . All of them are at a healthy weight .
5 #### They cameth , they saweth , they eated . Then , they promptly puketh . Typical cats overeating something they really like . They did love it , I will buy again .
5 #### Yep this is a good one - my dogs love them - the dinos are so unique - everyone wants to know where I got them . This vendor is great - totally satisfied - package arrived earlier than expected - well packaged -very very satisfied .
5 #### Amazing durability . My dog could chew up anything and has yet to destroy this !
2 #### Love nylabones , but this just creates extra sharp edges everywhere . It means that our dog was unable to chew / gnaw without constant worry from us . We ended up tossing it for fears of teeth / gum injury . I 'll stick to regular shapes .
4 #### My 3 pugs love the nylabone products ------ and this one is no different . They love to chew and these last a long time .
1 #### This was suppose to have the ball that had lights , it did not
5 #### Jumbo cat litter pan , shipped immediately . Item is exactly as described . Thank you .
4 #### Had to go jumbo size for our 9 lb Angora rabbit , but this is just right . Cleans up easily . She likes to hang out in there , so it 's become her cozy spot . We top it with hay , so the mess in her cage is very contained .
5 #### A good size for my Ragdoll and he 's happier now that there 's more room for him to " sit " .
5 #### Its a litter pan does what it should not much else to say ...
5 #### My two , two year old cats are brother and sister and have never spent a day apart in their entire lives . About a year ago they started drifting apart , then the dominant male would torture his sister , not allowing her to be near him or us humans . I saw on My Cat From Hell that you need one more litter box per number of cats . That sounded excessive . I had one box , added one . His behavior got a little nicer towards her . Then I added another . Now they sleep on my bed at the same time and are getting along ! The first box I have is a nice large one with a full cover that is necessary because they like to kick the litter all over the place . The two boxes I added as a test were tiny Rubbermaid dish washing bins and there was litter everywhere ! This was the biggest box I could find and assumed I 'd still have to tape higher cardboard walls but after three days and many uses absolutely nothing has spilled out ! I will be ordering another one to replace the other " third " box . As far as using more litter , it does n't . The cats go the same amount and how much you waste depends on your method of cleaning .
3 #### not big enough and tried to contact seller but not successful
3 #### One likes it , and the other wo n't touch it . Oh well , not all hounds are created equally .
5 #### Perfect treats to compliment the Natural Balance LIT food I feed my dogs , and they love the flavors .
5 #### We received the product on time and we are very satisfied with the product .
5 #### As stated in other reviews , I always feed my cats ProPlan . They have excellent varieties that keep my kitties happy & contented ..... salmon is one of their fav 's ! Proplan products are excellent quality , highly recommended by my Vet and give my kitties great teeth , beautiful shinny coats with no stomach problems . Delivery is prompt and w/o problems .
5 #### My cats love this food so much that I have it as a subscribe and save auto - delivery . Product arrives as promised and I do n't have to worry about running out !
1 #### PLEASE read the first few main ingredients before buying the product . Do not look at how fancy the wordings look but look at the actual ingredients that your cats will eat . Most of these food contain- 1 - Chicken By - Product Meal -- " dry , ground , rendered clean parts of the chicken carcass . " 2 - Whole Grain Corn -- grains = high carbs = fat . 3 - Animal Fat ( preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid ) -- a tocopherol is pretty much a form of vitamin E. 4 - Corn Gluten Meal -- that 's a protein corn by - product ; it 's a little deficient in lysine , so it should n't be the only protein source , which it is n't . ( Yes , your pet can digest it just fine ) . 5 - Brewers Rice -- another by - product , leftovers from the milling process . Please consider Grain - fee food for your cat if you want it to live a longer life because grain - free obviously does n't contain grains , leftover meats , and the price is almost the same as these cheap ' craps ' .

5 #### nice item I do n't know why i have to write more to get this in , it is stupid and makes many now want to even write ok
5 #### Longest lasting toy so far ! My pointer pit mix puppy beyond destructible , but this toy is still surviving ! She was able to naw the tail as well as part of the head away , but this is one toy that she has n't given up on yet since it 's such a challenge for her . I will recommend it for extreme chewers .
5 #### My miniature schnauzer LOVES this toy . This is my second one buying ( not because it broke- because it has gotten so nasty ) He drags it with him EVERYWHERE . We have to make him drop this toy . The only downside is if you have hardware floors , this toy WILL scratch them so be careful ... My boxer likes this toy as well but not as much because her teeth are alot smaller . I would recommend it for a dog with bigger teeth . I have noticed an improvement in his gum strength . I have had to brush his teeth less since getting this toy and he LOVES it ! ! ! I can not say enough how much my dog loves this toy . Also , while crate training he used to chew his bed , but once we got this toy he has not touched his bed . If we leave his toy out of his crate , his bed is chewed again ........ LIFE SAVER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Love Nylabone , love this dinosaur !
5 #### i have an aggressive chewer , no soft toys at all . but she loves these . i have the whole set
5 #### My dog loves this product ! Ca n't really go wrong with this .... a good tip : put some puppy toothpaste on there and it 'll help them brush better :)
2 #### My puppy does n't even look at it . I do n't know why ! ! ! She does n't even care ! Bad idea . I got her some bones and she 's more than happy with that . My puppy is 7 months and it 's a Dachshund . - just saying . She should love this ! I think I was more excited to get this than her lol
5 #### The cats play with this toy every day . I replaced the ball with a motion - activated LED ball for more fun . Costs twice as much in stores !
5 #### The only brand of cat food we buy . He loves it and it has higher quality ingredients . Ca n't recommend it enough .
1 #### We purchased Indoor kitten , poor baby vomited several times post eating . He vomited so much , he started vomiting white form . Just be careful , read ingredients clearly . Talk to your vet !
5 #### My cats love this stuff ! I had a " trial and error " with several different cat foods and this was one of the winners !
4 #### My cat did n't like it , however , I " gifted " it to a family member and their cat loved it .
5 #### The cats are eating it every other meal , and I 'm almost out of the 12 cans . Best luck ever with these picky cats ! I rotate with two other foods that are not consistent , and they keep eating this Wellness product . I 'm happy and they 're fed . Mission accomplished ! UPDATE ABOUT 10 DAYS LATER : My luck ran out . The cats quit eating this with pleasure before the case ran out . What they would n't eat from their bowls became little additions to the dog 's food . There is a higher - quality Wellness label , I think " Signature Selects , " that they still go for every time , but as for this Wellness label in several different flavors , they 've lost interest , at least for now . I suspect I can work a small can in on them from time to time after they 've forgotten this formula . Cats ...
5 #### My cat is crazy about this flavor and insists she have it for breakfast every day . I love the fruit and vegis and it smells fresh and wonderful ! When my cat is sick or finicky I blend it for her and it comes out beautifully creamy and smooth .
5 #### Plan to keep getting this , as long as the price does n't go up . The big cans offer good value . Kitty loves it and seems healthier since I switched her too it . Company has a good reputation , and is a step up from most grocery - store brands .
3 #### Cat not enthusiastic , was happy when I returned to Purina DM wet food for diabetic cats .
5 #### My dogs wo n't touch this toy . I do n't know if it 's the strong odor or they just do n't like the feel in their mouths . I will see to it that another dog gets it . I think it 's a good toy . But I 'm not a dog . Thank you .
5 #### Really a great product . This is the 7th time order these Tetra Pond fish food - sticks from Amazon . It arrives in a large box with two large sealed blue bags containing the fish meal to keep fresh . Makes a big difference in color of my goldfish after eating a few weeks . My pond is 12 ft x 24 ft and somehow my fish " hear " me coming with these floating fish meal product and jump all over in anticipation - they love it . Buying this size seems the most economical way to go .
5 #### TetraPond Koi Vibrance Sticks is a complete Koi diet / food with natural enhancers . Thanks to to the producer for such a great healthy food / diet product .
5 #### This has been my Koi fish staple food for many years - They have grown big and colorful w/ this and the Jumbo krill i also feed them occasionally . Being able to get this large a quantity at this price is amazing .
4 #### These are the prefect size for my little doggies ( 7lbs and 11lbs ) . I also like them for my medium size dog ( 70 lbs ) because I can give her more than one and not feel like I am giving her too much . I also like that it is wheat free as one of my pups has allergies . The one thing I do not like is how they smell . They down right stink . It does n't seem to bother my dogs at all . I guess they might like the stink as they are always drawn to the grossest things in the yard . I have not noticed any digestive issues in any of my dogs since giving them these treats .
5 #### These are smaller than I thought they would be but my very large dog LOVES them anyway
4 #### Seems like a good product and my puppy maltese really wants to eat it . But this is a little too hard to chew and after eating half my puppy 3 - 4 months Maltese gives up every time and half of it goes waste .
5 #### Not much to say about these other than my dogs loved them very much . Would recommend to others .
4 #### My cats like and eat Purina Pro Plan Chicken and Rice - they are the ones who make the determination .
5 #### I 'm not sure how you review a cat food since you and your human self do n't actually eat the stuff . My cats like this brand and Salmon specifically . I have recently changed their food to the new Natures Balance but they seem to be having a problem adjusting so I purchased this additionally to see if I can continue to ease the transition .
5 #### Due to work , I had cats in South Africa for two months before they were transported to Venezuela . I was afraid they would n't like the new food or get sick , since I did n't have the food they were used to previously . Both cats took to the food quickly and really enjoy it . No tummy issues , but I do always recommend that if you are switching food , do so by adding a little more of the ProPlan and less of their previous food during a week 's time . I am happy becuase I know they are eating healthy . As a treat , I also give them wet food once a day . Dry food is there all day .
5 #### My cats are very healthy with this product . The hairball formula should be bought with long haired cats , but this is a good product nonetheless .
5 #### I have fed my 10 month old Maine Coon brother cats Purina Pro Plan catfood for about a year now and I love how it makes their fur feel and amount of energy they have . They are very furry cats so I usually buy the adult hairball management Purina Pro Plan kind of cat food for them , but they were not disappointed with the chicken and rice flavor at all . I did notice more hairball activity with them without the hairball management kind , so I can say that it does its job for sure .
5 #### Very inexpensive cat scratcher that comes with a ball .
3 #### I wish my puppies would chew on these , but they are too hard . Super cute though ...
5 #### My dog destroys toys very fast so I wanted to get him something durable , and he loves it . At first he was n't too keep on it but after a while , he sure loved it .
5 #### Great chew toy for strong chewers ! My dog loves these nylabone dinosaur toys and I love knowing that when he chews on them it is also helps clean his teeth . Best chew toy ever ! ! ! ! Highly recommended !
5 #### My dogs love these ! I now have them in every room of the house .....
3 #### Quite possibly my pups ' favorite teether because they can hold it upright with their paws and chew it on the t - rex 's head . Unfortunately it can not withstand my strong chewing pups and pieces quickly splinters off .
5 #### My dogs love these toys - I have to search Amazon to get them because they eventually gnaw them all down .
4 #### I like it . But I did notice that it 's more slippery than other boxes so I sanded the bottom so the cats would n't think it was a slip n slide . It also does n't sit flat on the floor , bows up in the middle so when the cat steps into it , the bottom kind of flexes downward . It 's big enough for my fat cat and really that 's all that matters .
5 #### the perfect size my cats and I love them .
5 #### The cat litter pans are excellent . They are a nice big size and easily accommodate my two cats . I recommend them .
5 #### My cats just love this food , excellent service . Thank you
5 #### Happy kitty . This is her favorite and I like that it 's natural .
2 #### I went back to buying from the pet store for 2 reasons . One , the price changes constantly on Amazon and sometimes it is cheaper in the store and two , the consistency has been very poor . I got a great batch of cans the first time , the food was firm and the cat loved it . The second time I got a lot of liquid in every can . The cat would not eat it . I tossed 8 cans into the garbage out of 12 . Very dissatisfied with quality control . I have NEVER had this issue when I buy from the store directly . It is still a GREAT product that my cat LOVES . I will just not order it from Amazon any more .
4 #### My diabetic cat loves these . He is pretty finicky and I am trying to keep weight on him . No complaints .
1 #### Ca n't order this through Amazon anymore because the food looks and smells terrible , is different from what it used to be , and my cat refuses to eat it . She ate it for a few days after my last order and had extreme diarrhea which led to a vet visit , very disturbed kitty , very tired kitty mommy , and less money in my wallet . So , no , wo n't be ordering Wellness through the internet ever again , unless they address this LONG standing issue with quality control in their wet foods ! !
5 #### Good pate style food , very palatable . Lower calories than other wellness options ( only 35 cals / oz . )
3 #### it seems as if the recipe in the past year or so has changed , it used to be chunky and hearty , now its like a watered down paste . My cat definitely notices , she used to scarf it down immediately now she does nt even get excited to eat it .
5 #### Well , really the cats love it ; I have n't tasted it and do n't intend to do so .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R1MX6PP3K8BT16 " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / D1GMw7x8G - S.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1m7EJNdL6S.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Very well made ! I ve spent up to $ 75 on a single cat toy and this guy can wreck them all . This is equal or better quality . Even Chuck ca nt pry the ball out ! This is a first for a cat toy vs Chuck If you listen to video you can hear how much he likes it !
4 #### My older cat likes to play with it , and my kitten likes to sleep on it .
5 #### Great supplier . Very quick . Our Old English Sheepdog puppy ( 40 lbs at 4 mo 's ) loves these treats .
5 #### They smell like jerky and my dog likes them
5 #### We all are trying to save a buck here and there , still to receive the highest of level in product and reliability . Well I have been using Amazon for several years now . and have never had an issue . This product is no different then the retail stores product . It is the best food on the market for your KOI .
5 #### Great reviews from Amazon saved me spending more and shopping all the Koi stores . Just starting with Koi , they 're doing great on Tetra foods . Also use for hybrid cichlids in an aquarium . They need something loaded with nutrition but easily eaten as they have difficulty with typical hard pellets . Mixed several types of ' tropical fish food ' together and added a few Growth & Vibrance Koi sticks . The Koi sticks are their favorite food , snapped up first before anything else ! Easier to find and eat than the other foods . Update 6/2/14 all the fish are doing great on this food . Good growth , wonderful color and cichlids spawning all the time .
3 #### Dogs like this but it gets so sharp after chewing on . It pulls up the thread on the dog beds and truly hurts if you step on it accidentally barefoot . Pieces are all over the place but very small that dog will pass easily . I will not buy anymore because the dog beds look horrible now .
5 #### My puppy loves this toy ! She has chewed the tail almost down to nothing ! So far safe and nothing has come off or loose .
5 #### great chew toy , we have a pitbull who can demolish any toy out there - so this one is safe for him to chew apart , and it has lasted longer than any other chew toy so far ! :)
5 #### So these things are amazing since our dog can be kept occupied instead of taking it out on the house . However these are not meant to be played with once your dog gets them ; the edges get very sharp and our dog personally uses it as a weapon . I wish I was kidding . For the item itself , it 's priced right , it does n't break and cause a choking issue . We 've gotten a few and worth it !
5 #### This is a nice large size litter box . Needed a bigger liter box for my cat because she kept flinging the litter out when she covered her business and this one she ca n't do that as easy as the other one I had . Very nice sturdy box as well
3 #### This is in no way a Giant cat litter pan , lol . I ordered it based on the description that it was larger than large - that it was giant . I have a cat on the larger side and thought this would be bigger than the large pans found in pet stores . It 's not . I ordered a large cat litter pan from amazon for $ 5.99 that is larger than this one . The pan is of nice quality though . I think it would be perfect for a medium sized kitty . I 'll be returning this . False advertising is a pet peeve .
5 #### My cat loves her giant litter box and fills it up with giant surprises for me daily . She loves to hide presents for me deep inside it . But seriously larger pan means less on the floor . very little litter gets kicked .
5 #### Sturdy plastic construction , good size for my adult cats ( one we have nicknamed , " Fat Albert " ) , urine and feces do not stick to the smooth surface , and reasonable price- basically , a home run !
5 #### Same great stuff you would have to haul out of the pet store . I like being able to have this delivered to my door . My cats seem to like this food better than any other brand , and their poop does n't stink as bad when they eat this . The small round pellets do n't crack and make crumble crumbs all over my floor .
5 #### at approximately 8 dollars this is a fantastic buy . Cat scratchers tend to be ridiculously expensive , even for the plain rectangle cardboard ones , you find them in walmart between 15 and twenty dollars and honestly i refuse to pay that kind of money for something i can make out of an old box . this toy however is great with the added interest of the ball loop . We used to own a similar ball loop toy , but it was n't as well designed as this and they cat would almost never even look at it . My three cats were all over this thing the moment i took it out of the box , no cat nip even needed . and they have remained engaged with it so far over the past couple of days so it was n't simply the novelty of something new in the house that drew their interest . I am especially pleased to see that the refill cardboard for this toy is under three dollars for a two pack . I am also intrigued at the kits they currently have for sale around 7 dollars that allow you to plant cat grass in the center instead of having a scratcher . What a great idea !
5 #### This is like a hot dog on a stick for a cat . I mean - how much fun - the scratch pad in the center for either scratching or even better - SITTING on while you chase the imprisoned ball back and forth , back and forth . Big fun ! My cat liked sitting on the pad more than playing - so my sister 's car loved chasing the ball like crazy so she got it !
1 #### The reason I gave it one stars is my cat hated it . Sniffed it and walked away . It is probably good for a non picky cat ( and if you have one of those are n't you lucky lol ) I wound up donating it to the local shelter here where I know they are not picky . I guess I will have to stick with Sheba which is all she will eat . At least that is grain free .
5 #### My puppy LOVES this chew toy ! He got the brontosaurus - I 'm hoping to get the other varieties for him , too . He absolutely goes nuts playing with this thing and chewing on it , which makes me a happy dog - momma !
5 #### My little Italian Greyhound is a very large chewer & , so far , he 's been unable to damage this chew toy . That makes it a great toy !
5 #### My dogs go crazy for the Dinosaur Nylabones . There 's something about their shape and rough texture that dogs seem to love and even prefer over the smooth Nylabones . Would definitely recommend this item to anyone with a dog who loves to chew ! My dogs seem to particularly like the red one out of this set . Must taste good !
5 #### This has been good for my puppy for teething . He 'll go to his toy pin , pick it up and go to town .
5 #### I have been buying this fish food for sevewral years in the eight pound bag . The sixteen pound bag is a better value for the same top quality food .
4 #### I have a very small pond with small to medium sized goldfish ( Not Koi ) . Another brand of pellet food was not eaten readily by the fish , and this food is liked by the fish . I wish these were pellets instead of sticks , since they are too big for some smaller fish .
5 #### This might no longer be the case on the site but if you change the bag size you might get a different size treat as well . I went up from the 8 oz to the 14 oz size and did n't notice that the picture changed from the ' smaller breeds " to the regular sized treats as the bags look pretty similar . Our young , small and medium sized dogs love the smell and taste of these NB Sweet Potato and Chicken treats . But they prefer the " Smaller Breed " size to the regular size ( the size different is about 2 to 1 in both size and thickness ) . Our dogs will still eat the larger size but it seems to be more of a challenge and also leave a lot of crumbs everywhere . While I 'm sure it 's the exact same ingredients I think the larger treats could be a problem if our dogs were older or had weaker teeth .
2 #### My cats never use this and if they do they just sit on it .
3 #### The kittens play with the ball , but do n't use the scratch pad .
5 #### My cat immediately began playing with this . He loves it ! ! !
4 #### My pit / JRT mix likes to chomp on this sometimes , and other than teeth marks it has held up . She does seem to prefer an old piece of natural bone though . Maybe I need to wash it ?
5 #### My large dogs love these . They chew them vigorously and I am convinced that they help keep their teeth very clean . But , a word of caution -- if the head or tail of the dinosaurs becomes brittle , throw them away so that your dog can not swallow small pieces . I have bought many or these dinosaurs and will probably continue to do so .
5 #### Great price . Can get sharp and make a mess over time , but this chew toy is phenomenal .
3 #### Decent chew- durable for certain but ends up pretty spikey and causes bleeding gums ( or bleeding human feet if you have the misfortune of stepping on it after it 's been worked over for a day or two ) .
5 #### My dog loves these . They are by far her favorite chew toys and among her cheapest . Go figure .
5 #### It Is expensive , but wow , unbelievable difference in my 12 yr old cats ! Have only been feeding it to them for a month , but their fur is now amazingly soft , they are not drving me bonkers begging for food constantly , and have so much more energy ( they had been sleeping most of the time prior to the food change ) , AND my daily puker has only puked twice since the change ! ! I have never believed that spending more for " quality " food would be worth it , but I am now a firm believer ! So far , they eat less and beg for more MUCH less , and less waste in the litter box . I am hoping at their age , it is not too late to keep them from having health problems as they continue to age too - except for problems with their teeth , they are still very healthy .
1 #### I suppose there are dents in cans that may be acceptable . These look like they were rolled over by a truck with cans that are so badly damaged , , no one n their right mind would feed to their pets ... especially at these high prices . WE SHALL RETURN !
5 #### good quality cat food great for cats that are elderly or need a boost
3 #### My cats like it but I 'm not pleased that the cans are almost always bent . I have wondered if that 's why I pay less .
2 #### I know this is supposed to be a good product . My vet ( at the Humane Society ) sells it and it is what they feed the rescues . But it caused my cat to throw up a lot . Cats can be difficult in their dietary choices . She tolerates IAMS much better .
5 #### I REALLY was not expecting my cat to like this . She 's not a fan of the cardboard - textured scratching surfaces , and she 's not very into " self guided - play " . She only engages when she feels like she 's hunting and typically only gets worked up when I bring out the stick with the feather on the end so it was much to my surprise that she fell in love with this toy . When I first received it she disregarded it , but after a few days , it became her favorite thing . Sometimes she 'll have marathon play sessions where she bats the ball like crazy , and other times she 'll walk over for seemingly no reason , give it one swipe , and walk away . I 've even seen her scratch the middle part on more than a handful of occasions . As a whole , even if you 're not totally sure your cat would like this , I 'd recommend giving it a shot . I 'm not sure what it is about it but it 's a certain hit !
3 #### My cat seemed to visit it occasionally and forget about it for a looooong time(never scratched on this thing though ) . But it is good to put it there so he can have some fun with that ball when he feels like to .
5 #### Good for kitten cuz old cats do n't play the ball . And the scratcher will be easily damaged if the big cats play it hard . Sometimes it is annoying if the cats play it during the night , so I have to flip it before I sleep . It takes a little space to put it .
1 #### Terrible treats , they are hard and too large for any dog to have as a treat .
5 #### These address great for small dogs .. Not too big , not too hard to eat , no tummy reactions . They say Yummy Cookie ! Their Person says YAY ! !
5 #### My pup loves them and I love that they are good for him .
5 #### Our pups really seemed to love these , great texture and size small breed dogs .
5 #### Beloved cookies for the dogs . Always motivational , always well made .
4 #### Our dog has allergies and we had put him on this type of food . We then realized he could n't have any regular treats because they all had ingredients in them that he was allergic to . So we bought these . They were a bit overpriced , but so 's the food ( that 's why only 4 stars ) . But it is something we can give to the dog and know he wo n't have skin issues after he eats them . At first we thought he did n't like them much , but now he takes the treat in the other room and will happily eat it :) Thanks for making a product I can give to my dog without him having problems .
2 #### I was eager to try this with my toy fox terrier but surprised to find the plastic was so hard . Since it does n't squeak , does n't have fur , and does n't throw well for fetch , my dog has completely ignored the thing . Good thing it was pretty inexpensive .
5 #### find that it is very expensive and does not meet my expectation . I have cancelled my subscription to the item
5 #### The fish really love this over the other versions . I 'm going to hate to switch to the winter / spring pack in a month or so .
5 #### My koi love this product and ca n't wait to gobble it up . It keeps our pond clean longer as there is less waste produced .
5 #### I feed this several times a day during the Summer to my pond Koi . They thrive on it and eagerly eat it right away . I experience great growth and color in very happy fish . I have fed this product for over 10 years and in that time two of my Koi that were just six inches long are now 14 inches long and weigh almost four pounds each ! I switch to Fall / Spring Food when the temps drop into the sixties so they can gain some fat for the Winter .
5 #### What a deal . The stray cats are eating it all up and looking sassy . Must be sustaining cat food . The price is incredible ! Again , thanks to Amazon for helping me feed stray cats .
5 #### This is the best deal I can find anywhere for my cats and both the eight year old and the four year old truly enjoy it . :)
3 #### my cat liked this food and the price for such a large bag was low enough to allow me to committ to buying additional bags for my local anumal shelters
3 #### My mother has several feral cats that come around asking for food , so I ordered this bag because it got decent reviews and is a lot of food for the money . The ingredients are not great , but it is expensive to feed feral cats , and the ingredients are better than other cheap food sold at Rural King . The problem is that the cats do n't seem to like it all that much .
3 #### My cats can take or leave this food , I buy it to mix with their pricier food , to extend it , and my cats do like a ' blend ' of different kibbles . They eat it . Unfortunately , I wo n't be buying this from Amazon anymore , the package states $ 19.99 all over it , Amazon currently has it listed for $ 37 and then advertises " free shipping " for it . OK .... ? ? ?
5 #### This is the only brand of food my cat can eat due to his urinary blockage issues . The vet was trying to give me prescription canned food that 's more expensive yet filled with by - products and corn and other crap . I prefer to give my cat this natural food without all the crap and he has been healthy ever since . He 's been eating this for years so that 's proof that you can go the natural route and still prevent urinary blockages without all the meds . By the way my vet was also recommending that I give my cat anti - inflammatory and antibiotic pills indefinitely but this food made that unnecessary . Only complaint I have is that a few months ago I bought the same food for almost 5 bucks cheaper and I really wish that was still the price !
5 #### My cat LOVES this food ! And I can see a difference in his health after just one week of switching to feeding him Wellness Complete Health . His coat is sooo shiny , extremely soft , and he has boundless energy just like when he was a kitten . I am amazed at what a difference feeding him this food made . All of these benefits are worth the extra price of buying this food . I am so pleased that it is tasty to him and so healthy too .
2 #### Size of individual pieces are too big for my 6 lb cat and my 8 lb cat too . Hills should know better by now .
5 #### My cat got this spinning so fast , he created ripples in time . Then , he threw up on it .
5 #### My dogs all really like these treats and they are a good value . I will buy again .
3 #### My little dog will eat these but would rather have soft treats .
4 #### My Yorkie took a liking to these treats . They are made with good ingredients . And , they are not made in China ; YAY ! !
5 #### What can I say - the dogs love these bones . I have 5 dogs , and each one loves these Nylabones . Love the different shapes .
5 #### Lasts a good amount of time . Takes my lab a couple months to chew it down , and he loves it .
2 #### This is really hard plastic with no give . Maybe it 's just too big and heavy for our puppy , but it 's his least favorite . Maybe better for bigger dogs ?
5 #### I ordered this as an " add on " , and was pleasantly surprised when three of my five dogs took turns enthusiastically enjoying it .
5 #### I have 3 different dinosaurs for the Rottie puppy that CHEWS . Other than Elk Antlers these are the only durable chews she will touch and not destroy within minutes .
5 #### My cats really liked this brand of food . I bought it cause I was unable to get to the store so I ordered my cats food online and they loved it would do it again and it was a good price .
5 #### I bought this cat food to help provide food for a local feral cat colony . The cats really like it and the price was right .
5 #### there is a lot of good things in this food and my cats adore it . the pieces are small so there is a lot of food in this bag . it smells good when opened and the cats love to eat it right out of the bag . it 's a nice big bag with good food and i love the large sizes with my zoo .
5 #### My cat starting eating since day one . Appears to be gourmet like it says on the bag . Looks fresh and good size .
3 #### the price and size were right to donate to humane society . My cats have refused to switch to purina or whiskas from Blue buffalo . I was seeking to reduce costs but just knew when I saw the big bag that there was no way my cats would eat it . I had thought it was fancy feast ... white cat ... gourmet ... so when I realized its just a cheaper brand than even the purina .... well . As a donation though it helps I m sure .. The dogs will eat it if the cats wont .. at my place the racoons get whatever the cats reject .
1 #### We have 4 cats who pretty much eat anything . Not one of them would eat this ! I noticed they were particularly eager for their canned food in the morning , and then I realized one cat had lost substantial weight before it occurred to me to check their dry cat food bowl ( which my older children are responsible for ) . I kept an eye on the bowl and figured out it was n't going down . I dumped it out and replaced it with fresh and even though they were really hungry they would n't eat it . I ended up throwing away the whole bag and going back to whatever is on sale at the store .
1 #### Amazon should not even carry this - even the neighborhood strays would n't eat it ! I feed it to the fish in our neighborhood pond . They like it .
5 #### Our Koi fish just love this food . We have two large ponds and we use a lot of food over the feeding months .
4 #### Who knows whether this is better than other Koi feed . For me , I 'll rely on the recommendations of those who have used it over a number of years . I also like the way it is packaged , which is airtight and very convenient .
5 #### This is a huge amount of fish food -- I was pleasantly surprised . Although it is for the season of Spring ( Koi need different food depending on water temp ) I bought it for koi that swim in spring water so they are at 68 degrees year round . It 's always odd for me to figure out food for that reason , but they got very excited when they got this food . Easy for them to slurp up and great for large koi . It does prevent minnows from eating the food if you have koi in a natural environment but I kind of like it that eventually this will soften so any leftovers do n't go to waste and the minnows eat too . This was something the koi very much enjoyed .
5 #### I always buy my food in bulk to save some $ $ . This is a great deal , and I find this style of food keeps my pond from getting certain types of algae .
5 #### i allway buy tetra pond strick one of the ony compay that makes a good sticks for my koi , itry other brands but the koi love tetra pond sticks
5 #### This was ranked the # 1 cat toy on a few websites , and it 's a HUGE hit with both my 9 month old kitten and my 11 year old cat . All I have to do is give the ball a quick tap , and my kitten comes running from the other room ! Too cute . I received the blue color , so it was as advertised .
5 #### The 2 kittens I brought home from the shelter Love this well made toy ! It keeps them interested and having fun . I really like the quality , size and color I received . Can not recommend it enough !
2 #### It did however get sharp after the dogs played with it for a couple of weeks .... finally had to throw it out cause I was worried it might hurt the dogs gums , or someone would step on it and slice their foot open
3 #### this chew does n't seem to have any kind of give of chewiness to it and my dog does n't really like it , but the product itself is n't bad , just not very enticing to my dog .
5 #### I have a medium sized dog ( king charles / bichon mix ) and he is a big time chewer . He 's been working on this for over 6 months now and he 's done some damage to the tail but still has not lost interest in it . The only " con " I can think of for this toy is that it does have a large collection of sharp points which I suppose is great for teeth cleaning but a pain in * ss when you step on it running to the bathroom in the dark at 3 am . :)
5 #### I have all kinds of Nylabone toys and chews for my dogs ( boxer and pit bull ) as well as the dogs I board , but they all like this one the best . It 's also the cheapest .
3 #### Got the T - Rex and was disappointed by how small it was . That said , I have a very large dog . 95lbs worth of chewing power ... Did n't last but a month .
4 #### Good choice good toy well made my three love it so they each have to have one . It 's pretty good for puppies as well .
5 #### My cats inhale this food ! They were on Friskies for years , but I wanted them to eat a more quality food . I could n't be happier !
4 #### I like the wellness brand and have been giving it to my Maine coon for nearly two years , she never has hairballs and her coat stays extremely smooth . Particularly though , I 've had a bad experience with the specific flavor ( Salmon and Trout ) . Normally I feed my cat the chicken flavor ( 2 oz day ) and have never had issues . For whatever reason I ordered a package of the Salmon and Trout flavor and my cat began having continuous diarrhea . I experimented and stopped feeding my cat the food for a few days to narrow it down and low and behold the diarrhea went a way . I fed her one more can and it came back , so I threw out the rest of the cans . As a warning , if your cat has issues , try a different flavor . From my experience the chicken flavor is always safe . There 's a chance I got a bad batch , or maybe it was the flavor . Also a great tip for if you cat has diarrhea , feed them rice , pumpkin ( not the pie filling ) , and boiled chicken . Rice absorbs the extra fluid and the pumpkin is pure fiber .
5 #### My indoor / outdoor cats are very healthy and active . The squirrels would say too active .
5 #### I have cats that ages range from 1 year to 20 years old . This food is perfect to have in the community bowl .
5 #### My cat is super picky about what she eats , and she loves this stuff ! It was also recommended to us by a vet , and the ingredients make me feel like I can trust what I 'm feeding my cat . Have repurchased several times already and have had no issues :)
5 #### He likes these and that 's what counts . Of course I only buy products that first meet my standards ( ingredients and made in USA ) .
5 #### We have two dachshunds , and one of them recently developed food allergies ( definitely beef and possibly chicken , so we 're avoiding those proteins ) , so we gave these treats a try -- both our dogs love the sweet potato & fish and the potato & duck flavors ! ! And we really like that our allergy dog has n't had any breakouts with either of them :) . We bought the 8 oz packages first , and they are smaller treats that are a great size for our dachshunds , and then ordered the 14 oz . packages which we discovered had bigger sized treats ( more than double the size ) . We just break them in pieces , but we did n't know or see that before we ordered them -- we 'll probably try to stick with the smaller ones going forward , but for the price ( and how much cheaper they are here than at our local pet store ) , you ca n't beat these from amazon !
5 #### Dogs love it , healthy for them and a great value for the price
5 #### Cats love moving things that make sound ... need I say more ? Admittedly my cat does nt use the scratching portion but he loves playing with the ball . He did n't use it much as a kitten but now constantly holds off with it . The only thing I wish would change is that I could select the color instead of randomly receiving one . I got a purple one when all my other toys / cat equipment are blue . Not a big deal though .
5 #### My mother recommended this toy to me because her cat played with one " all the time " . My Persian plays with it nearly every day . She likes to scratch the center as as well play with the ball , so I just ordered a refill for the center . She especially likes the ball to go really fast . I like having a toy that she can play with by herself as well as having me play too .
4 #### Nylabones are always great toys , but I wish they would tell you this is a tiny dinosaur . I got this for my two dogs both over 70lbs and they destroyed it within hours .
5 #### All my dogs LOVE this toy . I see different dogs at different times knawwing on it . It IS INDESTRUCTIBLE ! Not fun to accidentally step on in the dark though . :)
5 #### We ended up ordering several of these because our new puppy just loved it . Kept him entertained for hours . Highly recommend .
5 #### We have toys for our daughter 's little dog and she found it immediately when she came over . It is now her favorite chew toy .
4 #### My dogs shred chew toys and they do it quickly . I bought this for our newest family member , a border collie / bernese mountain dog/ golden retriever mix who was taking his chewing out on my sons toddler bed and the legs of my dining room table . This is still going strong , 2 months later . He much prefers when I come home with a compressed rawhide or filled marrow bone , but he chews and chews on this and it 's still recognizable . Money well spent !
5 #### My cats love this flavor , even the picky eater . I only wish it was available more often .
4 #### there are better foods . I started with this and its ok but I recommend hound and gatos canned food as it is 100 % protein from meat . many canned foods will add in tons of liver or kidney because it is a lot cheaper than meat . this is better than grains for sure but cats need a more complete diet and we are paying an arm and a leg for our cats food so why should n't they be using top ingredients . wellness in particular has had quality control problems . They claim a certain number of ounces per can and I 've never weighed them but I can tell you most canned I 've got were about 65 % full . with hound and gatos , weruva , bff , the cans are always packed to the brim . like I said I did n't weigh to see if I was getting robbed but I feel like it was a space waster to can 35 % air with the food and also a environmentally wasteful attitude to the packaging .
5 #### My cats LOVE this food . I bought it when it was $ 23.40 for the case of 12 . I ca n't afford it at the $ 32 , since I feed so many , but if and when the price comes down , I 'm definitely getting it again ! I like that it comes in bigger cans . Not many cat foods offer that , and it 's a shame to go trhough that much packaging .
1 #### this stuff was gross . I bought this instead of the chicken and herring by mistake . The consistency was like it had started to go bad . It was runny and disgusting . The cats would n't touch it . Tried to feed it to my dogs ( bought a whole case of it - now what was I going to do with it ? ) , gave them diarrhea .
4 #### I have two cats who are 9 & 5 years old . My 9 yr old cat liked to eat too fast and throw up his dry food , this has stopped since switching to wet . We started off on Wellness since that was the dry food we were feeding them at the time . We had used Blue dry for two years but one cat kept getting UTI 's . Occasionally we will mix in extra water into the wet . I think their coats have gotten much softer . Remember with the extra fluids comes more pee . Make sure to clean your litter boxes frequently ! The reasons for 4 stars is the price . I 'm all for feeding my animals better food which in return keeps them healthier saving me money on vet bills but this used to be much cheaper and you could subscribe and save but that is no longer an option . Please bring back subscribe and save on this item Amazon ! ! !
5 #### My fur kids love this and are very healthy !
5 #### My cat loves this dry food . His allergies seem to have gone away since he started eating science diet . Originally , he started with the indoor long hair , but he did n't really like it too much . I had to mix it with wet food just so he would eat it , but he loves this flavor .
5 #### I ( as well as my dog ) have always been a fan of Natural Balance . They use high quality ingredients and my dog has never turned up her nose at any of the treats or food she has tried from this brand . These treats were no exception . Would definitely recommend .
5 #### My dogs love it ! ! I break it into half so they do n't get too much . Healthy too ! !
5 #### I like to have these small treats around for my rescue dog who was taught to get a treat when she tells me she needs to go out . They are small and they do the trick of her getting a reward
5 #### My golden loves them - he has some food allergies and they do n't aggravate the situation .
5 #### SHE LOVES THIS TOY , HIDES THEN FINDS DAYS LATER WHERE SHE BURRIED IT , MAY DAUGHTER SAYS SHE NEVER KNOWS WHEN THIS TOY WILL SHOW UP THEN DISAPEARS AGAIN , ONLY TO BE FOUND LATER , THE PUPPY IS HAVING A BALL WITH THIS TOY
5 #### My little pitty mix loves this toy . She is 55 pounds and it is a perfect size for her . Although she has several Nyla bones , thus is her favorite .
5 #### My dogs love these chews ! I have a variety of them laying around for the pups to play with . We have really touch chewers !
5 #### My dog loves the antler bones but they are expensive . This holds her over in between and lasts for a long time . Great to alternate chewing items to mix things up .
5 #### My dog is an agressive chewer - I can always count on the harder Nylabones to last . The only " bad " thing is stepping on one in bare feet ! ;-)
5 #### My dog chewed it up and its still surving . This one lasted a lot longer then the other Nylabones I 've purchased .
5 #### My cats love this and so do I knowing it is provides them with the nutrition they need without fillers .
2 #### Sorry , out of my four cats only one likes it enough to eat most of it , one will eat some of it and two refuse to eat it at all . The dogs are n't wild about it either , sometimes they eat what the cats leave behind , other times they wo n't .
5 #### I do n't know what all is in this but my two - four legged kids never get tired of it . You can tell it 's " quality " as I see it in their coats and their waste is minimal and not stinky .
5 #### My 25 rescue cats thrive on this brand . Each time I try to switch to a less costly bend , it shows in their coats within a couple of weeks . They eat much less of this due to its quality so it makes it worth the price . To the company : PLEASE do not raise prices because of good reviews ! I use four 16 lb . Bags a month .
3 #### My 22 lb . Frenchie choaked on a large piece . I had to break them into fourths when she still choaked on 1/2 . Not an easy task since they are much harder than any other cookies we have bought .
5 #### Great product for our pet that is on a limited ingredient diet .
5 #### My dogs really like the treats and I 'm very happy with the quality ingredients .
4 #### My dog I bought these for prefers stinkier flavors I guess , these were too bland for him . My other dog loved them though , but she would eat rocks if I gave them to her as a treat haha cheaper than the pet store and love limited ingredients .
5 #### I buy this now for several years . My Koi 's and Goldfish in the pond seem to love it . They are big and fat and breed every year , pretty soon I have to give fish away to prevent that the pond gets overcrowded .
5 #### This is one of the few chewy bones that my dog did not destroy in a day . She had it for months , slowly working on it until the head and tail were gone and only the body remained . She would have continued chewing because she loved it , but it disappeared somewhere . A lot of chew toys claim to be durable , but I have found this one to live up to that claim the most .
3 #### Our dog is hard on toys . This one out lasted the others by 10 minuets . Our dog Jethro Bodine should be a toy tester dog .
2 #### We have a 40 pound 6 month old puppy who loves to chew . After one sitting with this dinosaur , she was yelping and bleeding from her gums ( all adult teeth already ) . Now she just cowers from the dinosaur when she sees it ! Although it 's helpful to now place the dinosaur in areas we do n't want her to chew / get in tothat 's not really the purpose for this toy . I would n't get it again - it 's too sharp and hard .
3 #### The ball popped out almost immediately after my cat began playing with it . I 've yet to locate it under the furniture somewhere ( with all the other missing cat toys , haha)I bought a spare cardboard insert but should 've bought spare balls , too .
5 #### My cats love this . Even Rosie , a big , sophisticated male tabby has given it a go a few times . Ollie and Lola were fighting over it . I too got the pretty plum color , in fact , I got two of that color . One is a gift for grandcat .
3 #### Made my cats barf a lot even though I weaned them onto it . Back to half and half .
1 #### This kind my cat did n't want even to try , and she loved Hill Science Diet while we were in Germany ? Apparently not the same product
5 #### My cat is the type who eats half and then leaves half . I buy the god stuff locally too . I tried this as my local health food store was closed and I ran out thinking I still had more . I picked this up locally because of the reviews and so far so good . He eats all of it and did n't hesitate too much . Will update if anything goes wrong .
5 #### I bought two of these for a humane center at which I volunteer . The cats were very happy with the product and I bought 6 replacement pads . This is a great product and keeps the cats entertained and happily scratching .
1 #### I 've purchased Wellness from the local pet stores for years and my cat loved it , she ate a lot ! I decided to purchase a case through Amazon , the price difference was better and more convenient purchasing from Amazon . I could n't believe my cat would n't eat the Wellness I thought she was sick because she used to love it . After awhile I thought well maybe it 's the cat food , she continued to eat her Chicken Soup dry cat food so I went out a purchased a few cans of Evo canned cat food and she gobbled it up , so I 'm s convinced there 's something wrong with the Wellness . Save your time and money and try another brand of canned cat food .
5 #### cats love it and product is consistent from can to can .
1 #### Something has changed with the consistency of this specific cat food . This is the only flavor of Wellness my 6 indoor cats will eat but they did n't want to touch this batch when we opened the first can . The consistency was completely different . When they finally did eat some they all got sick . I contacted Amazon and they gave a refund . I 'm now just feeding them Bumble Bee tuna and they LOVE IT . Side note : One of my cats developed bladder crystals and the vet said the only treatment was expensive Science Diet , that I would have to feed her separate from the other cats , or surgery . I researched and just found out about ACV ( apple cider vinegar ) for bladder crystals , as well as kidney stones , and have been putting a couple of drops in her tuna . Then I read that it can help reduce hairballs so we just started putting it in all the kitties ' tuna ... just a couple of drops each ... and it does seem to be helping a lot already . You have to get Bragg 's ACV that has " the mother " in it ... not the cleaned up kind you get with the other vinegars in grocery stores . I do n't know if regular grocery stores are carrying Bragg 's yet but you can find it at health food stores .
5 #### Have 2 boy cats who love this food ! Does not seem to cause any tummy upset . This is especially good for one of my cats who suffered an almost fatal bout of pancreatitis from the " greenies"'cat snacks . After that I was really afraid what to feed him , but after being on this food for 2 years , he 's never had another issue !
2 #### My cats used to like this pretty well . The last two orders seem different and they will not touch it . There are six cats voting with their feet . Many times the cans come badly dented . We will find something else since this one seems to be a waste of money now .
2 #### We 've been feeding this to our cats for 3 years . My cats used to like this food , but they wo n't eat it anymore . They wo n't touch it .
5 #### Our puppy likes to chew on his dinosaur . He has n't made much of a dent in it but he does like to chew on it .
3 #### Got this for my shiba and she never touches it . Maybe it is because she stayed small and does n't really have much jaw strength , so would not suggest for a small dog that does n't rip apart it 's toys . But I can see this as being awesome for a large dog .
5 #### Very satisfied shopper ! Awesome product , works great , just as described , at a reasonable price and received the product in one piece within no time .
4 #### Dog had no issues . They were expensive at the time I bought them .
5 #### I try to keep ingredients in my dogs ' food limited . i love having these little bones formthem in the same flavor as their kibble and canned food . They think they are special , even if they are as healthy as their own food !
5 #### very hard . I try to break it up because I have small dogs . but they do enjoy it .
5 #### Another treat that both my small dogs enjoy ! They really like the flavor !
5 #### Great healthy treat for our dogs . They love it .
5 #### No chicken , corn or gluten ingredients which is helpful for a dog with food allergies . The dogs like them and the price is reasonable . We have been very happy with these !
5 #### Early 2015 I learned that my dog had food allergies , and thus began the journey to find quality food that would n't cause my furbaby to break out into terrible skin rashes . Natural Balance L.I.T. line of food and treats have been wonderful because I know exactly what I 'm feeding my dog , the ingredients are indeed limited as well as quality , and I have so many options to choose from as I rule out which ingredients my dog is allergic to and which she is n't . I 'm still in the food trial process , but she 's responded well with the sweet potato & venison treats ... And she absolutely loves them ! ! Definitely recommend , definitely gon na keep buying them . Five stars all around .
5 #### I just added some photos to help buyers choose and know what to expect , I also want to add that since I started to use this , my newest koi have become darker in colors , really pretty red golds . not sure if they are just growing or its the food ... but ... the fish love the food and pond is staying clean too . I have a good sized pond with about 40 comets and 5 Koi . they all love this , I switched to this style food when the water temps warmed up , it floats on top and they swim all over each other to get at it . the small 2 inch fish can handle the size kibble and the biggest 12 in fish just grabs several bits in one bite . the water stays clear , I can see to the bottom , so I think this is a good food for clear water . I only put in small tosses at a time , when the fish stop looking for more I stop tossing it in . so far this product keeps my fish healthy and happy , and Amazon has the best price I can find anywhere ! I also find you can hand feed this to your fish , they will happily come get it .
5 #### Cat loves this toy and it looks semi stylish in my living room .
5 #### My Charlie loves it . He even lays on the scratching stuff to take a nap . I will hear him in the middle of the night playing instead of sleeping . I put him in the corner for 10 minutes when he does it , though - lol . So far , he has not been able to get the ball out and scoot it under a chair so I ca n't find it .
4 #### My dog can tear stuff up in a second flat but this toy was great and the pieces that they can pick off are so small they will just ass through the stool no problem . Just had to cut back the sharp edges with a scissor every once in awhile so he did n't damage his gums .
5 #### ... on behalf of my dogs here , as I have not personally tested them . The K9 family members seem to be happy , though !
5 #### I have been using these chew toys for years . Have nt met a pup that does nt like them , yet . Worth the purchase even tho it may look weird and uncomfortable to chew on .
5 #### I was afraid this toy would tear my dogs gums and mouth since it was so prickly and hard but it did not ! He loves it but he does n't chew on it a long time at once . Maybe it is uncomfortable - but so far it has held up and he is still interested in it .
5 #### My dog loves nylabones but they always look like regular bones .... not this one . so cute ! but do n't step on it in the middle of the night !
5 #### Great food . Makes a pretty cat . I believe it makes the cats smarter . Also they eat less
5 #### I believe it is from this quality food . My cat is of healthy weight and no health problems . I free feed her via a silo feeder , and she does n't over eat . There are more of the nutrients available for uptake and less waste in the litterbox . I believe maintaining your pet 's health through nutrition management and routine vet visits will give you and your pet many happy years together . And remember to spay or neuter your adopted pet .
4 #### My cats love it and I feel like I can feed them high quality food without breaking the bank . It 's worth the slightly - more - expensive price tag to know I 'm feeding them well .
4 #### Vet says it is the way to go so we spend the BIG $ $ $ $ $
5 #### My cat loves this . When you unwrap it in the box , be careful you do n't miss the catnip pouch . I find mine later on the floor .
5 #### If our kitties could type , they would tell you that they spend so much fun time playing with this toy ! ! ! ! Neither of them seems to have figured out that they could use the center as a scratching toy , but then they do have a nice kitty tower that has 3 different scratching posts . This is well worth the joy our kitties get as well as the joy I get watching them play ! ! !
5 #### Great product both cats are going wild fighting over it
5 #### Great scratcher and toy . Both my cats immediately took to it both to scratch and play ! I purchases a secons one for another room .
4 #### These treats were the perfect size gor my Pomeranian . However , he does n't love them . He actually turned his nose up when I offered him one this afternoon . I m going to give them another try and order a different flavor .
5 #### My Maltese loves these and they are easy for her to chew .
5 #### These are great , especially for dogs with food allergies .
2 #### Good ingredients but these treats or at least the treats I got were rock solid my dog had a hard time chomping on it and it he did n't seem to enjoy it .
5 #### They smell strange , which helps me know it is actual food I am giving my dog instead of processed trash .
5 #### I ca n't really tell when koi are happy , but I do know that they gobble this food quickly . This is all I have fed them for the past 3 years . Of my 16 original koi , I have ALL of them , so apparantly the food is doing its job . They have grown from 2 inches to almost a foot , and all seem fat and healthy . You should get this for your koi .
4 #### She would not put it down for days I had to take it away from her at night so I could sleep . Dog approved .
5 #### Huge hit in my home . Either as a scratcher or just playing with the ball .
5 #### My cat loves this toy ! He never gets bored playing with it . Great purchase and great price !
5 #### Another toy I play with . OK , my cats love it .
2 #### I saw the reviews and ordered these for my allergy sensitive shihtzu . Unfortunately she will not eat them . She loves the jumpin stix but not these . I tried to give a few to my neighbors dog and she wo n't eat them either . They are mostly potatoe , but that 's ok with me for a treat . So , is say they are healthy but did n't work for us .
5 #### My dogs loved the treat too . Would love to purchase a 10 pound bag like other dog treats . Too expensive to buy 10 pounds
5 #### my Golden has food allergies this is her treat . No worries when I feed her these
5 #### My 2 dogs love this treat . Good nutritional treat as I wo n't feed them junk . Crunchy , came intact with no broken bits .
4 #### This is a great cat food for my picky finicky Bengal . He ca n't do grains , a lesson that was painfully learned . He also is extremely fussy & demanding but I guess that 's my problem . We agree on this . For once . One of the cans was busted open but I think that happened in transit .
5 #### This smells so good , and my cat likes it .
3 #### Normally , this is great wet food in addition to the dry we feed our cats . However , the Beef and Salmon order I placed last time came in sort of mooshy and strange looking . Almost like the consistency was way too watery . I 'm not sure if it was just the flavor , or they had a bad batch ( I know Amazon was not selling it for a bit due to customer complaints or something along those lines so who knows ) . All the other flavors I 've purchased have come in just fine and the cats love them .
5 #### Really works well for our cats . Amazon service on this product is first rate . We have been traveling and Amazon is a real lifeline for us .
4 #### My dog loves this toy and is always chewing on it and he has nice strong , clean teeth . This is my 3rd one .
5 #### This product works great ! It works just as its advertised , what else can I say , I m happy with this purchase .
5 #### This is the second one I purchased . I have a 5 month old puppy and of all the chew toys , he seems to like the nubbies on this one .
1 #### This product was recommended by our Bulldog Rescue organization , but when we gave it to our English Bulldog , the little nubs came off in his mouth and his mouth was bloody . We threw it away . Perhaps this would work for smaller or gentle chewers .
5 #### This chew toy is very solid and has the nubs for rubbing in teething gums . Our dog plays with it a lot !
4 #### My cats love it , but I was a little annoyed because they sent me a random color and not the color I thought I was getting . Luckily , I like the color they sent me , too , but I would prefer to pick my own color .
5 #### My cats favorite toy ! She loves it . Good quaility , simple toy any cat will love .
1 #### Eldest cat laid atop it for a day or two , but neither cat show any interest in it . They liked the box it came in though .
5 #### I think this is the best cat toy ever . It 's larger than it looks in the picture . Our kitten loved this at 8 weeks and she still plays with it at 7 months . The ball never gets lost . The sound of the spinning ball entices her to come out and play and is really much less annoying than I thought it might be . We have to remind that five year old child that this toy belongs to the cat as the spinning ball is mesmerizing . It 's a big hit at our house .
4 #### My big cat likes this so very much and it spares the furniture . Periodically ( especially when he 's frustrated ) , he attempts to tear it to shreds , but it 's weathered quite nicely . It 's a 5 - star product , but not for every cat . One of the females simply finds it a nice round cushion and spends her time just sitting on it .
5 #### I have tried other brands of Koi sticks , but my kois love this brand . the bucket is huge and I fill my smaller container from this on a weekly basis . I plan to order more when this one is finished . I noticed a difference in the growth rate of my koi as well , as they have responded so well since eating this brand - they are now huge and healthy !
5 #### This product is a high quality fish food . I notice the other reviewer refers to it as " Vibrance " which this is NOT - Vibrance has a red / yellow color enhancement additive which this does not . This means that if your koi or goldfish are white that this is a better product than Vibrance so that your fish do not get a yellowish cast to them which Vibrance will definitely do . I follow a 3 food rule - which means I feed all my pets and animals 3 different kinds of food at every feeding - this variety , as long as all are good quality foods , helps to ensure health and reduces vitamin deficiences . One of the things I like most about using TetraPond floating sticks ( Vibrance , Spring / Fall and this food here which is a summer food ) is that the sticks soften fairly quickly which makes these foods more easily eaten by all sizes of the koi and goldfish . I have seen immature goldfish suck in a stick with no problem , as well as younger koi . These does not happen with many of the pellet foods which are simply too large and do not soften that much . I would recommend this food for summer feedings , not for spring and fall - make sure you choose a food that is listed for spring / fall as they are wheat based rather than corn and much more easily digestable in colder water .
5 #### I have used this product for several years now , and have used other brands as well . For all my pets and animals I follow a ' 3 food rule ' - giving a mix of 3 different foods to help guarantee good nutrition . My koi and goldfish have always gobbled up this fish food , and since it softens fairly quickly , even the smaller fish - such as younger goldfish , can easily eat this . I wish it was less expensive , but what can be done about that . I highly recommend this food for summer feedings and choose the spring and fall which is wheat based for colder weather . One thing fish owners should be aware of with this type of yellow / red enhancement is that if your fish are white , whitish or partially white , they will develop a yellowish cast to them - there are other foods with color enhancement that will not cause that to happen . I do n't care so much about that because both my goldfish and my koi readily consume this .
5 #### It came on time . It floats . They notice me , the great lunch giver who scatters yummy things . They gobble it . They thrive . Can I say more ?
5 #### We are happy to report that our Koi are happy and healthy and this particular Tetra Pond fish food is the only fish food we feed them . We have had our pond and fish for almost two years now . We will continue to use this product and we highly recommend it .
5 #### Our cats enjoy this food . Great supplement to the canned wet food they have twice a day . Love that it is available with amazon prime .
4 #### My cats I 'm not too crazy about this food
2 #### This product was a lot harder than I thought it would be when purchased . It 's the toughest plastic , with hard raised bumps . My puppy is a very heavy chewer ( destroyer ) , and seemed to really like this chew , but I took it away from her . It made terrible cracking noises , and I was afraid she was going to break her teeth .
5 #### My dogs really like this toy , there is something about this dinosaur chew that they all like it , so I got another one because they keep taking it away from the dog that is chewing on it .
5 #### This is my third nylabone purchase for a 55 lb lab . She loves them ! She can go to town and chew on them for about 9 months before the wear is so bad that large flakes start to come off . Well worth it for a dog who normally destroys a toy in 3 minutes .
5 #### I have two German Shepherds ... one a year and a half old and the other 5 years ....... they both love these things and will chew and chew on them for quite a while at each go . They do leave a lot of little nylabone detritis after each chewing session , so you WILL be vacuuming a little , but they do give my dogs an enjoyable time .
4 #### I have had this dog toy for about five months and it is going strong . I have two motivated chewers who have demolished a household in their time , yet this still is around . I would love it except that is has become all jagged and gross . However , I guess after being chewed up for months it would be strange if it was n't all jacked up . Very good for medium size mouths and up , not for small dogs
5 #### he is a chewer & this toy is almost as loved as one of his bones,,,and far prettier to look at ,
5 #### My cat loved it , but I think the catnip that came with it was stale because he did n't react to it ! He usually loves catnip . A great toy for when I m gone and ca nt play with him .
5 #### Really good for dogs that have an allergy to grains and they love . Plus the best price around .
5 #### With a slight squeeze , it fits into the large Kong but is not easy to get out . I can fit two of these and maybe a smear of PB or some jerky treats if I really want to up the interest level . It keeps the 8 m old lab / golden pup busy for a while . He licks at it for a while and whittles it down . He 's fairly drooly while doing this but the wet spot of his bed dries and all is good . A busy dog is a good dog . My kids call this giving him a " Kong Mission " .
3 #### These arrived in great condition but unfortunately my puppy did n't like them . He would n't even lick them . :/
5 #### I bought them for my babies and they love it , the smell is not the best , but hey ! ! ! not everything healthy smells good . I try to buy things that are healthy and natural for my 2 shih tzus , since their tummy is so sensitive , and this is perfect . Because m babies are 10.5 lbs and 9 LBS I sometimes split it in half .
5 #### Love this stuff ! And so do my koi ... if I purchase other brands they tend to just nibble lightly and most of the food ends up on the bottom of the pond turning into toxins . Not Tetra ! They come right up and within 10 minutes the water is clear , they eat every morsel . They 're healthy and beautiful colors . It is an expensive food and I wish I could purchase it in bulk at wholesale prices , however .
2 #### This food makes a mess . Its very light and starts to fall apart as soon as it hits the water . My water was cloudy within a week of using it .
5 #### The only thing my new adoptee will eat . I 've tried other flavors and brands , but after a certain amount of wailing I broke down and gave him what he wants .
4 #### Our 3 cats loved this when they were kittens . Our new kitten did n't . Do n't know if they changed the formula .
5 #### Cats like it . Good amount of time playing with it .
5 #### Sturdy & well made , cats love it ! ! It even came with a little supply of catnip that we spread on the scratcher . All three of my cats are having fun with it
4 #### I could n't tell how big this item looked online but it is actually kind of bigger than I thought for a small dog ( 15 pounds ) . The dog still likes chewing on it though .
3 #### but not our dog 's favorite . We find this neglected by our dog so we may be passing it along to friends soon .
5 #### My dog is chewing machine and these hold up well . Because of the odd shape , I do n't feel that I have to take it away from him as soon as the bones , which last about 1.5 to 2 weeks . I 'm very happy .
5 #### This chew toy is such a hit , I have to buy a new one every 6 months . I give it as a present every chance I get !
5 #### I ordered this for my golden retriever who chews through everything , and it has lasted very well ! She loves the texture and I love the durability !
5 #### The puppy we recently got is great at chewing through basically any toy really quickly . I read the reviews on this and it said it was good for strong chewers , and it has lived up to its promise . It has lasted our dog about 2 months and he is still not done with it . Plus he loves the toy ! I think it makes him like it even more because he ca nt tear it apart like he wants to . Great price for how long it lasts compared to other toys that are the same price but last two days .
5 #### The dogs love these . The owner does too . I appreciate a well made product with limited ingredients . I have a dog who has many allergies . Finding a treat that she can eat is tricky . These are just the thing . I buy the lamb variety . They are a small biscuit for smaller dogs . Price on Amazon is better than the local pet stores . I will continue to purchase as long as the price stays competitive .
5 #### My dogs love these treats ! Good price and ingredients too .
5 #### My dog loves these treats , her itching has stopped , her " black " skin has cleared . I wasted years spending money at the Vet - all kinds of medications , antibiotics to clear my dogs itching and skin- yeast infections- then I switched to Natural Balance and the change in food brand made a huge diffrence
5 #### I feed my dog Natural Balance food , and only feed her the Natural Balance LID treats ( minus dental sticks ) and she does great on them ! The proteins in all of the formulas help with her itchy skin too , without having to buy specific hypoallergenic treats .
5 #### The cats are crazy in love with this toy .
5 #### Ruby is seven and been eating this for five years . She is very heathy and seems to enjoy .
5 #### I love this product , and Amazon is the cheapest place we can find Science Diet . My cat is a finicky water and was started on Science Diet when she was in a shelter . We tried to change her food to a healthier brand , and she literally tried to starve herself . It 's a cat food , so I ca n't say much about it , other than the product is consistent from month to month , and I 've never had any issues receiving the product on time .
5 #### FINALLY my cat does n't have diarrhea . We tried several different foods and even powder probiotics and nothing helped till trying this food . His bowel movements are firm again and no more gas !
2 #### I 'm sure this food is great for the cats , but after the 1st day of a little bit of nibbling , my cats ... all 4 will not eat it . Decided to pay more for better nutrition , but they are getting zero nutrition now .
5 #### I have used this stuff for a whole year . The koi have gotten so big . They really like this food too . I will buy as long as I have my fish . Not sure about the colors being nicer though . They do n't seem to be any different since when I got them a year and a half ago . But the fish love this food and for as much as they give you its great . Now I need to figure out what to do with these big buckets .
5 #### I was glad to find food with just the sticks . Our fish only eat the the sticks , so why bother with the fluffy stuff in the other containers . The price is the best here at Amazon . We have a few " gold - fish " and a Koi . I personally did n't notice any color change in the fish , but I did n't expect it .
5 #### Very solid food . Will probably last an entire summer in the size , and the bucket is rainproof . My fish seem to like it a lot and it does n't cloud the water . I ca n't say it 's " improved the color of the fish " as they claim , but I kind of find those claims dubious no matter who makes it so they can have a pass on that . Besides , I did n't exactly have a batch of control fish to measure against , so maybe it has . I 'd recommend this food .
4 #### A little smaller than I expected it to be but very sturdy . Take care not to step on it , it 's sharp ! Ouch !
5 #### Oh my little guy just loves this . I think the head is pretty much gone and I like the lack of splinters with Nylabone .
3 #### My dog is around 6 pounds , and he does not really pay much attention to this toy . I really only bought it for him because his name is Rex and I thought it would be funny . ( They did not send a T - rex , just a warning -- they send you a random one ! ) I knew they were gon na send a random one but I had hoped for a T - Rex . That is not why I give it an okay rating though . My dog just does not seem to care for it , but maybe a larger dog would !
5 #### I have hounds that chew - four of them . This dinosaur keeps them out of trouble and happy . I will be buying lots more !
5 #### Read the fine print here if you expect a T - rex : it comes in 3 possible shapes / dinosaurs . I was so bummed to not get a t - rex ! However my dogs could care less and immediately attacked the poor dino with zest , eating off his face in short order . So for the dog , it 's a 5 - star which is what really matters , right ? Packaging was also easy to open and that 's always a bonus !
2 #### I got this toys along with a few others for my one year old Lab pup for Christmas . This is the only one he does not play with .
3 #### Our dog chewed the tail off within minutes and then discarded forever . Would n't purchase this item for my dog again
4 #### I have a very finicky Kitty , so feeding him Grain free Wet food is quite a challenge . I have to be inventive . I tried this and he loved them for couple months , then just turned his nose on it . So had to change again . But I would recommended it and It also was the cheapest options on this product range . ( Trust me I tried a LOT ) which is a
2 #### Maybe it 's just my cat - I watched all the youtube videos of cats who love it - they sold the product . But my cat will NOT play with this toy . I bought the flashing balls , etc . No go . The toy she loves is the fluttering spinning battery operated butterfly on a wire . She will play with it for HOURS . This - sat in the apartment for months , then shoved under the sofa , then given away to a friend who adopted a rescue cat . No update on whether that cat plays with it or not . She prefers packs of rattle mice and balls . But not in a track .
3 #### I found " replacement " balls for it , which suggests there was supposed to be a ball . I want my ball !
4 #### My cat loves this thing - it 's really the first toy Boots started playing with since coming home from the shelter . Especially impressive , since Boots is an adult cat and not generally that playful . Walks right by most other toys . The scratcher is their favorite place to sit , and sometimes she uses it as a scratcher too ( though sometimes this leads to it moving across the floor ) . And Boots likes to bat the ball around the track , too . All around good purchase ! Only gave 4/5 because Boots ' claws seem to catch on the scratcher frequently . Otherwise , satisfied and would recommend ,
5 #### My cat loves it . She does n't use it for scratching as often as other scratching toys , but will chase the ball in a circle while we play . If you have a cat larger than 10lbs , they may not run around it .
5 #### The kittens love this . I placed a hex - bug ( asin : B00TTU9RAQ ) in the track and one of them loves chasing it .
4 #### I feed my standard poodle the venison and sweet potato formula food , as well as these hard treats and the Jumpin Stix . This formula finally allowed me to get him off of the prescription hypoallergenic ZD Ultra food , which is a hydrolyzed chicken protein . My only complaint is that these get very hard ( maybe I need to seal the bag better ? ) , and they 're pretty darn big , so not the best for a small dog or one with sensitive teeth .
1 #### Could not understand why the dog had terrible gas until I figured out that it was since she started eating this product . Stopped feeding the dog these " treats " and problem stopped . In other words , do not feed these to your dog .
2 #### My Doxies love These but they give them the runs . B - A - D ! ! !
5 #### I have n't tasted them but the dogs seem to like them . Good price and ingredient list , and just the right size / shape to fit in a size large Kong .
5 #### The treats are very large ... have to break into pieces for our small dogs . This is the only brand we feed them .
5 #### This is the most convenient and economical way to keep my cats in their favorite food !
5 #### Just what I wanted . Delilah the cat loves it
4 #### I think Science Diet is the way to go . I always purchased cheap cat food because well , it was cheap . When I started volunteering at the animal shelter I noticed this is all they use . I decided to give it a try . First thing I noticed was that the amount of food was far less than I was used to feeding her . Even though it was less it must be more filling because she 's not hungry so many times a day . She seems more content . She definitely is n't pooping so often . This will be the only cat food we 'll use from now on .
4 #### I got this for my beagle pup as she can not stop chewing . I 've purchased nearly every chew toy Amazon sells and finally got this . It was too hard for my 11 week old puppy . She check it out , mouthed it and never touched it again . Maybe when she gets larger .... Meanwhile , my 8 year - old son loves dinosaurs and wanted it . So , now it 's his . He knows he might be able to give it up one day , but I do n't think I will be able to get it back .
4 #### I bought this for my daughter new dog for the grandchildren . The dog , Lily , has chewed up a few toys of the kids like puzzles and game pieces so thought this might help out . Just sent it the other day but I assume the dog will like it .
2 #### My dog loved the dinasaur chew toy THAT IS SHOWN IN THE ADVERTISEMENT . Unfortunately that is not the chew toy that was received . The substitution was white and I believe was a taradactal . It is all angular and sharp points . My dog would n't even touch it . She even know the difference . This looks like a cheap substitution and I am upset that you just assume that we would n't know the difference . I left all of them at the dog park in case some other dog would want them . From now on DO NOT SUBSTITUTE without advising in advance . Very upset with this kind of business practice . All nylabone products ARE NOT equal .
5 #### I selected this food for our Koi based on the " color enhancing " claim . I do n't know what our fish would look like without this particular food , but he sure is a bright , beautiful fish with gorgeous gold , red , orange and black markings . The fish seems to like the food , which has been fed to him exclusively for over a year , and he has been happy and and healthy .
5 #### I use Tetra Pond for my pond kois and goldfish . I tried different foods , but they seem to like the Tetra Pond best . The price is great , about 12 or less than I pay at my local discount store~
5 #### I 've been using this pond food for several years and all my fish seem to enjoy these pellets . This is the only food I give them .
5 #### I have a large pond with lots of Koi and Goldfish , all of whom eat like crazy when I feed them . They seem to like this food best . Not only is it a good deal on the food , but it comes in a great resealable bucket that can be used for other things after it is empty .
5 #### its great for fish keeps them healthy and color bright and they love it does cloud water great for bulking up fish [ ... ]
5 #### Great price . This is the only canned cat food my 3 cats will eat .
5 #### My cats love this flavor and I love that it 's grain free !
5 #### If you figure out how much it really costs to feed your cat you will realize that this a bargain . Espically if you figure out how much a vet bill will cost if you feed your cat junk food .
1 #### My cat used to love this food . However , for whatever reason , recently he started to throw up every time he ate it . He is not prone to vomiting overall , so I suspect that the quality or ingredients of this food have been recently changed . The last batch of this food messed up his digestive system very bad -- after I completely eliminated it he had diarhea and vomiting for two weeks .
5 #### Just as good as the one I paid twice as much for .
5 #### I have a multi cat household , and my cats love this and fight over it . One will lay on it so the others can not get to it !
5 #### My dog is grain free and loves these treats . And I love that Amazon sells them for less than half of what the local pet - stores sell them for .
5 #### My dogs love these ... one has allergies ( food and environmental ) and these do not cause her any problems .
5 #### Both of my cats love this . One slept on it last night to keep the other one from playing with it . It keeps them occupied for hours and they seem to like the scratch pad better than the one I got them at Trader Joe 's . Nice build quality . Could be a little heavier - it skids around my flooring a bit so I think I 'll find a carpet square to put underneath it to keep it from moving so much .
5 #### I purchased this for my 26 pound dog . He destroys toys in a matter of minutes . But not this one . This one he chews on and carries around with him . This is a great size toy for him , not too big yet not too small . I have bought Nylabone products for him before and this dinosaur toy has the same great quality . I will be purchasing Nylabone products again .
5 #### We have bought three different ones and our German Shepherd really works on them . Buy these and you will find it will be one of your dogs favorite toys .
5 #### We have a chihuahua terrier mix , and she loves this ! More so than the other nylabones . It 's thicker and has more angles since she always seems to chew the ends .
2 #### My lab chews through every single toy except Kongs . He has already eaten the head off of this and I notice that little white plastic pieces come off . Not for my dog . I would suggest if you have a hard chewer to stick with Kong toys .
4 #### My dogs LOVE nylabones and of course loved this one . My only complaint is that it was a little small for my dogs . I would have preferred to have the company offer different sizes .
5 #### Nylabones are great . Not expensive and they last forever . Our dog loves to chew , but these hold up . Highly recommend .
5 #### Our cat had surgery and was placed on a VERY expensive wet cat food diet that was only available by prescription . This was the ONLY wet cat food our cat would eat when we tried weaning her off the expensive wet Vet cat food . It was just a little more than half the cost while not giving up almost anything in the way of nutrition . We HIGHLY recommend this for other cat owners .
1 #### I have been feeding wellness canned and dry cat food for several months and the cats have been doing great until now . I just received a case of the canned chicken and herring cat food and fed it to my 3 cats as usual . One of the 3 cats had horrible diarrhea and is also vomiting . He 's on his way to the vet today . The other 2 cats will not eat it . There is definitely something wrong with this batch of cat food . Too bad because wellness is considered to be a high quality pet food but now I 'm not so sure about that .
5 #### Our girl , and our roommate 's cat , both love this one . Always a go to .
5 #### My cats eat this in moderation ( which is what I want ) . Minimal regurgitation .
3 #### My cats ate it but showed no excitement . It was an experiment to change their food and see if they reacted to a higher rated cat food . I expected them to be excited over a new flavor . My cats are older and in good health . They seem the same after eating the whole bag , and was bored with it . I am going to try another brand and see what happens .
5 #### I have four cats of various ages , sizes and both genders and they all love it . They have fantastic , shiny coats , clear , bright eyes , boundless energy and strong , white teeth . I credit Hill 's Science Diet for all of that . I started feeding it because I had a cat that needed L - lysine daily and this is the only food that has it in the ingredients . That beats having to grind up tablets and mixing it in the food . Since the L - lysine boosts feline immune systems I feel that 's just another reason to keep giving it to them . This size lasts over a month even with my gang .
2 #### Received box with fish food and lounger that I ordered . Unknown to me the fish food broke open and was loose inside the box ... that was n't the worse part - fine dust from the fish food leaked out of the box and was all over the lounger box as well as my kitchen counter and floor . The size of fish food was priced well compared to that available in this area , however , I do n't think the clean up made it worth it .
5 #### Hi , I have been looking all over for a good deal on Koi food and came a pond this deal .... Right price and quick service too ! Better than buying locally any where !
3 #### This is definitely mostly brown rice and other fillers than lamb in the treat . It 's good enough for a training session , but leaves more to be desired .
5 #### My dog loves these . She goes crazy over both fish & sweet potatoes .
5 #### Great treats for dogs with limited diets . Our dogs love them !
5 #### My doxie dogs love these . It 's very hard to find treats that are real fish and not full of chicken by products . They are small dogs and these are small treats that have good stuff in them so I do n't feel like they are eating junk . Also 1 treat does n't add many extra calories to their regular diet and small Dachshund backs ca n't take the extra pounds .
3 #### Cats like it , were able to break it though . It did n't look like the cardboard was replaceable ( I may be mistaken on that ) so once it 's torn up , it 's kind of done . They got the ball out of the track .
5 #### This is the best and well made Cat Toy I have ever seen . The balance of the ball keeps the ball moving around once it is engaged . Kitty absolutely LOVES this toy and loves the scratchy part he lays on to bat the ball . We have two cats and I bought another one for our other cat and he loves it too ! . This is a win - win toy for hours of pleasure where kitty does n't get tired of it . Additionally , the one toy came and it looks like the plastic was broken on it before it was in the box ( like somehow it dropped and maybe it was a hairline crack ) but they sent another one right away . Do n't be misled by this statement as I only mentioned it to show how great customer service is - top priority and the best ! We really appreciated it . The quality of the toy is heavy and well made which is why we were surprised that the plastic cracked . Will buy again and again ! ! ! Excellent !
4 #### Great toy ! My new kitten loves it and keeps him busy for hours ! Just wish you could get the color you see , which is blue , I got purple . Not a big deal but the colors do vary .
5 #### I was skeptical this toy would be a hit , but when the kitten gets bored of harassing my older cat he runs to go play with this . Once I realized it was being used I got him the feather add on and now even the grumpy adult cat gets in on the fun !
2 #### They chomped on the chew for a couple of minutes and never went near it again ! Definitely depends on whether your pups actually like nylabone .
5 #### Nylabones are a long - lasting , calorie - free , relatively safe , & fun chew toy for your dog . And , the dinosaur designs are adorable .
5 #### Cute little t - rex at a good price . The dogs love it , chewing on it and tossing it around . Lasts as long as other Nylabone products , a good buy for the money .
4 #### It holds up to the chewing from my lab when he does grab it . It 's not his first pick out of the basket of toys , but seems good and sturdy .
4 #### The cat " Mittens " wants her dry every day and she gets it . Does n't solve the hairballs but she likes it and I give her what she wants .
1 #### I have four indoor and two outdoor cats that used to do well on SD cat food . Now they routinely throw it up . I 've tried all SD types and had the cats seen by my vet . He said there must be a new fngredient or filler that makes them all throw up . He advises trying a different product , such as Natural Balance or Taste of the Wild . I 've gone from 4 - bag - per - month recurring SD orders to cancellation .
5 #### Cats love it , poops do n't smell as much , and no hairballs / other health issues .
5 #### I have been using this Vibrance Koi food for last 5 years . Ask my kois and other pond fish . They like it .
5 #### I have been using this for my Koi for the past 21/2 years . I once brought a more expensive brand and my Koi would not eat it . This past summer , my Koi had more deeper colors with the reds and oranges really coming out . My fish love these sticks and hate the pellets . I would recommend this to anyone . Also feed this to small baby Koi that my fish had . They were able to eat this as it gets soft in the water . These fry since last spring when born are now about 5 inches long and healthy .
5 #### Over many years of keeping Koi in my outdoor pond in central Florida I have used mainly ' inexpensive ' bulk foods available on line from many suppliers . As my Koi grew and I became more picky about water quality I switched to the Tetra vibrance food . This food provides all the necessary nutrition without the cheap addatives that are undigestible by the fish and ultimatly cloud the water , and overload the biological filters . With this food my fish seem be healthier , put on less fatty tissue , but are satisfied nutritionaly . Their color has definitly improved and my filters are keeping the water beautifully clear and clean . My fish need less of this food to be satisfied so the cost of feeding the higher quality is not as much of an increase as I expected ... well worth the money . Not to mention fewer filter cleanings and a healthier pond .
4 #### My pug is a heavy duty chewer who goes through any Nylabone in a few weeks . We tried this Dino for a different shape , and it has been very popular . He and his foster sister chug fight over it , so cute ! Beware of stepping on it in your bare feet though- those bumps hurt !
1 #### This toy is something else . It 's made out of a very , VERY hard material and it hurts to even pick it up because of the prickly things on it . My dog does n't play with it and has maybe had it in it 's mouth once . Never again will I buy this .
3 #### What this is : a Nylabone shaped like a knobby - covered dinosaur My dog loved a friend 's dog 's tyrannosaurus chew . I thought we 'd get her one , so we ordered this . We did get a dinosaur nylabone , but we received a brontosaurus rather than a tyrannosaur . For whatever reason , the dog does n't like it as much as she liked the tyrannosaur . Who would have thought the dog would have a preference of what lizard 's head she was chewing off ? Low rating because : the page did n't mention " you may get a different lizard in your package . "
4 #### I thought it was going to be a little bigger , but my dog that is a heavy chewer likes it ! If she likes it , then I like it !
5 #### Our lab puppy loves this toy . After going through several chew toys and losing interest in others , this toy has both lasted his constant gnawing and his puppy - length attention span .
2 #### but it makes me nervous . These are extremely hard . I got one for the little power - chewer ( 16 pound standard dachshund ) and he likes the little bumps and the stego shape even though it 's a little big for him ... Little Remy has great teeth and a strong jaw , and does well with toys and treats made for dogs that are a bit bigger than him ( for reference , he chewed through a giant rawhide bone that was longer than he is which I only gave to him for a Christmas laugh ) . But I will probably take it away from him . It 's too hard and has no give ; it actually feels like solid plastic . I dislike Nylabone 's sizing because saying " up to xxlbs " seems misleading . This toy does not look or feel safe for the teeth of dogs " up to 35 pounds . " Personally , I would even hesitate to give it to a larger dog like my sadly departed black lab , who never had a bad tooth in her 13 years . If your dog has any dental problems , avoid this toy . Weak teeth might not be able to hold up against it . But the dino shape and bumpy texture are very interesting to dogs , so I wish that there were softer version of this toy . Also watch out because these are about as fun to accidentally step on as Legos .
5 #### Like all Nylabones , this is well designed and done ... and of course coming thru Amazon , you know you will be happy or they will make it right ... This is for medium chewers , not aggressive chewers like my labs ... and they loved it so much it was very worth while ....
5 #### I have 2 German Shepherds , and they have lasted their active chewing . It says there are different styles and I got both the same , that 's fine , the girls did n't notice . They both have a lot of life left .
3 #### Cat could care less . I will say that the price though is way better than what i saw at stores though so if you have a cat that likes these things then it would be a great purchase .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R39QNJHTFCLJNS " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1 - dCQCwROS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1do4aiM5kS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;My cat is obsessed with this toy . I bought it hoping he would love this and he wo n't stop playing with it . He scratches on it , and also wo n't stop playing with the ball ! I can not rate this high enough !
5 #### It is insane how much my cats love this . If you have a cat , get this . If you have a cat that ca n't be bothered with toys , get this anyway . They will love it ! The additional place to scratch is useful and the cats like it . I have to clean the peices of cardboard up but it 's worth it .
5 #### My cats love this . Also , when they wore out the cardboard scratcher , I just cut and wound up a new one from a box . Highly recommended .
3 #### Well ca n't say much I guess my cat is lazy . She looks at it then walks away . So if you 're cat is like mine do n't bother . On a side note we 'll made and I 'm . Sure a smaller energetic cat would love .
5 #### Great for stuffing in a treat ball , my beagle scarfs them up .
5 #### GREAT price for a treat my furbaby just LOVES ! ! They are the perfect size for her little mouth :-) I will order again ! ! Thank you ! !
4 #### I like the larger size treats better , but my dog was very happy with them .
4 #### they smell kind of weird , chemically but i order them for the limited ingredients
4 #### This food is very healthy but I ca n't get a clear answer from my 5 cats on which flavors they like . We actually charted their response to 8 different flavors ( yes we are nerds , as if the 5 cats did n't give that away ) and all we got was that they hate chicken and lobster and love chicken and herring ; every other flavor gave inconsistent feedback - not the fault of the food , just my picky cats . We have 4 foster cats living in our basement that gulp down every flavor we give them , and they 've been here for 6 months so it 's not just that they are hungry ... So I guess if you have a really picky cat they may or may not turn their nose up at this , but if you have a picky cat you probably already know that . If you have a cat that is open to new experiences , this stuff is high quality and they will probably love it . My dogs love it too and are more likely to try to steal this from the cats than other brands of food , but they also eat poo so I do n't give their tastes a lot of value .
3 #### Good for kittens , but there is only one flavor for kittens . Good cat food , but I switched my kitten to the adult wellness that the older cat likes . Kitten prefers a different flavor .
1 #### Not only did my cat not eat it , but when I gave it to a family member to give her two greedy cats , they just sniffed it and let it rot . Clearly , the stuff is gross to cats . Never again , I say !
5 #### Cat Loves it , we call it her fake " robot vacuum " she will scratch at it but also sit an lay on it .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R3CHHF8DL48HOG " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91XKsihIHLS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1GBXB8cbCS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;This toy has become a staple in our household , my cat particularly adores it when high on catnip ( and the catnip it came with was legit ) . Whenever she get 's really bored and I 'm too busy to play I sprinkle some catnip on it and wham ! 10 minutes of kitty exercise and entertainment . I was also impressed by the size of it . Mona is a solid 10 lbs of adult cat , but it 's plenty large enough to keep her entertained . Occasionally I like to put one of her smaller balls in as well to mix it up . She also regularly uses the scratch pad feature which alone makes it worth the investment .
5 #### the durablty of this stood up to the puppy chewing . I would buy this product again . It is stronger and will not make a mess .
5 #### My 112 pound rottie loves this chew toy . He can usually chew through anything , but this dinosaur has kept him busy . He digs through his toy basket to find it .
1 #### My teething puppy ( chocolate bullador ) preferred this toy to nylabone 's teething toys and has no interest with his permanent teeth . He has the same reaction to the bacon - flavored hollow stick . Before buying , know your dog 's chewing style ; not just based on breeds , but your actual pet . I have done a fair amount of research online , reading reviews , and talking to pet store clerks to find out this is not an uncommon behavior . Teething puppies are figuring out the world and will put anything in their mouth but may prefer a hard surface to push their teeth against into their gums . Then , with adult teeth , they may want to use their powerful teeth to destroy . So , this toy will likely fail to redirect destructive behavior because they will not be able to cause any damage . My dog quickly lost interest and started gnawing on his previously ignored teething bone , which I had to quickly take away after two days . He got one good day out of the teething bone , exposing the dental bristles , but was breaking off much larger pieces on day two and would have destroyed the whole thing in under and hour if I had not separated him from it . Now , I am stuck with two durachews and not quite sure how to spark his interest in either . Pro : Teething puppy looking for hard surface Con : Useless for powerful chewer that can not dent
4 #### My dog loves a Nylabone , and watching her work on her dinosaur is too cute . She really seems to like the limps and bumps on his sides . She has already taken his head off .
5 #### This is my 8 mth old english bulldogs favorite toy . He chews on it for hours at a time and it has n't lost it 's ridges or anything . I would recommend .
5 #### This is a very cute toy . My dog loves it and it was bought for Christmas and it is now March and it is still going strong . It was not the Dinosaur pictured but it is a dinosaur .
5 #### I was worried because of the reviews that say it can break their teeth and I m sure that s possible ( maybe they were older dogs or did n't have healthy teeth ) . I just watch closely as my Frenchie started chewing it and did n't see any need for concern . It quickly became his favorite ( as I keep 3 or 4 options around at a time ) HE IS A CHEWER . It affordable and a hit in our house .
5 #### Just got it today . I expected total dismemberment by my 1 year old 100 lb Akbash . He 's very large and tends to absolutely destroy toys , but this one will live another day . So , so far , so good . Does n't even have a scratch it seems , but I will update as he 's had it longer .
3 #### For some reason , my cat likes Science Diet 's larger pieces of dry food ( indoor and oral care ) . He bypasses the smaller pieces that this product has . I 'm mixing them together with a smaller ratio and will increase over time to try to acclimate him to this one .
4 #### I ordered these for my well - loved dogs -- two Westies and two Yorkies . The youngest Westie LOVES them , ( which is great , because she is still in training , so treats for her is most important for me ! ) but the others are not so crazy for them . My older Yorkie , a spoiled brat at age 10 , looked at me as if to say , " really ? filet , please ..... " Worth a try , because Natural Balance offers a great line of healthier treats than most . AND , it might truly be impossible to find one treat that all pets will love .
5 #### My dog fakes having to go outside potties so she can get these treats ... she loves them .
5 #### My GSP loves these things and they are better for her than other bone shaped snacks containing milk . Vet approved as well .
5 #### Reasonable price for a premium quality treat . Every dog we give them to loves them , and we are happy with the quality .
5 #### Great product . I give my Yorkie these instead of all the junky treats out there .
5 #### I 've tried the other flavors but my cat prefers the turkey over chicken . I feel good knowing he 's getting healthy food !
5 #### Wonderful - we use this as one feeding a day along with two dry food feedings , and when we added this our cats coats got shiner and their dandruff disappeared .
5 #### I bought this several months ago and my cat is still crazy over it .
5 #### Cat loves this and can play with it by himself which is nice .
4 #### My cat really took to this toy at first , but now only plays with it on occasion . Odd thing is that our Shih Tzu loves it to the point that he 's managed to remove the ball , which rolled under the couch , and now , no one plays with it . It does work well though and provides added benefit of scratching material . Sturdy enough for a cat or dog 's play ( well , a small dog ) .
4 #### Same as I said about replacement scratchers card board . Unmarked package of . Catnip . Cat loves the ball and it stays in the slot .
5 #### I bought several toys for my son 's new kittens to play with . This BY FAR was , from the very beginning and even now , their very favorite toy . They both play with it without fighting or disagreements . One will bat the ball on one side and the other one makes all effort to bat it back before it goes all around the track . This is a KEEPER !
3 #### My Bengal enjoy spinning the ball from time to time but does nt use the scratcher . Would I recommend it or buy it again ? NO
4 #### Funny enough , my kitten is more interested in the trackball than the cardboard scratch pad . He rarely uses it for scratching , and prefers his posts instead . Still , the ball keeps him entertained .
2 #### This kibble is more dog - sized than cat - sized . Come on , Hills - have you ever checked how big a kittycat 's mouth is ?
5 #### This has n't killed my cats and their poo smells like flowers ! ! Thanks Obama !
4 #### My cats were reluctant to eat this unless they were very hungry . I was reluctant to stop buying it because of its freedom from junk fillers and dangerous additives . We compromised . I started topping it with chicken leftovers and a little cooked chicken oil ( for my thinner cats in the winter ) , or commercial canned variety which I did not trust as sole nutrition , but which they would eat . This is a great deal for a multi - cat household , especially if you have to travel . Neither they nor I appreciate the texture , which is almost a semi - solid pudding , but the benefits balance the problems . Overall , fairly good stuff . Take it from the four - footed house owners .
5 #### Kitten LOVES this food ! ! He eats dry food during the day / night and canned food at our dinner time . Like that it is delivered and do n't have to hunt for " kitten " food .
5 #### My cat is very finicky . This has been the only food she will eat so far ...
5 #### My cat 's love it , it 's the only canned cat food I have ever fed them .
4 #### I bought two of these for my pups and received the T - rex and stegosaurus . They were a bit smaller than what I was expecting , but they will work for my two 35 - 40 lb dogs .
1 #### After reading the negative reviews about broken teeth and other issues , I 'm kind of relieved that none of my dogs have shown any interest in this chew . I even tried coating it with yummy stuff ( peanut butter , etc . ) to get my dogs to take interest , but they 'll only lick the coating off and then leave the chew . My dogs are all mixes of German Shepherd , Rottweiler , Pit Bull , and Border Collie , so it should say something that they will have nothing to do with this item . I 'm tired of stubbing my toe on it after having it around the house unused for over a year . It 's going in the trash .
2 #### Did n't interest my dog at all . He would rather chew up the plastic down spout . At least he did ruin it and swallow big pieces .
2 #### I bought this for my 10 lb mini doxie and she has little to no interest in it . It 's super rock hard ! I may try to put some peanut butter on it to make it more appealing but probably will give it to my parents ' golden retrievers to see if it interests them . Also , I was unable to choose which dinosaur shape I wanted at checkout . Kind of inconsequential but I really wanted the Tyrannosaurus Rex ! Instead I got the Stegosaurus . Perhaps that 's why she does n't like it :)
4 #### In true Nylabone fashion , this toy is very durable . It was a bit smaller than I expected it to be , but my dog loves it . Has quickly become one of his favorites .
5 #### He loves these . Our dog is stupid stubborn , he is good at training us to do his bidding . But we can use these to do some training with him . He lets us groom him for as long as we need to when these come out . LOL . And he has a sensitive stomach , these do n't seem to upset him at all .
5 #### These treats are great . They have a limited list of ingredients . Do n't feed your dog cheap treats , the few dollars you would save you pay triple for vet bills later . We feed our dog Natural Balance products for years and he is doing very well .
3 #### it 's a good product but realized one of dogs ca n't eat fish .
5 #### Let 's reduce this down to what is really important . Will my cats eat this , and will they still eat it in 3 months . Yes and yes . It is a cat staple that I leave out at all times .
4 #### I gave this 4 stars because my cats do n't like it as much as they like the hairball control . I also do n't care for the new heavy duty bag ; it 's overkill . How many eons will it take to decompose in a landfill ?
4 #### This dramatically improved my cat 's coat in 2 weeks . Unfortunately I discovered cat has a chicken allergy so had to stop feeding .
5 #### It is the only food my spoiled cat will it
5 #### We bought this a year ago and our kitten loved it . A year later and she still likes it a lot .
5 #### Cats love playing on this from time to time . It 's approved !
5 #### Perfect ! Perfect ! Perfect ! Year after year , the cats still play with this . I have purchased several replacement scratch pads in the middle , but they last a long time and are pretty cheap for two replacements - One usually lasts all year . I just flip it over after about 6 months and add more catnip . Usually , my cats get tired of most toys after a while , so I have to put them up for a few months and rotate them out . However , this turbo scratcher is one toy that stays out all year long and still gets played with almost daily !
5 #### My one cat plays with this every day now . Too cute .
5 #### A very helpful tool for my house : my cat loves to scratch it and did n't touch any furniture or door frames for that purpose .
5 #### My dogs love this dino chew . They chew on it all the time . Its there fav chew I have got them of all the chewable bones I got them
2 #### Too small for a large , heavy chewed . I was worried he 'd swallow it ! No problem though because he does n't like it . Will pass on to a small dog and see if there is more attraction . Would not buy again .
1 #### I generally give my dogs rope toys to tug which helps clean their teeth , or natural chews : bones , bully sticks and cow ears . They all sniffed this toy , and my puppy picked it up and dropped it by the fridge , which is where I keep the good treats . None of them have spent any time chewing on it , or even playing with it like a toy .
5 #### I have never been disapointed with a Nylabone dog toy . These dinosaur ones last forever and hold their shape well ( so they do n't look all chewed up right away ) . I highly recommend this toy for dogs who like to chew . We 've bought two of them for our pug / Boston terrier mix .
2 #### Notice how there is n't an obvious measurement on length ? Well , these 6.5 inches at most . Right , the cost is pretty low and that 's the one consolation ... but I was disappointed at these tiny snacks .
5 #### Great for my determined chewer . He spends quite a bot of time chewing on it . It is made of a very hard plastic material .
5 #### My cat LOVES this food ! I love the ingredients and she spins in circles all the way to her food mat .
4 #### what is going on with the yo - yo pricing ? ? ? i wo n't be buying this anymore . are you kidding me ? 32 dollars ? i was purchasing 36 cans per month , but no more .... going to another cat food that has a stable price ..... BYE
4 #### Cat like the flavor for a while but not so much anymore .
3 #### Would give a 5 for quality , but over half cans arrive significantly dented .
5 #### I have a Bengal cat and she really likes this . I also get the dry food .
3 #### My dogs love these treats and I was excited to find them at such a great price . I should have known that when they were shipped they would break . Half the bag was crumbs when I received it .
5 #### The Pup LOVES these ! Beware of the smelly gas afterwards
5 #### The product is exactly what we were looking for
5 #### The product is exactly what we were looking for
5 #### My pup loves these and they are a great price compared to what they cost here in Hawaii . Highly recommend !
3 #### My dog likes this but will not chew it much because it is very hard . He is an older dog so maybe a pup would enjoy it more .
1 #### WHEN OUR PUPPY WOULD PLAY WITH THE DINOSAUR IT WOULD MAKE MORE NOISE THAN EXPECTED ON OUR TILE FLOORS VERY DISTURBING TO OUR SLEEP AND OUR OLDER DOG PUPPY I THINK LIKED THE NOISE AND ATTENTION
5 #### This chew toy is awesome . Our beagle puppy loves it and chews for along time . It does nt break up . Absolutely as described and I would suggest this chew to anyone with a puppy / big dog also .
5 #### Both times i purchased this product for my dogs i can give this item an A+ . I love American made items so this is a double bonus !
3 #### good shape and sizes but the girls are just picking them up and throwing them around - i think they might just be a little to hard to chew - or they are just saving them for a rainy day
3 #### My puppy loved it ! But for who has hardwood floors is not a good idea because it 's a very hard toy and makes a huge noise when the dog plays with it !
5 #### GOOD , BUT MY CAT USES ONY SCRATCH PAD
5 #### This has provided tons of entertainment for my two cats - they spend time batting the ball around and also use the scratcher . Even when not playing or scratching , they like to sit or lay on it ( one at a time ) .
5 #### This cat food is the best . Its the only food i would buy . There is less poop when there on this food . I have tried cheaper brands but its the old saying you get what you pay for . We have a feral colony that 's on this food as i feel they would benefit from this cat food with less health issues . i feed dry food in the evening and some wet food for the morning .
3 #### Our cats prefer Blue Buffalo dry cat foods over this brand .
4 #### Works great and it is in my puppy 's crate most of the time . It is heavy which I suppose means it might last awhile . He chews it and as long as he is chewing this and not my furniture I am happy .
2 #### Careful people ! Even though this chew toy says for powerful chewers , it also says for dogs up to 50 lbs in VERY tiny print on the bottom of the package . I gave it to my 79 lb Lab Mix puppy anyway , since I had already bought it ... and lo and behold , it began falling apart in only a few moments . After removing the toy and picking up the white bits all over ... I thought to come here and warn people . I find it odd how it 's for powerful chewers yet only includes medium sized dogs in the toy description ! With pit bull terriers and a few other smaller breeds as an exception ... usually smaller dog means less destructive chewing ability . Senseless , really . If you have a dog that falls under this weight category ... except for a breed with very powerful jaws , this toy probably suits just fine , but if you have a large dog , do n't even think about it . I paid almost $ 9 for a toy that begun to disintegrate within a few seconds .
5 #### Buster now almost 6 monthes has not been able to destroy this one .. Buster is a yellow lab who has been teething for a while
3 #### Ok so here 's the thing my dog likes this but again it is for aggressive chewers and he has already ripped off some of the spikes ! Idk if ill let him keep chewing these bc of the mess and I do n't think its for aggressive chewers or atleast not my dog who is determined
3 #### Nylabone typically makes great products and I 've ordered these dinosaurs before for my dog who is a super , duper , mega chewer . The first time I ordered the dino was great and lasted for a while , which was nice . The second time , I was sent a different shape and it was torn up pretty quickly . The feet were chewed up within an hour . I 'll have to go to a local pet store to get the shape I want since I ca n't choose here .
5 #### My 4 cats eat this cat food and seem to enjoy it ; they eat it up !
5 #### This is great cat food . Very wholesome . Amazon has the lowest price I have found .
5 #### Our cat loves this and he does not have any health problems like he ate Fancy Feast before ! He had folliculitis when he was eating Fancy Feast ! ! ! !
5 #### Winston 's dog food is also Natural Balance Sweet Potato and Fish . So he loves these treats . Nice to get the same as his regular dog food .
5 #### My dog loves these treats . I have a 60 pound german shepherd . These treats are made for smaller breeds but I use them as training treats and as treats for my dog 's puzzles . They are great for training for a larger dog since you can give them quite a few . The Natural Balance brand is high quality and the limited ingredient line is great for dogs with sensitive tummies . My dog gets a Rx limited diet kibble and generally is very sensitive to treats but she does just fine with these . Highly recommended , especially for the price .
5 #### Good quality product for dogs with many food allergies . Probably great for your non - allergic dog as well .
5 #### Good quality product that my dog with many food allergies really like .
5 #### My poor pup is in a limited ingredient diet , including chicken . She is picky but loves these treats !
5 #### Kitty loves it and I love it because it helps keep her busy when I ca n't play . Surprising pearly magenta color too ! It seems to be high - quality and the made in USA label was a surprise to me . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is terrific ... my cats LOVE to " chase " the ball going round and round , and actually play with it by themselves ! I got a Burgundy color , and it matches my furniture perfectly . Great buy ... very sturdy . It 's a good cat toy for those of us who are working all day , and want to keep our cats occupied ! Highly recommend !
5 #### Our two male cats do n't play with many toys . But boy do they like this one ! Especially when we spike it with catnip ! Really glad I got this because our cats need to play .
5 #### love this food and love that amazon offers to deliver . having 6 cats means a lot of food . my mail carrier hates me ! LOL
1 #### My cats did n't like this one ... they like the chicken flavor .
3 #### It looks good to me , but my cats do n't like it !
5 #### Of all the flavors , my four cats like this one the best !
4 #### My cats seem to consistently like this product . It is a good quality .
1 #### One cat refused to eat it , the other would eat a few bites then throw it up . That says it all for me .
4 #### Good snacks for dogs and the tiny size is good for training . They are pretty high in carbs but the dogs like them .
4 #### I am more cautious of the snacks that I feed my fur babies . They are family so I wo n't buy those cheap milk bone snacks or anything . Love these and dog love them too
5 #### I purchased these for the dogs at the Idaho Humane Society , because my sister said they were the BEST for cleaning their teeth and safe for the animals . I wish more people would purchase these and donate them to the Humane Society .
3 #### The Nila bones are too small for large dog and they spend very little time chewing them . a larger bone needs to be offered
4 #### good product but smaller than I had anticipated . good customer service , just too small for my golden , will give to a friend for a smaller dog .
3 #### Overall this is a very strong toy . It is also heavy , and in my opinion too hard . It looks like it would be a tough rubber / plastic , but it does n't bend at all . My dog is n't a big fan of this toy , she barely spends anytime chewing it and tends to go back to her older toys . Pros : Affordable , Strong Cons : Heavy , Too hard
3 #### My dog is a crazy chewing beast who will normally go to town on anything you put in front of her . For some reason , she could n't care less about this guy . It 's too bad , because they 're really cute !
5 #### My pit mix loves this , and it 's one of the few chew toys that has lasted over a month . It seems to keep her teeth clean , and because it 's pretty lightweight , she can flip it in the air and run after it to entertain herself . Also the pieces come off in really small shavings , not shards or chunks . Highly recommend !
5 #### He loves biting on this toy , especially since our Great Pyrenees is teething . I wish I had gotten one that was a little larger .
3 #### There are better choices but maybe this would be better for non boxers ? The only toy that worried me as far as safety goes .
5 #### This was at the pet stores for about $ 30 . This is the exact toy . The kitten had this toy where we adopted her so we knew that she liked it but so glad we bought her one for home . She enjoys this and we enjoy watching her . Great purchase .
3 #### Well , I brought this for one of my baby ferrets because he keeps scratching the cardboard when I am away for classes and I ca n't let him out to play . But , so far they do n't know what it is and they do n't seem that excited to play with it . I hope they learn to play with it eventually as they grow older .
5 #### Mickey can independently play by himself with this toy . He loves it and I love it
4 #### My cat does n't really use the scratcher part ( wish she did ) . She does like to play with the ball part though . We have a camera where we can watch her when we 're not home , and she plays with this toy when she is alone more than any of her other toys , so I really love it for that .
5 #### This is great toy to keep them busy ! ( All 5 ) They especially Love the center to scratch . I ended up ordering one for my sister 's cat & one for my father 's cat , and their cats have enjoyed it aswell ! Sturdy , and the ball is heavy and secured in the circle . No worrying about them being able to get it out ! It is also made in the USA . Very impressed ! Totally recommend it ! And at this price , get everyone with a cat one !
5 #### I 've tried scratching posts and scratching rugs with little success . This was the first product that actually helped combat my cat 's carpet clawing addiction . She uses this all the time , and the cardboard lasts for quite a while . I 've had it for a month and it 's still going strong . She also likes to sleep on it for some reason .
5 #### Our cat loves ping pong balls over every other type of toy , but we lose them all the time - honestly , I ca n't understand some of the places she gets them stashed into ! I was n't sure that this was going to interest her since she ca n't run with it , but she loves it . She 'll either lay on her side and bat the ball around , or stand on the middle and push it back and forth . She has n't used the scratching pad so we bought the plant insert ( have n't tried it yet . ) Next step is the second ball level which I think will blow her mind .
5 #### The cats ( and the dog actually ) love this thing !
5 #### I 've seen this ALL OVER Instagram . Price dropped , and I could n't resist getting it for my cat . Surprisingly she was actually more interested in it than the shipping box it came in , lol ! She , of course , checked it out for awhile , before actually playing with it , but has since kept it in rotation with her endless amounts of toys ; as well as uses the scratcher .
5 #### This is the same food my vet carries , but the price is so much better .
5 #### All my vets as I 've moved around the country , have agreed this company 's food is good quality . My cats did n't like the flavor I got , so I did n't reorder this one . But I order a different one from them monthly .
5 #### I first started feeding my pets Hill 's Science Diet back in 1984 , when my beautiful black Manx cat , Joey , developed urinary tract problems and the vet recommended it . Switching to Science Diet ended Joey 's problems and he had a healthy , comfortable life for his remaining years . So of course when we got a Pomeranian puppy in 2008 , we started him out on Science Diet right away - and its the only food he likes ! Flash forward to 2016 and once again , I share my home with a fur baby . Shota is a beautiful part - Bengal rescue cat to whom I gradually switched to Science Diet Adult Indoor Dry Cat Food . He loves it ! And he 's healthy and happy . I highly recommend Hill 's Science Diet Cat Food for your fur baby - and as usual , Amazon has the best prices I have found .
3 #### It 's OK , My cats would not eat any of it , so I gave it to the local shelter . . . no complainants there .
5 #### We originally started buying this 10 + years ago at a little pet store near our house . One of our cats has a sensitive tummy and another is just plain picky . We found this to sit well with both of them , they all love it . We usually stray from the " fish " formulas simply because of the cat with tummy issues . We have a memory of trying a can once and it not sitting well . That 's why we like the chicken formula , have n't had any troubles with it . Occasionally a local big box pet store will be having a special with coupons etc . and I 'll grab a few cans , but primarily ordering on amazon saves me money with these cans - you get 12 12.5 oz cans for around $ 30 . If you pay much more than $ 30 you 're over spending . I 've ordered 100 + cans of wet food via amazon , and while not all of them arrive in pristine condition , I have n't had any catastrophic events ; leaking cans , cans packed with breakable items etc . These cans do n't have a pop open top , which to me is the only draw back . You MUST use a can opener .
5 #### Healthiest & best cat food so far . My Siamese cats are very fussy about their food but this is the only brand they love . Virginia LiCalsi Cohen
4 #### I am more cautious of the snacks that I feed my fur babies . They are family so I wo n't buy those cheap milk bone snacks or anything . Love these and dog love them too
5 #### I am more cautious of the snacks that I feed my fur babies . They are family so I wo n't buy those cheap milk bone snacks or anything . Love these and dog love them too
5 #### I have a little kitten and she just loves batting the ball around in circles , it 's pretty sturdy and well made only thing I would add is rubber grips on the bottom so it does move around all over the floor
4 #### our spoiled diva , " Jordy Nelson " , loved it , but this is how she shows appreciate , she just takes ownership .. but cats love changing the ball ....
5 #### My daughter came home to visit with her dog and brought this chew toy with him . My dog decided he liked it and took it from him . So I bought this one to replace it . Needless to say , he loves his chew toy .
4 #### This chew toy is loved by the dog , not by me . It lasts a long time and holds the dogs interest BUT after chewing a bit , it has sharp edges and when the dog drops it at your feet- it 's HARD and SHARP . No thanks . I 'm picking something a little softer next time .
4 #### Our pup loves to play with and then chew on something . This is a long lasting toy and dental chew . I have no fear that he will choke on too big a piece of it . He can gnaw or chew on it .
5 #### Nylabones are the best . Our dogs love them . Bought this smaller one for our frenchie and she loves it . Awesome
3 #### I was disappointed in this one - Nylabone Durable toys are the only toys I buy for my powerful chewers because they are the most durable I 've found to withstand their chewing . This one did not live up to the Nylabone Durable name . I gave it to one of my dogs , who is not the most aggressive chewer in the pack and I had to take it away from him the first day because he was able to destroy part of it and chew off pieces . I will go back to the Nylabone Durable Souper bones from now on !
3 #### The nubs are pretty sharp on these . I noticed blood on the one my husky was chewing on , and she 's not an aggressive chewer . My German Shepherd also had one , and he seemed to do fine with it . Though after about 15 minutes of moderate chewing , he lost interest in it , and has n't picked it up since . Neither dog is that interested in these after the initial first chew .
5 #### just what I wanted . I would recommend this to anyone . tell your friends and family . Shipping is good , too . On time .
3 #### Our adult cat eats it under duress , only if she gets nothing else . Does not like it .
4 #### OK so cats do n't love it , but they eventually eat it all . No problems with digestion . And I feel better that they 're not eating euthanized shelter pets and roadkill .
3 #### A great brand for general health and for my diabetic cat , but the trout / salmon combo is not a favorite . I can only feed this occasionally and then the cats wo n't always eat it .
5 #### Ordered Saturday , arrived Monday ! Great service for a product that my cats can not do without ! So happy to find a cat food without fish causing allergies
5 #### My cat loves this food ! We switched my kitty to this brand when she was diagnosed with a thyroid condition she begant o loose weight . Our vet insisted that we change her diet to a no grain , high protein diet . I spent over a week reading the labels on close to 25 well known brands , We found that most had alot of fillers and were over processed . We found only Wellness had the higher protein content . The food has been a great compliment to her medication and she is gaining weight . Her coat is shiny and her eyes are bright again . I would recommend this cat food to anyone who loves their kitty !
4 #### When my cat had to go on a urinary so diet for chronic crystals he lost a significant amount if weight , and the cost of the prescription food is almost unaffordable . I have been supplementing the rx food with this one , and he is slowly putting back on a healthy weight , with no new urinary crystals . Four stars because it could use a bit more wettness to avoid hard stools , and the cost , while cheaper than in pet food stores , is still a bit much .
5 #### This is nice food for my girl . She is an indoor cat so . I do n't want her to get fat . She seems happy with it .
5 #### Cat eats it . Cat loves it . Never pukes . Never shuns . Cat still alive and well . So five stars .
4 #### This was recommended to me by a shopper in PetCo when she saw my Pit Bull . She had a Pibble as well and she said her dog loved them . I remember seeing it on Amazon before for much cheaper than what they were selling it for at PetCo so I ordered it . It is not my dog 's " go to " toy but she does chew it often . I had tried other nylabone products that my dog just would n't bother with so I was pleased that she seems to like this one . I 'd say go ahead and give it a try ... iit 's cheap enough and you might luck out like I did . I would n't pay too much attention to the reviewers that claim it breaks their dogs teeth . I question their responsibility as a dog owner rather than the chew toy . Those are the type of dog owners that probably do n't monitor their dogs when they give them a toy . I only allow my dog about 20 minutes with any given chew toy . No one should let their dog sit there and chew on something all day .. especially unattended
5 #### This is the only toy my dog has n't destroyed within a few hours ( except a kong ball ) . I m not sure if she gets bored with it or if its just that durable ? Its a cute little toy just do n't leave the son of a gun where you can step on it ! It hurts worse than a lego !
5 #### I purchased these for both my dogs , one of which is a very strong chewer . They hold up extremely well and have given my dogs hours of pleasure with little wear . Also gave one as a gift to a gold retriever and received the same review from his mom . I will certainly continue to purchase these and recommend them highly !
5 #### I should have ordered more . all 5 dogs of varying size love to chew on it for hours . so far , no choking issues
5 #### My 6 week old kitten loves this . I got it for her a few weeks ago , she was n't really interested in it at 1st , I think she was too young . I left it out where she 'd have access to it and now she 'll come back to it many times during the day to play with it . She is very much a morning kitten and this keeps her occupied so I can drink my coffee .
5 #### Had to get a second one of these as one of my young and playful cats loves these . He runs back and forth and plays with them both
4 #### Wish it stuck to the floor because it moves around so easily and my cats get frustrated/ bored
5 #### I bought one of these in the late 1990s , and it 's still going strong . The cats I had then loved it , as have the other four kitties who have lived with me over the last twenty years . They especially love it when I drape a piece of tissue paper over part of the track . This is the gift I buy for every friend who brings home a new cat . Simple and wonderful . And ( human ) toddlers are fascinated by it ...
5 #### Best dog food for sensitive digestive system . Fast shipping
5 #### My little pup pup loves eating these and are very easy on her stomach . Such a great price on Amazon compared to Petco .
5 #### My dog is so picky that she wo n't eat most treats . In fact , this is the only treat she 'll eat . She loves it . She 's almost 15 years old and has trouble eating hard foods but she manages to gobble these up quickly .
5 #### When I adopted my kitten I noticed they had several of these in the play pens . My cat absolutely loves it , plays with the ball and uses the middle to sharpen his claws .
5 #### Both my cats scratch this all the time and one of my lazy cats absolutely LOVES pushing the ball around . 10/10 would recommend to cats .
5 #### One of my cats gets wet food , and I buy this , exclusively , for him . I tried other flavors and they were very ... soupy . This one , the consistency has remained as it should . My cat gets 6 meals out of it ( you can stretch it to 8 if they 're overweight ) . It works out to approximately 33 cents a serving for him which is far less expensive than other wet food products .
3 #### My cat is not a huge fan of this food . It 's dryer and more dense than the chicken only version ( with pieces of carrot big enough for a human meat pie ) . I 'm not completely sure but I think my cat votes against the carrots included in this mix . When I offer him two cans to choose from he always chooses the other one ( I am yet to introduce the control can of peas ) . I wo n't be ordering this one again . Maybe a dog would like it ...
5 #### This food has been a life saver for my diabetic cat . She has been able to completely come off insulin with two daily feedings of Wellness grain free canned food . For a cat with blood sugars previously in the 300 - 350 range with twice a day ear sticks & twice a day insulin , the normalization of her blood sugar ( 110 - 140 ) is nothing short of a miracle .. Yes , there has been much wailing & knashing of teeth at coming cold turkey off of dry food , but she loves the canned Wellness . Cats do n't tolerate carbs , & all dry foods have carbs . Only a few dry foods have the less than 10 % carbs recommended ( Nature 's Variety Instinct & EVO are two ) . Check out the chart prepared by Dr. Lisa Pierson , DVM for nutritional composition of cat foods . * * Be aware that any change in your cat 's diet will affect his / her insulin requirements . Switching from dry food to canned food without drastically reducing insulin CAN KILL YOUR CAT ! Check with your vet for instructions on how to decrease insulin . * *
3 #### I buy food to tailor to each of our cats needs . This was purchased for our 2 year old female calico . Occasionally , we 'll catch the other two cats trying to eat her food , so we know it 's good . She barely eats it though . We believe it 's because the pellets / kibble / food ( whatever you want to call it ) are so large , it 's difficult for her . She 's petite . We 're going to try the Optimal Care by Science Diet as soon as this bag is finished . If I could critique this food : Make the kibble smaller , and we 'll come back to this particular selection .
4 #### A mainstay in my home for years . Not the best quality but not so bad that I feel guilty feeding it to my boys and girls . The new bag is better due to the velcro closure , but holds a pound less food than the old bag did . The old bag was handy for putting cans or other garbage into the for the reason this bag is superior , the top does n't seal up well after opening on the old bags .
5 #### The cats love it and it 's good for them - what more can you ask !
5 #### Nom , nom , , nom ( not for me though ... for the kitties ... )
5 #### The cat loves it . I love that the cat loves it .
3 #### I have a shepherd and a shepherd / lab mix . They love to chew on bones and antlers . I thought that would be bigger and my dogs chewed on they but only after their antlers were gone . If you have a smaller sized dog I would recommend this product . If you have larger dogs like I do and they like to chew than I would not recommend this product .
4 #### Just as pictured and described . A dyno - nylabone dog chew toy . Has the little nodules to supposibly stimulate gums . Basically it is what they say it is and I have no complaints . I feel it is a great value and was cheaper than our local pet store .
5 #### We have two medium sized mutts and they love to chew . When I took this out of the package ( I got the Brontosaur ) our Border Collie mix went nuts . He carries this around everywhere . We 've gotten Nylabones before and they last a very , very long time . Since this one is made in the USA we appreciate it even more .
5 #### My puppy usually does n't like " bumply " toys but he adores this one . I have the Stegosaurus one . The puppy carries this toy everywhere with him . It has the Fresh Taste which my puppy loves the best . Go figure !
5 #### My cats love this thing , they 've had it for months and do n't get tired of it . They do n't play with it all day , but it 's a great addition to their other toys .
5 #### I have a Pitt bull who is allergic to everything . No matter what treats I would buy she would start shaking her head & scratching her ears to a point that she would make them bleed . Also she would bite her paws that she would make them raw . From the time that I ordered these treats she has not scratched her ears or biting her paws . This is a great product .
5 #### Purchased the biscuits for my dog who has a sensitive stomach & she loves them ! I also buy this item that 's the dog food .
4 #### These treats are a great little size , perfect for frequent treating during training . They did n't seem to agree with my dogs ' stomach though , but he has an abnormally sensitive stomach so it probably wo n't be an issue for most people .
3 #### Have ordered these in the past , this shipment seems to be a harder crunchier cookie , does n't break apart as easily , harder for my older dog to eat .
5 #### Glad that the limited ingredient diet is used for this product so the dogs can have treats !
5 #### If you have a cat you need this toy . its really that simple.i have never met a cat or ferret who do n't love it . My cats ignore it for weeks at a time , and then its their number one favorite again for a month . Our home has had one or more for the past 10 years or so .
5 #### I have purchased 3 of these over the last year and all my cats love them . The noise of the ball being knocked around at 3AM is , of course , an added bonus that only cat owners will understand . These are sturdy and can easily be refilled , either by buying the refills here on Amazon or at one of the big box stores . I buy refilled 2 at a time and usually end up changing the scratchers about every 2 months or so , depending on use .
5 #### All three of my cats love this thing ! There usually at least one playing with or laying on it . I also usually put catnip over the scratching board , they love it when I do that !
5 #### Who would have thought such a simple cat toy would be so much fun for them . They love this .
5 #### Paid $ 11.61 with free shipping . All kitties like it in some way or another . Whether it 's playing with the ball , scratching , or just sitting in the center . It 's easy to clean and you can replace the cardboard with these&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Bergan - Turbo - Scratcher - Replacement - Pads-2 - Pack / dp / B0002AS1CC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Bergan Turbo Scratcher Replacement Pads , 2 Pack</a > .
5 #### Size is perfect , my cat sits in the middle or lays across the middle and plays with the balls . Not all of these type of ball chasers allow for that . She loves jumping on it and laying across it !
5 #### this is a pretty tough nylon ! My Staffordshire Terrier chews on this quite frequently . I am happy with anything that lasts over a week . She has had this since Christmas !
4 #### I just bought this product for my 2 50 + lbs dogs . They seem to like it and I 'm hoping it durable enough to last a few months .
5 #### Our Aussie , Iggy , is an extreme chewer , and this $ 5 bone is worth it . It 's smaller than I had expected but , even after a month Iggy has only destroyed the head . She will happily chew on this ( when we redirect her ) . The first couple times she used it her spit was pink so I think her gums might have bled a little , but that stopped . We will be purchasing more Nylabones as they are so affordable , long lasting , CLEAN , ( unlike rope toys that can be distributed throughout your house fiber by color fiber ) and enjoyable chew toys found . Caution : stepping on this toy in the dark can bring a full grown person to their knees . Use care when left out ( or always wear slippers )
5 #### I buy these for my 3 dogs all the time , our local store stopped selling them so I am glad I found them on line . They are very hard and can stand up to a terrier with a ferocious chew power as well as a 90 pound Mastif . We love dinosaurs at our house , so they fit right in !
4 #### For some odd reason I thought these were chewable , which clearly they 're not . I 'm not exactly how sure the dental part works in , I have n't noticed better breath or less tarter . It 's a hard plastic toy , luckily for me my dog knows better than to eat the pieces she chews off , she just spits them out . If your dog is n't that way I would nt recommend as it could do inner damage or atleast monitor your dog . I m giving the product 4 stars because it did arrive earlier than expected , it does keep my dog entertained , she s more interested in chewing this toy than furniture . She seems happy with it so i m happy .
5 #### I chose this rating because our dogs are strong chewers . I ordered 2 and am glad I did . The dogs love them . If you have a hard chewer you might like to get them one of these . They hold up well -- better than the bones did for our dogs . ( so far they have n't chewed any part off ) .
2 #### Its very dry pate that does not stay fresh at all . Not worth the money .
1 #### I am back one more time to update my review . The price on this keeps fluctuating wildly , and mostly upward every 3 days or so . My 4 cats are unanimous to let me know they wo n't eat it without a full can of sardines mixed in . There are some better and less expensive foods out there- see my reviews .I will donate my remainders
4 #### I liked the price and the quality too bad most of my cats did n't eat it !
4 #### Very high quality and palatable . 4 adult cats eat about 2.3 cans per day .
3 #### Very high - quality food but the cats did not care for this flavor compared to others by this brand . Wish the cans were pop - top and a full 13 - oz size . This flavor seems to be palatable and 4 adult cats seem satisfied with 2 - 3 cans per day though they are sometimes still hungry between meals .

4 #### Very high - quality , palatable food . Wish the cans were pop - top and a full 13 - oz size . This flavor seems to be palatable and 4 adult cats seem satisfied with 2 - 3 cans per day though they are sometimes still hungry between meals .
5 #### My cats love the Wellness Turkey recipe . I have one finicky kitten , but he eats up all his plate of Turkey Wellness .
5 #### My baby loves them ! Best price I have encountered so far !
5 #### These are small treats but our 90 # Lab does n't seem to mind . Guess he likes the sweet potato and fish taste anyway .
5 #### My dogs love this flavor and are so good for them .
5 #### My dogs love this treat . Very satified with fast delivery .
5 #### Smaller bag is easier to handle snd the kibble stays fresher than when I get a big bag .
5 #### This is the food that every vet we have had recommends . It is not inexpensive , but of all of the high - end foods we have given our cats , this does seem to have the best results . They eat just what they need and do n't gorge themselves ; because of this , an expensive bag of food will last a lot longer than a bag of cheap food ( we refer to this stuff as ' potato chips ' at home , because the cats will never stop eating the junk food if you feed it to them ) . So it becomes a question of what you 're willing to pay for a premium food . For some people , the assurance of their pet 's well - being is more than enough to justify the expense . Others wo n't care what the critter eats , while a lot of us fall somewhere in between --- purchasing food which is pretty good , but is n't quite at the level of Hill 's . The choice is yours .
4 #### Our cat likes this food . Have had not problems .
5 #### My big dog ( 70 lbs ) absolutely loved this Dinosaur Chew and had it chomped up quickly . I think she is too big for this little chew . I thought it was bigger based on the picture and had it been , may have worked out better . She ate a lot of it and it did not agree with her so we tossed it after it was half gone . I 'm giving 5 stars because my dog really did like it !
5 #### My dogs are aggressive chewers and often go through toys quickly . Anything Nylabone is generally good and I really like these Dinosaurs . They wear well and do n't ever have large dangerous pieces chipping off . Definitely recommend this product .
5 #### Our dino looks slightly different than the picture , but my little maltese still loves it . Had it for about a month and he picks it up and runs with it , chews on it and then puts it down . For some reason this is a toy he goes to when he gets really worked up to come down .
3 #### My cat likes the scratch pad but does not play with the ball .
5 #### My cat loves it . Do n't loose the ball or it 's worthless . Wish it came with an extra ball .
5 #### My cats love this ! No digestive problems with it at all .
5 #### My cats like the turkey , beef and chicken , and chicken wellness canned food . I buy the 12 packs , because I have seven cats , all rescues . I have found that the vet bills can be incredibly reduced by feeding my animals wholesome food ... They also eat Blue Buffalo . Finding Amazon selling Wellness has been a godsend . Compared to prices at the pet stores , Amazon 's prices represent significant savings . And as long as my cats are happy ..... etc . , etc .
5 #### My beagle / jack russel mix loves these s ! He has two that he trades off on . He has had them for many months and they still have quite a bit of the bodies left . The poor Trex is missing his head , and most of his tail and legs while the brontosaurus is only missing his tail . My dog is a power chewer despite his size - he 's chewed through one of those black extreme kongs in one 8 hour work shift- so these harder Nylabone toys are great for us . I will probably be buying more once he can no longer chew on these .
5 #### Little Brown Pup really likes chewing on this , and she seems to know it 's not for burying . Huzzah for chew toys that stay in the house !
2 #### I was so excited just before Christmas to find these at such a reasonable price since they Nylabone - our dogs are generally crazy about them - but these two have gone virtually untouched . I think are they are a little harder and the spikes are pretty ' rough ' ... we have two dogs - large and medium and neither one are too taken with them . We will most likely offer them to the dogs next door to try ....
5 #### I have a medium sized dog that weighs about 25 pounds , and this dino is a great size for her . She 's a rather aggressive chewer , so I have to make sure things I give her are durable enough to last more then one chewing session . She 's been chewing on this for nearly a month now wich is a record for the length of time a chew toy has survived her chewing , and it still has a lot of chewing left in it . I would recomend this for any dog who likes to chew . I think a dog the size of a Labrador retriever would be ok with this toy , based on the size of it , but I 'm not sure about a dog larger then that . My 25 pound mix breed ( about the size of a westie ) sometimes has to work to pick it up , because of it 's size so I do n't recomend it for a dog smaller then mine because they may not beable to carry it or move it into a comfy chewing position .
2 #### I think it is too hard and could damage their teeth . Dogs like things hard but with a little give
3 #### This toy is good quality . However , my cat did not enjoy it as much as I thought she would . She barely plays with it . All that she does is sit on the center .
5 #### Cat goes berserk for this toy . The best value in cat toys i 've ever seen .
5 #### Our terrier mix dog loves these treats and they are excellent quality ingredients .
4 #### My cats had no problem adjusting to this kibble , and they seemed to like it well enough . Overall , the cat food has quality ingredients , including chicken as the first . I do have a problem with the corn gluten additive . This is an unnecessary ingredient for cat food since cats can not digest corn , so it acts only as a cheap filler . The same goes for the brewers rice , wheat gluten , whole grain wheat . But the corn is the only ingredient that may cause allergies .
5 #### Good food but my cats do n't like it . I ordered it my mistake .
5 #### My cats -- not picky by nature -- hesitated a bit when I first offered this food . I ca n't vouch for the taste , and they 're not talking , but there must have been a discernible difference between the Hill 's product and their normal IAMS food . However , after a couple of days of transition , they really seemed to like this . One thing that I noticed was that the bag seemed to last a long time . This food must have been filling and satisfying as well as tasty because they did n't seem to eat as much ( and they will eat ! ) . There were no digestive problems either . I like the velcro closure on the bag that made it simple to open and close . The food appeared to stay fresh . No complaints from my 2 felines or me .
5 #### The only thing I did n't do was contact Wellness and assure myself that they do n't spray the inside of their cans with BADGE or any of the preservatives that the canning industry is notorious for . Their food is delicious ... according to my cats . I wish they would put out one with a bit more texture , but the content of their cat food is important ... no grain ... and that is why I purchased it ... and through Amazon , it has arrived promptly and in near perfect condition . I have had only one or two cans with a slight dent . And with Amazon , I have compared prices ... and Amazon can not be beaten .
1 #### I am always trying to find good cat food , and there is a lot of garbage out there . I thought this product was okay in the past but then noticed " carageenan " , considered a carcinogen , on the label . I will sacrifice the $ 16 or so and pitch the unopened cans in the garbage rather than again subject any cat to the health risks .
5 #### My cat loves this food , and I feel good about feeding it to her . I 've done a LOT of research about what foods to give her , and this is the one that fit the budget and the requirements . Love it . Highly recommended . :)
5 #### My cat loves it and she 's had no issues with it as far as GI signs go . She s a very picky cat so I 'm happy she eats it .
3 #### My cat initially preferred this Wellness flavor over the other 5 that I tried on him , but he tired of it after 4 or 5 cans , which were interspersed with other Wellness flavors .
1 #### We breed cats and not one cat in our house likes this flavor from Wellness . They do like the wellness kitten core in the purple can a little bit more .
5 #### My cat always loves these and a great price
5 #### My cat loves this . Just sprinkled on the included catnip and she 's in heaven . Great buy !
5 #### OUR CATS LOVES THIS AND WE LOVE WATCHING HIM PLAY WITH IT . WE HAVE TWO OF THEM , ONE UPSTAIRS AND ONE DOWNSTAIRS . OUR CATS CAN GET THE BALL OUT OF THE BLUE BUT NOT THE RED ONE . WE DIDN'T BUY THEM AT THE SAME TIME , YEARS APART . SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A MANUFACTURING CHANGE OR IF THEY WERE MADE BY DIFFERENT COMPANIES OR WHAT . WHEN WE SEE HE HAS GOTTEN THE BALL OUT IN THE BLUE , WE REPLACE IT ON THE TRACK . BOTH CATS ARE SO MUCH FUN TO WATCH WHEN PLAYING WITH THIS . I WOULD THINK THAT EVERY CAT HOUSEHOLD WOULD WANT THIS . IT 'S GREAT EXCERCISE FOR THE CAT .
5 #### Have it 3 stars ... our cats fav toy ... No better review then that
3 #### Thought it would be more well received by great dane puppy , but he only picks it up once in a great while .
5 #### A little smaller than I imagined , but it 's nice to have a different shape Nyla in the house . Dogs are enjoying them !
3 #### Despite having this chew toy for several weeks my 7 - month old Rottweiler puppy has barely given it a second glance . She is an avid chewer and enjoys other Nylabone products . It seems to be a durable product and the ridges are unique but none of that matters if pups do n't find it engaging . Thankfully it is an inexpensive toy and who knows - there is always a chance she will become more interested in it as she gets older .
5 #### I bought one of these initially just to see if my dogs would like it . They ALL love it and fight over it , so I ended up getting more ( not that that stopped my one dog from hoarding all of them ) . Just be warned that you may not get the dinosaur pictured on Amazon . I got two stegosauruses and one t - rex .
5 #### We have two lab mixes . The youngest is still very much in puppy stage and boy does he love to chew ! We had given him rawhides to keep his focus on something appropriate to chew , but he was going through too many rawhides . I saw nylabones in petsmart in the heavy chewers section . The first plain bone went over well . So I ordered more on Amazon . I 'm so glad I did ! These were the best solution to keep our chewer occupied ! He loves all the different shapes and flavor toys that they have ! Thank goodness for nylabones !
1 #### Do not get this if you care about your dogs . I called Nylabone up to complain about this product . They said it is not for chewers . My dog is a golden retriever . Within 2 minutes of biting on it , it started to come apart .
5 #### My dog seems to like these they are bulky enough to break into a few pieces for training treats . quick to ship and just like we expected . Our bully approves
3 #### The dogs love it , I do n't . They are fine treats but they are for big dogs , not small dogs and it does n't say that on the package or in the description . They are so hard I needed tools to break them for the miniature poodle . The Lab loved them . She ended up with most of them because they were so hard to break
5 #### I adore NB products . I can understand the ingredient list , dogs LOVE them and I feel good about giving these .
5 #### cats love it . mix with sd adult light hairball control dry food
4 #### My cats love this food ! They 're both older , indoor cats , over 12 years old and seem to have no stomach issues with it . The ingredient that does n't thrill me is the Corn Gluten Meal because that 's really just filler . But really , when cats are older and they can keep it down with no upset then it 's fine with me .
5 #### Love science diet . They supply all the food to our big animal shelter here in Denver . Good quality food , very reasonable price !
5 #### Hills Science Diet Feline Adult Multiple Benefit Cat Food has no artificial colors , flavors , or preservatives . It supports ideal body weight for cats with different body conditions . It promotes healthy digestion for easy litter box clean up . My two cats love to eat - oh how they love to eat ! I feed them half a can each of wet food twice a day but always leave dry food out for them which they devour . My cats are n't overweight yet - but the vet did warn me to watch when I feed them so I am thrilled with Hills Science Diet Feline Adult Multiple Benefit Cat Food . My cats are getting the dry food they love plus vitamins , minerals , and amino acid . My cats love this cat food and digest it quite well - I have not seen any kitty throw up ( which is been an issue in the past when my cats eat too fast ) or hair balls since I started using this . My cats still use the litter box quite a bit but I have n't had to clear up any nasty messes since they started eating this cat food . My cats and I love Hills Science Diet Feline Adult Multiple Benefit Cat Food !
4 #### My bullies love Nylabones , they are the one thing that they do not destroy ! I got them these & the big smooth bone 2 pack for Christmas . Those were a big hit , these they do n't seem to like . I do not know if it 's the flavor or texture . . . They have the big smooth heavy bone looking Nylabones which they like okay , they have the BIG nubby ones which they love , so I thought they would like these but they looked at them , chewed on them a little & left them for the big smooth flavored ones in the 2 pack . Those they chew on daily along with the big nubby ones . Maybe it 's the flavor . They have Nylabones that are 3 years old !
5 #### My 80 lb puppy destroys most toys in a day but he 's still gnawing on his dinosaur and it keep him busy , too .
1 #### It 's durable because it is made of a solid very hard plastic material . My dog is a large dog , 85 lbs , and has only tried to chew on this once or twice since receiving it . She even cracked one of her canine teeth on it . I would n't recommend it . Mine has already found it 's way to the garbage can . Broken teeth ? No thanks !
5 #### My dog had the Stegosaurus and he loved being able to chew on the tail and head that were smaller than most other nylabones . I am really hoping he gets that one again , but he loved this more than he usually likes nylabones !
5 #### This turned out to be a big hit with my dog Mario . He loves it . I love it too because it keeps him busy and out of my hair for a while .
5 #### Love nylabone no rawhide and our pug loves this dino . Will last him probably years . Recommend nylabone made in USA .
2 #### I did n't realize this toy was as hard as a rock . Maybe it would work for grown dogs , but not pups with baby teeth and mine chews everything . I thought it would be good be for my chewer .
5 #### I have a 12 yo Manx whose developed bladder issues , and have had to switch him to all wet , which pleases the other two no end . They absolutely loves this stuff , and this seems to be the favorite flavor . Price is right , too .
4 #### My cats have been eating this food for a few years now , at the recommendation of our vet , who advised us to feed them a high - quality wet cat food without fillers . The cats love it , but ... As other reviewers have noted , the production is inconsistent . We 've received several batches of cat food that are extremely wet , runny , and so loose , that there ca n't possibly be as much actual food in the can as in a normal batch . I wish Wellness would address this , as they produce an otherwise stellar product .
5 #### Cats love this , fluffing paws and chasing the ball
5 #### Two year old cat loves it . He rarely touches it after a couple months now , but catnip always helps .
5 #### Not as good as the puffs , but they will work for the puppy treats .
5 #### All pieces are intact , Isabella loves them ! Duck and Lamb is her favorite .
4 #### Good for a change and for dogs who have digestion issues
3 #### This rain poncho is great for keeping your dog 's back , sides , chest and head dry . It is easy to put on and also easy to take off . Snaps at chest and velcro under stomach insure a perfect and secure fit .
5 #### We own a black lab and he is a massive chewer ..... with they Nylabone Toys and some training included .... our black lab chews his toys only . we rub peanut butter , low fat cream cheese and he loves it ! ! ! Nylabone products are the best !
5 #### My dog is a chewer- he destroys anything he is given the chance to . He chews on this thing for hours every night . Just lays on the floor and chews it . And it is still intact . It 's amazing . He will be able to continue chewing it for a looooong time ! Side note : it REALLY hurts when you do n't notice he has left it in the middle of a walking path and you step on it .
1 #### My Pit Brock chewed his head off in one hour ! if you have a pit do n't waste your $ $ $ not worth it
5 #### If I did n't know better I 'd say this was people food . It smells OK . Does n't break down into that runny mud substance if you need to nuke it . My vet said to return food to room temperature if it 's been refrigerated . Cat would eat it all day every day .
1 #### Review updated 2/2018 : Does anyone know if Wellness has changed the formula ? This was the go - to food for years , but it now both flavors ( Chicken & Herring , Turkey & Salmon ) give her THE RUNS . Poor baby ! As soon as I switch in another brand of wet food , her digestion improves . My earlier review : Kitty eats ; I love . In combination with some short play sessions , this wet food has been particularly effective in helping our once - overweight adult cat shed several pounds . A caution : when trying to meet the free shipping minimum , I order a case of this food along w/ only sturdy / unbreakable things ; Amazon has a habit of just dumping other items into the mailing box w/o other filler , and the cat food will knock them around during shipping .
3 #### My cat loves to just sit on it .. and nothing else ... It has become her sitting area .
5 #### I chose this one because it was bigger than other similar toys that I found on Amazon . They may look the same on the photo , but the diameter is different . This one has decent size and my cat likes to play with the ball every now and then .
5 #### Omg thank you so much . I opened the box over 30 minutes ago and my little ones have not stopped playing with this ! ! They love it . Now one is laying on each side and they push it back and forth to each other . So worth the money ! Thanks !
1 #### Too big and my cat did not like it .
5 #### I am giving this food 5 stars specifically because of the excellent treatment I received from Amazon . Unfortunately only one of my 4 cats was able to eat this food . The size of the nuggets was just too large for them , and frankly only the one- my 10 yr old tabby- seemed to really like it . I called Amazon and told them I needed to return it for this reason , and they returned my $ very kindly with no problem- also without having to send the food back . I ended up giving it away to the local animal shelter . I am sure this is great food and I have no problem with Science Diet/ Hills- just too chunky for my critters to chew . Thank you !
4 #### I agree with the reviewer who called Hill 's Science Diet Feline Adult Multiple Benefit Cat Food a slow sell . Our cats definitely do n't prefer this dry food , but they will eat it . Anytime there is a change in food for cats , there can be a period of transition . I take comfort in knowing the health benefits offered here .
5 #### another excellent cat food . this one is chicken based . bottom line is my cat readily eat this . and we know cats can be finicky about their food .
2 #### My cat does n't do well with this formula . He can handle some grains but I think this contains too high a percentage ... corn and wheat are very high on the ingredient list . He throws up frequently with this one . Also , they advertise less in the litterbox but there is an obvious increase I 'd imagine due to the grains / fillers . He also does n't prefer the larger kibble size , and he 's a fairly large cat . I also do not appreciate the addition of soybean oil . There seems to be a lot of cheap fillers ( that are also likely GMO ) in this one and not the functional ingredients I 'm used to seeing in high quality pet food . The best formula I 've found , thus far , has been the Wellness brand hairball control . I will definitely be sticking to that one .
5 #### Our 25 lb . cockapoo and 75 lb . irish wolfhouse / poodle mix have finally found a toy they both like . For whatever reason they prefer Nylabones that have been a bit roughed up so we use a sander to get them chewing . I do n't worry about them tearing thru this and ingesting plastic so it 's a good one for us .
4 #### A friend of mine has a Border Collie who is a ruthless and devout chewer , who absolutely adores this toy . But , my Aussie is more of a fetcher than a chewer so although he 'll have his moments with it , it 's not his go to chew toy . Which is the only reason it lacks full stars for myself . But , despite my dogs personal preferences , as a product this is a great chew toy . If your dog has a tendency to chew through anything and everything for hours on end , I would absolutely recommend this to you .
5 #### I have two of these things ( T - Rex and stegosaurus ) and my two mini - dachshunds LOVE them . They 're very durable with no bits breaking off like some other bones , and they 're covered with tiny little nubby bumps that work to scrape and clean dogs ' teeth while they chew on them . These are very good chew toys , and I recommend them !
5 #### its a nylabone ( i.e. lasts a long time ) and a good size . I think dogs enjoy chewing on it because of the different shapes / angles .
5 #### My cat loves it ! My only wish is that we could decide color when we ordered . We got purple and would prefer blue or black ...
5 #### My cat always loses every ball I put down on the floor . There 's one that I still have yet to find . WELL THAT 'S NOT A PROBLEM ANYMORE . My knees give this 5 stars .
5 #### I love this , but only one of my cats does . The other just uses the scratching area , but does n't play with the ball . Still a great purchase .
4 #### I guess they liked it enough , that my 3y.o . male cat , Scratchy - Scratch - Off , tore it up .
5 #### We 've tried quite a few of the Natural Balance dog treats and the Lamb and Brown Rice treats are the favorite in our house . There are n't really any that the dogs dislike . But these treats are not only loved by dogs but they break into pieces more cleanly than any other . I love the fact that these are not much of a mess . Some of them , like the Sweet Potato and Venison treats , are a crumbly mess . Even if you give your dog a whole treat every time it seems impossible for them to get eaten without leaving crumbs behind . The Lamb and Brown Rice dog treats are the only Natural Balance dog treats I am going to continue buying .
5 #### Both of my dogs love these treats . They work well for training , and can be broken into even smaller treats if desired .
5 #### I love this brand indeed it to both my cats and my dogs and my puppies both love these treats ! ! They go crazy for me
5 #### my german shepherd would come running when he would hear the back rustle !
5 #### Small bag but the dogs love them and my dog with allergies is not breaking out from the ingredients .
4 #### We got a small 6 month kitten . This is as great except she got bored of it . I wish this brand had more options for kitten formula .
5 #### My cat has stomach problems . She can eat and likes wellness- but only if it also has chicken .
5 #### Best pet food on the market . I 've been buying from Amazon for a year now . Shipping is quick and it 's more economical than buying from my local pet / feed store . Never a problem with any of the cans , never had opened , damaged or dented cans . Easy choice for me .
5 #### Cats love it . No problems with throwing up . Good for multiple cat households .
5 #### The cats love it , and it does not seem to exacerbate the older cat 's allergies .
5 #### VERY GOOD QUALITY AND CONVENIENCE OF SHIPPING TO HOME
1 #### My cats normally love this food but the product I received was spoiled - opened a can the day it arrived and none of my three cats would touch it .
5 #### The most popular dry cat food in my household .
5 #### My cat loves this food . Granted , she 's not a picky eater and loves any cat food . But I like Science Diet , because when I adopted a previous cat , I was told by the shelter to always feed him Iams or Science Diet . ( That 's not meant as an endorsement of either brand -- that 's just what I was told . ) The one thing I 'd point out is that the size is a bit larger than other cat foods . I primarily feed my current cat Iams , which is quite a bit smaller . I caught her taking a piece out of her bowl , placing it on top of the wood feeder , and then eating it from there . This larger size causes some trouble for my cat , and I think she has a pretty normal - sized mouth . She 's not small , at about ten pounds . It slows down the eating process a bit , which could be a good thing if you 've got a cat that 's a voracious eater . I just do n't like seeing my cat struggle a bit with the size . Other than that , though , it 's a great cat food that she enjoys eating .
3 #### Truth be told , my cat is not finicky . She gets excited whenever I put any new food in the bowl , and it happened just that way when I brought out HIll 's Science Diet . There she was , patiently waiting . As soon as I left , she dug right in . Looks like another winner . I have to admit , this food smells like it really does have chicken . If I was on " Survivor " and Jeff Probst said eat cat food or else , I would n't mind having a taste . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ UPDATE 8/28/16 : I take it back , every last word . My cat has been doing nothing but hacking up hairballs . At first , it was just a little . Now , it 's multiple times per day . We 've had her for years and it 's never been this bad before . We 're switching out brands .
4 #### At least 1 out of 2 dogs enjoys it periodically . It definitely does n't get chewed down . The material is very , very hard and I had my doubts about it and the dogs teeth , . However both walmart and petsmart carry tons of nylabone stuff so I figured iT HAd to be alright or there would have been recalls . Me I do n't like it , but the dog does and since she does n't chew on it obsessively , unlike other things I 'm not too worried about her teeth .
5 #### Toys do n't last very long in my house . Between lab puppies , weenie dogs , fosters , and clients , I have tons of chew - monsters to help me redecorate , utilize toys , and frost the downstairs so I do n't usually buy anything that ca n't stand up . They are still here and they are still mostly intact . I would buy these again once the other nylabones are gone .
5 #### I gave this to my mastiff and she loves chewing on it . She has n't been able to break it up or chew any of it off , so it is good for dogs that are aggressive chewers . Would buy another one of these .
5 #### My cats love Wellness turkey and salmon recipe . My cats are very finicky about their wet food and I looked for a while to find one that they all liked . I have 5 cats and it was difficult to find one food that they all liked . Finally found it with Wellness . They all love it so I will continue buying it for them as they are very happy with their food . One thing about Wellness , it does not have a strong odor like other cat food . This is a big plus my book !
5 #### Great cat food . Cats should not be eating fish or grains and that is what most wet cat foods are made of . What cat in the wild eats fish ? And what cat in the wild eats grains ? I know it is expensive but you should treat your cat with respect and feed them what they deserve . BUY THIS NOW ! !
4 #### Great product , cats liked it . HOWEVER , note this is one of two Wellness wet food options that are NOT grain free . My guys need grain free formulas , and I did n't realize upon purchase that this was not . Aside from that , good product .
5 #### Wonderful healthy choice for my kitties ! Best price anywhere ! I think they must get a discount from the company because a lot of the cans are dented , but I do n't mind because it means that I get the product cheaper and I 've never had any issues with freshness .
5 #### I got this for my little blind kitten as it makes noise and the ball is predictable . I LOVE it and so does my cat ! It is very sturdy and I highly recommend !
5 #### My cat is always sitting or playing on this . Real cute
3 #### My cats liked it at first , but only if I spin the ball for them . They do n't use it was a scratcher .
5 #### I sprinkle cat nip in the middle pad , and have put more balls in it that move at different speeds . She likes it and the noise of the balls hitting and rolling let 's me know she 's having fun .
5 #### Very strong . Great length . Everything wonderful . Well , until my husband found my stash . So I bought him his own so I can keep some in my supply - stash ! Fun .
5 #### Bought these for my Boston Terrier 's and found that all our dogs go absolutely crazy over them . The limited ingredients is the only foods I buy anymore because it has completely eliminated any allergies my dog has . Definitely will continue to purchase these items .
5 #### My dog loves these ! Bonus , they are small so they are good for training .
5 #### supports ideal body weight promotes healthy digestion no artificial colors or preservatives chicken recipe 7 pounds bag has a resealable top made in the usa this is a brand we already get from our vets for our cats . What I like this brand makes it so my cats do not eat as much . They eat far more of the off brand we get than this one . Not as much throwing up either . the first ingredient is Chicken which is even nicer .
5 #### Great cat food that my finicky feline will finally eat . I love Hill 's Science Diet products . Always rich on flavor and quality and my cat loves it . Science Diet does cost a tad more than anything I would normally buy in the supermarket . However , you get what you pay for and I know my cat is worth it and her health is my upmost priority .
4 #### I have two cats : one is elderly with digestive issues that seem to do better with low carb food , and the other is a slightly younger kitty who seems to packing on a few pounds . Both have lived inside for several years . They both are eating the Scence Diet Feline Adult Food with no negative results . I mix it with their regular dry food to very slowly introduce it into their diet . If they start having issues with the food I will update this review .
4 #### My cats can be so picky about their food for about the last year . If I can actually get them to eat anything buy Fancy Fest , it is a win and this is a win . They actually eat this one very good and I love it helps control weight and helps with hairballs . In terms of size , it is a little bit bigger than FF and is in a triangle shape , but my cats do n't seem to have any trouble eating it . My cats are only 4 , but if you have an older cat with teeth problems you might want to keep that in mind . I did notice a difference in the little box , there was less and it did smell more mild , so that advertisement seems to be true . Overall I am please and would buy again .
5 #### Our cat loves this food . She actually nags us for more food . It is supposed to help maintain weight which is something we are becoming concerned with as out cat is 13 and beginning to become a bit less active . This is a nutritious choice . Nothing better than a healthier choice that the cat actually loves .
3 #### My dog likes this OK , but the first time he used it , it got sharp edges and he cut his lip a little . Use sparingly and under supervision .
5 #### dogs enjoyed it . It is a chew toy a little bigger than my hand . Worth the $ 3 i paid for it .
3 #### I do believe this really is for aggressive chewers . My puppy is a big time chewer of toys , but she does n't care for this one -- she likes rings so she can put her foot through as she chews . She really ca n't hold this one like she wants to .
3 #### I bought this for the novelty . Unfortunately , my 9 - year - old dachshund did n't show much interest when I gave it to him . I 've had good luck with other nylabone products , so I 'm not sure why he did n't care for this one .
5 #### 2 of my cats love this . Keeps them entertained and active . Wish they 'd all use the pad , but it 's a toy that could last forever .
4 #### I never dreamed my cat would find this interesting beyond the first hour . I did swap out the plain ball with one that lights up when you hit it . Now she plays with the thing at least once it not more times a day .... when we 're around ... at night by herself . The scratcher center is a little small for utility , but she loves cardboard , so she 'll stretch across it sometimes for fun . Love that it 's self - contained , so you 're not always retrieving the ball under furniture .
3 #### My cat loves it but I had too much trouble getting the lid off , so had to switch brands . Otherwise , good food .
4 #### one the the better grain free cat foods . The price is good also .
5 #### My cats really do n't care for any other kind but the Chicken . It 's expensive , but it 's better than regular cat food and seems to keep them significantly healthier overall than dry food of any kind ever did .
5 #### My cat loves the food and its recommended by my vet b / c it 's grain free and pure protein . I have a main coone who is 11 years old . At one point she weighed 17 pounds and by switching from dry food to wellness canned wet food she shed over 5 pounds .
5 #### These are a perfect size for a big dog that does not need to get bigger and they have the right kind of ingredients . Thanks , Dave
5 #### I love it great price one of 5 dogs like it but that is not the sellers fault .
5 #### I just think it 's funny to see my dogs eating dinosaurs but luckily they like them too so we all win ,
5 #### My two dogs ca n't get enough of this chew toy . They can spend a good hour chewing on this thing and it does n't wear down . This will last at least a 2weeks before it gets all dirty and then you have to throw it away .
5 #### So far my AM bulldog / pit mix has n't succeeded in tearing this toy up . She is only 6 months old but love her dinosaur . I recommend this for any dog !
5 #### our 10 month puppy has tons of chew toys but he has n't really like any of them until we got this one . it 's great for a younger dog .
5 #### My cat is a huge fan of Science Diet , dry food , and this one is no exception . She digs right in , just like it is her normal food . I usually feed her the hairball / urinary formula , because she loves that one the best . She loves this one too !
1 #### The first ingredient is chicken . The next five ingredients are Brewers Rice , Corn Gluten Meal , Powdered Cellulose , Wheat Gluten , and Whole Grain Wheat . Now what do you think there 's more of in this bag -- chicken or cheap carbohydrates that an obligate carnivore should n't be eating ? I was offered a bag of this food for free and I would n't accept it . You should n't either .
5 #### Sugar absolutely loves this food . Upon first smell , tried to push me out of the way to dive into the bag . I have been using Costco 's Domain cat food , but like that this one has 15 % fewer calories .
5 #### I have a senior kitty who is picky about dry food , and I have two middle aged gentlemen who sneer at food that is supposed to be " good " for them . My old gal needs dry food she can chew easily and that she thinks tastes good , and this she will eat ! ! ! ! I usually have her on a wet food only , but been trying to add some dry ... this is perfect for that . My boys love this so much that when I mixed it with their old dry food , they picked out every single piece ! Ha Ha .
5 #### My cat loves this food , and it makes his poop smell less horrible .
5 #### My cat loves it ! Easy enough to switch her off of wet food with a great quality dry food such as this .
5 #### This is a good , quality dry food designed for multi - cat ( adult cats ) households . To be honest , I 'm not sure why it 's targetted this way . I 've always had more than one adult cat and they all eat the same type of dry food that I serve to their little palettes . The main ingredient here is chicken , and there are not a lot of ' filler ' additives , which is what I am always looking for . There are a variety of vitamin and mineral supplements listed on the ingredients list . The cats seem to enjoy this dry food . I feed them canned food twice a day and they free - feed on dry food whenever it delights them to do so . Hill 's has long been a trustworthy , highly regarded pet food brand and I believe this is a quality dry food .
5 #### My kitties love this toy ! They 'll sit in the middle & play for a long time .
5 #### This item has worked so well with my cats , fosters and as gifts . I do use a different catnip . Sometimes it is used for napping .
3 #### It 's ok . My cat did get bored with it
2 #### Nothing wrong with the cat food . We generally like this brand . The cats just do n't seem to like the addition of the Herring ... oh well
4 #### Packaging was adequate . No dented cans . But this time the cats do n't want to eat it . They gobbled up the last case , but not these .
3 #### Most of the cans in this case were badly dented . Fortunately none of the seals were broken . The damaged apparently occurred before the cans were put into the case . The case and mailing box were not damaged .
5 #### My husky loves these . Have read other reviews saying that they arrive crumbled or completely crushed ... Not a single one of mine were broken , so I 'm not sure what these people are talking about .
4 #### At first my puppy liked these , but prefers the soft chewy meaty ones .
5 #### Great treat for a dog on a limited ingredient diet . He loves them !
5 #### My kitty loves this cat food and so does my dog . I ca n't keep my dog out of it . I buy it for the nutritional value and cost .
5 #### I do n't know about the issues other reviewers have reported . My five cats told me they like this stuff . They do n't puke , so I 'm inclined to believe them . The vet says they 're okay , so we 're good to go . Really good price .
5 #### My cat has always been on hill 's science diet and we jsut made the move from kitten food and he loves it !
4 #### My dog would be consider a power chewer , or a step above if possible . She receives a lot of Nylabone products because they last much longer than many other brands so when I saw a dinosaur I thought - HOW ADORABLE ! If you do n't have a power chewer or your dog is under 50lbs this would probably be better for you . I found it to be a little easier to destroy than a typical nylabone toy , possibly because it is thinner overall . We received the brontosaurus . Because it is easier to destroy the pieces that break off are bigger than on any of the other Nylabone products we have purchased before and I have to supervise play with this to ensure she does n't eat / choke on the pieces that she is able to break off .
5 #### my terrier mix chews on this all day long and he 's only gone through the head and tail ! very much recommended ! I actually bought 3 more ...
4 #### All four of my dogs , two small and two medium , love to chew on this dinosaur . You do have to watch out that you do n't step on it in your bare feet ... trust me , it will hurt . And , strong chewers may be able to get chunks off after it 's been chewed on for a while , so keep an eye on it to get a new one if it starts to get thin in places .
5 #### My cat likes to play with this ! Good , durable quality too !
3 #### Out of three cats , two liked this flavor . They prefer turkey , so I wo n't order again .
2 #### this is the one flavor of wellness cat food that neither of my two cats like . I put it in their bowls , they sniff it suspiciously , then they look at me as if to say , " really ? you expect us to eat this stuff ? " they do like turkey / salmon and chicken . it 's well - reviewed , so i am sure it 's simply a matter of preference-- though they are n't picky eaters . the only other food that i 've given my cats that they refused to eat is trader joe 's dry cat food . one cat backs away from it ; i suppose it 's so frightfully bad that he fears it might jump out of the bowl and attack him when he is n't are n't looking .
3 #### My cats would not have anything to do with the food . I 'm sure it 's good stuff , but they wo n't eat it . =( Will be donating the remaining cans .
5 #### my new kitten loves this . it actually smells really good for cat food . her coat is super shiny and soft .
5 #### My cats lose their minds over this toy . My previous cat , 10 years ago , also loved this toy . When I got new cats last year , it was the first toy I bought and they took to it right away . I put the Meowijuana product under the pad and they scratch it . I 've also upgraded it to have the blinking / flashing LED ball . I 've tried the feather - on - a - stick toy that can go in the middle , and they broke that within a day . I 've also tried the cat grass insert ( replaces the cardboard ) and that was very well received by two cats who I think have never been outside . Sometimes I 'd hide a fake mouse in the grass . It 's a super toy with plenty of options and add - ons to keep it interesting for humans and cats alike .
5 #### All cats love this ! I bought this one for my new stray cat from the " Gas Station Kitties " . He 's an old fighting feral who is enjoying his golden years . Yet , here he is , playing with a toy ! It 's wonderful !
1 #### All 2 Papp 's , and Chihuahuas for me and a rat terrier , whippet mix and poodle mix we babysit of different breeds will not eat these . If they try they leave most of it in crumbs to vacuum up .
3 #### These break very easily , which in all honesty is not bad if you do n't want to give a whole or split a cookie . What I find discerning is that whenever I give these to my dogs they always cough afterwards , as if tiny crumbs are caught in their small throats . Often times as well regardless if I purchase this item at Petco or on Amazon , I always end up with a bunch of broken cookies and a few good whole ones . It 's an okay product especially since it is a limited ingredient treat which is important for my dogs .
5 #### My EB loves these snacks and she is a picky eater .
5 #### He loves this food . It is smaller size so easier for cats to eat .
5 #### Cat has been eating this forever and no problems .
5 #### I got my cat from a shelter and they fed him this , I tried to switch his food and he will not eat anything but this food . Convinent to ship to your home with 2 day shipping via Prime .
4 #### I purchased this when trying to get my cat to eat when he was in kidney failure . He did eat it at bit . My other cat is now finishing it .
4 #### Durable . No mess . Safe for my pet . During the worst of the teething phase this product helped with chewing . This product along with other teething soothers worked for our dog .
5 #### I have a beagle terrier mix ( 30 pounds ) that loves to chew . She chews on her dino chew daily . We 're on our third one in three years , it takes her about a year to semi destroy them . They 're never totally destroyed when we take them away from her , but the less thick parts like the tail , head and feet then to get worn and worry me a bit . For the price this product is well worth it . Just be aware of where your dog leaves these , they 're not fun to step on barefoot .
2 #### The dog chewed it once and will not go near it now . I am not certain if it is the item , the hardness or what , but the dog does not like it .
5 #### Dogs love it but it 's not as popular as the Kong . I 'd stick with the regular Kong in the future .
1 #### We ended up with the Stegasaurus version of this product . Within 5 minutes of giving this to our dog , her teeth were chipped and she was bleeding . The design of this product is terrible and nylabone should discontinue this product altogether .
4 #### Good food but did not like the USPS delivery . It came 3 cases in a box . My doorbell did n't ring but I heard a loud " Thump " and opened the front door to see what I had heard . The USPS girl tossed a total of 4 packages to the concrete . It was my regular mail person and I kind of froze - did n't want to yell at her to stop throwing it around but knew damage was being done with each big thud . I already saw several bent cans , without opening the cases . Sickening to see that kind of damage and carelessness , and I doubt if she even realized what she was doing .
5 #### Both cats love the Wellness Turkey and Salmon , which is a nice change . I love the larger cans and the fact that I ca n't see pieces of carrot , peas , or green beans which have no business in cat food ! My only complaint is the " multi - size " lids I have wo n't stay on the bigger cans so have to cover with plastic wrap for storage in the fridge . Will definitely buy again if my two kiddies are still happy with it by the time we get through this first case .
4 #### My kittens love it , it 's grain free , and well priced for the can size . Ultimately though I ended up going with Wellness CORE Kitten Formula ( not Kitten & Cat ) 5.5 oz . cans , as the food was just as good for me , and much cheaper per oz .
5 #### The only drawback to owning a Spynx cat is that they have the most vile , poorly - designed digestive systems known to man . Our previous cat literally cleared the house on many occasions when he visited the litter box . We decided to try a grain - free diet , and I 'm so glad we did . The new kitten has absolutely no problems with this and does n't stink up the place one bit . It is soft and very uniform in texture . He LOVES the way it tastes - in fact , he is so eager to get the loaf down his gullet that he shoves his face into it and we have to pick it out of his nose holes . If the cat had thumbs , he 'd put both of them up for this food .
5 #### My 12 - week old kittens love this toy . It only took me showing them once or twice before they got it .
5 #### My cats LOVE THIS TOY ! ! They can not get enough of it . Once I dumped all the nip on it , it was like they were in a trance . They played with this thing for HOURS ! ! Definitely their favorite toy . I did n't even realize that it came with the extra nip benefit . NIP FTW !
5 #### My kitten enjoys this game . Keep her occupied for a little bit before she runs off to hunt for more to get her little self into .
5 #### My 15 # terrier LOVES this dinosaur chew toy . It 's not too big and not too small , and he 's had it for a while now and has n't totally destroyed it so it 's long - lasting as well . Perfect for heavy chewers and great price too .
5 #### My dogs love chewing these dinosaurs . It gave us a break Christmas morning so we could open presents in peace .
5 #### and it is her job to kill them . But THIS DINO wo n't die ! ! She has done her very best chewing but still this little guy is still recognizable as a Dinosaur masquerading as a toy ! Give her a few more weeks , she may prevail . Lovely toy for the dog who loves to chew , durable , no fuzzies to pick up and the only noise is the dog 's gnawing and gnashing ! Thank you !
5 #### My dogs really enjoyed this Christmas present . I think this will last for a very long time and will help their teeth & gums .
3 #### Be careful . The hard plastic is strong but may cause your dog 's gums to bleed all over the place . Not good for white carpet .
5 #### My cats like it . They have eaten it for many years . It is so nice to order from Amazon.com instead of going to the pet food store .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2PAIXW7W3304O " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91guAl8uWES.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1Fj5VHu - HS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Better than the tiered or tube versions . She can not get the ball out herself . Bought the twinkly ball separate and she just loves it . A little noisy at night but better we can live with that .
4 #### I have always bought this particular toy for any cats I have fostered . I had a kitten who loved it and an adult cat who plays with it from time to time .
5 #### My cat loves this . She uses it mostly as a horizontal scratcher but hey , that 's great because I dislike my furniture being torn to shreds . Catnip pack is a nice addition .
3 #### My cat is 18 months old . She does n't play so much .
5 #### Received today and he 's been going at it non stop great toy . My older cat just like to nap accross it lol
5 #### Last a very long time , my dog still plays with this today and although its bruised he still loves it .
2 #### The description says this is for " powerful chewers " but both of my dogs ( one is only 17 lbs ) destroyed theirs in short order . There were plastic shards everywhere and they were coughing them up too . Not safe for strong chewers !
5 #### My dog has food allergies and these are good treats for her
5 #### Price was fantastic when I placed my purchase . It has doubled since . Regardless , I will purchase again ! My pup loves these . She is medium sized ~ 40lbs , so she gets half a treat at a time . They arrived mostly intact , and smell fresh .
5 #### Natural Balance anything is fantastic ! ! Our spaniel had ear problems and we switched to everything Natural Balance and NO problems after that .
5 #### Very happy and health doggies , two cockers and and english bull dog
2 #### My kittens did n't understand it or play with it , nor even use the scratch pad in the middle :(
4 #### My kitten loves this . The only downside is that you ca n't pick your preferred color . Otherwise , the cat really enjoys chasing the ball
5 #### A must have for any cat owner . When I first put a new scratch pad in the middle I will sprinkle a little cat nip on it and they begin scratching right away . It becomes their go to scratcher instead of any furniture . Purchased my first one several years with my second cat and this single handedly saved my couch .
5 #### My cats take turns playing with this toy . They also like to sleep on the scratch pad(which they do use ) .
5 #### I am told the cats love this ( it was a gift )
1 #### The one that was sent was a different kind of dinosaur with skinny features that I am afraid my dog will chew of chunks . I gave it to a Nieghbor who has a small dog . Much too small for my Golden .
4 #### My dog loves the nylabone products . They keep her entertained and last a long time . Going to be a great stocking stuffer .
5 #### This is not as big as I first thought however my chewing pup loves it and so I had to buy a second one after 3 months because the first one only had a small part left but he still carried it around ! !
5 #### Have purchased several of these dental dinosaurs . After dinner , my dog gets his " dino " and cleans his teeth . Obviously he likes this chew toy . I know that I 'll be purchasing more " dinos " in the future !
2 #### This was the favorite toy of one of our Boston Terriers . He was quite content to chew on it for hours , eventually wearing away the entire head , leaving a nub at the neck ( note he wore it down over time , as opposed to biting off the head ) . However , his teeth are a mess , and I 'm pretty sure this contributed . The plastic seems too hard for stubby little Boston Terrier teeth .
5 #### This is my dogs new favorite chew toy . The only downside is when my dog leave his new chew toy laying around , it is very uncomfortable when I step on it .
5 #### The dogs love these things and they last for a long time . Not sure if they help the dog 's teeth , but they keep them busy for sure .
5 #### My dog loves this and chews it all day ( which will hopefully make a dent in her tartar buildup from her previous owner ) , No messy pieces left around and no gum bleeding - very pleased , The dinosaur shape also attracts my 3 year old grandson , so far they have n't fought over it
5 #### Recommended by my vet and my cat loves this food and he is very picky
5 #### My cat has never had an obsession for food before ... She got sick for a while so the vet recommended this brand of food . She was eating Wellness Cat food prior to the change . She loves this food with all her heart . She cries for it .... it 's insane ... she even likes to cuddle the bag hahaha
4 #### My dog has been having some skin allergies lately so we decided to try a grain free diet as suggested by our vet and friends . We bought these because they are the same brand as his grain free wet food , but he likes his other Cloud Star treats better . These however have n't been wasted and he enjoys them . They are nice sized for his 48 lb doodle body . Oh and after about 3 months of a grain free diet as well as chlorhexadine shampoo once a week , his skin scabs are all healed !
5 #### Although some people seem to have received crushed treats , mine were almost completely intact , so no complaints with shipping . They are definitely hard / crunchy , and a little bit difficult to break ( I can only get mine into halves , which is still a bit large for my 14 lb puppy ) but these are still fantastic treats ! The ingredients are great , and my dog loves them . It 's nice to offer a varied protein source ( like fish ) and still feel good about what you 're feeding your pet .
4 #### My dog loves these treats . She has tried a lot of treats and these are the ones that she gets really excited about . I just wish they were healthier ... so I do n't give them as often as I used to but your dog will probably like them as well .
5 #### my kitties have been eating this since I first adopted them ( 3 1/2 years ago ) . They are healthy and never had an upset stomach ( unless they eat a gecko ) . They love the food .
5 #### My cats love this food ! Grain free . Nor full of junk and fillers .
3 #### My cat will only begrudgingly eat this flavor . Possibly just a his preference .
5 #### My cats love this food and I have been feeding them Wellness for three years , since I got the cats , and they are very healthy kitties .
5 #### My cats love it , so I am happy . And you can not find a better price than Amazon 's . I have not , so far , found battered cans , so I read others ' reviews and was a bit apprehensive . My package came in fine shape . It carried a " Heavy " label , and the box was the perfect size for its contents .
5 #### Cat 's favorite toy , this is what he always goes back to .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2F28QV81QWL6L " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1c4lh9KVcS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1UYP - DsXPS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;My cat is obsessed with this . Seems so simple and silly , but they love it .
5 #### must have for cats and for your couches . I personally think this is one of the best scratchers . My cats wo n't use the scratcher that are on the door or wall . They love rolling on this one when the cat nip is on it and love hitting the ball around . definitely recommend . I also recommend getting more than one if you have more than one cat to avoid them fighting over it . I should also mention that putting the cardboard scratcher in it is a little tough . You just have to make a little indention on the cardboard to get it under the tab . That 's why it stays in so well ! luckily you do n't have to change it more than about once a month . its worth it .
2 #### " Chipped " away to easy ......... I do n't like the idea of hard plastic pieces in my puppy 's tummy ..... threw it away after a day & got a bigger heavier duty one ..... he is a very powerful chewer ........
5 #### This toy is very durable as we usually go through toys quickly with my puppy . She love chewing on the dinosaur and so far so good ! Plus , it 's made in USA ! I highly recommend .
5 #### My dog is obsessed with this bone- its unique shape and size make it easier for her to hold while chewing , and she does n't go through it as quickly as regular shaped nylabones . We call it her Nylasaurus .
5 #### My baby girl loves her new scratcher ... she 's not crazy about then ball .
4 #### My kitten loves this . It 's a good toy for when she needs to self - entertain . She 'll chase the ball around for a good 15 minutes at a time . My adult cat , well , not so interested . I 've seen her bat the ball a bit and use it as a scratcher , but not much more with it . The quality is good , and for a cat that gets easily bored and needs something to play with when you 're not around , it 's great . But some cats need more interactive toys than this one .
1 #### They sent one that 's about half the size of the one pictured . I am not happy with this purchase . Plus , the one they sent does not have a handle and is just a blob Stegosaurus .
5 #### She loves this dinosaur ... seriously loves it . She has many shapes of the Nylabone products -- this guy however is by far her favorite . The head , feet , tail -- all chewed off , only the center body is left . I like these because they are designed to massage gums , clean plaque from teeth and as a doggie bonus , they are flavored . I do recommend the dinosaur in particular on her behalf -- she ca n't type but from the rate of chew , this is a good one .
5 #### My dog is small , but he is a chewer . He goes through most toys . The head and legs are gone from this one , but it lasted considerably longer than most others . Only thing that stands up to time like this one is a leather toy he had . He eats through Kong 's in a week .
5 #### I mix this with a plaque preventing dry food and my kitty loves it .
5 #### Good nutrition , fair value , large bag , and the cats loved it . Did it 's job !
5 #### My cats were constantly leaving puke piles . This stopped it . Thank you .
5 #### and cats love it , too ! They are not losing weight on it though !
4 #### Good , but a lot of broken pieces and crumbs . I suppose that 's the price you pay for affordable bulk shipping online . My dogs love the salvageable pieces just fine though .
1 #### Let me first say I have almost never had a truly bad experience with items I have purchased on Amazon . I usually do a lot of checking around and reading reviews . These Natural Balance treats I have purchase locally are really good and my dog loves them . I decided to purchase my last bag online , a little cheaper that locally , I got two bags , this one and the Sweet Potato and Venison . The Sweet Potato and Venison was just fine . But , my problem with this bag of treats looks like someone played a game of football with the bag . I just opened it a couple of days ago and dumped the whole bag on a plate to see how many whole treats were in there . Nine , the rest of the bag was nearly all crumbs . Very disappointed . Also , when I purchase these locally for my mini schnauzer they are bite size . These are gigantic . The bag says for " puppies thru adults " , maybe a puppy saint bernard .
3 #### This is a great product and my dogs love it . Unfortunately it does not ship well . Each time I order it I have many broken bones but this time the package was badly damaged and almost every treat was broken . Guess this is something I need to pick up locally .
3 #### My dog likes it but it is flaring up his food allergies . I have to feed my dog a L. I. D. dog food of lamb and brown rice . But I have been exploring what else he can eat with out an adverse reaction . So this is off the list of possibilities . But I can still give them to his dog buddies that can eat anything and save the lamb and rice dog biscuits for my dog . Also they are rather smelly .
5 #### My dog has a sensitive stomach and typically does n't do well with hard biscuits but these are very easy on her stomach and are grain free . I like the smaller size because you can increase the frequency of treating . These are also easily broken in two . Any more than that and they start to get crumbly . Our dog also loves the taste .
5 #### Love Wellness ! My cat loves it ! She had a runny stool before I started feeding her this food . Now she 's perfect and odor - free ( almost - lol ) .
5 #### I love this , knowing my cats are eating healthy . They hate it though , but they hate everything healthy so it is not the fault of the catfood . I finally decided to mix healthy and good tasting and they are not eating a lot healthier than before .
5 #### Great price . Petco and Petsmart want $ 1.49 a can . Very happy and fussy cat and it does n't give him poopy butt ! LOL
5 #### The cats seem to like it . Personally , I have n't tried it .
2 #### My cat [ 16 yr old Russian Blue ] normally loves his Wellness brand canned food . I 've been feeding it to him in a couple of different flavors for 2 years now . My cat completely rejected this case and began vomiting [ mostly bile ] when I started this case [ first mixed with former batch to transition ] . I found a can of the former case and that solved the issue - he reverted back to his regular eating habits and stopped vomiting . Since the vomit was mostly bile , I have no way of being sure if he just rejected this flavor and was extremely hungry since he was only eating his dry food [ Spot 's Stew as a treat / supplement ] OR , if there was actually something wrong with this batch . This particular flavor was on sale for 30 % less than we normally pay , which later left me wondering if this batch / flavor has been an issue for others .
5 #### My cat loves this food . I 've been feeding it to him in a couple of different flavors for 2 years now . We made a complete quality diet switch to this and Spot 's Stew grain - free dry 2 years ago , and I can say without a doubt that his health has improved significantly . Even our vet remarked , at a recent check up , how healthy he was for 16 years old and how shiny his coat is . I have a Russian Blue and the typical balding spots at the temples , that they get with age , have actually filled back in somewhat ! In the two years I had only one case that seemed a little hard and dried out ... Amazon replaced immediately and sent a free return label .
5 #### My cats love this and spend quite a bit of time using it .
5 #### Cecil loves it . He played so much until he just went to sleep on it .
2 #### My 11month old pit bull chewed the head off in the first 2 minutes and tried to eat the plastic pieces . Not good for power chewers . And not safe .
3 #### My little dog , sheltie / lab mix , was able to chew small pieces off , a little at a time , which does n't thrill me , but she does love this toy . It no longer looks like a dinosaur .
5 #### I got a stegosaurus ! Ca n't wait to give it to my dog for christmas . She is going to love it - she loves to chew on anything . From the way that the toy feels , I think that it will last more than a couple of days , which I ca n't say for most of her toys . I like it because she ca n't choke on it , it wo n't make a mess , she ca n't pull it apart , there 's no stuffing , no rope .... so many reasons . Just a simple chew toy !
1 #### This is horrible . I total waste of money . It is completely hard and my dogs hate it . The spikes are hard points and I just feel that it does n't do anything . I thought it would have some give to it , but very wrong .
4 #### This is a good chew toy for our puppy , has held up for a while . My only complaint is it gets shredded spikes as the puppy chews it up and then picks up carpet fibers that stick to it .
1 #### Had to take 1 1/2year old cat off this food . Made him start throwing up here & there over time . May be just my cat , but for as young as he is seems pretty fishy to me . Went to a grain free diet .
5 #### My kitties now cats love this thing . I purchased this for my 3 kitties and 1 cat . The kitties would play for hours with this and the cat would sit in the center . Now 3 are 1 year old and the other is 6 , they still play with it but not for hours at a time . Great inexpensive purchase
5 #### Did n't know how big a hit this would be with my beautiful blind boy , but he loves it and so do I. Keeps him busy when I 'm at work . He follows the ball sound as he bats it round and round and the ball stays put ! Only been two times I found it out of the " track " no fault of the toy . He 's a feisty 3.5 year old with some strong legs . Of all his toys , this is his favorite . Watching him one ca n't help but smile ! The scratcher center is also his favorite of his scratching posts . It 's his first stop every morning . I have no problem with him clawing furniture at all . I rescued him in May an my furniture still looks just like it did before Oreo Wonder became part of my family . I highly recommend this Cat toy for both sighted an blind fur babies . As much fun for me to watch Oreo play , as it is for him !
4 #### Our Corgis love these ; good consistency treat . Quick shipping . Sort of high priced for sweet potatoes .
4 #### My dogs love these treats . I love the fact they are grain free . We have two Boston Terriers who have allergies pretty bad and this works well . The only reason i did n't give them a 5 is that most of the time a large percentage of them are crumbled .
5 #### Good quality at a decent price . This bag brings on the Happy Havanese Dance !
5 #### Our two girls live for these treats and you can feel good about feeding them a high quality treat .
5 #### As described . I 'm always hesitant to buy some products via Amazon , because I 've heard that some are knockoffs . But hopefully this is OK , and yes - I did a taste test ! ;-)
5 #### My cat really loves this food . refuses to eat the dry stuff now . she will actually wake me up to feed her .
5 #### Our 15 week old kitten loves this ! We had been feeding her only a holistic dry food on recommendation from her breeder , but our vet recommended that we add some canned food to her diet . Trusting him more than the breeder , we bought this and a couple of other wet foods . One was BLUE 's kitten formula , and another was a cheaper brand . Our kitten liked this better than BLUE , and she got sick when she tried the cheaper brand . We will be buying only Wellness from now on ! Since we do n't give her a full can at a time , we bought some washable , reusable can covers that allow us to put a can with some food left in it in the fridge to save it for later . I highly recommend getting some !
5 #### We have two rather large 3 - year - old cats , and we have been exclusively feeding them wet food for the last couple of years . Their fur is so soft that when we brought them to the vet for their shots last year , the vet exclaimed " Wow , their fur is so soft ! What are you feeding them ? " When we said Wellness , they replied " That explains it , I thought this felt like a Wellness coat . " Even if this food is expensive , consider it an investment into the long - term health of your cats . A poor diet will lead to expensive veterinarian bills later in life . In order to cut down on costs , we feed half Wellness and half Friskies canned food . A quarter can of 12.5 - ounce Wellness per cat in the morning , and half a 5.5 - ounce can of Friskies at night . Canned food is always better than dry food , since it helps the kitties stay hydrated and cuts down on kidney problems later in life .
3 #### My cat does n't like it , even after gradually mixing in with her old food . Would like to feed her cleaner food like this , but not sure how to convince her .
1 #### Beagle and jack russel were able to chew large pieces off the feet area . Safety hazzard . Had to throw it away the first day . Our dogs love nylabone products but this one was not safe .
5 #### This toy will take a beating and go on for a long time . Dog is happy . I am very happy .
3 #### This seems like a harder plastic than other Nylabone products . Our dog is OK with it -- not a favorite . We like the comment " Dinosaur Varies . " Fortunately , our dog likes stegosauruses .
5 #### Nylabones are strong . They do n't come apart and my dogs play with them for hours . It is a toy they do n't get tired of . They go to their toy box and take them out to play . They have lots of Nylabones and I will keep ordering more . The dinosaur is a favorite because my grandchildren collect dinosaurs
4 #### This is pretty good quality and offers a two in one for a cat . How do they automatically know to scratch this thing ? My kitten is kinda scared of the ball now but liked playing at first ... he 's just getting used to the place I guess .
5 #### Both Cats enjoy this . If they get bored with it pick it up put it away and put it back after a few days .
5 #### cats love it . we get it on auto - delivery , and go through about a bag a month . ( our cats are piggies ) every 3 - 4 months , we skip one delivery and it works out perfectly .
4 #### cats loved it , but hippie wife wanted non gmo cat food .. fml
5 #### My cats love this food . I switched from a grocery store brand because their coats looked dull and they were shedding more than shorthairs should . Normally when I change foods , I have to wean them on to the new brand over time , but they started eating this preferentially over the old brand on day 1 . They even prefer this over canned food ! Within weeks , their coats were shiny and the shedding was much less . My cat who is prone to regurgitation has done this somewhat less since starting on this food as well . Very pleased .
3 #### I have been feeding my cats the science diet indoor cat food or several years , I just bought 2 new bags of 15.5 lbs . My cats been throwing up all over my house . I 'm realy mad about this . I m going to call my vet and ask what to switch then to . Something must of changed in the formula of the cat food .
5 #### My cat loves this food so much we have to make sure the closet is closed or she has tried to open the bag on her own to eat more ! Love the velcor closure on the bag . We have ordered more . Great product for a great price and free shipping on our prime membership . Thanks
5 #### my husky loves this toy . The T - rex is her favorite ! was a great Christmas gift for her . Thanks for having a varity .
5 #### My dog loved this toy , he 'll just lay down and gnaw on it . The only bad thing was that as he got to really chewing all the time it would be sharp . I made the mistake of stepping on it two or three times and it really hurts !
1 #### We have a pit mix foster dog that is definitely a chewer , but I really thought this would last more than 10 minute . Nope . The entire upper body was in pieces and she was working on the legs . Just threw it away .
2 #### My dog ignored it . Had to throw it away . What else can I say about something that my dogs do n't like ?
5 #### This is one of the 2 toys that have survived my puppy 's teething phase . The rest are history . I have a female lab retriever , and this is the toy she prefers when her teeth hurt . She does n't chew on it hard enough to break it , but you can tell it 's losing its texture . I think it 's a great toy that will last a long time =) UPDATE 3/17/2014 : This is one of the few toys that has survived my lab retriever ! It 's losing its texture ( from all the biting ) but it has n't been broken :) Very recommended !
5 #### My cats go nuts for this stuff . They used to love Fancy Feast , but now , whenever I open up a can of FF , they turn up their nose , and start looking for the Wellness Chicken and Herring . If subscribe and save is available , I am going to sign up for this product -- not only is it helping my kitten grow into a very healthy cat , it is also helping my adult cat recover from a very bad bladder infection . All in all , I highly recommend this product !
5 #### Since switching to Wellness brand , my cat no longer suffers from crystals in her bladder .
1 #### In what universe does your cat need flaxseeds in it 's diet OR whole cranberries and blueberries ? ? Do you think in a cat 's natural habitat they 'd be snacking on any of those ? No ... why do they add it ? Marketing , as those things are good for OUR Human diet which they try to convince us is good as well for our babies . Also this has caraganeen and guar gum ! ! ! WTH ? Look up what those do to the body for your cat . Shame .
5 #### Good quality food , excellent price with subscription program . Our cats love it .
5 #### Good quality food , excellent price with subscription service . My cats love it .
5 #### Good quality , excellent price with subscription service . My cats wolf it down .
1 #### This review is for both the 12.5 oz . cans and the 5.5 oz cans of Chicken and Turkey flavors . I had been feeding my cats Wellness for a couple years now . While I had problems with inconsistent batches , it remained my go - to choice . BUT this has all changed ! My last few orders ( I order a pack every month ALONG with a subscribe & save pack ) have been making my cats SICK . They wo n't touch it when feeding time rolls around . I thought maybe they were rebelling so I just kept on feeding them Wellness until they ate it . Now my cats are having litter box issues and we have to use baby wipes on our 1 y / o cat . We 're upset , to say the least , because up until recently we have always fed Wellness with no health issues . I recently bought a pack of Tiki Cat to switch up their diet , and we have had no digestion issues on it . So it is the Wellness that is causing all the digestive distress ! We have decided to switch from Wellness altogether after this incident . For the price and expected quality , the inconsistency is not worth it . While I 'm sure Wellness is a blessing to many homes , PLEASE be careful ! Some Wellness batches may make your cats sick as they have mine .
4 #### Good , albeit those filler carrot bits in it , which cats do n't seem to dig much . If it did n't have the carrots , it would be a 5 star because of the quality of the food , digestibility , and trustworthy branding , plus cats generally do like chicken flavor , and do n't barf it up . Do n't overfeed and the cat should do well . Some cats ca n't tolerate overfeeding no matter the quality .
4 #### my pup likes sweet potatoes , seems to like them , probably wo n't buy again , they smell pretty fishy , do n't want it getting in my rugs
5 #### Great healthy treat for my pug . He loves these and has eaten them his whole life . Amazon has the best price around .
5 #### Our two little dogs love these chew toys . These are their second set so they have one at home and one in the car because they love to ride in the car .
4 #### These are really hard plastic , and pretty much indestructible ( from what I 've seen thus far ) . That said , not my dog 's favorite toy , which is why it lost a star . If I could get him to chew on this as much as he tries to chew on my armchair , I 'd add a sixth star .
5 #### Just like the Nylabone Dura Chew Wishbone Chew Toy , my dog can chew on this toy for hours and is unable to destroy it , plus it keeps her interest .
5 #### My dogs ( 2 Dachshunds and 1 Labrador Retriever ) absolutely LOVE these bones ! I 'm not sure what it is , but this is their go - to Nylabone . I used to purchase them at pet stores , but Amazon has been the cheapest on them for a while now ( yes , my dogs chew so many of these bones that I should really buy stock in them ! ) , so I always come here now when my pups need some more dinos .
5 #### This was one of the first toys we ordered our puppy and it is still one of her favorites . Even though it is almost unrecognizable at this point . But she still loves it . And it has helped keep her from chewing up my shoes ;) )
2 #### I bought this quite a while back . At first my dog did n't take to it , but it 's now one of her old go - to toys . Why 2 stars ? This thing gives my dog an unfair advantage in the house . If we 're playing ' chase ' , this is the only toy I can never get away from her because it hurts my hands to hold on to . She also leaves it in strategic locations as to cause the bare foot the most damage . Overall , it 's a good toy for a dog and not a person .
5 #### This is possibly one of the best toys we got for our dog . He 's a 55 pound pit bull mutt and he is constantly chewing on the toys we get him . Even the toys that claim they are indestructible inevitably get destroyed by him . Not this one . We have had it the longest out of any toy we have given him , and the best part about it is that it also helps clean his teeth because of the little bumps all over it . If you have a dog who is constantly destroying any toys you give him or her , get this and you wo n't be disappointed . While it 's worth noting that no toy is ever completely indestructible , this one has withstood the test of time and is still going on , even though he has chewed a bit off of it .
3 #### I mix it with a natural for flavor then they eat it . They are not thrilled to eat it by itself .
5 #### I was skeptical first since it had a very mild odour . But my 2 cats just love this flavour and brand . Its pretty hard for me to find something they like in dry food department but this one fitted really well .
4 #### My cats enjoy this brand and flavor over some other brands like Royal Ca * * * and Whis * * * .
5 #### I have two cats , and one is prone to respiratory and skin issues . After trying several types of cat food ( with my vet 's advice along the way ) , he seems to to best with a combination of this and a half - pump of salmon oil every day . I 've purchased every flavor for my cats , and they do n't seem to like one over the other .
2 #### Though wellness is supposed to be a good quality brand my cats wo n't touch it . They 'll eat anything from meow mix to Weruva and Tiki cat but they wo n't touch anything made by wellness . Makes me wonder if there 's something bad in it because animals can be sensitive to that stuff . I would rate it higher my my cats sincerely do n't like it .
5 #### My 2 dogs ( American Bulldog and Boxer ) have one of these and have yet to destroy it even after 2 years . I purchased one for my sister as a gift for her new puppy and she immediately started chewing on it . She loves it ! Very high quality . I only purchase Nylabone products due to their durability and Amazon is sooooo much cheaper than the pet stores !
5 #### This is a great chew toy , it lasts a long time , it massages the dogs gums , helps keep teeth and gums healthy .
5 #### My two pit bulls love these ! They have had the same four durabones for a year or more , and although they look a little shabby , they 're still perfectly good . They even bring us these chews like they are toys . GREAT product .
5 #### Dog and Cat both love it .. I believe it is the bums on the product they like to feel on gums . I have a pit and she has yet to chew through it so it is as described , durable . Of course it arrived on time and as described .
5 #### I have a 70 lb Dobermine and she loves this chew toy ! The hard grooves make it impossible for her to destroy quickly and she carries it around with her everywhere . Very pleased~
5 #### The dinosaur shape provides some extra texture and angles for chewing but the nylabone material has been helping it last longer than I expected .
5 #### Dogs love it and perfect for small dogs like ours !
1 #### Product was all broken up & crumbly ... TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY .
3 #### I read the other reviews and decided to try them again . They are really very hard not my yorkies favorite biscuit . I wo n't be buying these again
5 #### Our dog has allergies to grain and these treats have been great for our pet . They come in plenty of flavors for small and large dogs . She loves them all . We tried many brands before we found Natural Balance LIT . We 've been using this product for the past year .
4 #### My Catahoula tore it out of my hand the moment she saw it and ran off with it . Five hours later , she was still chewing on it . I only wish she 'd gotten the brontosaurus instead of the stegosaurus as she tends to chew off sharp edges first . Still , if it keeps her from chewing the furniture ( which it does ) , I do n't care what it looks like . Seems to be a winner .
5 #### I have purchased about 5 of these over the course of a year and almost all of them still have something left . My dog chews quite a bit and Nylabone is my brand of choice . These little dinosaurs seem to last forever .
5 #### The pup loves this toy . His iron jaw is kept busy for large blocks of time and it 's safe for him to digest .
5 #### From the moment the package arrived , our dog has been beyond excited about his dinosaur . Somehow he knew the box was for him , and he took to chewing it up immediately . Even though he is not the most aggressive chewer , after nearly nonstop chewing for a week straight , it is holding up really well . I would definitely buy more of these , if this one ever needs to be replaced .
5 #### I 've had this product for about a month and it 's been one of my dogs favorite chew toys . I recently took her in for a vet check up and they did n't have anything to say about her teeth being in bad condition or any injuries but she 's had it pretty chewed up after a month . For the price though , it 's kept her very entertained , I 'll probably have to order another one soon . Some of the other reviews worry me a little bit but she does n't appear to have had any issues with it so far and I feel it should be fine if i replace it soon since she 's chewed it up pretty good so far . I think she likes it more than her other chew toys because of the texture and shape .. It 's not plain like her regular nylabone so it catches her interest more . Although she has appeared to have gotten the head off so that may be a concern , hopefully it wo n't be a problem but I 'm not an expert , just worth noting that the first thing that might happen is the head being chewed off .
5 #### I have a little dog with a lot of energy and this is one of the best chew toys I 've found for him to date . He really seems to like everything about it . I 'm pretty sure he does n't see it as a tiny dinosaur and thinks it 's more rodent - shaped . I thought the texture was a bit rough , but the nubbiness seems to appeal to him . He goes at this thing pretty tenaciously so it helps keep him from getting bored . Our vet recommended Nylabone and says my dog has clean teeth and fresh breath so I 'll be reordering .
3 #### This is a very well - made cat toy , but more for older cats . I have a small kitten and did n't realize that this toy is so large ( check measurements ) . Not sure why , but our 5 - week old kitty is scared of this toy . We plan to save it for her and hope as she gets a bit older she will learn to like it . We 're also thinking of purchasing the add - on part that fits on top and will make for a variety of activities for her to play with . It says it comes with catnip , however we could n't locate it in the box or on the toy .
5 #### < div id="video - block - RUW7ZG5IE9DSI " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91 - hDk2N0lS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71R91dLTstS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Just arrived today and I sprinkled some cat nip in the center and my cat absolutely LOVES it ! It 's so cute and funny seeing her be so amused by a ball !
5 #### My two kittens absolutely love this ! They play with it constantly , scooting it all over the living room floor . We do n't have carpet . I highly recommend it . Even a couple of my adult carts play with it too . I have a main coon mix that try 's to sleep on it but he 's way to big !
5 #### My fat cat loves this stuff ! She goes thru it fast ! My dog ends up stealing her food when she drops a few kibbles !
5 #### My cat loves this . Its all I feed her and each time I go to the vet it 's always the same : " Your cat is very healthy . Good weight , shiny coat , bright eyes . " Ca n't ask for more than that .
5 #### It 's science diet , the cats eat it , they look good and are happy with shiny coats and no real troubles with fur balls . Have always fed my pet Hills science diet and they lived long lives , with my Norwegian Forrest passing away just 1 month before his 20th birthday ! !
3 #### Everything about the product looks great , except my cat wo n't eat it . Ca n't place all the blame on the food , so gave 3 stars .
5 #### Pallatable and really healthy . Highly recommended . Forget all other brands if you want to keep you cat healthy ! One other good brand is Science Diet , all others just have good PR that lead you to believe you are buying the best thing . Do n't be fooled by false advertising !
5 #### My cat 's fur is soooo soft . Especially the white fur parts . And only 1 cat out of 4 has thrown up within the past 2 months .
3 #### My cats are FANATICAL for this , however the smell is atrocious and unless you are able to feed your cats in an environment far enough away from humans to smell , you will find yourself wondering if something crawled into your cabinets and died .

5 #### I just purchased a kitten , large breed . This is one of the items I purchased . I have seen this toy many times on utube and cats just love it . I kitty has many many toys , but unlike dogs , one one at a time , they need action , new action . Arrived packed in box . Instant gradification . Thank you
2 #### bear pays no attention to it . But time may change that . It stays among his toys . He has not found a way to brake it which is a plus for him .
1 #### My vizsla puppy loved this toy and started to chew it right away . In 5 minutes there were a lot of small and very sharp pieces everywhere . I had to throw the toy out . My puppy destroys everything and chews on toys really hard so this chew toy was n't the right choice for him . But it would probably work with dogs who are easy chewers .
5 #### My tiny little dog loves this toy so much , he drags it all around the house and to bed with him !
3 #### Problems with it : 1)Unable to pick the dinosaur sucks 2)My dog played with it for like a couple hours max then never tried it again . Might be personal preference though and it definitely seems durable .
5 #### This was an awesome add on - i 'm so glad i bought two . They are both still around and being chewed on daily by my two dogs after 3 months ! Perfect . What more could you ask for . It does the job , and helps clean the teeth , too ! ? double AWESOME >
4 #### High quality item - chew toy is a little too large for my 10 pound dog . Otherwise , exactly as described .
3 #### Hm . So I got this for my dane pup because I thought it was a cute , durable toy , and it is , but he really just is n't into it . I 've seen him play with it about once or twice over the past 3 months . He prefers things that bounce or stuffed animals . I put them to use now in his food bowl to slow down his eating and they work well for that purpose .
5 #### This is what the cat was eating when we adopted it so this is what we feed her .
5 #### Great compliment to the NB Potato & Duck food
1 #### I read some of the reviews and thought .... How can they be that stale ? Well they were ! They are hard , dried up in the middle and brittle . Many were cracked and crumbled when they arrived . Lesson learned .
5 #### my dogs love these treats ! my smallest dog has a limited diet he can eat , and these fit right in .
4 #### The cat seems to like it . Something about kitties and tiny spaces . I 've got a finicky one , so this is a winner . The roulette wheel ball is a nice bonus . Does n't really make or break the toy , but there is occasional batting around with it . Worth the price .
2 #### Prefer the model where the ball lights up as it is played with . It holds the cat 's interest longer .
5 #### My cats eat all the wellness flavors and love them ......
5 #### best cat food hands down , both my older cat and younger cat luv it
5 #### My cats love this food . I have fed Wellness for many years .
5 #### Cats love it . It smells less terrible than the chicken and herring .
4 #### This toy is the perfect size for my medium as well as large lab . The lab destroys all bones but this one holds up well and it is the perfect size for my aussie mix as well .
1 #### I am a dog trainer , for 30 years , this should have been pulled years ago . the parts break off and get wrapped in the dogs guts , kills them , or huge vet bill for surgery . recently one of my sheltie clients did not heed me , lovely dog , huge huge vet bill . DO NOT BUY AT ALL ! ! ! ! ! DOG TRAINER WARNING ! ! ! !
5 #### Good value for the money and keeps my Miniature Pinscher puppy from eating my mail ! good for chewers and puppies ....
5 #### Even for dogs that are ' hard chewers ' , this toy is wonderful ! Yes , they can , , and will , eventually wear down parts of the toy { esp the head and tail } from gnawing on it , but it does n't break off into small pieces as some toys can . I 've used this for big and small dogs , and they all love it equally ! I think the ' bumps ' on the surface of the toy help stimulate the teeth / gums , and it must feel good when they chew on it . Great toy !
4 #### Great chewing toy , keeps my dog occupied for a while but I have to rotate it with another nylabone toy so she does not get bored .
5 #### Our 3 Siamese love all the Science Diet hard foods . We are very happy that it is available on Amazon . Extremely healthy for them and they really seem to enjoy eating it . Thank you Amazon .
5 #### This is the best cat food that I have ever found , bar none . It is also the only cat food one of my cats will eat . All of their coats are so shiny that the vets have asked which food I was using . Worth the extra money without a doubt . I would recommend also serving wet food ( separate bowl ) for male cats especially to help mitigate UTI .
5 #### My vet recommended . Saved some money on my vet bill . :)
5 #### Cat seems to love it ! Started her on kitten and moved on to this . Compared with store - brand , she is not hungry all the time !
1 #### I have nothing to complain about as far as nutrition goes , which is the most important of my criteria when I buy treats for my babies . But the second criterion , chewiness and fun for the dog is also important . These arrived as mostly crumbs . Even the intact treats -- a few in each bag -- were WAY to small for my GSDs , and they practically swallowed my hand trying to get them . Gone in a second or LESS ! One crunch , gulp . Treat over ! But most of the bag was worse , since it 's tiny pieces utterly useless as treats . I threw them away . Never again !
5 #### Was very pleased with product , will be ordering it again as needed .
4 #### We 've used these many times but lately they have been made so they crumble apart easily if you try to break them into smaller pieces . We always have some around but I 'm disappointed in the lack of consistency in the baking of these .
5 #### My cat , when awake , wo n't leave it alone . Great toy .
5 #### Sometimes you bring a toy home and your cat loves it ... For a week and then never touches it again ? Well I got this a month ago and my kitten { now 3 months old ) spends more and more time on it . As she gets older , she gets smarter & looks for new ways to try and get that ball so it 's like a new toy all he time . I 'm trying to attach a video . So you can see the ways she loves it .
4 #### Cat liked it at first , but eventually was over it . There are some interesting " inserts " and " upgrades " that you can do with the center base though . I think that 's kind of cool .
5 #### I have several cats who really go to town on my couches . I have these at work and they work for the kittens and younger cats , so I wanted to see if they would work with my cats . The kittens really loved the ball rolling around and the scratcher in the center . My older cats love the scratcher and it 's helpful for them but I know I need to get a refill of the center area soon because it 's really messed up . I 'm super glad my cats use this now . Some of them even sleep on it .
4 #### Good food Good price Free delivery w / Prime ... what more could you ask for ?
5 #### This is by far the best food for my cats . They are both 3 + years , love it , and let me know they prefer it . The only exception is ( of course ) wet food . They 'll have a blast with any ' wet ' food , but this is not only my choice , but theirs as well , in dry food
5 #### Well , the cats like it and seem to do well with it .
5 #### Most of my cats were raised on Hill 's , but when I fell on hard times I started buying cheaper and cheaper brands . Now I have elderly cats , and one in renal failure - they have to have good care and I went back to Hill 's . I may have to cut back on other things , like food for me , utilities - I do n't care , they need good nutrition right now .
5 #### My cat loves this and her waste does not have a smell to it . Good product .
4 #### This is one chew toy my dog can not destroy . She seems to like the feel on her gums also . Will continue to order these .
4 #### This toy is made of a very hard material and pieces do n't come off . Knobs help with teething pups . Typical nylabone quality .
1 #### My 6 month old , 45 lb puppy is a super aggressive chewer and likes Nylabone products . She was really interested in this one , HOWEVER , the plastic is not durable and basically becomes a sharp , flaking mess ! This chew piece ( " for powerful chewers up to 50 lbs " ) is NOT good . It made my dogs gums & lips irritated and now she has a big , pink , patchy sore on her lip - which looks like a rug burn - from her lip rubbing up on the distorted , sharp plastic of this T - REX . We were so excited to get a new chew , but it 's awful ! I took it away and her lip & gums are healing . I suggest Nylabone take this product OFF the Market . We 're sticking to Elk & Deer Antlers , hooves & other natural chews from now on ! THUMBS DOWN , NYLABONE . =(
5 #### It all depends on whether your dog likes it or not . My friend 's dog chews up toys within a day or two of getting them . He has this one still after several months . The head is gone , but the rest is intact . My boyfriend 's dog , however , only picks it up when she knows I 'm waiting for her to play with it . My only complaint is that when your dog is carrying it around , if he scrapes up against you with the little nubs can be pretty sharp .
5 #### My lab puppy loves this chew toy ! He has managed to flatten the nubs on the toy but it has not broken off into pieces . Highly recommended for a lab puppy or an aggressive chewer . I love the Nylabone chew toys because they are the longest lasting things we could find for our pup who manages to destroy and shred all of his toys . Great product !
5 #### No issues . Comes in a small cardboard tray wrapped in plastic . None of the cans I have received have ever been damaged .
5 #### Cat Loves it , her coat is shiny and no dandruff . Great deal with subscription .
5 #### Cat Loves it , her coat is shiny and no dandruff . Great deal with subscription .
4 #### My cat loves it . She does n't play with the ball as much anymore , but she enjoys sitting in the middle and using the scratching section
5 #### My two 100 % BLIND rescue cats absolutely LOVE this toy ! ! ! Having no eyeballs and extensive surgeries ( due to inherited feline herpes from their two different mothers ) , these girls were going to be put down because they were not " Adoptable " . But they are incredibly loving , kind , caring , FULL OF LIFE , and VERY NORMAL feline ladies ! Their sense of hearing is phenomenal , and I hoped this toy would be enjoyable for them . IT . IS . PERFECT .
4 #### I like the idea , but my cats are n't too interested .
5 #### Of all the toys I got my cat after adopting him from the Humane Society , this is the one that he 's become most attached to . Since October we 've changed the cardboard out twice . He loves this thing . I was pleasantly surprised how much he seems to really get into tearing it up ! Inexpensive and great for entertainment . For you /and/ your pet .
5 #### This is a multi use item . They perch , nap , play , scratch . They really like when you spin the ball so it 's an interactive toy . It 's a mystery to me why they like this so much . Cat basic supplies : food , litter box , catnip , Turbo Scratcher , Go Cat Da Bird , Ethical Pet Wide Springs , Smarty Cat Ultimate Scratching Post , and some furry mice .
4 #### It is crumbs , and it has a slit at the top of the bag .
5 #### My Suzie Q loves these and they are missing ingredients she 's allergic to .
5 #### Dogs love these treats - limited ingredients are great for dogs with allergies .
5 #### My dogs love these . This was a great price . Quick delivery
5 #### ANOTHER Natural Balance quality product . My dog about jumps out of her skin for one of these . She s on a weight restricted diet now so I am picky where her calories come from ... one of these in a Kong ball keeps her busy for a couple of minutes , and that pleases me .
5 #### My cats love this toy and play with it all the time . The only issue is that they fight over it sometimes :/ so I might order another one .
4 #### Got this for my two 6 month old kittens and my 14 year old girl . The ' kids ' went balistic over it ! My 14 year old loves watching them and that encourages her to participate a little . But I think most of her amusement comes from watching the kids . Nix 1 star because the ball keeps popping out and now I ca n't find it . I wish the ball did n't pop out , but they really like it so I 'm going to try getting another one . If that ball pops out , hopefully I 'll be able to find 1 of the 2 balls and keep 1 at least in the game ... It 's worth buying a second . :)
5 #### My dog loves her new T - Rex chew toy . She 's 8 months old , and chewing on tons of toys and shoes . I 've had pets before that do n't enjoy nyla - bones , so be sure they enjoy chewing on something hard . Definitely recommended for puppies .
5 #### My dog got this last year for christmas and its still around and intact , I was worried when after a few days of having it I noticed it had blood on it but he is an obsessive chewer and that soon stopped . Some people have complained about the heads or tails breaking off but mine is still intact . He loves this thing . The only issue I have with it is that now all the little spots on it are sharp and he likes to leave it right in my walking path . I ca n't help but think he does it on purpose .
3 #### My 1 year old lab had it for half the day , he was n't able to fully destroy it , however there are definitely signs of wear . I do n't think it will last as long as I hoped .
4 #### My dogs have all loved the variety of shapes on these dinos . They are sturdy but do not last as long as the more uniformly shaped bones . I would not recommend these for dogs that normally get Nylabones over the WOLF size . My Doberman can chew these but he does n't destroy them . My bichon goes through them like crazy . Your results may vary depending on how aggressive of a chewer you have .
5 #### My puppy and his big sister love this toy . They are very very hard chewers and Nylabone has proven to have the most durable products . Kong is awesome too but they are rubbery so my dogs bite off pieces of them . Plus , it is really cute to see go get his dinosaur :) Rawr ! Update ! 5 years later and this is only one of four toys my dogs are allowed to have . One lasts about 3 weeks . It will get stuck on the carpet and I will enevitably take my foot across it and be in misery , but it keeps my dogs busy and the pieces they chew off are too tiny to cause GI harm .
4 #### Chicken flavor -- Great cat food . 4 stars because this batch came very soupy .
4 #### My cats love this food . It may not always be the most appetizing to look at but all four of my kitties devour it . I had to scale back buying so many cans of this but I still make sure to always have a supply so they can be treated from time to time .
1 #### I 'm sure the food is great and the contents are quality but my cats HATE IT !
5 #### I have been using this for almost 6 months now . I have a cat that had a urinary blockage and the vet put him on some pretty expensive prescription food . After looking at the ingredients and doing a lot of research I decided that dry food - even if it 's a prescription food - was n't the best choice for him . I switched him to this food and he has been doing fine . I closely monitored him for the first few weeks ( I grew up with cats that were constantly getting blockages - so I freak out at the first sign ) . So far I 'm incredibly pleased . My cat loves the food , and it 's cheaper than his prescription food ( and even less than that when I get it through subscribe and save ) .
4 #### i give it 5 stars ; my ( former ) vet is a proponent of science diet . my cat would give it 3 . she is not a fan of it , but will eat it with a bit of gush stirred in and on . we have tried other brands and formulas that have upset her system . i mix this with oral care and she has been doing fine .
5 #### I have noticed a GREAT difference in my cat 's hair since starting this food . He has less damdruff . He also seems to be at a more healthy weight . We will not switch cat food again- we will be sticking with this indoor Science Diet brand !
5 #### One of our cats preferred food . Good for them too .
4 #### my cats love it .. what else is there to say
5 #### This is the brand that was fed to my cat at the shelter , so I moved him back to it after briefly trying a cheaper brand . He 's 10 years old , and has n't had any GI , UTI , or weight issues . He 's a picky eater , but loves this stuff , and it 's very reasonably priced here . This kibble is smaller than other brands , and it seems like it takes my cat longer to pick out and eat pieces from his bowl , so he eats slower and consumes smaller portions . It may be a more expensive than bargain - basement brands , but it 's worth it to me to have a happy , healthy kitty .
5 #### My cats love this stuff and are healthy , although a bit chubby . Hmm .
3 #### Cats love it- came in the wrong color though
5 #### My kittens love this . I almost did n't order it , but I 'm so glad I did .
5 #### My regular cats only gave this a passing nod . They are severely spoiled . My FOSTER kitty thinks it 's the best toy they 've ever invented . At 2 am this morning I finally had to get up and take it away from him . He 'd been playing non - stop since midnight and keeping all of us old - timers awake . He is possessed with this thing . He is the best example of a review I can give . When I finally find him a forever home , this will go with him !
5 #### Great Value for the money ! cute & whimsical dog toy or dog gift . Larger than I thought it would be & adorable too .
1 #### Our dog was moving from moderate to heavy chewing around the time we got this , darn thing lasted all of 2 hours as our lab pup ripped into the head and tail of the stegosaurus that showed up in the package . It says this can stand up to hardy chewers so not sure if we received the incorrect dinosaur or whether there is no truth in this advertising . I do n't recommend this product if you pup is anything close to a remote chewer and/or over 45 lbs . I did n't bother returning it or making a big deal since other Nylabone products have worked out well for us so this one probably just needs to be calibrated lower in terms of durability and rated for less than moderate chewers . The entire dinosaur is too small as well and I was worried he would actually swallow the darn thing
5 #### They 'll sit and chew them for hours -- only the heads are gone after a month ! Here are four words .
5 #### This toy has lasted far longer than any other Nylabone toy and my dog still finds it interesting . Also it does n't look disgusting after several weeks . Totally recommend .
5 #### bought two for my two golden retriever pups , they both love them , sometimes share other times fighting over them . great for their teeth and teething
5 #### My dog is a power chewer and I have one of these for every room . The only time she left it alone was when her baby teeth started coming out , then I just switch her to a smooth Nylabone in the interim .
5 #### I love sweet potato and I think my dog loves it too . It smells great .
3 #### Dog likes them . They are a little too large for my small dog , and they do n't break in half without crumbling .
5 #### My cat loves this , likes to fall asleep on it !
3 #### My kitten never played with this , but did use the center scratcher .
2 #### Very cheaply made . So lightweight it slides across the floor every time my kitten tries to play with it .
3 #### The best quality canned cat food we 've found . All four cats love it and we alternate their flavors in order to give the widest range of nutrition possible . If you ca n't feed your cats and raw , organic diet , this is one of your best choices . But a big demerit for not using BPA - free can lining , as BPA is known to be one of the major causes of the deadly hyperthyroidism epidemic in cats .

2 #### I have always fed my cats wellness cat food but I just read that it has an ingredient called carrageenan . It can lead to all kinds of digestive problems . Actually this ingredient is in a lot of human foods also such as ice cream , almond milk , and yogurt . You really just have to read labels . It is used as a thickening agent . I did write to wellness about my concerns . Now I am worried about feeding this to my cats . I 've just changed over to Instinct cat food but one of my cats prefers the wellness .
2 #### I like the formula , but my cats HATE THIS FOOD ( and I have never seen them turn their noses up at anything before ) . I am very sad .
4 #### My dogs have had the trex and stegosaurus nylabones for 2 years . Its held up fairly well . It is n't their favorite toy , but they will chew it ocassionally . But BE CAREFUL that they do n't chew the nubs into sharp points . I stepped on it and it left bloody holes in my foot .
5 #### My small dogs love all the nylabone chews . They have a lot of them and they constantly are chewing on one . This is a good one for my small dogs .
5 #### I have 2 puppies and they fought over this so much I had to buy another . They chew on this more than anything I have ever seen them do before . Do n't understand why , but this is a BIG hit ! !
5 #### Great for teething puppies ! The little nibs really make his gums happy . , He likes it almost as much as my old slippers !
3 #### My Malinois / Husky loves Nylabones . He has gone through one of the " souper " bones and is working on another one . I got him this and noticed it was considerably smaller , so he has already chewed off the head and tip of the tail - but it keeps him busy , cleans his teeth and he enjoys it . UPDATE : After a few weeks with this toy I have noticed my dog is able to chew off larger pieces ( more specifically the legs ) and I have had to take them away for fear of him swallowing them whole . I have also noticed some sharper edges on this bone not only from him chewing , but also the texture of the dinosaur . He has cut himself on it once , but I only realized it when I saw blood on it and inspected his mouth . So , no more of these dinos for me !
1 #### The original formula is very good . But I decided to give this a Ty since my 4 cats are indoor cats . The pieces are way to big . Two of my cats three up and overall they do not like it . Amazon does not take returns on this . So maybe my dogs will eat it . Too much money to throw out .
5 #### Cats seem to like it , and the transition to this brand was smoother than with other brands we 've tried . No apparent stomach upset during the change over from their old food , and it seems like less stomach upset overall ( fewer messes to clean up ) . Something to note : the pieces are much bigger than most cat foods out there , so if you have a kitty with dental issues they may have some difficulty with this variety . I do n't know what size pieces the other Hill 's brand cat foods have though .
5 #### The kittens really love this toy . I love the ball a little less at 2 am , but it 's a fan !
5 #### MUST HAVE ! My cat loves this toy and uses it daily and plays with himself to stay busy sometimes when I 'm working . I 'm so happy he 's happy and loves his toys , especially this BERGAN TURBO Scratcher . I got one for my brother too .
3 #### My dogs enjoy the food from this brand but these treats are hard and crumbly and do n't smell much like meat . They eat them but they are not going crazy for them . I probably will not purchase again .
3 #### my dogs will eat them but not really fond of them
3 #### The dog will eat anything so saying she loves them is fairly moot . They arrived broken and in crumbled pieces so it 's more like putting a pile of crumbs on the kitchen floor for her to lick up .
1 #### My dog hates Natural Balance treats for some odd reason . I was shocked when he refused to eat these because my dog eats ANYTHING and EVERYTHING . Hell , his favorite thing to eat is tissue / napkins ! Also bought the Venison kind and he turned away from those too . I admit the smell of these is a bit off putting . Maybe the smell turns him away .
4 #### I have a Scottish Terrier who constantly likes to chew on something , especially before bedtime . She 's a very heavy chewer , and goes through most bones quickly . The dinosaur chew toys tend to at least last her a month or so . The only cons to them is the fact that if your dog chews as much as ours does , little bits of plastic fall off from the constant grinding . Also watch your dog if it gets to that point , as any consumption of this toy will result in barfing or nasty poop . I also would n't suggest having them lie around on the floor , as stepping on them does n't feel so great .
5 #### My big chew dogs are still going at these after a few months ( about half of it left ) Dogs are attracted to it ~
5 #### My puppy loves he carries it from room to room . It 's very durable it feels good on a teething puppies gums .
5 #### hours of fun for the pup - some dogs seem to play with these and tires of them - she chews on them for weeks .
5 #### my dogs are chewers and not overly picky - if i try to take it from them it MUST be good . and with 2 dogs they 're the best bones ever if the other dog looks interested in the one the other one has . i m amazed how many times they take it each others bones even though they 're the same ones . And the fact that nylabone has products made in america is the biggest selling point . Not all products so look for the made in usa
4 #### The cat loved it when she thought she was stealing the dog 's food . Now she ignore it and ask for her old food back . The dog loves it .
5 #### No doubt this is a quality product for kittens . It looks and smells very rich ( concentrated ) and contains liver . I can smell it a mile way . I mix it with some KMR formula and the kittens love it .
5 #### My indoor and outdoor cats love this turkey and salmon . The inside girls are picky eaters and they will eat this right up . I have also noticed much less " cleaning up " in the house . Seems to be really easy on their tummy 's . Really happy with this brand .
5 #### I 'm a crazy cat lady who cares about the ingredients and quality in the food I give my two cats . This was recommended to me by my vet and it 's the best ! and is now the only food my cats will eat ( including treats and people food ) .
5 #### Hector , our cat , says he likes it a lot so I will order it again .
5 #### I have two of these next to each other . My cat plays daily with it .
3 #### My dog really likes this chew toy . Its perfect size for her . She is 18lbs . Does not fall apart easy . Durable . nice looking and the price is good too .
1 #### My three dogs found nothing interesting with this toy . I do n't even they smelled eat . It is worthless . Do not buy
3 #### I think its cute , but my dog has no interest in chewing on it , so it serves more of a decorative purpose at my house . Oh well .
5 #### I have two rescue doggies , who I have mentioned many times in my other reviews . They 've both got anxiety issues , which cause them to chew and misbehave if anything goes off schedule ( usually in our house it does n't , but if I stop at the store on the way home rather than going straight home , something is gon na get eaten ) . Because of this , we try to keep a variety of toys , especially durable ones , available to them in their toyboxes . This has seemed to help immensely , and they realize that if they 're going to chew , we would much prefer that they go to their box rather than our couch or shoes . One product that we consistently stock in their toyboxes would be anything Nylabone . They are definitely durable , and while it is noticeable that they 've been chewed , they do n't shed chunks of plastic like other chewable type toys do - this gives me a huge peace of mind . The boys also really like the nubs , and will sometimes just sit there and nibble at them . They 're both large breed dogs with very strong jaws ( one is a Great Dane / Lab and the other is a Boxer / Rottweiler / Pitbull / Chow mix ) , and these have held up marvelously . Definitely recommended !
5 #### After lots of experimentation and elimination of foods ( treats and maintenance food ) I was able to determine that my boxer / lab mix is allergic NOT to grains , but to meat , poultry ( including duck ) , venison , and lamb . He thrives on ProPlan Sensitive Skin and Stomach formula . These Natural Balance Sweet Potato Limited Ingredient Dog Treats are the perfect treat - others I have tried triggered an allergic reaction . I also keep Natural Balance L.I.D. Limited Ingredient Diets Sweet Potato & Fish Dry Dog Formula kibble on hand for training treats . Great product !
5 #### The price was good and we use this brand of dog food so decided to try these out . They are nice size treats and the dogs love them .
5 #### My cat plays with the constantly . So funny to watch her try to get the ball
2 #### My cat does not play with this at all , but at least it has a nail scratcher she uses that .so not a total loss
5 #### I know of many cats that love this toy . As a cat person , is say this one is a good bet .
4 #### My cat likes it . Ball stays comfortably trapped and has n't popped out once . Bit of cardboard do get on the track and must be removed from time to time . Decent product for a decent price .
5 #### He loves it ! Came right away and package well ! Will order again !
1 #### Making my cat throw up yellow bile . Never buying this brand again . Will stick to Blue buffalo
5 #### Out of all the Nylabones ' this one is the only one that still looks the same and has not fallen apart ... It 's indestructible ! My puppies love it and throw it and bury it and it continues to handle the abuse ... LOL
3 #### This was not what i expected but it was worth the money . My dogs ended up liking it alot more than i thought they would . Perfect crate chew bone .
2 #### I got this for my rottweiler / red heeler mix . He loves toys but I have a hard time finding anything strong enough for him . This toy is SO hard it seemed like it was hurting my pup 's gums . It also starts to come apart after he chews it , so that he is ingesting tiny fragments of the toy which I do n't think is safe for him . Also , I got the stegosaurus which is very small(about the size of my boyfriend 's hand ) and , like another customer pointed out , is not nearly as cool as the T - rex .
4 #### This Nylabone is durable and keeps our pup busy . She is teething and seems to really enjoy it . It is not large , but well sized for a medium puppy .
5 #### She chews on it for hours and it looks as good as when we got it . Kind of like the cute dinosaur figure too . After countless toys that our dogs have chewed to pieces , this is perfect .
5 #### My boys love these dinosaurs chew toys . I bought more than one and they have lasted longer than other teething toys . If your dog destroys toys , try these . I 'm glad I did .
5 #### My small cat loves this stuff . After one week , her coat is smooth and shiny and her # 2 's have decreased from ohmygodthatstinkssobad to tolerable . We tried Natural Balance for about 3 months . Switched to Wellness to get away from grains . I also add a smidge of water to stretch my dollar . I am going to buy a case of the chicken for her today just to mix it up , as well as some dry crunchies for snacking ( 1/4 cup ) while I am at work .
3 #### I have been happy using Wellness Turkey formal for quite a while now cuz my cat like it ... don't no what happen now cuz I learned that you have different distributors .. the food is not appealing to my cat anymore .. Please keep it as before ... thank you
5 #### My cat loves this stuff , grain free , super high in protein and all the other goodies .
5 #### I have tried so many different brands of quality cat food for my seven cats over the years . This Wellness Chicken Recipe is one of two brands that I feed all my cats . They mostly eat this Wellness because the other brand I buy ( to give them a little variety in their diet ) contains a high amount of tuna and , as I understand it , too much tuna is not healthy for cats in the long run . But this one is by far everyone 's favorite . It 's my favorite in that it comes in 12.5 oz cans . Feeding seven indoor cats and 5 - 7 neighborhood feral cats a day can add up . This is a high quality , well priced food .
2 #### Love these treats . Did n't love that they came crushed in pieces . :( Wo n't be ordering these online again due to that .
5 #### As described , though my cats generally prefer laying on it to anything else . Occasionally I hear the ball moving , though .
5 #### My cats loved it . The kitten played with for about an hour . Soon as I got it out of the package . My older cat , who very rarely plays with toys , played with it too .
