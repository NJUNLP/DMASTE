5 #### The King , the Mice and the Cheese by Nancy Gurney is an excellent children 's book . It is one that I well remember from my own childhood and purchased for my daughter who loves it . It is about a king who has trouble with rude mice eating his cheese . He consults his wise men and they suggest cats to chase away the mice . The cats become a nuisance , so the wise men recommend the king bring in dogs to chase the cats away . The cycle goes on until the mice are finally brought back to chase away the elephants , brought in to chase away the lions that 'd chased away the dogs . The story ends in compromise and friendship between the mice and the king . The story also teaches cause and effect relationships . The pictures that accompany the story are humorous and memorable . I was thrilled to discover that it is back in print . I * highly * recommend it for children ages 2 to 7 .
5 #### My students ( 3 & 4 year olds ) loved this book ! Definitely recommend it to other teachers .
5 #### Over and over the king has problems . Fortunately , he has wise men to help him solve his problems . Unfortunately , his wise men turn one problem into another problem . So , on top of all his other problems his wise men are a problem too . Who wants mice all over the place ; naughty mice at that ? And so many that they are in your food , even in your beard -- you do have a beard ? Well , the wise men have the answer to the problem . And the king is delighted , but not for long because the problem comes back again and again . In the end , the king wins ... and the king loses . How can he both win AND lose ?

5 #### I remember reading my parents ' copy of this book until it fell apart . The story still makes me giggle . I just wanted to share it with my kids , who appreciated it even though most of them are teenagers now . The story is light - hearted and silly , but with a very powerful message about learning to live with the problems you have instead of trading them for larger problems . The artwork is hysterical , too .
5 #### I am very happy with the book ! ! ! It is one of my children 's favorite books and I was so pleased I could order it here ! ! !
5 #### My copy is so tattered , worn and so loved . A well done plot on how it 's sometimes better to get along , than to try to work the problem .
5 #### This was one of my favorites when I was a small child , so I bought a copy for my nephew when he was just starting to read .
5 #### So , you think you have problems ? Things could be worse and this clever book can prove it . The king starts out with a problem . The mice are eating his cheese . The more he tries to fix the problem , the worse it gets . The king finally arranges to bring back the mice when he comes to the realization that his original dilemma was n't so intolerable after all . The solution requires cooperation from the king and the mice . It involves the cheese .
5 #### My mom bought this for my oldest son . He and his younger brother loved it . When the baby rolled around , so to speak , 9 years later , it became his favorite too . No one , child or , well , old child , fails to be delighted by this story . Oddly , they all seem to have the same favorite page , too ( when the elephants are run out of town by the returning mice ) . This is a never - fail hit , and cheers everyone up as they face the prospect of the nap .
3 #### 41 years later : The cheese is government cheese . The mice objected to the king 's idea of good manners as species - centric , and rebelled . The king blamed the peasants , and forbade them to keep cats or chase mice from their homes . This made things worse . Peasants that could afford to do so moved as far away from mice as possible . I ca n't wait for the next chapter .
5 #### One of the best books I have ever read . The message is deep wisdom that our government leaders and makers of US foreign policy would do well to internalize . Your kids will like it too .
5 #### Finally back in print . What an awesome book . Loved it as a kid and now one of my kids ' favorites . So happy I can now purchase for my niece .
5 #### To summarize the story , it 's all about trying to deal with the problem you have in the first place ( mice ) , rather than bringing in solutions that create even worse problems ( cats , dogs , lions and elephants ) . But since you will likely be reading it to your kids , the story is not all that important at first . I had this as a boy and enjoyed the drawings , which gets a kid hooked on a book before anything else . My two - year - old LOVES this book , and fills in the words every time we get to words like " king " " mice " " cheese " " lion " , etc . He really has no idea what the story teaches , but he loves to read it with me , and that 's the key to a great kid 's book .
5 #### I was given this book for my 8th birthday , in the year of its first publication . The Golden Treasury of Poetry was a constant companion ; lost , alas , after " growing up " and making many life - moves . This year , 2009 , 50 years after I first received this book , I recaptured it from a used book dealer in upstate NY , as a birthday present to myself for my 58th birthday . The book is my bridge back in time . A beloved collection of classics for children ; do n't let yours slip away !
5 #### I had this book as a child and loved it . The collection of poems is a broad and deep as I remembered
5 #### My aunt bought me this book in 1962 - I was ten years old . My younger sister and I read the poems and loved them all . We marked the book up by writing in it by trying to copy all the great illustrations in it . My dad , sister , and myself would read about Paul Revere 's ride and The Common Cormorant and then talk about what we read . My father 's favorite poem in it was The Children 's Hour . When I was in my 30 's I bought myself another copy of it . Both my sister and my dad have passed and this poetry book brings back all the memories that I shared with them . I 'm 64 now and still remember the words to my favorite poems in this anthology . It will definitely make memories for any child who is lucky enough to get a copy .
5 #### This was a wonderful book so I got it as a gift for my niece . It 's a very thick book full of different poems on many topics . You will be able to find many that you love .
2 #### Looking for a Louis Untermeyer book from the 1980s and this was not the one ,
4 #### Its lovely just what my husband was looking for and how he had remembered it
5 #### I do n't know that I can truly explain why I like this book so much . Started reading it to my son and daughter in approx 1960 . They loved it and so did I like reading it to them . The Book contains a wonderful collection of poetry of many topics and styles , appealing to from toddlers to adults ! I think it is a great family book . Had two more children when the first two were in Middle School . They liked it just as much and now I have given it to their children ! Our youngest grandchild would n't let her father stop reading it to her in the evening and then demanded permission to take the book to bed . She is only 22 months old . Somewhere along the line in moving around the book was lost . I just bought it for my husband and me . Love it . Thank you Louis Untermeyer for this collection !
5 #### The poetry and illustrations are splendid . Although the book seems directed at children , adults will be inspired as well . It is one of those books that would stay in the family for generations . " Golden Treasury " is the right name for it ! My dad gave me this book when I was about eight.-- this was in the seventies . It inspired me to write poetry and I won a poetry contest in school because of it . Somehow the collection reminds me of a better time , when people valued good things and were more sweet and innocent .
5 #### I grew up with this poetry book . I loved it then , I love it now . Too bad it is out of print .
5 #### I rated this a five because it 's the first book I used to introduce my - now 45 year old - son to poetry . Custard the Magic Dragon was read over and over and he still remembers it to this day . It 's a charming mix of poetry , rhymes and stories in verse . You 'll treasure it for your children - and for yourself . If you can find a copy , get one and enjoy all it has to offer with your kids or by yourself .
5 #### A must for every home , with or without children . Delightful ! Each and every poem is a classic treasure . Wonderful to read out loud .
5 #### One of my daughters , growing up , also loved this book , which I had had when I was a teenager . Because she was a bit careless , the cover was destroyed . It is so great to have a good copy again of this lovely collection which I can now read to my grandchildren . The Anglund illustrations are , of course , delightful , and many of the selections simply can not be found anymore , of either the poems or the illustrations . A priceless book .
5 #### This was a favorite . I think it changed my life when I was just a child . I became a poetry lover and am one still . Simple , beautiful poems appropriate for children but not childish at all . Whitman , Hopkins , many famous poets included here . All these years later I can still remember lines from it . Genevieve Taggard 's Millions of Strawberries came to me while I was eating strawberries a friend gave me . Although I could not remember the title , thanks to the wonders of the internet , I searched for the lines I remember and found the text . Then , I went to the bookshelf ( I still have the book ) and read it and many others . Fond , fond memories .
5 #### This is a favorite childhood book of mine . I hunted it down after getting married in hopes of reading it to my children someday . It 's filled with wonderful classic poems . It has some funny , witty poems but it does n't have many of the " silly " slapstick style poems that are so common in kids poetry to day . While some may see that as a liability , I think it 's a great thing to expose kiddos to good literature from a young age . If all kids digest is junk food , they will get fat . If all they read is silly , slapstick poetry they will have a harder time appreciating classic stuff later on .
5 #### I fondly recall this collection of some of the world 's best loved poetry . I 've not read it in forty years , yet I can still recite passages word for word . I remember pouring over the poems , asking my mother what certain things meant , they disappearing to read some more . Lady Clair haunted my imagination , as did bold Lochenvar . And who would n't laugh at the little girl with the curl , right in the middle of her forehead ? To this day I have a copy of Lone Dog by Irene Rutherford Mcleod hanging in my work cube , lovingly handwritten by my grandaughter , who now has the book and loves it like I did . My all time favorite poem , I must admit , is the The Hiwayman , by Alfred Noyes . I 'm about to publish my eighth romance novel , and if I retrace my literary steps , I 'll find an eleven - year - old girl sighing over the tragically doomed lovers . Though years have passed , this volume stands the test of time .
5 #### This volume is a memory from my childhood , filled with lovely poems that my father read to me before bed . I 've been looking for it for 10 years . Now I will read it to my grand - daughters .
5 #### This book was given to my mom when she was 13 from her sister . She used to draw from the illustrations inside . When I was about 10 , she let me start drawing from it . I absolutely love it ! I have used it over the years to draw from , and now I teach art , and my students draw from these beautiful pen and ink illustrations . The book is lovely and full of wonderful poems and collections . And although the poetry is wonderful , I have to say the illustrations are my favorite ever . This is a classic you do n't want to pass up !
5 #### It 's a flash back to the past . I loved this book of poetry when I was in high school . This book was in pristine condition .
5 #### I love this little book which is wonderful to give as a gift to both adults and children . I already have my own copy but I wanted another to give one as a gift because it expresses in just a few , simple , touching words the way in which we would all like to be cherished , but probably never have been . It always makes me cry . I call it the agnostic 's bible ! Clare .
5 #### This book is dear and sweet , and the cover illustration and colors are simply beautiful . A win - win reading for children ( and adults too ) .
3 #### Dr. Seuss has some really brilliant books . This book is just a so - so Dr. Seuss . As a parent who is familiar with about 15 Dr. Seuss books , this is one of my least favorite books . The book attempts to teach the child what " Up " means . There is a terrific amount of repetition , and the cleverness in the rhyming and pictures is not " Up ! " to par with other Dr. Seuss books . My 6 - month old children are too young to understand this book , but I think that Mommy and Daddy will tire of the book long before they have gotten the very simple and trivial message in this book : what is the difference between Up and Down ...
1 #### Completly boring ! ! ! Yes it 's a childerns book that they will be able to read beacuse 60 % of the book is the word Up . This one never gets picked for story time just sits on the shelf . We love Dr Seuss books but this one is disappointing .
5 #### After so many years . I remember this book . Guess I am not a " green eggs " and ham or cat in he hat kinda person
5 #### A delightful first time reader book , with delightful photos and repetition .
5 #### Good book and has my 1year old loves it since her favorite word is up .
5 #### In this early reader , Dr. Seuss explores the concept of up . What kinds of things can go up ? What does up look like ? In Seuss typical rhyming fashion we learn . The illustrations are done by Quentin Blake so are not typical of Dr. Seuss . They are interesting , colorful and fun . The story is simple and repetitious making it easy for young readers to learn how to read new words . Alongside the every day words , there are a few new things children might not know such as stilts and buttercups . This is a fun early reader that makes learning to read easy due to repetition and rhyming . It is written on the end of first grade reading level . Recommended for grades k-2 .
5 #### This is an excellent book in teaching 3 and 4 - year olds how to read . They feel very successful when reading this book .
5 #### Great story .... read it to my kids when they were little , now am reading it to grandchildren . I will say , however , that the quality of the books is SO much different . Thin pages compared with our original copy with much sturdier covers and pages . However , that is a complaint for the manufacturer ..... the story and illustrations are the same , and still excellent !
5 #### i am a collector of Dr Seuss books and this has made a great addition to my collection ! thank you
4 #### It 's a good book for young ones just learning to read but ... For collectors or Dr. Seuss fans it 's somewhat of a let down . Not having the signature look and style of the Dr Seuss books makes this one more of a curious oddity . Only recommended for fans who need every Seuss book .
5 #### What A Fun Book for the Grandkids . I 'm adding to their Dr. Suess library . A big help for the ones who are learning to read .
5 #### This is such a great book about all things that go up ! I love the illustrations & the rhythm of the rhymes , and so does my two - year - old . It 's not too long , either , so she actually pays attention all the way through .
4 #### Not as great as I remembered it . It does n't keep my 2 year old 's attention . Maybe when he is older he will like it more , .
5 #### How can it be anything but great ? ! We all love Dr. Seuss books . They make great gifts for anyone you know !
5 #### A classic ! I think children of all ages like to read this book , or have it read to them . Not as crazy as some of Dr Seuss 's books .
5 #### Dr Seuss books are timeless and we never get tired of reading . I never read this to my children but my gransons are loving it .
5 #### It 's Dr. Seuss . what 's not to like . A great story that I remember reading as a kid that I am now reading to my child !
5 #### The beginner books by Dr. Seuss are fun and full of ways to teach emerging readers phonemic awareness a basic building block to literacy and a lifelong love of reading .
5 #### My girls loved this book when they were toddlers and I read it so often that I have most of it memorized . When I attended a baby shower where the hostess asked us to bring used books , it was my first thought . My adult children were horrified I would part with our copy , so there was nothing to do but buy a new one . " Wake every person , pig and pup , ' til everyone on earth is up ! ! ! " Great fun for little ones .
5 #### I had this book when I was a kid and remember wanting it read on a VERY regular basis . Now I find it has the same effect on my son .
5 #### " Wake every person , pig , and pup , till everyone on earth is up ! Except for me , please go away . No up for me , I 'm sleeping in today ! " We are fifth graders and this is our favorite book by Dr. Seuss , Great Day for Up . I can just feel the breeze when I go up , up , up , and away . Think of all the happiness you will miss if you sleep in ... when you can have fun , in all kinds of ways , with Dr. Seuss ! ! ! This book is fun for you and me , wake up your mind and creativity !
5 #### Looking for an upbeat early reader ? This one gets you going ! " Great Day for Up " has upbeat vocabulary and phrasing ... really colorful illustrations depicting all kinds of " UP " things , a few more difficult words , but it all makes for a great beginning reader . This book makes you happy just reading it !
4 #### I purchased this copy for my granddaughters ' school library . It came in a reasonable time and is in reasonable condition . The librarian was happy with it .
5 #### I loved this book as a child so I purchased it for my God Son , it 's in amazing condition . I could swear my own mother bought it for me years ago , I 'm very impressed .
4 #### Dr. Suess 's scansion and made - up words annoy me . My tri - lingual children have a hard enough time differentiating and isolating Standard English words , so I generally avoid Suess . The volume is a rare welcome exception ( there are a few Suessisms ) and is an excellent book for first readers . The story is plain , with the major intention of teaching your child to * read * his or her first words in English ( in this case the word is " up " ) . But Quentin Blake 's illustrations are superb and worth the price of the volume alone . The conclusion is a bit silly , and has a rather lazy aspect to it that parents need to guide their children on ( no , it is n't okay to sleep in bed all day like the boy in the story , this is just a silly book " ) , but mostly this is unobjectionable .
4 #### This is one of those books that purports to be about something , and at some levels is actually about something pretty much unrelated . The next most important industry after oil in the Middle East is carpets . The author , Kremmer , is a journalist who spent a decade travelling around the region , reporting on various events for Australian new agencies of one sort or another . This is his story of his love affair with carpets , which turns into a pretty serious study of their styles , manufacture , sale and trade , and of the significance of these items in Muslim culture . While the oil is irrelevant to Muslims , except in terms of the money it generates , carpets can tell a lot about the heritage of the Muslim world . For the most part , this is interesting , and there 's a lot to learn about Muslims and carpets . Only towards the end of the book does the author begin to veer into actual politics , and then , of course , he turns out to think that American policy in the Middle East is too agressive ( this was late in the Clinton years ... one shudders to think what his opinions are now ) . Thankfully , he at least hates Saddam Hussein and the mullahs who run Iran ( journalists typically do n't like governments that restrict freedom of the press , regardless of whatever else they do ) . This one proviso aside , there 's a lot of intersting material here , and the book is well - written , the characters drawn interestingly , and the settings well - rendered . I would recommend this book .
4 #### Hand - woven carpets are one of the few products that Central Asia has consistently exported to the rest of the world , and by which the rest of the world knows of central Asia . As such , a traversal of the routes and bazaars that comprise the carpet trade would take one through many of the important places in Central Asia . Likewise , dealing with those involved in the trade would give insight into the history , economics and culture of those living in this area . This then is the subject of this book . The author travels the bazaars and trade routes of Iraq , Iran , Pakistan , Afghanistan , and Kashmir looking for carpets . While doing so , his interactions with the locals open up a whole world of history , culture , religion , food , and habits that are alien to those in the west . Whether it is how to barter over goods , or the proper way to greet an older woman , the stories told by Mr. Kremmer bring to life places that many of us will never visit , yet that comprises a large part of this world both spatially and historically . The author intersperses his accounts with character studies of the various individuals he meets , side stories to fill in local histories , and editorials that connect what he seens in these far - off places to what occurs in Washington D.C. and the stockmarkets of the West . Overall , a great travel book , a great history book , and a great story that is told . I highly recommend this book .
4 #### A fascinating book for anyone who 's ever dabbled in rugs . Even if you 've been to an Arab souk or an Iranian bazaar , you 've probably never come close to the real source of these beautiful objects . Kremmer 's trek to the rug - making heartlands helps you appreciate that the carpet on your living room floor did n't materialise in a dealer 's show room but was rather the product of a completely different society .
5 #### Christopher Kremmer 's book takes you on a journey through the Central Asian countries most frequently in the news today , and provides an incomparable insight . The largest , and first , section , is an account of events in Afghanistan , which he has witnessed first - hand as a foreign correspondent . This book is no dry history , nor is it merely a travelogue , nor is it merely an extended piece of journalism . Kremmer comes to know and befriend people of different backgrounds within the region , and it is their stories , as well as the carpet trade and stories of emblematic carpets , through which the narrative is woven . We care about the future of the peoples of the region , because we care about what becomes of Kremmer 's friends . What Christopher has managed to do is to make the internecine politics , the inhumanities , the brutalities , comprehensible , through his humanisation of peoples who might in lesser hands be reduced to the merely ' exotic ' or even worse ' unknowable and inhuman ' . Earlier this year I read ' Unexpected Light : Travels in Afghanistan ' by Jason Elliot . I thoroughly recommend both these books if you desire to reach some understanding of a region of such importance to us all .
3 #### I love this series , but this entry is not Hillerman 's best stuff . I 'm not sure if he 's running out of steam , or if the life stories of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee do n't allow much development at this point . The dense subplotting and evocative details about Navajo life , so evident in the best Leaphorn / Chee stories , are mostly missing here . Hillerman seems to have been motivated mainly by a desire to wrap up the Jim Chee / Bernie Manuelito relationship , which he does , but not in a particularly original way . If you are new to this series , try the books written in the 1980 's to get a better sense of Hillerman 's considerable talent ; The Dark Wind is probably the best of the best .
4 #### I can almost smell the dry red clay and see that beautiful blue sky as I read this book . This book is a quick read but has some interesting twists to it . I can close my eyes and remember traveling a small state highway along the Great Divide on my way to see the V.L.A. near Datil , NM . I had read only a couple of the Jim Chee / Leaphorn books when I visited Gallup , New Mexico in 92 and 93 but I almost expected to see one of the books ' characters appear at the Giant Truck Stop coffee shop or one of the tiny diners we saw on Hwy 36 . Jim seems to be taking a big step in this book so I will wait patiently for another of these charming suspensful novels and I hope my husband gets me this one on tape too . Thank you Tony Hillerman .
4 #### " The Sinister Pig " ( a term which has a couple of meanings in the book ) is another fine addition to Tony Hillerman 's Joe Leaphorn / Jim Chee series . This one involves a somewhat more complex plot than most of the previous ones , and as for character development , Mr. Hillerman seems to take it for granted that the readers of this book have also read at least some of the others , and that therefore he does not need to go into too much detail as to the personalities of his characters . Having said that , though , I enjoyed the book very much , and my only real complaint is , as with " The Wailing Wind " , it is , at about 230 pages , just too short . But it is always a rare treat to be reunited with our old friends from the Navajo Tribal Police , and as an added bonus this edition features a happy ending romantically for the ever - lovelorn Jim Chee . Here 's hoping Mr. Hillerman keeps the Leaphorn / Chee series coming , and that he adds a hundred or so pages to his next tale .
5 #### I chose this rating because I could not consider a lower rating for a Tony Hillerman novel . It is a perfect blend of mystery , folklore and culture . It seems that I have been reading these books for a good part of my 71 years . Now that I have discovered Anne Hillerman novels I will be reading Leaphorn and Chee stories for the foreseeable future .
5 #### Glad to have Hillerman on CD so I can enjoy the book on my travels .
5 #### Tony Hillerman was adept in his portrayals of the Navaho police , the scenery , & his plots are zesty . The book was from a Library , in almost pristine condition . Arrived very fast . Am heartily enjoying right now .
5 #### Another great Hillerman story . Interesting plot , great characters , happy ending for Bernie and Chee , not much more I can say .
5 #### This has been one of the MOST captivating and intriguing of Hillerman 's books yet !
3 #### The plot and action are fine . Tony Hillerman certainly can tell a story , and although this one is only on Navajo land for a short time as the scene for the murder which opens the book , Hillerman does an excellent job of re - setting the scene in southernmost New Mexico as Officer Bernie Manueliti leaves the Tribal Police for a new job with the US Border Patrol . Cowboy Dashie and Joe Leaphorn play their usual solid key roles , a rogue pilot / political henchman adds a great deal to the plot , an evil villain gets what he deserves , but the steady and taciturn Jim Chee is instead portrayed as a bumbling idiot , especially when facing his feelings for Manuelito . All the parts of the plot make sense and intersect nicely , the title fits nicely , but unfortunately there is very little authentic Navajo lore to add to the atmosphere . That is usually a highlight in a Hillerman novel , and I missed that . I still would have given the book 4 stars , if it were n't for the really weak " romance " between Chee and Manuelito . It never felt real or genuine , and its lame , sobbing 1950s - style resolution should make every female reader shake her head in despair . All mystery lovers and Tony Hillerman fans expect better from such a skilled author .
5 #### I read the book a few years ago and enjoyed it a lot .
5 #### Typical Hillerman , the only mystery set in modern day- series of American Indian culture wrapped in Traditional and Ancient ethnology that held my interest from start to finish , you will love the characters ( the good guys ) and despise the ( bad guys ) and see the unconscionable results of the Indian downfall , and hopeful transitions made for their future in transition . I recommend obtaining all of the series and read them in order , starting with the " Blessing Way " .
5 #### A really enjoyable story that literally ventures off the reservation . A good plot with the usual characters , less of the mysticism that Hillerman sometimes seem to dwell upon .
4 #### Hillerman has a poetic way of describing the setting for his stories . The stories include detailed information about the traditions of the Navajos ... their beliefs and how they have Adapted to modern day living . I enjoy his stories because I knew nothing about the Native Americans . The story plots are always unique and the endings unexpected . He is a good Storyteller .
5 #### As always Hillerman fills my mind with pictures of Canyon De Chelle that I visited when in my teens . The meeting again of friends , Leaphorn , Chee , and Bernie , make my dreams complete .
3 #### Good background . Interesting premise that is believable . My only complaint about all of the Hillerman stories is the endings . The hero always has a miraculous escape . You can count on it .
5 #### Like all Tony Hillerman books the story caught you in a web of unanswered questions and great characters . He mixes in a tremendous knowledge of the Navajo traditions and spiritual beliefs.you get a story that keeps you guessing , you ca n't wait to reach the end , but , when you do you wish for much , much more , Try one of his 18 Navajo mysteries and I think you 'll be hooked . Enjoy ! !
5 #### I have loved reading tiny Hillerman novels . The books are a " you ca n't put down " type . Hope to read all his books
5 #### another great novel featuring life from the Native American prospective
5 #### Features the moment Chee realizes he loves Bernie . If you are a fan of this series its a big Yeah ! !
5 #### Great . Just what you 'd expect from a Tony Hillerman book .
5 #### Having toured the four corners five years ago , I find his books even more enjoyable . This was another good read with an excellent plot .
4 #### Compelling , twisting mystery involving several law entities . The author skillfully weaves a varied story line of love , drugs , jurisdictional CYA and happily ever after 's . Believable characters , entertaining and informative dialogue . I may re - read this book and always look forward to other works by this author .
5 #### Oh ! this was a super thriller . But , then I have loved every one of Tony Hillerman 's Joe Leaphorn / Jim Chee series . Now that he can no longer write more , I 'm reading books by authors Aimee and David Thurlo , to whom Hillerman was their mentor . I enjoy getting a peek into the Native American view of life when it gets entangled with Anglo law , etc .
5 #### Best one I 've read so far of Hillerman 's ( # 4 ) . I think this might have been his last one .
4 #### Not up to most of Ton'y novels but a good plot and fun read .
5 #### Not one of the best of Hillerman 's Navajo series . Bernie is now in U.S. Border Patrol . On the job she unknowingly caught the attention of drug dealers . They feel she is undercover for Navajo Police and decided to kill her . Her Boss takes her picture which is shown around the drug dealers . Bernie 's friend call Joe Leaphorn who puts the situation in perspective . He tells Jim Chee to go and bring her back . Chee asked Cowboy Dashes who is now working in law enforcement for the BLM to drive him there . Will they be in time to save Bernie and will Jim Chee understand why Bernie left the Tribal Police ? A good light read .
4 #### Awesome reading .... the scientific premise around Einstein 's Time Distortion makes this a very thought provoking book .
5 #### Another great Hillerman Leaphorn - Chee mystery . As usual , Hillerman brings a modern mystery into Navajo reservation . An execution stryle murder leaves leaphorn and Chee puzzles and they try to unravel the how s and why s. Finally Chee gets the girl ! This is excellent .
4 #### As with all his Chee and Leaphorn novels , Hillerman delivers a clever little mystery sat in the dark southwest that is very worth reading if you like his other books . There is a conflict between Bernie and Chee over them getting back together after a separation while an enemy lurks in the shadows to cover up a murder for well , you can guess the motive . I really like his novels since they provide a glimpse into Native American life which I rarely find in other books . He has a solid and established brand that carries on through generations of readers and novels like this keep the fire burning . Definitely a wise purchase !
5 #### I 've always enjoyed Tony Hillerman books and this one is no exception . I love them because the detective mysteries are not predictable , the chance to learn about the Navajo culture , and the books are safe to read to any of my grandchildren .
2 #### I do n't like Hillerman novels . It was chosen for our book club . .
5 #### You can never go wrong with a Tony Hillerman book . So fascinating , intreguing and sharing of the knowledge of the MidWest keeps the little gray cells entertained . Thank you once again Tony . Recommended reading .... top notched . Fran G.
3 #### This novel starts off with Navajo Tribal Police sergeant Jim Chee finding a corpse in tribal lands near a natural gas field . The FBI is trying to take over the case , saying that it was a hunting accident . Joining Chee on the case is the familiar characters of Joe Leaphorn and Bernadette Manuelito . Conspiracies abound , and not surprisingly , the US government are n't necessarily the good guys . This is a solid novel , perhaps a little better than some other Hillerman novels I have read . The plot is logical , the writing professional . The downfall is that nothing really stands out about this novel . Its not the sort of novel that you ll remember long after you read it . Its descent enough to pass the time and is a solid read , but not particularly memorable . Carl Alves author of Blood Street
5 #### Tony Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers . I enjoy his two prominent characters , Jim Chee , a young traditional & Joe Leaphorn , the older , but non - traditional Navajo . Following their adventures as radically different characters is most enjoyable . Hillerman 's descriptions of Arizona 's desert country & Navajo culture blend seamlessly into the plots . Sinister Pig is largely about Bernie Manuelito & her dangerous adventure with the Border Patrol .
3 #### Once again Leaphorn and Chee engage in a joint effort to solve a crime , and rescue a damsel in distress ! This time , Chee finally gets the girl ! This tale starts of rather obliquely with the death of an unidentified man seemingly unconnected to the new border patrol job acquired by Officer Bernie Manuelito . The plot unfolds rather rapidly after Bernie 's picture shows up in some bad places in Mexico . Actually , the plot unfolds too rapidly and takes away the mystery usually captured in Hillerman tales . However , the reader will enjoy an ending that hints of more adventures to come by a new two - some .
4 #### I have come to enjoy Tony Hillerman 's books . My friend is a Navajo Indian who grew up on a reservation . She suggested Tony Hillerman as a good author to learn more about the Navajo culture . And she was right , I am . The Sinister Pig is easy reading and educational in more ways than one even realizes as they are reading . You do n't have to pause to wonder what the author means , it is clear as day . The one thing I wish I had known before purchasing the Sinister Pig is the fact that the many many Hillerman books go in order . So , I did not have much background information on the characters . It is possible to still read it , Hillerman does provide some facts from previous books . But , I believe it would have been better if I went in order . It would have been a much more rounded book with more sympathy or empathy for these characters , provided by reading the previous books . Which I now plan on .
5 #### Not quite the Hillerman formula but done well just the same . All our old friends are in this story and it looks like everything can be wrapped up if Hillerman decided would be his last . However , it looks like there is at least one more novel and probably two . In this novel , we get to be into the heads of the good guys and bad guys from the start as they banter around . An ex - CIA spy with knowledge of the oil industry is sent to find out information on how oil companies bypass paying royalty money to the First Nations Trust Fund . He ends up committing suicide with a bullet in the back . Mean while way down south Bernie now with the U.S. Customs Service gets lost , goes off the map , and puts her foot in it . Bernie 's co - worker gets suspicious and tells Joe . Jim gets out some snaps ; Joe gets out his maps ; Bourbonette gets out the coffee and brains . They hold a committee to figure out what is happening . Will Bernie smell what she stepped in , or just walk right in to her demise ? Will the cavalry arrive over the hill in time ( does not look promising ? ) Who or what is the " Sinister Pig ? "
5 #### I love Tony Hillerman 's work and am sad that he is no longer with us to tell great Leaphorn / Chee stories . I lived in Farmington , NM for many years and am familiar with the Navajo Tribe and the many beautiful landscapes and places he describes . His books are always respectful of Navajo culture and a great read !
5 #### Just in time for alzheimers onset . I can read them all over again ! Seriously Hillerman tells an excellent story and you get a window into another culture in the background .
5 #### I believe this was Tony Hillerman 's last work before his death ? If so , it is a fitting last hurrah to a stellar writing career . Plot , characterization , dialogue were all imaginative and superbly written . It is a story of good ( Leaphorn and Chee ) and innocence ( Bernadette Manuelito ) vs super - rich and powerful evil , and a man who redeems himself from evil through his love for a good , although flawed , woman . Good , innocence , and redemption , after much suspense emerge victorious , of course , and my only disappointment is that the author did not give the villain a more fitting end . I will miss Hillerman and his characters , his respect for American Indian culture , and the thoroughly Catholic world view that underlies his novels . Requiescat in Pace .
5 #### Moves Jim and Bernadette along -- with some dope dealers . Another " sinister Easterner disturbs hotzo " yarn , complete with some good bad guys .
4 #### Many good characters and story lines . Only one character 's story is completed at the end of the book . Leaves you wanting more story about what happens to the everyone else .
5 #### Tony Hillerman has done it again ! ! He is such a great storyteller;and I absolutely loved Bernie 's character in this book .
4 #### If you like Tony Hillerman 's characters and style of writing , this book does not disappoint . Another good read from a good writer .
5 #### I gave this book five stars because it is fast paced , suspenseful , and a good time . It builds up the characters in new ways , and brings closure to some ongoing story lines .
3 #### While most of Hillermans Joe Leaphorn novels rest on a strong sense of place , this one could take place almost anywhere . It also shifts the focus from the retired Leaphorn to Jim Chee and especially Bernie Manuelito . I found some of their decisions puzzling , to say the least . The plot here is also weaker than others . The story rests on a device that I have seen elsewhere , in both film and novels , including a variant in one of the older James Bond movies . Its not that mysterious , and unfortunately I did not find the denouement at all credible . Still , Hillerman knows how to move a story along . Its a decent airplane read .
5 #### Every Hillerman novel is wonderful and deserves multiple readings . I even like the one written by his daughter . I have all of Hillerman 's novels ( except the Vietnam one ) .
5 #### I have been a Tony Hillerman fan for years . When I ordered this audio book it was because of the title . Listened to this story while exiting Colorado . The mountains and sand dunes were my vista . The story was light but tangled .
5 #### I was glued to every word ! I 'm not accustomed to hearing background info on books I love by the author .
2 #### I have read many of the Hillerman books and enjoyed them immensely . The later books , however , were not up to his earlier work , I am sorry to report . The story gets near the end , and it seems like someone else had to finish the story .
4 #### This is older offering of Hillerman 's , but the title intrigued me , so I ordered it . I was not at all disappointed and learned the reason for the title to be very interesting .
5 #### I have read all of the Leaphorn / Chee mysteries , I was disappointed when Mr. Hillerman passed away , and was no longer writing any more of these great mysteries .
5 #### Tony HIllerman books are always excellent reading . If you have n't read any , do n't wait any longer . kWorth your time and money .
5 #### Have read most of Tony Hillerman 's novels . I always enjoy his Chee and Leaphorn stories . I wish all of them were available for my Kindle Fire .
5 #### I really appreciate his writing style and love the twists and turns his stories take . The last 3 books I have not yet read in paperback I have now read on my kindle .
5 #### You can not go wrong with a Hillerman novel ! He has created real , sympathetic characters in Leaphorn and Chee , and treats the Navajo culture with respect and affection , and the plots are interesting and engrossing . Get all the books ! You will not regret it .
4 #### I thought I 'd already read all of Mr. Hillerman 's mysteries , but somehow I missed this one . It was up to his usual standards and I enjoyed reading it . Mr. Hillerman 's knowledge of and respect for Native American cultures and his thorough research means that I always learn something new .
5 #### Extremely well written book using all of Tony 's characters in a very unique way . Combining several cultures , geographical areas and plots . Wish this was not his last . I will miss Tony and hope his daughter continues in his wake .
5 #### Another example of a wonderful experience through a mystery with twists and turns only possible by the pen of a master storyteller . Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn are like old true friends and I am always excited to look in on their lives and travel with them one more time . Well done .
3 #### Somewhat simple for those of us used to Elizabeth George or le Carre . Character are flat ; location and native american focus interesting .
4 #### This is one of HIllerman 's novels that I probably wo n't be re - reading . It was good but not at the top of my list . I did like it better than Finding Moon .
5 #### Okay , I 'm a Hillerman fan . I always enjoy the peeks into southwestern native American culture with a good mystery woven in .
4 #### a gift to the aging grandma . She enjoys this author very much , what a bonus to find it in large print .
5 #### I love Tony Hillerman 's novels . He has such a great blend of suspense , humor , and conflicts / resolution of human interaction . He represents the Navajo / Hopi view of the world as it coexists with the mainstream American culture . It 's just really enjoyable to settle in with a Tony Hillerman novel .
5 #### I have ordered many Tony Hillerman books for my mother , so I am basing review on her input . She absolutely loved both of these books - she has read every one from this author and wished there were more ( the author passed away in 2008 ) . Forever Rest in Peace Tony .
5 #### I enjoy Hillermans books . He adds twists u do n't see coming . I also enjoy the cultural lessons . Good reading , enjoy
5 #### Hillerman not only takes me back " home " with his descriptions of both the Four Corners area of the United States , but also displays wonderful character development that runs true throughout his Navajo mysteries . I also find the interweaving of the " sacred " mythology of the area and the native peoples , brilliant , without comparison . He honors the people and their ways as well as spinning a wondrous story that keeps the reader tantalized , wanting more !
5 #### I have the paperback collection of Tony Hillerman 's books and pass them around to friends to read . Since they are not on my shelves all the time , I wanted to acquire the e - book versions in order to have them on hand for me .
4 #### I like all of the Navajo novels that Tony Hillerman has written . The characters and the plots and the vivid descriptions of the land and culture are facinating .
4 #### Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police and his retired partner Joe Leaphorn investigate related cases involving people and drug smuggling across the US - Mexico border and Indian oil - gas production fraud . Their relationship with the Federal authorities again focus on the arrogance and incompetence of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the FBI . Their colleague Bernie Manuelito , formerly with the Navajo Tribal Police and now with the Border Patrol , is instrumental in discovering the tie between the dope smuggling and people smuggling , with exploitation of Mexicans being smuggled into the US . The Navajo officers , with help from an Apache colleague put the pieces together to find the link between the fraud and border cases and the murder on tribal land that pointed to both .
5 #### I am a fan of Tony Hillerman and have read a lot of his books so my review is naturally prejudiced and that is not bad . The book lives up to his usual standard of excellence and was fun to read while at the same time giving me an opportunity to look into the way of the native americans in a very positive and insightful manner . I did not read it expecting anything other than to be entertained so can not comment on anything but his ability as a storyteller -- great storyteller .
4 #### Informative as to oil pipeline maintenance and function . A good read . Hillerman respects the Indian Nation and is as comfortable to be with as a favorite chair in front of a slow burning fireplace .
5 #### Having lived in the 4 corners area for a few years and working with the Native Americans for several years makes his books great for bringing back memories of the area and the great people who live there 1
5 #### This is a terrific book , and I am so glad that Tony Hillerman 's books are being re - issued . He was a wonderful author , and really gets to the heart of Native Ameruican culture . He is definitely one of my favorite authors !
5 #### This book came quickly and was in the condition stated . Having spent some time with the Navajo people , it is refreshing to read a work that gets it right about our Native American friends .
3 #### Tony Hillerman 's THE SINISTER PIG reads like a half - hearted effort to fulfill a contract , not to tell a good story . Some great threads are inherent , but the unravel instead of weave . The reader is bounced from the border where Bernie Manuelito is now working to the Four Corners for a murder . The strongest theme is embezzlement of tribal funds , but here Hillerman waxes lightly . Okay , but not his best . Nash Black , author of SINS OF THE FATHERS .
3 #### I own and have enjoyed all Hillerman 's previous books , but this one does n't quite hit the mark . Sorry , Tony . I can only give it 3 stars .
3 #### Among the various detective novelists writing today , Tony Hillerman occupies a pretty unique position . His series of detective novels , following first the adventures of two different characters , Lt . Joe Leaphorn and Sgt . Jim Chee , in separate books . Later , Hillerman combined the two characters , and has been chronicling their combined adventures for a good long time now . He 's added supporting characters , including a series of girlfriends for Chee , a wife who died and then a lady friend for Leaphorn , and colleagues like the inimitable Cowboy Dashee , who 's appeared in the background of several of the books . This latest entry in the series is n't the strongest , but it is interesting . Someone 's been killed on the Reservation , and before anyone can investigate , the FBI shows up and closes down the investigation , announcing the improbably verdict of " hunting accident " . Chee does n't buy the explanation , and both he and Leaphorn take to investigating on their own . Meanwhile , a former colleague of theirs , Bernadette Manuelito , has gone to work for the Border Patrol . While there , she discovers things which seem to link into the investigation on the Reservation that Chee and Leaphorn are running . I enjoyed this book well enough . It 's not Hillerman 's best , but it 's a good story and reasonably well done .
5 #### Hillerman again skillfully leads his readers through convoluted mysteries while painting verbal pictures of the American West . He switches tantalizingly between the reader 's favorite characters , Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn , portraying the Navajo lifestyle as he leads us through the passages of a complex maze of clues . Just as we finally discover the name of the story 's villain(s ) , we discover to our dismay that another journey with this authorhas ended .
2 #### I really love Hillerman 's books . He is one of my favorite authors . That said , everyone lets a stinker once in a while , and this is Hillermans . My first impression was that Hillerman had gotten so old and feeble that he could n't write any more . This impression was later corrected , he 's as good as ever . So , if you like Hillerman , do n't expect much from this one . If you have not read Hillerman , do n't start here - please . He is a very good author and all of this other books are far superior to this one .
5 #### This is the first book I read of Hillerman 's and I loved it . I have started at the beginning of this delightful series and Hillerman does not disappoint . Great read .
2 #### The best I can say is the audio book kept me awake on a long drive . The book barely resembles the early Hillerman ones I remember , and is sort of a mix of generic Crichton - Grisham political / crime suspense with a little romance and a little New Mexico flavor thrown in for old - times sake .
5 #### Bernadette ( Bernie ) Manuelito gets to be the hero . If you like Tony Hillerman , you 'll like this one .
3 #### Great , as are all of Tony Hillerman 's Navajo stories . Off the Reservation and into the modern world .
1 #### Characters you do n't care about , exposition instead of action , Leaphorn and Chee MIA for much of the story ... this one has it all . I gave it a generous chance for five chapters , then called it quits because it was uninteresting and uninvolving . Rob Schmidt BlueCornComics.com
4 #### I had not read Mr. Hillerman in awhile . I was on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and ran out of reading material . I picked up " The Sinister Pig " and was very glad I did ! It felt like I had returned to some old friends ( Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn ) . The plot involves murder , oil , drugs , and politics . A great , quick read .
1 #### I have read most of Mr. Hillerman 's Chee / Leaphorn books and enjoyed all of them , even the early ones that lacked the depth of his later works , but this book left me cold . Every character of worth Hillerman created had to have spot in this book , and many did n't fit well . This was too contrived to hold interest .
3 #### As an on - the - mark political rant on the theft of Indian oil monies , drug smuggling , failure of the drug laws to reduce drug use , success of drug laws to maintain prices of illegal drugs , poltical influence on and misuse of federal agencies , one wo n't find better . Both as a novel and as a mystery , this harlequin romance is Hillerman 's worst .
5 #### Hillerman is at his best again . This will keep you turning pages until you reach the last page . Hillerman 's style is evident and welcomed .
1 #### I have read every Leaphorn / Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan . I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend .. we both agreed it was so disappointing .. we can not believe it was written by the same person . The writing was awkward and heavy - handed ... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here . It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery / romance . The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs , the beautiful rendering of the landscape , the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing . All I can say is , the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman 's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye ... he has given us much enjoyment .... he deserves better . And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman 's plot lines .. the public should be warned .
1 #### If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel ( novella actually ) , I sure ca n't tell . I have been a Chee / Leaphorn fan for many years , but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman 's other work . It is reminiscent of a ' B ' movie . Instead of building suspense , the plot is laid out all too plainly , the characters are unreal , and the Chee / Bernie romance does n't ring true . I am amazed that it was published .
4 #### Have read the whole Leaphorn / Chee series by Tony Hillerman . This is one of the better ones - the subject is topical and the characters take on more definition . The overall " feel " is that this time , the subject is of a more personal nature to Tony Hillerman ? A good read .
5 #### PORK ANYONE ! THE SINISTER PIG by Tony Hillerman combines all of that you have come to expect from a classic Hillerman mystery . It 's all there : murder , intrigue , ominous messages from " The Man , " political maneuvering and corruption . And , as usual , it 's all set against the sweeping panoramas of the American Southwest , as vivid in Hillerman 's descriptions as in a Maynard Dixon painting . Chee and Leaphorn are at there very best when a body turns up in their jurisdiction . Step by step , the pair untangle the deftly woven webs of deceit placed carefully to ensnare the curious while covering up one of the slickest crimes the two have ever encountered . Bernie Manuelito and Cowboy Dashee are along for the rollicking ride ! THE HORSEMAN
3 #### I have enjoyed Hillerman 's novels for many years . His strength is writing about the Navajo community and making Native American culture integral to plot resolution . It is great when I can enjoy a light mystery novel and feel I have learned something about a culture I am not very familiar with . I have counted on his accuracy since he seems to have the endorsement of the Navajo community to represent their culture in his books . This book , with emphasis on Washington , a few mentions of Homeland Security and Osama bin Laden , takes him away from where I perceive his strengths to be . His characters always seem to lack depth . They seem to exist to move the plot along . It would be great if he could write one of these books wherein he explores the inner life of some of his characters in a sustained , deep and meaningful way .
4 #### Leaphorn , Chee and Bernie romp all over New Mexico in this tale involving a heavy handed Washington bureaucrat with too much power under his belt . Bernie snaps some photos at a ranch near the Mexican border , and soon her life is in danger . Meanwhile , Chee and Bernie ca n't seem to admit they love each other , and Chee wants Bernie back off the border patrol and back into the Navajo Tribal Police where she belongs . If you like J.A. Jance 's Joanna Brady series , you will love this one . It also has a touch of Clive Cussler 's style in it .
4 #### This is one of Tony Hillerman 's weakest mysteries , but it 's worth reading for a plot twist that will make it interesting for long - term Hillerman fans . I suggest , as others have , that you first read several of the earlier books in the series to get to know Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn , the Navajo detectives who surely deserve a place in the hall of fame for fictional detectives . You wo n't be able to appreciate fully this book without being familiar with the back story . Contrary to Hillerman 's usual practice , most of the action in this book takes place off the Navajo reservation , way down in the New Mexico bootheel near the Mexican border . Hillerman 's usual weaving of Indian culture into his mysteries is mostly absent . Hillerman also preaches in this novel , a bit unusual for him . He argues against the US war on drugs as futile and harmful and he exposes the theft of billions of dollars from Indian tribes by fraud in the payment of royalties on oil and gas revenues . Smallchief
3 #### It 's a little ironic that Hillerman made his reputation as a chronicler of Din ( Navajo ) characters and culture , but tends to put other tribes in his novels as local color elements . I was interested to see Tohono O'odham characters in Sinister Pig , but disappointed when it became obvious that Hillerman knows little or nothing about the O'odham . They 're not " locals " in the SE Arizona / New Mexico bootheel region any more than Navajo or Hopi are . He has Jim Chee think , " That tribe had its reservation on the Mexican border , lapping over into Arizona " . Jeesh ! Look at a map , Tony : the Tohono O'odham reservation , about the size of Connecticut , is right smack in Arizona southwest of Tucson . ( Lots of O'odham live in Sonora , but not on designated reservation land . ) Minor point ? Yes , in terms of the novel overall . No , in terms of Hillerman 's reputation as an amabassador of Native culture to a broader readership .
2 #### I am a big fan of all mystery and crime novels , so naturally I went out to get this book . I was sadly disappointed , and almost regret my purchase . There was n't the usual umph I feel from his novels . I do have one spark of good that came out of this . I took the chance on a new author , I bought her book and loved it . It was " Waves of Deceit " by Marlene de Velasco . I would read that one again over this anyday .
1 #### I 'm a big fan of his , and I have to say that this was a BIG letdown . It features : Stilted dialogue , no character development , no suspense , no description of Indian tradition and poor editing . Avoid at all costs .
1 #### i would n't bother with this one . it is a crashing bore . hillerman has been on a slide the past few years . he has reached bottom .
4 #### Tony Hillerman is such an accomplished writer , it 's understandable that some reviewers are somewhat disappointed by this effort . Hillerman does an excellent job of presenting details of American Indian culture without resorting to the preachy tone some " politically correct " authors would use , and these details are missed in this novel . This novel also seems to lack some of the plot twists of some of Hillerman 's earlier works - it winds up reading more like a straightforward crime story than the mysteries Hillerman has created in the past . These criticisms aside , I enjoyed the novel . It 's a quicker read than some of Hillerman 's earlier works , yet it still throws in a couple of twists . The characters Hillerman has created are interesting , and it 's enjoyable to read another novel involving them . In short , the novel has its faults , but on balance I enjoyed it , and I look forward to reading Hillerman 's new novel soon .
1 #### An interesting plot but all of Hillerman 's strengths , careful delineation of place and characters is absent . Any characters from any author could fill the roles . Is someone writing for Hillerman now ? I wo n't pay money for any further novels by this author until his writing improves . A shame because his early novels are among my favorites .
1 #### I normally enjoy Mr. Hillerman 's works , and have a collection I like to return to over and over . This one , sadly , went straight into the box to go to the used book store . The editing was so horrible as to be a joke . It makes one wonder if his writing has always been this bad , and some UberEditor has been working magic for all these years , or if he was just under a huge rush to meet contractual obligations and could n't be bothered to actually write a decent book . It is also disappointing in that the story could have been exceptional , given a bit of care . This is an important issue to all the tribes , but should be just as important as a history lesson to all Americans as an indicator of just how corrupt the American government was in the past , and remains today . Next time , I will take a little trip to the library before I automatically add the next Hillerman novel to my collection .
1 #### I agree with the reviewer who said ' read the others first ' . Apart from the great spaces of the American Southwest , there 's very little that 's typically Hillerman here . Please Mr. Hillerman , stick with the various Amerindian cultures of the region - they 're fascinating - give us more interplay & inter - reaction !
3 #### I love Tony Hillerman 's books , but this one is a major disappointment . I have always found his descriptions of the Navaho culture and the lives of the characters to be very interesting with unique situations that distinguish him from the usual run - of - the - mill mystery writer . Substitute the character 's names with any Anglo or Hispanic names , and you would not recognize this as a Hillerman book . I was sorry to see that Bernie 's character devolve from a strong woman officer to the lady - in - distress rescued by the hero , and eager to become the little woman after all . I was also sorry that Jim seems to be losing interest in becoming a healer . They story was interesting and well written , if a bit of a stretch , but just not what I look for in a Hillerman book .
2 #### Reading Tony Hillerman 's latest , I was at first thrilled by the congregation of old friends - Jim , Joe , Bernie , Cowboy et al - and a return to the delightfully atmospheric Four Corners . Then not too many pages further , my elation was undermined by a pathetically weak plot , a non - dimensional villan and female victim , and a rush to the totally predictable and maudlin denouemont . Let 's hope that Tony finds a second wind ; these characters and northern New Mexico are too good to waste on a comic book story .
2 #### I love Tony Hillerman . I have read every book he has written including all his Chee / Leaphorn books , his children 's book , his coffee table book , his memoir , his non - fiction books , etc . I even liked " Finding Moon " . Having said this , his last several Chee / Leaphorn books are delivering a diminishing return of enjoyment . " The Sinister Pig " is an acceptable novel but without question the worst Chee / Leaphorn book to date . The books feel particularly strained in how Hillerman tries to bring all of the series characters ( Chee , Leaphorn and Bernie ) together in unlikely and implausible ways despite their natural separation by age , jobs and hundreds of miles . What I most enjoy about Hillerman are his steady pacing , sense of the environment and interweaving of Navajo and western culture . All of this is present in this novel . What is missing is carefully plotting and crisp dialogue .
4 #### I 've read all his books . I found this a quick enjoyable read . I 'll admit the captivating imagery of the 4 corners area that Hillerman created in earlier books is missing , but I still liked the book . It drew me in and got me emotionally involved . The story was actually more interesting to me than some of the stories in his more highly regarded books , including some of those which had that magical imagary that this book is missing . If you 're a fan , you should read it coz you 'll probably like the story .
1 #### I 've read all of Hillerman 's books , and this one is a major disappointment . It reads like a very rough first draft , a plot sketch . If you pay attention to the bewildering number of characters , the plot plods resolutely forward , no surprises -- and none of the intricate twists that Hillerman has dazzled us with in previous books . The characters are thinly developed ( so - o - o - o little tension between major love interests ) and seldom manage to rise above pot - boiler level . Unlike his other books that take place on the reservation , there is no interesting information about native Americans , their history , culture , etc . About the only thing this book CAN claim to do is keep you turning the pages . You keep believing that surely the real Tony Hillerman will appear to delight you . Alas , he 's asleep at the wheel . It 's a shame to see such a talent settle for so little . I am one disappointed fan .
5 #### I had the CD read by George Guidall who does an excellent job . Many of the other reviewers tell you the plot so I will just give you my impression . I thoroughly enjoyed the book keeping in mind I have read several other books with the characters of Chee and Leaphorn . I liked the suspense and timing of this book . I have no problem with Bernie being shaken by her ordeal . I really liked the element of Budge 's part in the drama and I especially liked the ending .
1 #### I first read Mr. Hillerman in 1973 or so . I enjoyed his wonderful blend of Navajo atmosphere and crime . He has been straying . As he gets off the rez , his books lose their impetus . This book is a great example . Very little to do with Navajo interaction with the larger culture . A lot to do with a pretty silly plot . At many points in the book , I found myself re - reading it , trying to figure out how X happened , as it seems to have been edited very slackly as well . Ca n't recommend this book , unfortunately .
4 #### I gave THE SINISTER PIG 4 stars because , hey , it 's part of a good series with very likeable characters and it is a page turner . However , on other accounts it is lacking . The strength of the Jim Chee / Joe Leaphorn mysteries has been character and cultural setting . This time out , the story is plot - driven and largely takes place off the Four Corners Navajo reservation . Much time is spent on the " guest star " characters and not so much on our old friends . Thus , there is a thinness to this book despite a plot that starts off ambitiously snuffling up Washington corruption , post 9 - 11 paranoia , corrupt CEOs , drug smuggling , and other zeitgeist . The good news is , those who have read earlier entries in the series will be amused to find all of the other regulars finally losing patience with Jim Chee 's romantic klutziness and variously taking him aside and essentially saying , look here , the time has come to get on with things . Also , Hillerman takes what might be his best shot yet at satirizing the bureaucracy . There is a great scene where the FBI , New Mexico State Police , Bureau of Land Management , DEA , and representatives of at least two other agencies are disputing jurisdiction and who should show up but Homeland Security , insisting on authority over everything and everybody . A last comment : the hardcover edition is riddled with publishing errors , mostly misplaced punctuation . Is n't proofreading on editorial job descriptions anymore ?
2 #### For years , Tony Hillerman has been giving us wonderful plots , intricate characters and breathtaking verbal landscapes . With " The Sinister Pig , " unfortunately , it seems Mr. Hillerman is growing tired of his Leaphorn / Chee series . The plot of " The Sinister Pig , " his latest in the series , is promising , but Hillerman seems to have lacked either the energy or the desire to flesh it out into what could have been a fantastic novel . Instead , what we get is a partially realized concept that clocks in at an anemic 240 pages . ( And it 's 240 heavily padded pages , at that , with blank pages between chapters , large type and heavy leading on the part of the typesetter . Let 's face it : This is more a novella masquerading as a novel than the real thing . ) The book is also rife with proofing errors , including more missing question marks than one can count and at least one instance in which he accidentally refers to Chee as Leaphorn in mid - scene . That , plus a far - from - satisfying closing , makes " The Sinister Pig " feel like a rush job , as if Hillerman was more interesting in finishing this project quickly than crafting a quality piece . Fans of Mr. Hillerman 's work have come to expect much more , and they all know he 's capable of top - notch fiction . Unfortunately , " The Sinister Pig " does n't fit that category .
4 #### This is actually more of an agglomeration of more or less related short stories than a real mystery book with a central plot and a few sub - plots . While Hillerman has done this before and usually does this very well , this is not his best effort . It would not be a good book to start reading Hillerman , you need to know the characters to understand some of the allusions . One of the reasons I read Hillerman is his intimate acquaintanceship with a place and a people that I find interesting and yet know very little about . Usually he obliges by adding to my small store of knowledge about the southwest or Navajo life . This time the additions , and there were some , were very small . Hillerman needs to get back into Chee or Leaphorn and then write a story . This is when he is at his best - but he is still very good .
4 #### I really liked sinister pig , with the exception of the characterization of Bernie Manuelito , who I felt was short - changed somewhat . In this book , Bernie has decided to work for Border Patrol , out of frustration with her ex - boss Jim Chee , who has been a bit stand - offish . Instead of being satisfied with her new position , Bernie yearns for the rez and her friends . Jim Chee , meanwhile , is miserable without Bernie , but helpless as to how to express his growing affection I admit , I was a bit disappointed with the character development of Bernie Maneulito , who is my favorite character . Why must Jim Chee and the other male characters constantly rescue her ? Bernie is a well - trained police officer and no longer a rookie ! I was disapointed that the author chose to portray such a strong female character as a frail wilting flower , who just needed one of the men to help her out . Feh . It would be nice for Bernie to rescue Jim Chee for a change . Overall , a good book , with an interesting villian . But please , I 'm a bit tired of the author selling Bernie short . What 's wrong with Bernie being a cop ? The book needs a few tough women to balance out the mostly - male cast .
5 #### In this latest book of several - the Joe Leaphorn / Jim Chee series - a well dressed corpse is found near the Jicarilla Apache Indian reservation without identification or visible means of transportation . Sgt . Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police is dispatched to the scene and caught up in a spiral of intrigue and white man 's avarice and greed . Here is an authentic tribal setting that is engaging in its freshness and ring of truth ; this is a mystery of riveting vigor . Sgt . Jim Chee and retired Joe Leaphorn combine forces once again to sort and tie a variety of clues into a satisfying conclusion to the story . Along the way , as an essential part of the story , Jim resolves his interest in former NTP office Bernie Manuelito . From the scandal at the Department of Interior concerning a missing four or forty billion dollars of Indian Trust money to the capitol of the United States , this tale grabs and holds the reader . Here 's suspense , greed , avarice , theft , murder , love and the wide open American Southwest wrapped up in a tidy bundle of reader enjoyment . This is Tony Hillerman as good as he has ever been and hopefully will continue .
3 #### I have read all of Tony Hillerman 's books , and have learned a great deal about the Navajo people and their culture . I think I enjoy the descriptions of setting and folkways more than the plots of his books . This one was short on description of sky and mountains and weather . Hillerman seems to have decided that since he has written so much of Navajo ceremonies and the nature of the people , that he does n't have to tell us any more . I felt a great lack of what I enjoy most . I also felt that the book lurched along from an unprepossessing start in Washington D. C. through a series of events that never quite explained everything . I expected more to be said of the ripoff of royalties for gas and oil , because it seemed to be introduced as an important problem early on . This wo n't stop me from reading the next thing Hillerman writes , but I hope the next one is more organic in structure and contains the old poetic quality when he writes of the people and the land .
3 #### Tony Hillerman falls off his stride when he attempt to plot a story around high - falutin ' eastern types . But how can any story that features Joe Leaphorn and his magical maps -- even if only tangentially -- fail to enchant a listener ? The final compilation is not Hillerman 's best , but it is still a whole lot better than a whole lot else out there . The audio version is wonderfully read by Geroge Guidall .
3 #### I eagerly await each new Hillerman book spotlighting the compelling duo of Native American lawmen Leaphorn and Chee . The author has defined these two in a low - key , nicely detailed manner that makes them compelling and comfortable , story after story . Why , oh why does Hillerman keep his appealing heroes offstage for so long in this latest outing ? He continually cuts away from the good guys to focus on the bad guys , who are uninteresting and mundane . I 've devoured every Leaphorn / Chee mystery , and am sad to report that this is by far the weakest . But onward and upward , Mr. Hillerman . Bring on some more .
3 #### The acknowledgements at the beginning of this book tell the reader why this book was written . Mr. Hillerman mentions " the Department of the Interior 's efforts to explain what has happened to $ 176,000,000 ( billions ! ! ! ) of Indian oil , gas , coal , timber , etc - royalties which it ca n't seem to account for . " In reading this book , it seemed as if Mr. Hillerman 's outrage over this little publicized situation and his effort to call attention to it , led him to give less attention to his usual complexity of character and setting . This book was perfect for airplane reading and may lead me to learn more about the missing royalities . It may also lead me to read " Seldom Disappointed " to learn more about Tony Hillerman and what makes him tick .
1 #### I share the sentiments of my fellow reviewers - this was contrived , shallow and a total let - down . It was as if Mr. Hillerman hired out the writing . I am a total fan , and eagerly awaited the book . Now I will eagerly await the next one . I am always an optimist .
3 #### I , like many Hillerman fans , waited anxiously for Sinister Pig . Unfortunately , when it arrived I was disappointed . The story has potential , but fails to reach it . It 's like Hillerman was told write your story using only X number of words , then you 're done regardless of whether the story is filled out and completed or not . Is this the end of Chee and Leaphorn ? ?
1 #### It 's quite clear that Tony Hillerman has squeezed the last ounce of blood from this turnip . You know he 's run out of ideas for his venerable Native American heroes when he 's more interested in the villains of the book than the cops . This book , definitely the worst in the series , is as flat as a pancake from start to finish , with a " mystery " as complex as an Encyclopedia Brown story . Chee and Leaphorn have basically nothing to do in this story except pass on endless , awkward exposition . Side characters slide in and out with no real purpose . The only cop who Hillerman seems to be interested in , the fetching Bernie Manuelito , becomes a helpless pawn in a macho boy 's game of drugs and power . Even Hillerman 's trademark Ansel Adams - esque descriptions of the southwestern scenery seem minimized and irrelevant . Hillerman ca n't even figure out how to end it properly , resorting to a horridly uncharacteristic " epilogue " that seems like it was written two hours before deadline . This series really does have a lot of legs in it , but Hillerman no longer seems to have the energy to keep it moving . Perhaps it 's time for someone else to take over with Hillerman serving as consultant . Because it would be a shame for Chee and Leaphorn to continue on the downward spiral that has plagued Hillerman 's most recent efforts .
3 #### The reading of this book became a real chore .... I found myself reading just to be reading , but not really enjoying . The beginning of the book was confusing , boring and not very well written . The pace did seem to pick up when there was more of Chee / Leaphorn . The last 9 - 10 chapters , which were good , sort of balanced out the first 17 - 18 which were mediocre , hence the 3 star rating instead of 1 star . And , while I 'm crabbing , I want to address the fairly recent practice of putting out 200 page books for $ .... I 'm beginning to read some of the lesser known authors with " hefty " books so that I feel that I am getting my " money 's worth " .
3 #### This is not really a Chee / Leaphorn novel . It does not take place on the Navajo Reservation , neither Chee nor Leaphorn is really involved in the crime , and the crime really has nothing to do with Navajo culture in any way . In fact , the effort to involve them comes off as contrived . While Bernie is more of a central character , she is a weak central character . All we find out about her is that she is sad and misses Jim Chee . We do n't even get to see her as a very professional cop . The most interesting character is actually Budge ( a hatchet man for a cartoonish Very Bad Rich Guy ) . If only the novel had been written about him , from his viewpoint , it could have been great . As it was , it was just an OK but forgettable standard cop / mystery story . It could n't even decide if it was going to be a story about exploitation of Indian resources or about smuggling drugs . And while I support legalization of most drugs , the discussion of that in the book was heavyhanded and simplistic . It really seemed as though Hillerman had a bunch of topics and series plot developments on a checklist , but was searching for a real novel to slip them into . Sadly , he came up with this threadbare framework instead . The stylistic skill was as good as ever ( thus the three stars ) , but you know what they say about putting lipstick on a pig ....
3 #### It almost seems as if Hillerman is trying rush the Leaphorn / Chee serial to a happy ending for his readers so he can quit writing them . In true Hillerman form , the plot had great potential rooted in current events , but came up shallow . For me it was reminiscent of some of Hillerman 's work in the 80s when he seemed obsessed with the professional killer who was in turn obsessed with his parents ( which is n't necessarily bad , it worked very well in " People of Darkness " ) . There are some twists and surprises , but not enough to save it . Even a bad Hillerman Leaphorn / Chee story is a good read for me , but I was spoiled by " Sacred Clowns " and " Hunting Badger " ! !
5 #### There is something immensely satisfying , comfortable , and compelling about a Tony Hillerman mystery . None of those is quite the right word , but they will have to do . Other readers have reviewed the plot , so I 'll skip that . Perhaps the characters are what are so electric . One just has to like Jim Chee , the patient Navajo policeman , and his lieutenant emeritus , Joe Leaphorn . By now they are old friends to Hillerman 's many readers . In the book just previous to this , we are introduced to Janet Pete 's replacement -- Ms. Pete went off to the city and left Jim Chee brokenhearted . Chee 's new love interest ( most obliquely ) reprises here and is even more charming than last time . Still , it may not be the characters that drive a Hillerman mystery . Perhaps it is the very land itself , the Four Corners high desert of New Mexico , the Navajo people , their culture , the sacred mountains , the dusty , rutted roads , the hogans , the ceremonies and shamans and fears and prejudices . All I know is that I eagerly await Hillerman 's novels , and I 'm a bit sorry I read this one already , since the wait for the next one will be even longer .
5 #### Great book and lots of fun but absolutely no Indian or Southwest anthropology or cultural flavor . It could have taken place in Manhatten or Miami or anywhere and the characters could be anyone . The legendary Leaphorn plays Nero Wolf or Spencer and Che is his legman or HAWK . This is the happiest of all his stories but is the only one that you do not learn anything except the meanings of " Sinister Pig" . All the new and old loose ends with some surprises , but you close the book happy . For the first time in a dozen books , you do n't find yourself hoarse yelling at CHE to say the right thing .
1 #### I am a big Hillerman fan but found this book sadly lacking in the normal quality that I would expect from Mr. Hillerman . The story line as noted in other reviews was weak and thin to say the least . Character development was left at the sketch level , and the plot was not supported by the narrative . Several examples of this include the plot line between Chee and Officer Bernadette Manuelito . It was simplified to the point where all we read about was his yearning for her , and her for him . The level of which was dime store at best . Secondly , in trying to tie all the lead character 's in , we find ourselves jumping from one simple story line connection to another . Chee to Leaphorn to Bernadette Manuelito , to an unknown power broker in Washington , etc . The resolution of the story lines would have better off in a typical weekly tv show . Since when did we see in a Hillerman book , the paid killer letting his feelings get the better of him and saving both Bernadette Manuelito and the Senator 's girlfriend . If someone wanted to read Hillerman I would send them back to any of the previous books and tell them to stay away from this one .
4 #### I love Tony Hillerman . In my mind , he can not write a bad novel . Also he seems to be a very genuine individual . The characters he creates are unique in mystery fiction . I would love just reading about them going to the mall . This is most conventional Hillerman yet , and I do n't mind . It starts with a mysterious man who gets killed in the first chapter ( in Hillerman novels , the murder always happens in the first chapter ) . It then brings Jim Chee in , them switches to Bernie Manuelito far from home and eventually in enters Joe Leaphorn with his professor friend . And eventually even Cowboy Dashee ( ? ) enteres the story . Its like a gathering of old friends . It even has a sympathic hitman . I agree with most all of the criticism of this book and I do n't care . A few years ago , Mr. Hillerman had a case of cancer and did n't write anything for a while . I guess I count every book after that a bonus book . As you can tell , this is not an objective review . I 'll take a book like this from Hillerman over about every other author I read which includes Jonathan Kellerman , Ruth Rendell and Colin Dexter . I like Alex Delaware , Inspector Wexford and Chief Inspector Morse , but the Navajo people as portrayed by Mr. Hillerman are uniquely interesting .
5 #### In " The Sinister Pig , " Tony Hillerman tackles more universal concerns . His Navajo Reservation gang is up to its elbows in trying to solve yet another homicide . This time , it 's a mysterious agent whose death extends clues in numerous directions , not the least to the very center of America itself , Washington D.C. Hillerman 's action takes place almost entirely off the Reservation . The complicated web he has woven involves primarily the drug trade , massive fraud by oil and gas organizations , and the smuggling of illegal aliens across the Mexican border . Hillerman has chosen to take his socially significant themes to a much broader horizon and readers may feel they 're reading from a daily newspaper ( lately described as " America 's newest fiction form ! " ) editorial page . Still , the issues he present could n't be more relevant . Granted , he takes care of his established characters . The Legendary Joe Leaphorn contributes heavily and Jim Chee faces a complicated and complex set of personal struggles : his relationship with Bernie , his responsibility to his native culture , and his loyalty to his job . Hillerman has no problem with any of this , yet " The Sinister Pig " seems to move at a pace unusually fast for the author . This book seems to concentrate on action rather than devote much time to personal philosophy and Navajo culture . Nonetheless , Hillerman has another winner .
5 #### I just wish Tony Hillerman could write faster . I seem to need a dose of a new book by him about twice a year . His books featuring Leaphorn and Chee , for me , are the best of the lot , so Sinister Pig goes right to the top of the list . Here 's the thing : Hillerman and his editors KNOW anything he writes is going to sell like thermal longjohns in Alaska . But still , his books read like they 've actually been edited and checked and coddled a bit . Sinister Pig deals with murder - of course - dum - de - dum - dum : otherwise , it would n't be a Hillerman mystery . It also deals with lots and lots of $ $ $ missing from the Tribal Trust , drugs , greed , and hanky - panky on the ' rez . ' I just wish Janet Whatzername , Chee 's first love interest , had n't vanished from the series so early ... Here comes Bernadette Manuelito , however , to take up the slack . Do n't miss it - but here 's the thing lots of casual readers do n't realize : You can take a Hillerman book , a topographical map of the Four Corners area , and a 4 - wheel drive vehicle , and actually track down every single rock and arroyo and mesa and creek that 's mentioned . Trust me : I 've done it .
5 #### This latest Hillerman mysery features all the usual ( by now ) characters , Joe Leaphorn , Jim Chee , Louisa Bourbonette , Bernie Manuelito , Cowboy Dashee , and a new hero , whose name I wo n't mention , because to do so might spoil some of the surprise , but I hope we will be seeing more of that person . The action takes place in southwestern New Mexico , the location of Bernie 's new job , and therein lies the missed opportunity . If only Tony Hillerman had gotten together with Judith A. Jance and brought Joanna Brady in to help , there might have been two novels about the same events , this one and another by Jance , from Joanna Brady 's viewpoint . I , for one , would have loved to read both , and I am sure I am not alone . Nonetheless , " The Sinister Pig " is a very enjoyable read , for which thank you , Tony Hillerman ! Let us hope for many more to come ! watziznaym@gmail.com
4 #### I 've fallen in love with Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee in all the other books involving one or both of these Navajo Tribal policemen . It 's usually so satisfying to see the way the Legendary Lieutenant approaches a problem , especially in contrast to his younger colleague . So I 've always must see what they 're up to , and so should most readers who consider the mystery capable of plenty of literary satisfaction . As always , Hillerman 's descriptions of the Navajo Nation landscape are wonderful ; so real you can almost feel the charged air as summer thunderstorms build , hear water racing down the wash , see and touch the earth . Unfortunately , this latest book strays too far from home . Hillerman does n't capture the beauty of the more southern desert and Apache country . While Bernie Manuelito is usually somewhat endearing , in this book her behavior is almost too wide - eyed to be plausible , especially considering she 's a cop . And Chee and Leaphorn , as well as the ever - appealing Cowboy Dashee , seem like minor characters in what turns out to be a fairly stock spy / thriller caper , with a bad guy so bad he 's almost comic . And the ending -- please Mr. Hillerman -- you've got to keep Jim Chee forever lost and questing ! If he grows up , the world will grow old ...
5 #### Enjoyed this story as a child ( I 'm now 71 ) so thought our almost - here Great Nephew would love them as well .
5 #### my favorite book as a child , now in a nice new edition , love this ! so do my grandchildren !
5 #### Mom and Pop read it to my godson at bedtime . He loves it !
5 #### One of my favorite books from childhood and I m sharing it with my grandbabies . The artwork is colorful .
5 #### I am so glad Amazon had this version of The Little Engine That Could book . Also was happy to have it in hardcover . I was n't sure at first if my almost 4 yr . old would like the old fashioned looking pictures but she was very excited pointing to all the animals , toys , trains and clown as I was reading the book to her . I would definitely recommend buying this classic book for any child 5 and under .
5 #### This story is good way to teach children the importance of helping others and believing in yourself . The other engines reminded of the Good Samaritan story from the Bible because the first two engines said they were important , but they did n't help the little train at all . The little blue engine was just like the Samaritan because she was the one who helped the train get on the way .
5 #### This is my favorite childhood book . It has a great message for kids about the power of believing in yourself .
3 #### Was it always a girl train ? I feel I remember the story differently as a kid
5 #### This was my favorite as a child . I just wish it was available as a board book
3 #### As a kid , I * loved * this book . However , as an adult , it is quite painful to read . The wording is awkward and unnecessarily complex . My parents gave me my old copy of the classic , which I initially thought was an amazing gesture of love to have saved it all these years . Too late I realized it was sweet revenge for making them read it to me so many times . Unfortunately my kids enjoy the book quite a bit .
3 #### This is a great book , but make sure you get the original illustrations . The illustrations by Phil A. Smouse ( isbn 1577480813 ) are insipid , a big contrast to the original illustrations ( by George and Doris Hauman ) which are charming . The version I have is isbn 0448405202 but it appears that other versions probably also have the originals .
5 #### I think I can ! I think I can ! I think I can recommend this book as a classic that should be in the library of every young child !
5 #### This is a very cute little story that young children will enjoy . I definitely recommend purchasing this book for the child in your life . I purchased this for my young nephew and he really enjoyed it .
5 #### Just exactly the book that I wanted and illustrated beautifully ! I recommend it for kids of all ages !
5 #### This is a beautiful book - lovely illustrations with the classic , inspirational story . I always give this along with other baby gift items . This story has been the most inspirational little piece of " literature " for me all of my life .
5 #### I have always loved this book . I keep buying it as gifts for the little ones .
5 #### Ordered two of these for my great grandchildren . My kids loved this book .
5 #### My 3 - year old granddaughter loves this book . Timeless book illustrated beautifully for e - book format . That 's the one she wants again & again !
5 #### This is just a great , timeless classic . My daughter loves that the hero train is a girl . The illustrations are cute , if a bit dated . You can definitely tell they 're from the 50 's . It does add to its charm though . Just a sweet little book .
5 #### My favorite book ever when I was five ! :D I love this story . It shaped my life .
5 #### I remembered this from my childhood . I loved it then and got it for a friend with deslexyia . We 'll start easy and workour way up !
5 #### after all these years it is still a favorite
3 #### I did n't realize this is a mini booklet , when I ordered it I thought it was the regular sized book , but other than that it is very interesting , my 4 and 6 year old boys love it
5 #### What can one say bad about the little engine that could ? ! You should do it !
5 #### Sadly someone thought it was a good idea to cut the books story in half and redo the art . This is NOT that book .
5 #### Such a great book ! Classic and must have for your little one 's collection . My son especially loves trains so this is definitely one of his favorites . My son tends to get frustrated easily and wants to give up without trying a few times often and my husband and I always love how this book teaches kids to keep trying and believe in themselves . We always loved it as a kid and now our little ones get to enjoy it as well . Highly recommend .
5 #### Wonderful Classic . All kids need to read it at some point to learn about the power perseverance
5 #### This was a favorite when my children were little so I bought it for my grandson . Nice story and the book is a good addition to any kid 's library .
5 #### Cute Ebook ! I got it for PreK , it 's a little wordy so probably something better suited for K-2 , but overall they enjoyed it .
5 #### Good story . Persevere and find grit within yourself to get what needs to be done , done .
5 #### I love the illustrations and is such a classic tale ! !
1 #### The story I remember had a train that struggled up the mountain but through perseverance and determination , finally made it . This story is about some toys whose train broke down and ask other trains to help them , but most other trains do not because they do n't pull lowly toys . This story sucks .
5 #### classic great book on power of positive " I think I can "
5 #### A classic that never get 's old . A must for EVERY young reader .
3 #### The story does n't make a lot of sense , and seems like it might be abridged from the one I remember from childhood . Disappointing .
5 #### A wonderful story that I will always remember from my childhood ! ! All about doing your best ! ! Kaye Cloniger
5 #### This is a great classic and one of our children 's favorites .
5 #### A family favorite ! My children loved it , and now my grandchildren love it too !
4 #### This is not the original classic edition . Knock off one star for lying . That one was published in 1930 with illustrations by Lois Lenski . This one is a 1954 revised edition with illustrations by George and Doris Hauman . The revised illustrations have a 50s look and more vibrant colors . Watty Piper is the author of the story for both editions , which story appears in print around the beginning of the twentieth century .
3 #### This book is a classic but it is TINY . It 's the size of my husbands palm !
1 #### Way way way smaller than I expected . It 's like a tiny book that came out of a cereal box as a prize
1 #### I bought this for a 5 year old boy who LOVES trains and I could just seen him wanting this read over and over again !
5 #### This was my favorite book and now it 's a favorite for the 3 year old grand baby .
5 #### Great illustrations and great story . This book is good for kids of all ages and is great for helping to build confidence .
4 #### My two older sisters had to read me this book when I was about three or four years old . I 'm now 61 years old and I 'm pleased to buy it for 3 year old great - niece you all are great
3 #### The reason that I gave this book three stars is that they have changed the engine to " a girl " . I recognize the value in that change for little girls and think it 's perfect to teach girls that they can do what they want to do . However , I have a little boy . I have observed that we seemed to have moved from one extreme to another . I want my little boy to know he too can reach for the stars .
5 #### I know this is n't the full version , which is part of the reason why I love it so much ! It 's a board book and the story is short enough ( and fun enough ) to keep a little ones attention all the way through . It was my son 's favorite book when he was little and I was thrilled to find this for my nephew ! Over 15 years later , and I still know almost all the words !
5 #### My grandson loves this classic story and the art work is beautiful
5 #### I loved this book as a child and could n't wait to get it for my train loving little guy . It was harder to find than I thought it would be , so I was really happy to find it here . We read this book all of the time ! It is a great story about helping out and giving it a try .
5 #### Every train buff - no matter their age - NEEDS this book !
5 #### The classic children 's stories are always worth it . My grandson loves this book .
1 #### It had tears , some label covering a defect and also wrinkled pages .
4 #### I enjoyed this book and my 18 month old does too . My son LOVES books so this may be advanced for most 18 month olds . I like that the book is full of vocabulary we tend to not use these days . The pictures are not my style but still good .
5 #### This is a Christmas present so I have not been able to really see its usage . But I know the story from my own childhood and think it will be great
2 #### It was ok . I had the original board book one and my son loved it . I had to replace it from all the wear of it being used . This one just seems like they cut out all the good stuff . Does n't really feel like a story as much anymore . I hate saying that because I know there 's always out there complaining when they revamp or edit a story . This time I think the editing cut down to much of the stories main theme .
5 #### Classic book that reminds us to try hard all the time .
3 #### The book itself is in pretty good condition , it has thick pages and a little track that the wind - up mini train is supposed to " ride " along throughout the book . However , the mini train was not included , which I 'm pissed off about , since it 's actually listed in the title of the item ! ! I do n't want a refund , my husband just found a tiny miniature Thomas the Train that our grandson can drive along the tracks by hand instead . I 'm just disappointed .
5 #### How many of us know that " The Little Engine that Could " is female ? How delightful !
5 #### What else is there to say about a classic ? I made a box of childhood memories for a high school senior , and this is one of the things I included , as all my kids have heard this story so many times , as did I and my brothers in our childhoods .
5 #### The kiddo I bought this for is obsessed with trains and this instantly became his favorite book . It 's a classic story .
5 #### Great children 's book ; my sons loved it and now my nephew will too !
5 #### Loved this book as a child , a teacher , and a grandma . A classic theme of perseverance and believing in yourself .
5 #### Wonderful beginning of school year . Great introduction for Growth Mindsets .
3 #### Great story , but why , why did they have to make the hero train a girl ? ? Leave the original as it is !
5 #### A cute story , cute illustrations , and a nice moral . Never Give Up !
1 #### I should have taken my time while throwing books into my cart because this is definitely not the book I was looking for . To begin , this thing is TINY . I have 3 young kids and typically have to sit a ways back for them to all be able to see the pictures but this book is so small I 'll need to be right in their faces . I can see this getting problematic quickly . I also envision it getting torn up quickly since the pages are so tiny . I also did n't realize that this is an abridged version and does not include the entire story . We will be returning this to purchase the hardcover version which is complete .
3 #### A lot smaller than i thought it would be . I do n't advise for kids under 2 . My son can tear these pages up in a heartbeat .
5 #### This was one of my childhood favorites . I love the illustrations and the story .
5 #### My kids love this book . It 's a great message and a classic
1 #### Sadly not what I remembered as a child . It is as simplistic and corny and without depth as it 's time , I guess .
5 #### This is another book I read to my son everyday when he was young .
3 #### We recently joined Dolly Partons Imagination Library and received The Little Engine That Could for our first book . Naima was excited to read about a choo choo train as she said . We enjoyed the illustrations and the idea that even the little engine could be helpful and accomplish a hard task . What I did n't like about the book was that only good girls and boys were getting good food and toys . I felt like sent the wrong message to little kids . Even kids who are considered bad should get good food too . The kids however really enjoyed this one and I m looking forward to seeing what else the Dolly Partons Imagination Library sends us .
5 #### Bought this for a baby gift . A classic book about not giving up . One of my kids favorites .
5 #### my wife had never heard of this book so i bought it for her birthday .
5 #### Given as a baby shower gift . This book is a classic . Great item .
5 #### Bought as a replacement for my son , who had read his first copy so many times it is in tatters ....
5 #### How could any parent ( or grandparent ) not read this to a child ? ! One of my favorite memories --- and my 35 year old son says the same thing !
5 #### I begged my mother to read this book to me over and over . And because she loved me she did . Still , some 60 + years later , I look to this book for comfort and inspiration .
1 #### What ought to be a simple story about a train engine has been turned into a long , convoluted story mostly about a clown . Sad to see a classic story ruined so thoroughly .
5 #### This is my son 's favourite book ! He has gone through two copies of this book ( he sleeps with it in his bed ) . He had the " normal " sized version before , but this mini version seems to be holding up much better ! A little hard for me to read the type without my glasses on , but I pretty much have it memorized by this point . ;) Such a classic book . I love it !
5 #### My favorite all time book . I was given this book when I was 2 years old and ever since I have loved the story and the positive message . Always try your best and never give up . IF you think you can do something you can .
5 #### Just what I was looking for to give to my new little nephew who is battling a serious disorder .
5 #### A must have for children of all ages . As enjoyable to the adult to read as it is to the child .
5 #### This a great book . Thanks to many reviewers for your comments . I carefully chose the hardcover original which did not disappoint . The Little Engine That Could ( Original Classic Edition ) Hardcover July 31 , 2001 by Watty Piper ( Author ) , George Hauman ( Illustrator ) , Doris Hauman ( Illustrator ) . It 's a lovely story and it does have the " I think I can , I think I can , I think I can ..... " . I would highly recommend this book in hardcover .
5 #### I remember this book from 45 years ago but it was a different author ? Same title and story - line .
5 #### A family favorite . I prefer this original and classic book .
1 #### WAY smaller than expected and it 's cheaply made ... I would n't purchase again . My baby is going to tear it to shreds .
4 #### the little blue engine never rage quit even though he had every reason in the world to do it
3 #### I remembered this book as a classic , and my son loves trains , so I got it for him . The pictures are a bit old style , but the book is high quality construction . My main complaint is that this book is not fun to read , and since my son loves trains , I have had to read it many times . I would recommend getting the Thomas the train books instead .
5 #### This book belongs in the heart of every child . It will continue to be a guide their whole life .
3 #### Classic book-- just did n't realize I was buying a tiny version of it . My fault for not checking the dimensions , but it seems it could have been more clearly marked ...
3 #### I have always enjoyed reading this story to my kids , but did not realize that this was a tiny book , it was my fault for not reading the description carefully . This is a VERY small book .
2 #### I get doing voices for kids , I like that , but this narrator was all over the map , and inconsistent in even keeping the same voice for the same character . I give it two stars for my child 's vote ( although that could be because it was a train story ) but for both myself and my husband , this was an epic thumbs down .
1 #### This is a miniature , abridged version of the book that you can mail to someone . This is n't written super clear in the description . Was very disappointed when I saw it was n't the actual book .
5 #### I read this book as a kid , and I loved it . I bought this copy for myself .
5 #### Wonderful book ! Teaching valuable morals . Beautiful illustrations as well .
5 #### The is the companion book that I give with OH BABY THE PLACES YOU WILL GO . Keep reading it through childhood and let your child know that with work and a positive attitude s / he can accomplish wonderful things .
5 #### Lovely book , large format , not a board book . Lovely illustrations and story .
2 #### The book is too small for my two year old to pay attention to .
5 #### i ca n't even believe how many nights my son has picked this book at bedtime . He first got it when he was almost 2 and now he 's 3 + and still loves it . The pictures are bright and gorgeous . I love the emotions on the characters ' faces . We 've used this book to teach my son about saying please and thank you and about trying hard and helping . Bonus : the main character little engine that could is a GIRL . So so so many of the kids ' books have male protagonists . For animals and trains and trucks they are almost always boys .
5 #### I buy books for my nephew , who turned 1 on Christmas Day . My brother and sister - in - law read to him every day so I buy all ranges of books to add variety for them ( the adults ) . This is a great , classic story . I like the illustrations in this version .
4 #### I would give 5 stars , but the book we received from Jenson Online Inc. had an address label on the back that was almost impossible to remove and left some residual sticky film that I 've had trouble with . I was n't expecting this when I ordered the book . Of course the book gets 5 stars though . 4 stars for having to remove the frustrating address label .
5 #### This is a classic story about never giving up and believing in yourself . I loved this as a child and my children love it too .
5 #### Perfect size for little hands . Delightful story and positive message told . Its a classic every family should own . Excellent quality . Great Buy . Highly recommend .
5 #### My 3 year old LOVES this book . This is the first one he goes to when we do our nightly reading . Super cute story , kind of sad , but has a happy ending !
5 #### Read this as a child and now I read it to my grandson . He loves it
1 #### When they say mini , they mean it . This book is so small . I made it work my giving it to my daughter from her elf on the shelf .
5 #### This was a child 's gift . I read this when I was a little kid , I do n't think you could go wrong with this book .
5 #### This is a magnificently printed and profusely illustrated edition of one of the true children 's classics . Do n't be fooled by other abridged editions or flimsy books -- this is an item that can be passed down from one generation to the next . When the publisher calls it the " deluxe " edition , they are being accurate .
5 #### This book is a classic and kids love it to this day . My grandson , who is obsessed with trains , was very excited to receive it .
1 #### This book is small . It looks like it came out of a happy meal toy bag . Not like the one you remember reading when you were little .
4 #### This is a tiny tiny book , but very cute and great for travel .
3 #### It 's an ok book . It is very small ! ! ! ! ! ! I wish it was a normal size book .
5 #### This was one of my favorite stories as a child and I love it still . I purchased the story ( one with different pictures ) and found that it just was n't the same ! I was so disappointed ! So I searched until I found the same one I had as a child and this is it ! ! ! Love the message of continuing to try , of being helpful to others , and the role of encouragement . I have purchased one for each of my grandchildren . THIS ONE is the best !
5 #### Thank you for making this an ebook . One of my daughters favorites a great way to teach determination to your child . If you could make a bilingual version in spanish that would be fantastic
5 #### This part of a set of books I sent to my great - grandson . My granddaughter is appreciative of these books .
5 #### This is hands down my son 's book . A classic -- we have the version from when I was a child and bought this as back up since the " vintage " version is showing a little too much wear . Only down is that this book can be a bit lengthy and my son wants to read it every night/ day , multi times , so .... I also love that Little Engine is a female engine . Girl power .
5 #### After all these years . I know I can , I know I can is something I have always told my kids when they have felt doubts about anything .
2 #### Not the full story I recall . I ordered this for my kids , but this seems to be a condensed version . Please look for the original book as this does n't seem to be it . However , the basic concepts are there .
5 #### I have loved this book since I was a child and remember the message of the story so many decades later : be compassionate and never doubt yourself . From my memory ( having last read this years ago ) , the story revolves around a train that was carrying toys and treats to children at the other side of a mountain . The train breaks down and multiple trains pass by - they try to solicit help from each train but no train is willing to assist them . Finally comes a small train who , because of her size , does n't think she is capable of pulling them over the mountain , but is moved by her compassion . While pulling the train , she tells herself over and over , " I think I can , I think I can . " And she does . :) A wonderful , sweet story with a good message and beautiful illustrations . This book is a must - have .
5 #### Great children 's story and a classic . This is your child 's first lesson in perseverance , and one that will stay with them forever . I think I can . I know I can . Great words to build a life long foundation .
5 #### I have loved this story since I first read it to my children years ago . There are lessons on persistence against seeming insurmountable odds , never giving up hope , seeking help until you get it , and encouraging others when times are tough . I highly recommend this book for children of all ages .
3 #### Be sure to read book description . This book is the actual size of an index card . I purchased to share with a class of first graders and it was difficult to read to them and share pictures . Needed class magnifier to assist .
5 #### This classic has always been one of my favorite stories . I 've I do believe I have tried to incorporate its timeless message into my life . We should never give up , even if all the odds appear to be against us . We should believe in the possibility of our own strength . You ca n't necessarily count on those who appear to have the strength , or expertise , or life experience . Give a chance to the underdog . And that underdog just might be you !
4 #### I gave four stars , only because this version was quite small . However , if you love the story , I would suggest simply finding a larger version . There is so much to see in the pictures , and it can be missed in this small form . I think this would be a perfect gift to give away to guests at a train theme party , though !
3 #### When I bought this , the picture did n't give any hint as to the miniature nature of this book , so I was shocked when I opened the package and found this 4x4 little thing . I know that 's my fault for not reading the item details , but I think the picture should make it more clear that this is basically meant to be a postcard , not a book for a child 's collection . I ended up sending it to a friend ( all you need to do is stick three stamps on it and it 's good to go ) , otherwise I 'd post a picture to show that it 's about the size of a coaster .
5 #### HAD THIS BOOK FOR MY CHILDREN WAS GLAD TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT FOR MY GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER
5 #### My 3 year old just loves this book : illustrations , narrative and overall message . It 's a ' must read ' for bedtime since he got it .
5 #### I grew up reading this and my kids love it too !
4 #### I was expecting the large book , so I was shocked when I received this tiny book ! I forgot to check the measurements . It ended up a great addition to a baby gift .
5 #### This was a favorite book of my childhood . My original copy had long disappeared and I just really wanted the book and its message back in my collection . None of us are too old to absorb the messages that it brings . I 'd suggest one copy for all grandparents and a additional copies as gifts for each grandchild . Actually ir would make a great graduation gift in todays world .
5 #### Super cute classic children book . My son loves it
5 #### This book is a classic and always has been one of my favorites . Def a must have when it comes to buying books for kids .
5 #### awesome book . i purchased this for my little nephew , but i think my ( adult ) sister loves this book more than he does .... probably because it 's a throw back to our childhood ..... not sure , but was a very good purchase . :)
2 #### Sure , my kid loves it . But I can see why they have published multiple abridged versions . The original text is awkward and wordy . The story structure is also all wrong . There are three antagonist engines before the hero is introduced when two would do the job . Each time and engine stops they repeat the same wordy sentence . And only at the last " bad " engine do they introduce the gimmick of the book which everyone remembers -- where engines puff their thoughts in short little sentences . It would make a lot more sense if all the engines talked like the hero in short puffs . The layout is also questionable . Long sentences break up between pages awkwardly and are hard to get out in a single breath . Lastly , the hero 's part and the Act III conclusion are way too short . It should have taken up a greater page count -- or maybe lose the tedious setup .
5 #### Cute little book -- great grandchild will love hearing what " Daddy " liked so well . Like new !
5 #### Loved this book . My son gave it to his father an wrote in it ... Thank you for showing me I can ...
3 #### Got this after a nostalgia surge ( and losing all my Little Golden Books ) . Great to preserve the story and would not be something I 'd mind being subjected to the inevitable crayons but I miss the heft and feel of a ' book ' opening to a story .
3 #### Beware - this is an " abridged " version , so you 're not getting the whole classic story here . I wanted the full one , so was disappointed .
5 #### Loved this book as a child and love reading it with my 4 year old son !
5 #### The book is nicely illustrated . My 3year old is engaged when we read this book . Excellent story !
5 #### What a classic , wanted my grands to read it
4 #### Nice rendition of the original . For those who have complained about them making the train a female , thinking that this was a change from the original , they should be aware that in the original Watty Piper version , the train was a female . In many later versions however ( including the ones I knew when I was a kid ) , the train was a male . I am deducting a star since the cover on mine arrived with a tear .
5 #### This is our families favorite story . We have read this book regularly , and often daily , for the last three years ( since I had our first child ) . I 'm especially glad to have this book on my kindle :)
3 #### This book is little , not your regular sized book .
3 #### classic ! but somewhat surprised at size of book , very very small
5 #### Bought as a gift for a 3yr . old boy 's birthday ! He loved it !
5 #### I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old . He loves this book ! ! He actually listens when I read it . He 's now at the point where he has almost memorized all the words and " reads " it to me instead .
5 #### This was purchased for a new great - grandchild . It was one of my favorite books as a small child and I 'm hoping Scarlett will love it as well . I was thrilled that the artwork was like the original .
5 #### My daughter reaaaaally loves Thomas . I 've gotten her other train books and she likes them but always prefers her Thomas books . Until this one ! This is probably her favorite book right now . It 's such a classic ! I remember loving it as a kid too . So happy I got it for her !
5 #### Small book about 5"x5 " and was a perfect stocking stuffer . My daughter loves loves loves trains and this is a great addition to her train books .
1 #### This was not what I expected . It was my least favorite version of this story that I have seen .
5 #### Not my kids favorite book , but they do keep coming back to it time after time . Not as much as other books but they definitely come back to it and enjoy it . The artwork is nice , not perfect , but very nice .
1 #### The book was in poor shape . The cover was all wrinkled and someone actually wrote their name on the inside ! That should have been revealed in the description .
5 #### Love the illustrations and love Watty Piper 's telling of the story . I know there are other versions out there , but this one is my favorite , by far !
5 #### This is a small book , but covers and illustrates the classic children 's story well .
3 #### Board book is a very shortened version of the classic
5 #### Beautiful large - size book to teach young children about trying when you do n't think you can do something , not giving up and then achieving success . Overcoming odds and being able to accomplish something others can not and being proud of the accomplishment .
4 #### A wonderful book which I read to my children . A little small compared to the one I had thirty years ago , but my grandson does not seem to mind .
5 #### Another classic children 's book that I bought for my grandchildren .
5 #### I 've had this book since I was a child which is over 79 years and I purchased it for my great grandchildren for Christmas .
5 #### Nice book reminds me of my childhood I ca n't wait to to read to my son when he 's born .
5 #### I gave this as a special gift to a Buddhist nun who lives near me and for 2 years has been building a training monastery . It 's been a difficult , sometimes uphill project for her and a few other helpers , but it 's coming along now . She read the book out loud during her morning meditation with two other nuns - in - training ; they all loved it .
5 #### LOVE THIS BOOK ! I read this over and over as a child and was delighted to finally read it to my children . I also believe it contains valuable principles .
5 #### This was my favorite childhood story . Whenever things got tough in my life , I would say to myself , " I think I can , I think I can . " I 'm sixty and I never forgot this story ... sounds silly , buy true , My grandson loves it too . I hope it helps him think positive .
1 #### Not pleased with this purchase at all . I expected a book and what I got was what looked like a postcard . The book was tiny , and very cheaply made . Thin pages and abridged version . I should of read the description more closely because it is very misleading . Save your time and money and order a different version . I am sending this book back for a refund .
5 #### My four - year - old son and I love this re - telling of the old classic , The Little Engine That Could . Everyone knows the story of the little engine that used perseverance and positivity to find the strength to pull the train over the mountain -- I'm sure I 'm not the only one who recites " I think I can , I think I can " while hiking steep trails or running uphill -- and Loren Long 's new version keeps all that is timeless and magical about the old tale , and dresses it up with more beautiful and vibrant illustrations .
4 #### The story and illustrations are great , I just wish the book itself was bigger . Just realize it 's pocket - sized . Would be great to take on the go , but not a great bedtime story size . However , my kids still love reading it , even though it 's small , and they have n't complained about the size . The story is classic and teaches a simple but great message . My kids ( 5 and 6 years old ) love it , and I love that it has a nice message . Would definitely recommend the story itself , I just wish I would have ordered a bigger size ( if there is one ) so that when I read it to both my kids they can see the illustrations a little better .
4 #### Bought this for my grandson .. it is a classic . He is into Thomas and Friends and wanted to know the " names " of the engines .. cute .
3 #### I was dissapointed when I received this small book . I had been looking for the " Golden Book " version of this story to send to friends in England and had hoped this would come close . I 'll keep looking for what I want .
5 #### Perfect story for young students . Thank you for making the original version available .
5 #### This is a classic story that kids will always love , with a good encouraging message .
5 #### To me this book is as old as time , but a new book for my grandaughter . She loves it and I have pleasure reading it 4 - 5 times a day . The condition was great and the book came quickly thank u off that . Sincerely a great full Nana
4 #### I needed to refresh my mind about a great children 's book , to use for a funeral oration .
4 #### Nice book ... I only gave it 4 stars because I do n't think it 's great - original story- illustrations are ok
4 #### A friend suggested I read this leading to my first marathon .... I guess I will be chanting " I think I can , I think I can " - heart warming for little ones to ask for help and keep asking until you find the person who believes in you and what you want to achieve .
4 #### I was not bowled over by this book but I was stunned at how much my 3 1/2 loves it . Instant Favorite ! I do n't mind that its abridged , he often falls asleep near the end anyway . Its sweet and simple with pretty artwork . The repitition is not so fun for me so we usually do n't read every word on each page .... the Old Man train tickles my son when I do my best 100 yr old voice .
5 #### A great lesson in sticking to your goals and having self confidence .
4 #### It is ok . It is smaller than I expected . I purchased it for a plane . The text is very small and so are the pictures . My son ( 2.5yo ) lost his interest after we 've read it a couple of time as it was hard to see the pictures . Hopefully , we can re - read it when he is older .
5 #### The story is simple : We 're stronger than we think . You know the story and you know the tagline . I had n't read this since childhood . Reading it again , seeing these pictures , made it alive again . The pictures each are works of art . Drawing from classic comic strip styles , but elevating with a sort of depth not ordinarily seen in a children 's book , they will amaze and engage . As to the story -- wow ! It is prose and poetry at once . It avoids sing - songy rhymes , but has a simple refrain that has pushed this into the canon of great children 's literature . Anthony Trendl TreeFortBooks.com
5 #### This is the classic in its original format . Beware of " abridged " editions and reduced - size formats .
2 #### Watty Piper , The Little Engine that Could ( Platt and Munk , 1930 ) When I was a kid , I was pretty open to reading just about anything , really , and there were very few books I simply did not like . One of them was The Little Engine that Could . Well , a copy of it popped into our house tonight thanks to the mother - in - law , and I read it to the Bean tonight . Forty years later , my opinion of the book has not changed one bit . Repetitive prose , unlikable characters ( in the engines who refuse ) , trite , inspirational resolution ... I would n't have put things in those words when I was four , of course , at that time all I knew was that I was bored by it compared to other books in my collection of which I wore out multiple copies ( Big Max , The Snowy Day , Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People 's Ears , Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel , I could go on all day ) , but now , with a quarter - century of analysis and criticism behind me , I can put fingers on why the book rubbed me the wrong way so badly when I was young . And it still does . I know it is beloved of millions , but sorry , folks , I have never been able to get on this bandwagon , and at this point it 's pretty obvious I never will . *
5 #### Beautiful book ! And , my son loves it . It is a larger size , with more words , so very interesting and engaging for a 4 year old , who reads well . He is growing out of the learning to read , one or 4 words each page & this one is still engaging because it has very large , gorgeous images .
5 #### My Dad always told us to " think I can " and we could . Wanted my granddaughters to experience this book . Love it !
5 #### Two year old loves this book . I LOVE the updated illustrations especially the Native American doll . It 's just a beautiful book , one I will keep and pass down to my kids ' children in 30 years .
5 #### I used to read this story to my son and now I am reading it to my grandson . It is a great story with beautiful colorful pictures . Both of us have fun when we read it . Story time is a wonderful special time for bonding with someone you love .
1 #### Why would you take a classic children 's book and abridge it ? It 's already short . It 's designed for kids . Why cut it down ? Is paper that expensive ? I just wish the title said " The Little Engine That Could , Abridged . " I bought this from my mobile phone , without reading the fine print , assuming I 'd get the normal book . Time to find a normal copy . Perhaps in a physical bookstore this time . Or carefully reading reviews . Looking on a desktop , there seem to be dozens of different versions , all butchered in different ways . Perhaps Amazon could find a way to place the normal edition at the top of the listings ?
3 #### I purchased this as a gift for my grandson ... VERY disappointing that the Little Engine is now a female . I will try to find a little girl who will enjoy this and continue my search for a gift quality book that is still the original and has a male Little Engine .
5 #### My favorite book as a child ... I am purchasing this one for my newly - adopted nephew . A positive , encouraging message ... there 's nothing you ca n't do if you set your mind to it !
4 #### It was not the original book , but it serves it purpose in that I can give it to a little girl to teach her to dream and believe in herself , even when there are doubts . This books teaches children to dream .
5 #### A classic . This story is a must read for all children . Timeless and sweet , it teaches not only perserverebce but why we shoukdn't judge a book by its cover .
4 #### Cute classic kids story . Book is very small , only 4 1/2 X 4 /2 inches in size which was a surprise to me when I oipened up my package . Good size for little hands but very small print for reading . It arrived within alloted time frame and was well packaged . Another good addition to my kids library collection . Ellen P.
5 #### I am an artist , so when I read the book to my son , I was very fond of the artwork ; very relevant , exciting in color and texture , and humorous . I also loved the message of the book ; the idea of the power of your words and supportive actions . Excellent book !
4 #### my boy loves this story , and quotes whole pages , he loves the book and has read it hundreds of times , but the pages keep falling out- the stitching is not sturdy enough for a toddler 's loving attentions .
5 #### Have loved it since I was a child . Just bought it for my soon to be great nephew / niece . Have quoted the " I think I can " forever .
5 #### It 's a great story with a great message for small children and grown ups alike who love to read to their kids or grandkids .
5 #### I loved this book as a child . I think it turned into my mantram . Mine was a cheap edition and is long gone . This is an oversized gorgeous edition . I wonder if this little message is how I managed to survive advanced cancer and accomplish everything I ever set my mind to my whole life . May . be .
5 #### This book is one of my favorites and i bought it for a friend who has a baby . I recommend it
5 #### This was my younger son David 's favorite book . I bought this new copy of the book for my grandson who is named in memory of my younger son . This three - year - old loves the book and shuffles across the ceramic tile in the kitchen chugging , " I think I can ; I think I can . " As a retired teacher of literature and language arts , I treasure the book as a great motivational tool for children . I would recommend it to every parent of small children , because we all need encouragement and good self - image . And who does n't like trains ? ! ? ! ?
5 #### I bought this as a gift for a two year old , and I was told that it was good quality . He has been walking around with it , looking at it for two days .
5 #### This was my favorite book growing up . It has the best positive message of persevering -- never give up , pursue your dreams . Never give in to a difficult challenge -- you can do it . At 68 , I still never give up .
5 #### My mom used to read me this when I was very young . And , I think that phrase " I think I can , I know I can " has followed me throughout my years . A wonderful lesson to learn at a young age . One must believe in order for things to come true ! Absolutely love this book and the drawings . Most highly recommended .
4 #### My son loves this book but either I did n't read the description well or the size of the book was n't very prominently displayed . It 's very tiny and his grandparents definitely can not read it . It makes it tough to hold so I can read and he can see the pictures as well . Great , classic story though with beautiful pictures
5 #### I love this book so much because it 's a cute message , and the main character and the hero are both females . It 's refreshing to read a story to my daughter where the default character ( be it a duck , pig , train , robot or human ) is n't male . She 'll have time enough in society to learn that the default human is a white male and everything else is an " other , " I really do n't need children 's books to start hammering that message in while she 's not yet old enough to poop in the potty . Because some other books do that , but not this one . I think I got a little off - topic there ...
5 #### I remember this book from decades ago when my mother read it to my brother and me , and I ordered it for my two - year - old grandson . The book is exactly as I remember it and I am thrilled to be able to give it to Owen for his second birthday , and I look forward to reading it to him . I had the book at one time and read it to Owen 's dad . How lovely that this wonderful classic is still available ! Beautifully illustrated and a wonderful , positive story for children . Susan Moore Jordan
5 #### Classic story of perseverance - I loved this story as a child & so glad that it 's been modernized in its look / artwork for the next generation ! My 2.5 year old son loves this story & quotes " I think I can " on occasion !
5 #### As a teacher this book works so well when you are talking about motivation and determination to your class . Just a note , I teach high school and the students are spell - bound when we use this story for a lesson .
3 #### I glossed over the " mini " description of this book , but it truly is diminutive . If you want the regularly size book get another version but if you want the ultra small one this is the one for you .
4 #### This was one of my earliest books . I believe it was read to me repeatedly before I could read ( and I learned to read VERY young -- before I was out of diapers ) . The illustrations were SO vivid ; it 's rare to find a book that 's so charmingly illustrated . The story , of course , is about the Little Blue Engine , who has a positive attitude as compared with some of the less admirable traits of his fellow engines . Some of them are stuck up or snobby or full of negativity . The trains and even the cargo have personalities . ( My sister and I liked the dolls . ) And then one day , when faced with the possibility of some children over the mountain NOT GETTING THEIR CHRISTMAS GIFTS IN TIME ( gasp ! ) , the Little Blue Engine is the only one with enough motivation to drag those heavy cars up the steep tracks and save the day . I loved how " I - think - I - can " sounded so much like a train noise , and I could definitely imagine using it as a chant for little kids preparing for a difficult feat .
5 #### A classic story , nice travel size . Teach : perseverance & optimism . Children will enjoy saying the author 's unique name as well as chanting " I think I can , I think I can "
5 #### This book will always be near and dear to my heart , both of my children love this story it 's amazing !
5 #### I read this story to my daughter and son constantly and no I have bought it for my great grand son
3 #### This is a gift for my son who is three . He loves the little book . Mostly he likes to point and talk about the pictures on the book as you read the story . Since he is three , he can not give me detailed feedback other than he likes it .
2 #### We love the story and wanted to buy my nephew his own copy . Unfortunately , no where in the listing did it mention that the book was pocket sized . I returned it . Amazon was great about that , as always , but I 'd have much rather had the book .
3 #### I bought this for my nephew and I pictured it a big book but it came in itty bitty . Palm size . Still a great book , just to small for a 2 year old .
5 #### The Little Engine That Could is a classic story I enjoyed as a youngster . Now , I get to share it with my own children . IMHO , a must - have for every library .
3 #### I should have read the fine print before ordering this paperback copy . The book is teeny - tiny and I could not read it to my class . I had to go back and order the hardcover edition .
5 #### Our grandson picked up this book and did not want to put it down . He is two and currently in love with trains .
5 #### My son , ( 17 months ) , loves carrying this book around . It was so small , and easy to carry for him , that he brings it EVERYWHERE ! I love reading the encouraging story to him , too . Great find !
3 #### I bough this to help my train - loving child with the ABCs , and while it is a cute little book , it 's really not that great , and at times can be an awkward read .
5 #### I have always loved the " I think I can , I think I can , " and hear it joyfully say , " I thought I could , I thought I could " . We can al reread this one , you know ?
5 #### THIS IS A BOOK THAT I READ TO MY BROTHER YEARS AGO SO NOW I AM READING IT TO MY GRAND CHILDREN GOOD SHIPPER
5 #### Admit it . Every once in a while , a situation arises and you think of the Little Engine That Could ... and Did ... and you say to yourself " I think I can ... I THINK I can . And you do . Why not let the next generation learn all about persistence , the easy way .
5 #### This book was purchased for a book a day advent calendar for my grandchildren . They have enjoyed having it read to them and it is a nice addition to their collection .
4 #### I did n't realize that you could fit this book in your pocket when I bought it but my 2yr old doeasn't seem to mind . It 's a great classic no matter the size .
5 #### I remember this book from my childhood , and " I think I can , I think I can " became part of my mental vocabulary . I am now enjoying very much the opportunity to share that with my kids .
5 #### My grandson 's favorite story -- he chants along as I read , " I think I can , I think I can , I think I can . " Wonderful way to teach perserverance . We both like the fact that the little engine makes it to the top and down the other side to the good boys and girls !
5 #### my son reads to my grandson all the time . family favorite , I thank you very much . came fast . that is all i have to say
5 #### My grandmother read it to me often when I was little and I loved it then . I have a lot of tenacity and faith in God now and I think it 's from hearing this book read over and over .
3 #### This particular version did n't match the jacket of the book I ordered , which was supposed to be the pop - up version .
2 #### I did not realize how " mini " a mini book was . I purchased it as a gift and ended up having to purchase an additional book .
5 #### Another one of my favorites . There are never too many books for the little ones to read , and I normally give at least one book along with clothes for new mommies . The earlier they learn to read , the better off they 'll be .
3 #### This book is small . Picture a small book in your head ... its smaller than that . But that does n't factor into my star rating . Because they do list its size and its mentioned in other reviews . I bought this book because my son loves trains ( 2 years old ) and I remember loving this story of never give up as a child . Its our family motto " nothing worth having is easy to get " -keep trying and believe in yourself . This was not the book I was looking for . Apparently , I was looking for " pony engine " but that 's still not the product 's fault . The issue with the book is it makes all boy trains bad . I wo n't let my daughter ( 5 years ) read it either nor my son . Messages are important no matter how stuble it creeps into their brains . When perhaps they are older I will let them read the book as an example of how unfair and ridiculous it is to vilify a whole gender . I admits t to over thinking ot . But thhats my right as a parent .
5 #### We are planning some upcoming activities for our school teaching the school 's character traits . This book goes along great with the character trait of perseverance !
5 #### A classic book that is great to read to any child especially train lovers ..... this is a must read everyday in my house . Its a great and very durable book .
5 #### An excellent philosophy . One that can get you through your life in the good times and bad . Please read this one to your children often .
5 #### So glad to see this story of determination and success still exists for little ones . The perfect size for little hands to carry , for parents to read , and gorgeous , brightly colored pictures for little ones to follow along . The pictures are so accurate and brightly colored that toddlers will be able to tell themselves the story just by looking at the pictures , but it will be best when Mom and Dad are reading along .
1 #### Ridiculously small & inadequate . Bought as a gift for adoption & could n't give . Had to buy another so gift was late
5 #### A real motivator for children , which is based upon an immortal classic . I bought this edition after the reviews it received from other purchasers . There are several versions that I am sure are just fine as well , but I found this one to be better suited towards upper elementary students .
5 #### The young boy who was the recipient of this book was very excited when I gave it to him . He immediately reacted positively at the sight of the engine on the cover .
5 #### I purchased this for friends who are expecting their first child . It was fabulous and just as I remembered it .
5 #### I would recommend this book . This book is like the story of the Good Samaritan in a child story form in that other trains that could help the broken down train wo n't stop to help , but an unlikely candidate stops and helps . It 's also a good inspiring story about endurance , keep trying , tell yourself you can succeed and you will .
5 #### A friend gave this book to us . My 22 month old son loves this book ! ! He picks it out every time when we read .
4 #### " The Little Engine that Could " is another much maligned book . It is often criticized for being too saccharine or preachy , and if I read it every day , I might find that to be true . But reading occasionally ( maybe once a month ) , I find it delightful . First of all , it features a train , toys and a circus . What more could you want ? Personally , I could do with less of the clown ( as in , not at all ) , but not everyone shares my quirk or phobia . And it is a sweet story with an easy - to - grasp point . Is there anyone who grew up before 1990 who can hear " I think I can " and not remember the engine ? And the illustrations ( again excepting the clown ) are colorful and enjoyable . Overall , it is no wonder this book is a classic of children 's literature .
5 #### As a young boy growing up I did not have many books read to me before I went to bed . I wish this one could have been there for me to inspire me , as it has so many others over the years . I would hear about the title " The Little Engine That Could . " To no avail , it would take me well into my adult life for me to finally pick up " The Little Engine That Could . " Now I realize how powerful a phrase , ( " I think I could " " I think I could " ) seeped into the mind of many to spur them on in life . For me it is still not to late to acquire positive reinforcement . " The Little Engine That Could , " should be read and reread over the years for an effectual attitude . It is never to late " What The Mind of Man Can Conceive and Believe , The Mind Can Achieve . " Thanks , to the " Little Engine That Could . "
3 #### It was designed to be sent in the mail which is neat , but not what I was looking for . Great book though .
5 #### My husband 's favorite things are trains so I added this to a shower gift for our friend so they can like them too
5 #### This book great for coming out of the twos who do everything and going into the 3 's who say I ca n't . It was smaller than I had thought .
5 #### Colorful , excellent quality , binding is strong . My grandson loves this book ! A classic for an iPad capable 2 year old who also loves books .
5 #### Ordered several for my 102 yr old Mother to use as baby gifts . She has given this book before and feels it is an encouraging and instructive book to give to children .
5 #### I love this classic story the pictures are great and the story is easy to follow . I would recommend this to others
5 #### Every child should have this book in his / her library . I remember reading it as a child , and now I am reading it to my grandchildren .
5 #### This is a wonderful story that encourages children that they can do things if they really set their minds to it .
5 #### I love buying this book as a gift for the birth of a new baby , but then realized the book did n't contain the full story I remembered from childhood . I started researching a bit and found that most copies of this book contain a condensed version , not what they now call the " deluxe " version , which is what I grew up with . The book is great , as it always has been . One thing I noticed as an adult , which may or may not bother others , is that all of the trains that refuse to help the stalled train with all the goodies it 's tryint to bring over the mountain to the good boys and girls are " he s " ; the little engine that agrees to help is a " she . " Read into this what you will . I still love the book and its central message enough that I continue to give it as a gift whenever anyone I know has a new baby .
5 #### Wonderful book for children / and adults . A real classic . I read it to our children over 50 years ago and give it as gifts .
5 #### I am a big believer in board books for toddlers . This is an excellent version of the much loved classic .
5 #### This was my favorite book as a child and I wanted a new edition for my own children that still had the original illustrations . I am quite pleased with this book and my children enjoy it as well .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books . It 's simple and has a LARGE message . I wonder if my love of trains came from me reading this book as a youth . Buy it .
5 #### A very nice edition of this timeless story . My grandsons love the pictures , and I love reading this classic to them !
2 #### GOOD MORAL , BUT EVEN AS A KID I THOT IT WAS BEATING A DEAD HORSE . COULD SAY THE SAME IN LESS WORDS .
5 #### If you buy the currently printed Little Engine that Could and compare it to this one , you 'll see that the text is different even though the publisher claims the currently published one is the " full , original version " . The illustrations are also different is every other edition from the first . Since this is the widely accepted telling of a classic American morality tale , I felt it important that my daughter read it with the original prose and pictures . I want her to have a good background in classic storybooks as she learns to read . Elmo 's great , but modern popular culture is best appreciated with some decent cultural context gleaned from knowing popular canon . I think every child should get the chance to enjoy " The Little Engine that Could " in its original form .
5 #### Brings back memories for me as well as my grown children . Now memories are being shaped by my grandchildren . Love this classic book for kids
5 #### This classic story is a must have and the new illustrations help catch young readers attention . We will keep this in our collection for a long time .
5 #### This is an age - old favorite book that every little boy will love . My toddler grandson especially loves the pictures and even though he ca n't read , he has memorized the lines !
5 #### This is a beautiful edition . This book is a classic which I will give to my grandson when I am sure he wo n't eat it.it .
5 #### THIS IS ONE OF MY GRANDSON 'S FAVORITE BOOKS . HIS MOTHER READS IT TO HIM ALL THE TIME AT BEDTIME AND I ALSO PURCHASED THE MOVIE SO HE COULD WATCH ... THIS WAS ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES AS WELL WHEN I WAS A CHILD . LOVE THE STORY ! ! !
5 #### I love the positivity ! I love the can - do attitude ! This story as stayed with me since kindergarten . I have called upon its words in my adult years when I needed a boost and I have used this book as the impetius for my own Children 's Book ' The Caterpillar that Would n't Change , a story about never giving up .
5 #### We were looking for a copy of the book we remembered - this one was bigger but had the same illustrations .
2 #### I bought this book because the story is non - sexist unlike all other train stories ( a little female engine who helps , for a change , a male character ! ) . I thought having a tiny book about a tiny engine would be fun , but this book is so so small , it is impossible to read at bed time in dim light . When I hold it in my hand my son can not see the pictures , and I hand the book to him , I can not read the print . Also , I have never seen a children 's book where the sentences continue over the next page . That makes reading very difficult and unpleasant .
3 #### I love this book and its classic illustrations . The three stars pertain only to The Little Engine That Could ( Little Letters)[Abridged][Mass Market Paperback ] . The product description is wrong ; the book is actually only 5x5 " and has an odd wrap - around paper cover that is n't mentioned anywhere .
5 #### Even with some changes that I do n't think improves the book , this old classic is a good children 's book for your child or grandchild ..
5 #### This is truly a classic story in a nice book that my grandchild loves and we love reading to him .
5 #### My favorite book as a child in the 1940 's . It is still worth reading and passing on to wee ones today .
3 #### I think this story is for the older kids . Somehow it is too long for 3 or 6yrs old kids .
5 #### This book is so fun to read and the pictures are great ! I love making the voices for the characters in this book , my son loves it so much , I 'm glad I bought it
5 #### I bought this book to teach my 2 1/2 year old about trying and never giving up . It did exactly that , my son now understands the concepts of " I think I can " . I read other reviews about it being outdated and pictures being old . Yes , that is probably true but I would say appreciate it as a classic because it is ! Children can still relate to it whether the toys in the pictures are of wooden toys or modern gadgets .
5 #### One of my granddaughters favorite book . I loved it when I was a child . It really lasts ! The illustrations are wonderful and hold her attention .
4 #### I 'm giving this 4 stars because this book is amazing , and my kids love it . But , when they say it 's mini , they mean mini ! It is tiny ! I bought this so I could read it to the kindergarteners I work with at my son 's school . It 's got such a great lesson about keep trying and do n't give up , believe in yourself and you can do anything . BUT , the size got in the way of the lesson . The kids ( I had 4 at a small table ) could n't see the beautiful illustrations well . It 's completely my fault for not reading the description better . I would definitely recommend spending a few dollars more and getting the full size book .
5 #### Perfect book choice for a little boy of four who adores trains . I remembered the book from my daughter 's childhood with great fondness and am happy to pass on the joy .
4 #### My boys , though adults now , loved Watty Piper 's " The Little Engine That Could . " As a parent , what 's not to love ? It teaches that anything is possible with enough determination , especially when it 's for a good cause . When my three - year - old grandson developed a love of trains , I introduced him to the story , and it quickly became his favorite when he came for a visit . So I ordered this book for him . I take the blame for not checking the size more carefully . It seemed like a good value . When the book arrived I was so disappointed . Yes , it 's still readable , and I suppose it 's perfect for little hands , but I want the buyer to realize that the book they 're buying is small . Other than the size factor , it 's a good value for an excellent children 's book .
5 #### I bought this book for a two year old girl that loves trains . It has beautiful illustrations and she really loves it . Her parents had to read her this book multiple times a day there for a while .
5 #### Wow ! Wow ! Wow ! This book has awesome illustrations - expressive , magical , colorful ! The pages are larger than the average book and that adds to the beauty of the scenes . I highly recommend this version of the story !
1 #### This book was not as described and was actually a pop up book . The book was also not in very good condition . I ended up keeping it because it was only $ 4 and not worth the return shipping cost .
5 #### I got this book as an imagination library book . It quickly became one of my son 's favorite books . He likes the bright colors in the pictures and the fun story . The story is very good for teaching kids to help others and that they can do anything if they put their mind to it .
5 #### < div id="video - block - RX0JRTQ6JTWAB " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / C1VKzScFlhS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91OruCO4K - S.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;This is a great book ! The illustrations are awesome and the story inspiring .
2 #### I thought a board book version would be great for a young child , but this is not the same as the original . The illustrations are cutesy , the text is abridged -- a real disappointment .
5 #### This is a classic children 's book . I read it to my children for years . Then the copy was sent to my older grandchildren . Now the youngest granddaughter needs a copy of her own . The pictures are beautiful and something a child would like .
4 #### My little train lover adores this story and has no issues with it being much smaller than the library version . The story is stillfull length and that 's all she cares about !
3 #### Like some of the other reviewers , I purchased this book without reading the specifics . My fault , I know , but even if I was aware of the book size , I would n't expect the content to be so microscopic on the inside . Tough to hold your kids and read this book to them .
2 #### I have this exact same book as is pictured , it is not the book I recieved . I got a cardboard book . Nowhere in the description did it state that it was a cardboard book . I was very disappointed as this was a gift .
1 #### While the story is classic , this mini book 's illustrations are way too small . Also , the tiny printed words take up a third of each page . It is not at all like the sample pages shown .
5 #### I grew up with this Story and wanted to share it with my Nephew Ryan . He loves to get stuff in the mail , and recognizes the letters of his name on mail , though he just turned 3 . He loved it ! I also sent him " The Pokey Little Puppy " and intend to continue to enrich his and my other nieces ' and nephews ' experiences in literature with such classics .
5 #### This was my husband 's favorite book as a child so we recently added it to our library . Our train loving nephew has an equal amount of adoration for The Little Engine . On our bike rides he 'll often say " I think I can , I think I can " when we 're going up a hill . It 's a short book so if you have n't read it in a while do n't expect anything Earth shattering , but it 's a classic book that 's worth another read .
5 #### This movie was on Netflix but they messed it up so we decided to buy it on Amazon since our son was obsessed even with the broken one on Netflix . It is the greatest movie . Even as an adult I get sucked into the songs . It has a great message too .
5 #### This miniature version of the classic book is fun . It is the complete original , hardback , and only about five inches square . The only strange thing to me is that the words are sometimes a bit illogically placed ( sentences are broken up by page turns ) . My little boy asks to hear it often enough that I have it largely memorized so the page turns do n't phase me much , but I do think it odd .
5 #### Who does n't know this story ? The classic story of the little blue engine that pulls an engine carrying toys for children over the mountain has been inspiring children and adults for ages . The illustrations are fantastic and go perfectly with the story . My son is two and a half and it 's one of two stories that he lets me read from start to finish . It 's perfect for small children , especially small boys obsessed with choo choos !
5 #### Everyone knows The Little Engine That Could , but many do n't know that the author is actually unknown . " Watty Piper " was a publisher 's pen name , and the story predated him anyway . This new ( 2005 ) edition is notable for its new artwork by Loren Long , an illustrator of increasing acclaim . ( He illustrated Barack Obama 's even more recent&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Of - Thee - I - Sing - A - Letter - to - My - Daughters / dp/037583527X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Of Thee I Sing : A Letter to My Daughters</a > . ) This hardcover is HUGE ( just over 12 inches by just under 10 inches ) , and Long 's textured acrylic artwork , often in two - page spreads , is the focal point here . The message -- Think Positively -- is as vital for children now as it was when Platt & Munk published it in 1930 . ( Watty Piper was in reality Arnold Munk . ) As to the question of the trains ' gender , it does n't matter to me . More importantly , it does n't matter to my kids . Read this classic to your children , and hope that one day , they read it to THEIR children .
3 #### The Little Engine that Could by Watty Piper and illustrated by Cristina Ong is a story about the Little Engine who was trying to get all the toys to the workshop . I liked the book because it was kind of like God , because God always tells that to us , that we should n't give up just because something is hard . The book is good for kids who are 3 or 4 or maybe younger . The book 's main point is that we should n't give up if we 're doing something really hard , like when we were at Paradise Park and I almost got to the bell but I just could n't get there because the rocks were too high .
3 #### This version of the story was a little too abridged for my taste , but I do appreciate it 's durable board book format . My son ( 12 mo . when purchased ) enjoys the pictures , and probably would n't grasp the story yet anyway . But do n't order if you 're hoping for a board book version of the classic you remember .
5 #### Purchased this version because it was listed as being complete ( no missing engines or key parts of the story ) , well bound , and had excellent artwork . All that proved true when the book arrived . I would recommend this particular hardbound version to anyone who wants a copy of The Little Engine That Could that will be used for a generation or more .
5 #### What is there not to like about this classic masterpiece ? My kids love it and the message is positive . More children 's books need to teach lessons in self - esteem . It is an important building block that should be added to a child 's foundation at an early age .
5 #### This little book is a real classic in my opinion ! A must read for boys or girls . I know I remember reading it as a child .... it left a lasting impression on me . Now that is the stuff of good reading !
5 #### My grandson , 3 yrs old , is a big fan of Thomas the Tank . This classic tale has become a favorite already , I think because it does have colorful drawings of the story and , it is about trains . He thinks twice now about saying " I ca n't " . If he does , Grandma quietly repeats " I think I can , I think I can ... " . He will grin and forge ahead with the task or skill he was attempting . It is often one of his picks for a bedtime story . Train - loving child or not , the message is timeless .
5 #### Ca n't wait to read this wonderful book to my granddaughter , when she 's a bit older as I did with her mom , my daughter ..
5 #### I gave this book to my sister for her 61st birthday . She enjoyed reading the book as a child , read it to her children and to this day encourages friends and family by reminding them of the determination displayed by the main character in the book . Beautifully illustrated and bound . A timeless gem .
5 #### I have always loved this book . The story is inspiring and the illustrations are wonderful . When I was a child , I looked longingly at the picture of candy going to the boys and girls on the other side of the hill and wished I lived there . I recently bought this book for my four - year old granddaughter and I 'm sure she 'll love it just as much as I always have .
5 #### My 3 year old has started saying , " I think I can , I think I can " when he faces an obstacle and I love that ! We have read it over and over and over . Such a wonderful message .
5 #### I bought this book originally based on the reviews I saw on this website . Once we received it , I thought - wow - there 's really not much to it and I thought my 2.5 year old would be bored by it in no time . I was definitely wrong . My daughter loves this book and asks me to read it over and over again . She 's already memorized the story and reads it to me . The illustrations are cute , and your toddler will enjoy it .
5 #### My 3 yr old son loves this story . I never had the original book , so I ca n't comment on the difference with this new edition , but we really enjoy reading this story at bedtime . Pages are nice and thick , so no accidental tearing of the pages .
5 #### This is a beautiful edition of the book . I do n't know how it compares to the other editions , but my child and I really enjoy this book . The red on the book jacket is very shiny and the pages are just the right thickness so they do n't tear easily like some other hardcover books .
5 #### This is the original classic . It 's a total favorite for my son . He would n't go back to his other Leap Frog books . This one is a keeper that makes him laugh .
4 #### This classic book tells the story of a train whose engine stalls out before it can get over the last mountain to deliver toys and food to the good children on the other side of the mountain . The toys begin to flag down passing engines to take them the rest of the way . Several engines refuse , but a little blue engine agrees to try , even though she has never pulled such a heavy load . Through generous good will and tenacity she makes it over hill . The well - written and original plot , and the pleasantly repetitive " I think I can , " " I thought I could " has ensured its popularity for over sixty years . It has been illustrated in several styles , but this one and the one by Ruth Sanderson are the best ones I have seen . The&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Wee - Sing - and - Pretend / dp/0613882393 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Wee Sing and Pretend</a>&nbsp;album has a " Little Blue Engine " song derived from this book which makes a good companion to it .
5 #### This is a feel good , helpful story about trains that do n't have their own section in the Target toy department . My 3 - year - old daughter loves trains . And Thomas is getting a little annoying . This book is wonderful on so many levels . I love that heroine is a girl train . The message is great -- think positive and you can achieve . We 've only had it a short time , but daughter quotes the book back to me already . It 's a joy to read out loud -- it 's very well written . And the illustrations evoke a different time -- when kids were kids and not just consumers that need to be enticed into buying a toy or a book or a DVD collection .
5 #### This is adelightful book and a true classic . The illustrations are intricate and beautiful - full of fun and sweet details and are a visual feast for both children and adults . The story is a classic tale with a good moral ( do your best , and help others when you can - you can do it ! ) that is appealing to all ages . We just began reading this to our almost 20 month old son and though he is too little to undertand all of it , he is captivated by the pictures and the phrase " I think I can , I think I can , I think I can ! " In my opionion this is must have for all families .
5 #### My kids go nuts over this book b / c each page has a silly picture , and they can respond , " Yes ! " It 's fun to watch my 4 - year - old recite it from memory to my 2 - year - old and hear him respond , " Yes ! " and " No ! " at the appropriate places ! This is a fantastic book !
5 #### VERY , VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE . OUR GRANDCHILREN WILL ENJOY THIS OLD BOOK AS MUCH AS THEIR PARENTS DID YEARS AGO .
5 #### Chugging along through life , we often meet obstacles that hold us back . But one thing we must learn is .... If you want something badly enough and you put forth your best effort , the impossible becomes the possible . All children should be able to say " I think I can " .
5 #### My 2 - year old adores this book . The repeated " No " to the questions cracks him up .
4 #### Okay , first things first . This book has got some gender issues going on . All the male trains are too busy to help the broken down train and its little friends carry presents to the little children . The only train that cares is super tiny , has a very uneventful job , and is female . If you can get past this gendered message , the book does show that if you push yourself hard enough , you can accomplish your goals .
5 #### For my son whose middle name is " Engine " . He is the little Engine that could . This is as classy as it gets for your little ones . All of the important life lessons are covered with a story line that intrigues their minds .
5 #### This is an all - time classic because it is such a classic , and as much fun to read aloud as silently .

5 #### My 3 yr old son loves this book , he makes us read in several times each day and has memorized a lot of sentences from it . I would recommend this to anyone whose kid loves trains .
4 #### My husband loves reading this classic to our daughter and she loves reading along ! A classic .
5 #### This is a book I loved as a child and my 21 month grandson enjoys it as much as I do .
5 #### The story was reworded , but it is still a great story and a great teaching lesson . The illustrations in this book are gorgeous .
4 #### This is a wonderful version of a classic . The pictures are wonderful for mom to look at as she reads !
5 #### This was a childhood favorite of ours and now of our son . We love that it has the original illustrations , although we also enjoy the newly illustrated one as well .
5 #### Excellent book that I just purchased for my four year old nephews birhtday . As we all know the book tells us how perseverance and persistence will eventually pay off if we try hard enough . It gives hope to all .
5 #### my twin toddlers love this book - the train - shaped board book is interesting for them to explore with their little hands , and the story just long enough to hold thier attention
5 #### My two year old granddaughter is reminded of all the things to do before bedtime .... then she gets a story ! Very popular book .
5 #### When Cornelius ' mother quizzes him on whether he 's ready for bed , he answers honestly each time . Yes , Cornelius has fed the fish ... chocolate chip cookies ! Yes , Cornelius has put on his pajamas ... and a pair of rollerskates and a scuba mask ! Preschoolers and kindergardeners will laugh at Cornelius ' silly antics . Adults will appreciate whimsy in illustrations : the fishes ' shocked looks , the titles on Cornelius ' books ( We , we , we all the way home , Where the Wild Pigs Are , and If you Give a Mouse a Pig just to name a few ) . Great for encouraging dialogue during a one - on - one read - aloud session .
5 #### Wow ... books that have impacted me over the course of my life ... I read this as a preschooler and the message was never lost . This timeless classic about a little train that uses will and belief in one 's self to overcome obstacles is the grandaddy of the self help literature ! In this beautifully illustrated version , I can share these wonderful moments with my own children and god children . Getting the toys to the good children on the other side of the mountain is the core motivation to show children young and old the power of self belief . This book was a major inspiration to me as a child and through my own books , I continue to help perpetuate the choice to believe in yourself . As an author of children 's books , I treasure the magic that reading brings to children . This is about as important a tool as any that you will ever arm your children with . Take a shot on this book ... you will not be disappointed . Brian Weiner CEO The Illusion Factory ( Inform and Empower Yourself ) Author Toad Catchers ' Creek
4 #### both my boys ( 2 and 4 ) love to hear this story over and over . There are quite a few lessons to be learned in this adorable book .
5 #### " Cornelius P. Mud , Are You Ready for Bed ? , " the latest children 's storybook from author / illustrator Barney Saltzberg , takes readers through the zany bedtime routine of Cornelius P. Mud , a very silly pig . The subject is a ritual all young children are familiar with , getting ready for bed . The spirited Cornelius , however , puts his own special twist on the bedtime routine . Sure , he puts his toys away -- in the refrigerator ! Yes , he puts on his pajamas -- and his snorkel , and his rollerblades and his swimming pool float ! What really makes " Cornelius P. Mud , Are You Ready for Bed ? " funny is the way Saltzberg uses the illustrations to tell us the real story . The text is simple and straightforward , innocent enough . It 's in the pictures that we catch on to Cornelius ' antics and get to see the mischievous gleam in his eye . " Cornelius P. Mud , Are You Ready for Bed ? " is a hilarious , vibrantly illustrated story . Read this to your children if you want them to fall asleep smiling . No matter how unhappy they are about having to go to bed , they wo n't be able to resist Cornelius ' " charms . "
5 #### This little book with its beautiful picture of ' The Little Engine that Could ' was a favorite . I read it many times to my children . The message of not giving up , of taking on something which the odds are against and are unlikely , of doing what is hard and to some seems impossible , of persisting and persisting until one does climb the mountain is one I think important for all of us in life . As I remember this book I think of my children and pray to G - d for their well being .And that they too will know in the words of their grandfather that lesson " When the going gets tough , the tough get going " A beautiful little book which brought us many moments of happiness .
5 #### Much discussion about the gender of the trains , the significance of which had escaped me , even after reading to my kids over , and over , and over . But very true , nice to have a female heroine . Bottom line - this is a great story and the children respond regardless of their gender . In fact my 2 year old turned into a train lover because of it . We often use the phrase " I think I can , I think I can " when they complain they can not accomplish something challenging and it does inspire them to try . The illustrations are charming and have a sweet old fashioned quality . Ca n't miss with this one .
5 #### As a parent of three , one of the most important things I can give my children is motivation . The attitude that he or she CAN DO ANYTHING IF THEY THINK THEY CAN DO IT . By reading this story over and over again , the message will go into their conscious and subconscious mind and my hope is that they will follow their dreams and become all they are able to become .

5 #### My second daughter has now fallen in love with this book , at about the same age as her older sister did ( 3 and 1/2 ) . So , we are reading it every single night , often multiple times . If her older sister is any guide , this will probably continue for about 6 months . This is simply an absolutely perfect children 's story . The plot has some tension to keep the child 's interest to the end of the story . The story shows how small people ( or trains , if you want to be literal ) with a good heart ( like a child ) can make a big difference in the world . The illustrations are extremely colorful and magical . The only fault ( this is incredibly minor ) I can find is the one - time usage of the word " indignantly " , which no child is going to know . Other than that , I would n't change any other word or aspect of this book . It 's also a fun story for an adult to read outloud . I enjoy using different voices for the arrogant Shiny New Engine , the gruff Freight Engine , and the tired Old Engine , as well as helpful Little Blue Engine 's famous repetitive cadence ( " I think I can " ) . It will be a sad day when my youngest outgrows this book . Do n't deny yourself or your child the pleasure - buy it !
5 #### I liked this book because it motivated me to do things positively than negatively . I would recommend this book because of the way the train is determined to go over the hill to give the toys to all the kids on the other side .

4 #### The current self - help genre tends to be dwelling on hurts and self - pity , then finding magical solutions . Our Little Engine just has healthy self - confidence and determination . And please do n't stress even that when reading it to the kids who will love it , since they find their own more imaginative interpretations . The unabridged version is a lifetime favourite of mine , and , for classroom use or that with older children , find a copy at all costs . This version does retain much of the essence , however , and is great for the pre - school set . The only " negative " I can think of is that the kids so love the repetition that parents may grow a bit tired of the daily requests for it to be re - read , especially if the particular child wants to hear only certain sections ( I knew one who always wanted " the clown part , " the other " the food part . " ) The same enjoyable repetition makes this a favourite story to read to children in primary grades . Yes , be sure you do n't stop the kids from all joining in " I think I can ... " This remains one book that every favourite kid of mine receives as a present . If it disappoints any of your children , that will be a first , in my experience !
5 #### Few books are so gratifying to read to children for the first time . A child does not even need to understand English to " get " it . On first meeting our four - year - old son , who had never heard a world of English until then , I put him on my knee and impersonated each engine character chugging through these pages . He was scared and shy , but he loved the " characters , " which I could only differentiate for him by sound , and he especially loved the famous repeating line " I think I can . " As my whispers rose to crescendo , he squealed in delight . Nowadays he reads much harder books before going to sleep at night . But he likes every now and then to come back to this one : He well remembers the first moments of bonding with me , and with this book . --- Alyssa A. Lappen
3 #### This is one of the great children 's stories of all time . I loved it as a child and read it over and over again , and my son has been demanding it as a bedtime story regularly since he was2 - 1/2 years old . The 1991 Platt & Munk ( a division of Grosset & Dunlap ) edition , beautifully illustrated by Cristina Ong , leaves out all the requests made to the busy trains . The story is now very brief ( which is why I give it only 3 stars instead of the 5 the full - length version deserves)--I suppose because it is a board book -- but the essentials are all there . It also changes the sex of the engines from male to female , so perhaps some parents would like to read this edition to their children as well as one of the others .
5 #### Even as an adult , the message is loud and clear - persistence pays off . A close friend gave me this book after I achieved a goal for which I had strived long and hard - this book was the PERFECT gift . I ca n't wait to share it with my daughter .
4 #### If I were rating this book based on how much I like it , it would be about a 2 star book ! If my son were rating it , it would be 5 plus stars ! I always found this story a bit dull and predictable . I was given this book for my son , and read it to him half thinking he would feel the same . Well , from the time he was less than a year old , he loved it very , very much . We read it over and over and over .... I think the message does inspire kids , and of course , it 's about trains , which alone is enough to make him happy . So I have mellowed on this title , and think it richly deserves a 4 star vote !
5 #### Like many others , I first read these poems as a very young child . I did n't realise until rereading them just recently how many of them had stayed with me . The poems all deal with sounds , sights and emotions that will be familiar to most young children . And as an adult , the poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson brings back that sense of wonder and amazement that many of us lose as we grow older . One of the poems that I will always remember deals with how difficult it is to go to bed when you are told in the summer when the days are long and the sun is still out . who does n't remember this ? The illustrations in this particular edition , by Tasha Tudor , capture perfectly the childhood world of the poetry -- the imagination in play is wonderfully portrayed . Remember when the space under the table became a cave , or a castle , or a spaceship ? These poems and the accompanying illustrations deal with these imaginary adventures that all children share in . Purchase this book and share it with other adults and with the children in your life . If it stays with you for the rest of your life , then you have gained a treasure .
5 #### Thirty years ago , I was taught to read with this . Different pictures , same poems . I learned to imagine and believe in ordinary , yet beautiful things . Even today , in my own writing , I smile realizing how and when I learned a technique ... just by listening to my mother whisper these poems nightly . Aptly named , RLS has the reader remembering the wonderful days of playing alone and with friends , of delighting in the moment . Your child will gain an understanding of classic children 's poetry , of the rhythm and rhyme . They sound eloquent aloud , and read gentle at bedtime . Anthony Trendl TreeFortBooks.com
5 #### Gyo Fujikawa is my favorite illustrator of this collection of poems by Robert Louis Stevenson .
5 #### A Child 's Garden of Verses is a childhood staple that should be in every child 's home library . I purchased the hardback illustrated by Gyo Fujikawa , one of my favorite children 's illustrators . The book is large and the illustrations are charming . There are a variety of full color and black and white illustrations . The poor reviews for the paperback version of this book made me nervous , but do n't worry about ordering this hardbound Gyo Fujikawa illustrated edition . I ordered it for my niece 's birthday and ca n't wait to give it to her ! My own kids are begging to read it before it gets gifted :)
5 #### This is a beautiful book and I do enjoy it as I did as a chile . My favorite of all books .
5 #### These poems were clearly written for children , but are not childish . I ve enjoyed reading this to my children at bedtime .
5 #### A classic . The pictures are charming , and the poems are marvelous . I got it for my little grandson to enjoy when he gets to be a little older . I remember memorizing some of these poems when I was a child , and have always loved them .
5 #### This is a classic . I bought it for my grandchildren to read to their children , my great grands .
5 #### This is a great book , but the cover is just a drab green color . Illustrations on inside are great !
5 #### Lots of memories as I read poems to my grandchildren .
5 #### Such a beautiful book and wonderful poems for children .
3 #### Another classic that was printed in China . Has a strong smell of printing materials .
5 #### this is the most beautiful book . It is a lovely and beautiful way to expand little minds early on in the world of literature . Love it and the art work is stunning .
5 #### I can not recommend this book enough we absolutely adore this book in our home . I read a few verses to my 3 and 4 year old every night .
5 #### Beautiful poems from childhood , together with lovely paintings by Tasha Tudor .... can't lose with that combination . A wonderful gift for any child .... or even and adult , which is who I bought it for .
1 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/A - Child - s - Garden - of - Verses / dp/1514288109 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">A Child 's Garden of Verses</a > I was completely disappointed with this book . I was excited to get it to read it to my kids . Once I got it I was completely saddened by it . I could barely read it due to pages missing . Then , the poems in it all ran together , so I was unable to tell one from another . complete waste of money .
5 #### Absolutely Beautiful . A worthy addition to any family 's collection .
5 #### They loved it , I barely read more that a couple of pages . My rating is based on the Grandkid 's reation
5 #### purchased as a duplicate for our childhood book so each of our children can have one for their homes . Very good packing by sender , and the service was prompt , and the book exactly as described - thank you .
5 #### I am a homeschool mom who incorporated this gem into our school day ( kindergartener and first grader ) , and I am so thankful for it ! RLS knows words and the minds of children , and this book helped me introduce one to the other . Two of my friends have bought this for their children since looking at my copy .
5 #### There are many editions of Robert Louis Stevenson 's A Child 's Garden of Verses . This one is notable because it is illustrated by Eve Garnett , who has filled this edition with most delightful pencil sketches and drawings . Next to Tasha Tudor 's illustrations for the poems she selected for her collection , Wings From The Wind , I like these lovely ( on a smaller scale ) drawings by Eve Garnett . Garnett was the first British writer of children 's stories to write wonderful stories of working class families ( in London ) ( The Family from One End Street , etc . ) , and she illustrated her own books . A small gem of a story of hers ( " The Kind Visitor " ) can be found in a collection of stories titled : A Golden Land , edited by James Reeves . The story originally appeared in Eve Garnett 's collection of four of her stories , called : Lost And Found . Sadly consider how many excellent books and stories are " lost " to today 's children because they are out of print ! This edition of RLS 's poems is also out of print .
2 #### You know , this book was not at all what I hoped to receive in the mail . The reproduction was awful . The picture quality was terrible . The poems were slightly enjoyable which is why I am giving it a two stars instead of one . All and all , folks really talked this one up in the Ambleside society and I just wondered why in the end . He 's a well known author , but the book I received did not live up to par . It maybe less disappointing to glean his writings for free off the internet rather than part with cash for this particular book .
2 #### This is a rather faint photographic reprint of the 1919 volume , so the images are faded . This item would only be useful to someone doing work on the illustrated versions of these poems . It is not attractive to young children .
5 #### A beautiful nostalgia book with Tasha Tudor illustrations . Arrived in good condition and promptly from seller .
5 #### I had a copy of this growing up and loved reading it again . The illustrations were beautiful ... brought back many memories !
5 #### My first book , over 70 years ago . Remember my Mother reading to me every night . I have bought this book for each of my Grandchildren . I have it for myself now on my Kindle . Still enjoy .
5 #### This book is entirely charming . We absolutely love Gyo Fujikawa 's illustrations ! They complement the classic children 's poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson perfectly !
5 #### The copy of " A Child 's Garden of Verses " by Robert Louis Stevenson I ordered as a Christmas gift for my Great Grandson was perfect ! The illustrations by Tasha Tudor for the book were perfect .
5 #### I grew up with this book ' it was my favorite . I bought this ebook version so I 'd always have it to read to grandchildren .
1 #### Terrible . This is just photocopied paper glued in a book . Titles are n't even on the same pages as some of the poems . Poor quality . Would not buy . Deserves zero stars .
5 #### It was beautiful book when I was a child and it is a beautiful book today - 70 yrs later
5 #### I love the book , and I hope my grandchildren will too .
5 #### Great book , delivered promptly . Enjoying the verses with my grandson
1 #### Terrible , blurry , faded reproduction of original book . This product deserves no starts . Amazon should n't sell it at all .
1 #### The Kindle version of the Everyman 's Library Children 's Classics is poorly formatted . Some of the poems which originally appeared within illustrations are ONLY in the illustration , and the illustrations are small and not very high quality , so those poems are difficult to read .
5 #### I bought this book for great granddaughter . I 'll have to wait and see how she likes it .
4 #### Pages are thin . Child would easily tear even with supervision . Putting it away for a few years .
2 #### I have n't seen this particular version so I 'm giving it an extra star for what I presume to be nice illustrations but these verses by RLS are horrible . Not only are they terrible poetry , they have outdated and toxic ideas ( such as the idea of " bad children " and the verse about " foreign children " ) , and much.of the vocab is so outdated that it wo n't be understood by today 's kids without so much explanation that any magic will be stripped away . Also , FYI they are skewed toward gun / soldier play . There are a lot of important childhood experiences in the verses that are great to discuss with children such as imagination and what to do when you 're lonely but I can not in good conscience recommend this book . I was so excited to find the 1960 illustrated version but now this may be the second book ever that I 'll put in the recycling bin . Browse the verses online for free or get the 99c kindle version if you really ca n't believe it and need to see for yourself .
5 #### This beautiful , gentle book was a birthday gift for a just - turned 8 year - old little girl . The illustrations and literature inside this book are charming and enchanting .
5 #### It has all the wonderful poems and stories I read to my boys when they were little . They were also read to me by my mom many years ago , and I love them and want to pass them on to my grandchildren .
5 #### The perfect gift from adults who follow through and read it with children .
3 #### Stevenson 's poems are wonderful but it 's hard to read them in this book because they follow one another with little break between then and there are no pictures in it at all . I wish I 'd paid a little more and gotten a better version .
5 #### Beautiful verse . A book every child should have read to them and then read it themselves .
5 #### Great memories----60 - 70 years ago , and I can still quote lots of them . Now I 'll have to explain some words ( counterpane ) and lifestyles and that should make more great memories ! Book and illustrations are excellent .
1 #### I wanted my son to have poems to memorize . This is a cheap knockoff that ca n't even spare a page for a single poem . It just has them one after another with little distinguishing between one and the next except a slight change in font of the title . Truly a cheap , flimsy book . The poems are lovely , so I suspect that being out of copyright this is just an attempt to grab at money without putting quality into it . The paper is possibly the lowest quality you can buy . The poems deserve better .
4 #### It contained all of the classics with a modern cover .
5 #### Most of the old poems still hold up . Some , though , are dated by their first - world views . We can read them now and learn how the world has changed , then skip them in the future .
1 #### THE BOOK IS A VERY SMALL PAPERBACK WITH NO ILLUSTRATIONS
2 #### No objections to the poetry , but the printing is quite off . Some of the poems are printed on opposite pages , separated by large pictures . Makes it difficult to keep the flow of the poem .
1 #### I have never been so insulted by a publisher 's work ( or lack thereof ) . What should be a lovely , classic book for children turned to be nothing but a cheap knock - off . Starting with the author 's bio page , which was titled " Jane Austen , " followed by very grainy , low - quality pictures that had little to do with the subject , poem titles at the beginning and end of poems ( the first poem ended with " Bed Bed in in Summer Summer ) , oddly placed blank pages , and poem titles at the end of one page with the poem following on the next . I was so disgusted , I could n't even show it to my child , lest he think that this was appropriate work . Robert Louis Stevenson is probably rolling over in his grave . Publisher : CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform ; Prm Ill edition ( April 4 , 2016 )
5 #### Will love reading these classic poems to my granddaughter . Beautiful illustrations .
5 #### This is my favorite children 's book . No child should be without it .
5 #### This review is of the CLASSIC ILLUSTRATED EDITION . Other reviews note this edition has all the original poems . Apparently some other editions do not . I ca n't say for sure since I have never compared to the original but all the classics are certainly here . I read them to my kids when they were babies through school age ; there is enough going on in the poems and the pictures are good enough they liked them . I also got a CD of them put to music , sung by a lovely soprano . ( Music for Little People/ Ted Jacobs ) and we listened all the time when the kids were little , including as bedtime lullabies . My middle schooler has just stopped letting me sing " Young Night Thought " to him then , and I still sing " The Moon " or " Lamplighter to my 10 year old . I think having some memorized poems is good for the brain and the psyche and having these set to music makes that come naturally .
1 #### I purchased the ebook version from a link on the Tasha Tudor product page for A Child 's Garden of Verses , assuming the e book was identical to the paperback and hardcover versions illustrated by Ms Tudor . It is not . I have notified Amazon that perhaps they want to delete the link from the Tasha Tudor page .
5 #### Thank you for the quick response ! Just the Book I was looking for my 101 yr . old Grandma !
5 #### A beautifully illustrated version of a classic book ! Very happy .
5 #### My parents shared these verses with me when I was very small , and I grew to love them . Reading them now in my sixties brings back memories of carefree times . I for one find it interesting that the same man who wrote these verses also wrote of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde .
5 #### Beautiful book of RLS poetry . The pictures are delightful and captivating for young children . Every family should have this in their library .
5 #### a lot is first person . i see so much so vividly since i grew up with this wonderful book and still remember bits of it . i used to dream about the little boats that rls would set onto the surface of the river and think of where they would go , what adventures they would have , it set me dreaming and does so still . away down the river , a hundred miles or more , other little children will bring my boats ashore .
5 #### What the world needs now . Read this to your children !
5 #### We adore this book ! I spent the entire school year slowly savoring the poetry with my daughter . And Tasha Tudors art work is so lovely that I decided to use this extra copy ( we already owned the book ) to frame some of the poems and decorate my daughters room with them . A book that will be treasured for years to come .
5 #### Childhood poems who could ask for more and illustrated by Tasha Tudor . Fantastic .
3 #### Disappointed in the illustrations . Was looking unsuccessfully for the edition I had as a child . Cover was a little beaten up , but I expected that ; it 's very old . I enjoyed re - reading the beautiful old poems . Brought back wonderful memories of my granny reading them to me . I hope the mommy and baby - to - be to whom I 'm giving this precious book will enjoy it as much as I.
5 #### it is a great child 's book , I had it about 75 years ago as a child and it was a favorite .
5 #### Purchased this for my Husband 's Grandma , she was born in 1925 , and told me how she missed her Mother 's copy of this book . Not the same as the one she had , but she was very pleased with this version .
5 #### I have loved this book all my life . It was a gift when I was small and I believe every child should read it- many times . I always feel better after I read it .
5 #### Classic edition -- great way to introduce a favorite child to great literature . ......
4 #### I wanted this book for my future grandson . My mother insisted on having it on hand so that she could read it to by daughter . My daughter was thrilled to get it because it reminded her of her grandmother . We will all explain to Oliver why we love to read this book to him !
4 #### Its illustrations and text are lovely , but I was disappointed with it physically . This book is small , slight , lightweight . I had expected a book with more physical heft and substance . This book is not likely to survive long in a child 's bedroom or library ..
5 #### My granddaughter loves poetry ( she is eleven ) . This collection does not disappoint .
4 #### I remembered them as more fun to learn .. my grandkids are not wild about this one at all ...
5 #### I love the illustrations in this book , but most of the rhymes are antiquated and will not hold the interest of today 's kiddos .
4 #### Nice picture book , but many of the poems are antiquated and so do not hold the interest of little ones today . Nevertheless it is a sweet book and if your little one enjoys rhymes , you may find this a good purchase .
5 #### My children enjoyed these poems . They now feel connected to Robert Louis Stevenson 's childhood . The illustrations are beautiful .
4 #### A great read - aloud book for children with some classic poems .
4 #### This is a very nice book . We have enjoyed reading it . I can not say it is my favorite and my children are n't dying to read it either but it is a nice book of poetry . The subjects are all very serious . The illustrations are soft and lovely .
5 #### I had this book when I was a child ( in the early ' 40 's ) and want it to read to my newest Great Grandchild when he 's a little older .
5 #### I was thrilled with this book -- it was better than I expected for a book so old : clean , crisp , tight binding -- and superbly packaged . I 've never seen anything packaged that well before . Thank you ! ! !
5 #### This book is in excellent condition ( it was used ) . I was pleasantly surprised by its quality , too .
5 #### I enjoyed the rhymes of childhood memories in this book . It made me think of days gone by with my little ones .
5 #### Illustrations are beautiful ! Although the poems are a bit outdated , it 's a classic that I believe should be in a child 's library .
5 #### it is wonderful book to share splendid moments in family ! ! !
5 #### Stevenson 's masterful work is enhanced by Tasha Tudor 's alluring art .
5 #### One of my favorite book as a child . Urchased it for my granddaughter because there are n't any like it nowadays
5 #### the sweetness of these words i carry with me , and for under $ 3 is there any better gift to give a parent / child ? the price makes the gift not " too precious " to read and take off the shelf . every child should have a copy .
5 #### This arrived in great shape it was just as discribed
5 #### A classic that I purchased for my 3 young grandchildren .
5 #### This is a gorgeous edition of a book every child should have . We have several different versions and this is my absolute favorite . The art is very pretty and really captures the innocence of the poetry .
5 #### This is a beautiful book with timeless illustrations . Exactly what I wanted for new parents .
5 #### A gift for a great - grandchild who will be born next week . Every child should have a copy of this book .
5 #### I have an older version of this book from the 1800 's . Wanted to have a more recent version that can be handled and enjoyed . lovely verse that still has a place in children 's hearts !
5 #### Beautifully illustrated . Favorite Rhymes and excellent for finding something for the kids to memorize !
5 #### Beautiful classic , illustrations . As far as I can tell it 's his entire collection . Many of his poems are mentioned in our homeschool curriculum , Writing with Ease & First Grammar Lessons . This is a great supplement and an excellent staple for any children 's library .
5 #### A classic . Loved to have a poem read to me at bedtime as a child . Comfort in a book of poetry .
4 #### I gave it as a gift - I was pleased with the condition .
5 #### This is a beautiful book . I will be purchasing additional copies for gifts .
5 #### This brought back such beautiful memories from childhood . It was exactly what I was looking for .
5 #### Lovely book ! I remember my Grandma reading to me as a young child
5 #### I got this to read on our trip to Scotland and was returned to childhood memories , both of having it read to me and reading it to my younger brother and my own children . Robert Louis Stevenson captures the essence and innocence of childhood wonderfully . Truly a classic worth sharing through the generations .
4 #### There are so many gems in this book of verses for children to memorize . I especially enjoyed the one about eating goodly , or they will grow up spoiled by all the junk food snuck .
5 #### What a large , well illustrated version . I had this growing up and lost it . I , m now 60 years old and teared up reading some of these poems . Countless children have grown up with this book and it makes me sad to see the new generation playing around with notepads and smart phones at 4 and 5 years old . Really pathetic . They should be outdoors playing when possible .
5 #### My great granddaughter and family are enjoying it as did I in my childhood . It is best read to small children after they learn nursery rhymes from Mother Goose .
5 #### This is a gift .... shhhhhh .... Still have this good from childhood and I am OLD . Loved the illustrations and of course , the verses are a part of my dwindling memory bank
3 #### A lovely reminder , but not laid out very well , and of course , unillustrated . Free , but this should not be your only copy .
5 #### Poems are so fun and thrilling to read . It takes me back to my childhood . Illustrations are excellent !
5 #### I bought this to add to my children 's collection . It 's beautifully illustrated and brings back fond memories of the verse read to me as a child .
3 #### This is not the edition I was looking for . It;s ok Nothing against the seller . It is the edition . Not all the great verses were in this one .
5 #### Bought this as it 's a big part of my early childhood love of books . The art work in this one was perfect for blending with those memories .
5 #### Will give to my 6yr.granddaughter and use the Favorite poems for the 10yr . old
5 #### i love presenting my grandchildren with poetry and this book is a great source .
5 #### Love both the author and Tasha Tudor ... how could one go wrong !
4 #### Love it ! Beautiful pictures and beautiful old time verses by R.L.S. Great for story time for some child with a fanciful imagination .
5 #### I grew up reading and loving this collection - I wonder what happened to our family copy ? I recently read " Under a Wide and Starry Sky " , a biography of Robert Louis Stevenson and his wife Fanny , and wanted to revisit the poems . They did not disappoint and were even enhanced by knowing more about the author . So many of the poems capture very well the childhood experience of wonder at the world , imagination , being in the moment . I 'll be buying a copy for my almost-2 - year - old granddaughter !
5 #### My wife was extremely happy to see this book come out of the packaging , she loves the great authors , Thank You ! !
5 #### I loved this book . It is the first book I remember reading over and over and over . I am sure I wore my copy out . or rubbed the words off the pages It opened my mind to so much more out there in the world . I think every child should have a copy . The pictures were wonderful also .
5 #### I PURCHASE THIS FOR MY OLDER SON DUE TO LIKING THE CLASSICAL BABY 'S POETRY SHOW .... SEEING ONE OF THE POEMS FROM THE SHOW IN THIS BOOK , I GOT IT FOR HIM ..... POEMS ARE BEAUTIFULLY DONE & IMAGES ARE NICE TOO .
5 #### I love reading these classic poems to my children . I 'm always looking for good literature to offset the commercial garbage my kids are constantly exposed to . Also , you ca n't beat the price !
5 #### I have the first edition from the 1950 's that I read to my son in the 80 's and hopefully for my grandchildren . Although the new book has a few less poems , it is wonderfully illustrated and interpreted with cultural diversity . Gyo Fugikawa is my favorite illustrator and she brings a very old classic to life , even in 2014 . perfect book to bring to a baby shower . No one else will think of it !
5 #### I have given away three of these books in the past few years to young moms and to a young poetry enthusiast . The perfect collection of poems to start whet the appetite of one just beginning to read poetry . This is a good edition of the collection with beautiful pictures and line drawings .
5 #### This has been one of my favorites since childhood . I wanted it in my Kindle so these beautiful poems would be handy to read at any time .
5 #### Great book . Fantastic illustrations . I bought the original one then ordered a few additional ( one for me , one for my grandmother who collects Tasha Tudor illustrations ) .
5 #### We were asked to give a child 's book for a baby shower gift instead of a card and I picked this . Beautiful illustrations by Tasha Tudor and of course the lovely poems by R.L. Stevenson which I hope the new little one will enjoy when he is old enough . Thank you ! , Carolyn
5 #### I loved and memorized many of these poems when I was a child more than 80 years ago . I have given copies to my grandchildren and , now , my great grandson . My fondest memories of this book are sitting on my mother 's lap as she read the poems to me .
5 #### This was my favorite book as a child . Now I 've given it to my new Great Grandson . ( And , there were no duplicates of this book . My granddaughter received 5 Goodnight Moons )
5 #### This is a great book . The Verses are fun to read Children enjoy listening And early readers can read it to you . You may want to sneak a peek on your own , too . A classic . This is a nice edition , as the illustrations are somewhat like the originals .
5 #### I read some of these to my 4 yr . old who then paused and said , " I do n't get it " . Good book to introduce your child to different reading styles ! Reading them generates great conversation w/ your kids ! !
4 #### Robert Louis Stevenson is a very good writer . This book is interesting , fun and educational . There are n't any pictures , but I liked it anyway . This book features poems about animals and nature I enjoyed reading it
5 #### I gave this book as a gift to a four year old . I have always loved Robert Lewis Stevenson 's poems and the book I own I have read to my children and grandchildren many times . I know many of the poems by heart . When I was looking for a gift book for a four year old and discovered that this book was illustrated by Tasha Tudor I could n't resist buying it . His parents were equally delighted to receive it .
5 #### My Mother read these poems to my brother and I from the time we were quite small . When I needed to recite a poem in high school , My Shadow was it !
5 #### Parents - BUY THIS ! Grandparents - Buy this ! Teachers - Buy this ! Fans of poetry - Buy this ! Kids - Nag your parents to buy this ! This is poetry and spectacular artwork that grabs all ages . You will read and re - read this for a lifetime .
5 #### not as good as a print copy , but better than nothing at all ! Robert Louis . Stevenson 's poetry is a delight .
3 #### I had planned to use it as a gift , so I was disappointed to find that there was writing inside the book .
5 #### One of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Great Books . Many of the poems are remembered from childhood . Stevenson is one of children 's best authors . His books are still well read , especially but not exclusively by chilren and young people .
5 #### Lovely book to expose the very young to their first poetry ! Pretty book with nice artwork . Great addition to our preschool ! .
5 #### The poems here stand up to the test of time . They appeal to children of all ages , especially when read aloud .
5 #### I had the same book as a little girl 50 years ago and was delighted when I saw the same book with the illustrations I do loved so many years ago .I bought this as a gift for a 9 year old girl who carries it around much as I did .A true treasure for any child .
5 #### Being descended from Robert Louis Stevenson , I 've always especially loved his poetry and memorized some of it as a child , still remembering it more than 50 years later . Recently it occurred to me that this book belongs in my collection , and that my grandchildren should have a copy too . Stevenson 's writings are delightful for young and old alike , and this book 's illustrations make it an especial treasure .
5 #### This is such a nice book . I am giving it to my granddaughter and her cousins for Christmas . My father used to quote Robert Lewis Stevenson 's poems to me when I was growing up . I wanted to share this with my granddaughter and her cousins since they will only know their great grandfather through what we share with them about him .
5 #### The poems are fun to read , easily memorized and timeless in appeal . These poems easily come to mind regardless of one 's age and they bring back memories of happy childhood days . This is a great book to help children view the world more simply without the smart phones and I - Pads that occupy their minds today .
5 #### My granddaughter loves the R. L. Stevenson poetry . I had an old Golden book from my childhood . This is a close replica -- contains most of the poems in the one I have . It was in excellent condition , and my daughter and family are cherishing it .
5 #### We homeschool and I wanted to find a book of poems to start my 9 year old of with . I have him choose one poem a week to memorize and he has to recite it to me at the end of the week . This is our first year of homeschooling , so we have started off with the shorter poems . They are great poems and there are lessons to learn from them as well .
5 #### Our kids grew up with bedtime readings from this book and loved it . Now I use it as a baby shower gift and pray others will enjoy it as much as ours / we did .
5 #### This was my favorite book from childhood and I still read it to my grandchildren and know some of the poems from memory .
5 #### This was my favorite childhood book and the earliest one I recall my grandmother reading to me . It started my love of poetry . I now have a four year old great - grandaughter to whom I am giving this for Christmas and look forward to reading it to her , all the clear , easily understood childhood poems . Should be part of everyone 's collection .
5 #### We have a few other hard copies of this book but it was nice to get this on Kindle so we can easily take it along in the car or on vacation . My daughter loves these poems . They capture childhood so well .
5 #### This book was a favorite when i was a child , so i purchased it for my nephew 's 3rd birthday . Who can resist this delightful poetry that never gets old ? Every one of the original poems is in this nicely illustrated edition for many hours and years of bedtime inspiration !
5 #### Been a favourite of mine since childhood . I grew up in the parish where the manse 's garden was the inspiration for the " Garden " of verses .
5 #### The first time I read A Child 's Garden of Verses , I was but a wee slip of a girl . I lost that book long ago , and was delighted to get it again . Every Kindle , IPad and bookcase should contain this book . There are so many classic poems in it : The Swing ; The Counterpane : and ever so much more . Again , Stevenson 's superb abilities as a poet lead a child to the heights of imagination , and leave them enthralled with the wonders of childhood . Reading the poems to your children , or just to your friends or spouse , can lead you to the remembrances of those wonder years . He is a poet for the ages , and this is one of his best collections .
5 #### Forty years ago , I was taught to read with this . Different pictures , same poems . I learned to imagine and believe in ordinary , yet beautiful things . Even today , in my own writing , I smile realizing how and when I learned writing technique just by listening to my mother whisper these poems nightly . Aptly named , Robert Louis Stevenson has the reader remembering the wonderful days of playing alone and with friends , of delighting in the moment . Your child will gain an understanding of classic children 's poetry , of the rhythm and rhyme . They sound eloquent aloud , and read gentle at bedtime . The Land of Nod by Robert Louis Stevenson From breakfast on through all the day At home among my friends I stay , But every night I go abroad Afar into the land of Nod . All by myself I have to go , With none to tell me what to do-- All alone beside the streams And up the mountain - sides of dreams . The strangest things are there for me , Both things to eat and things to see , And many frightening sights abroad Till morning in the land of Nod . Try as I like to find the way , I never can get back by day , Nor can remember plain and clear The curious music that I hear . Anthony Trendl AmericanSpeechwriter.com
3 #### The ONLY disappointment was the quality of the paper printed on ... if it were just a bit thicker ... ah Gyo Fujikawa is one of my all time favorite illustrators and a great author , too !
2 #### The book is ok and a standard of poetry for children . But when the book arrived , it was NOT as pictured . Was a bare , very used book without a cover , as pictured . I kept it because it is the poetry that counts in reading the book , but I will NOT order from this seller again .
5 #### I bought this book as a gift for my mother ( a collector of vintage children 's ' picture books ) , whose father used to recite some of Stevenson 's poems when they played together ; and in particular , she has memories of him reciting " the swing " as he pushed her on the swing . She said she could n't recall the poem but wanted to share it with her grandkids ( aged from a few months to 4 years ) . For that reason I am glad that this is a board book : perfect for reading to small ones without worrying about ripping the pages ! She loves vintage books from the 1940's/ 50 's eras , such as those illustrated by Eloise Wilkin . I would n't say that these illustrations are in Wilkin 's style , but I think she will love the nostalgic feel !
5 #### I LOVE this book . As a child , I could n't always understand the strange words and grammar of the poems but he had me at the first poem , " Bed in Summer " . The same poem grabbed my 4 - year - old grandson when I put him to bed in July with the sun shining brightly . " My Shadow " is another one I love and very nice to quote to my grandson on a walk in the long shadows of late afternoon The year was 1885 so the settings are dawning - industrial age . There are ' nursies ' and ' curtsies ' and other anachronisms galore . But the behaviors are universal and make me smile .
3 #### This is a good book - a classic - but , quite frankly , I do n't remember ever buying it from Amazon . Maybe I did , but I do n't remember .
5 #### I like this book . It has many fun and cute verses in it . Good value , good condition . Great seller too !
4 #### I loved this as a child and many verses are still in my memory . I sat and read this with my granddaughter . The only disappointment was that the original pictures ( were in color in my very old book ) are black and white and not on the same pages as the verses . The best pictures are the ones in your head as you read these beautiful verses .
5 #### I purchased it for my new great - granddaughter . I loved the book as a child and can still recite some of the verses . I hope she loves it as much as I did and do .
3 #### Yes these were the poems I remember from childhood but the editor should get an editor . The number of misspelled words was unacceptable .
3 #### There are a few lovely poems in " A Child 's Garden of Verses " , and many that are just okay . The biggest problem , in my opinion , is finding the right audience . The poems seem too - adult for children and not nearly sophisticated - enough for adults . This is a collection of poetry written by a man who is in love with an idea of childhood that is somewhat at odds with its reality . I think most children , and most adults , will find these uncaptivating , with a few exceptions . A better choice is the poetry of Shel Silverstein .
5 #### A classic book of poems for children . This edition is gorgeous -- large pages with the most lovely illustrations . A must for a child 's library .
5 #### I had this book as a child and was overjoyed when I found it . My favorite poem has always been " My Shadow . " I was so happy to find it and read it again . All of Robert Louis Stevenson 's poems are wonderful . This was a sweet childhood memory lane experience .
5 #### Robert Louis Stevenson had a gift for writing sing - songy poetry that was not sickeningly sweet . These are gentle rhymes that bring to mind the carefree days of childhood . Some are better than others , of course , and most of the best ones have been made into abridged / illustrated books for children . My children are grown now , but I still enjoy reading many of these soothing poems to myself .
5 #### Always love Robert Louis Stevenson . I have a hard copy of this , but I wanted a version on my Kindle too so I could take it with me .
5 #### I had this book given to me by my great aunt in the 1950s . I read it , re - read it and have loved it ever since . If you give one book of poetry to your children , grandchildren , godchildren ... whomever .... make it this book . The very best book of children 's poetry ever written .
5 #### I read this book over and over as a child and memorized many of the verses . I think that early exposure to poetry encourages creativity and a good grasp of language . These poems have a compelling universality .
5 #### I love the poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson and read these to my granddaugher as a child . She is now 16 . I think this book is a great baby gift . The parents will love the poems as much as the kids .
4 #### I love the poems I 've known since childhood , but would probably like it better in the print version . A good choice for those who prefer e - reading .
5 #### He is always , beautiful , always deep . What a gifted poet to write words that still please the ear , the eye , the heart .
5 #### Yes , I gave this as a 1st birthday gift to my nephew . My niece reads them to him before he goes to bed . Culture at a young age .
5 #### I purchased this as part of a group of books for a new baby present to start his library . the illustrations along are simply wonderful
5 #### The book was in great condition . This was a childhood favorite and I was pleased to have it back in my library again .
4 #### I do n't think of this as a book I would hand to a little reader . Many of the poems need a little background , or explanation , or " selling " . It is a collection I would skim , skipping the more obscure or precious poems , and selecting the ones that might appeal to or amuse the particular child . When approached that way , the formatting problems do n't really matter because the adult reader can accommodate them in the course of reading aloud . Because this is a freebie it is a great choice for trying out the poems , ( or for amusing yourself and searching through your own memory ) . I figure that if any of my listeners respond particularly well to this collection then I 'll keep my eyes peeled for an illustrated , properly formatted copy for my youngster to keep as his own . In any event , if you are looking through free Kindle downloads this is a nice choice to while away a bit of reading time .
1 #### This was recommended by a friend . The pictures and poems are boring and not engaging at all . Yikes . I 'm not sure I will be taking recommendations from this friend again .
5 #### I remember reading this book when I was a child , so when asked to give " my favorfite childhood book " to my niece for her new baby I immediately thought of A Child 's Garden of Verses . It is perfect for reading to children from infancy until they can read it by themselves ! A Can not Go Wrong gift .
5 #### This was my favorite childhood book . Poetry is like music . My mother read it to me so many times that , by following along , I learned to read . I got in trouble in kindergarten when I pulled out a second grade book and started reading it to my deskmate . However , I was n't ruined by learning to read at age four , I was blessed . This book made school and college easy for me as it made me a lifelong avid reader . I purchased this for my grandson . He is a little young , being only 3 months old , but he is already being read to .
5 #### The poems in this volume are magical for both myself and my five year old . She is now dreaming of writing beautiful poetry herself one day ( she 's actually a very creative writer now , but she has very high standards = 0 ) ) . This is the kind of poetry that , rather than leaving you scratching your head wondering what that was all about , is straightforward and beautiful , and for the adult , evokes all kinds of warm reminiscences . I love reading these poems aloud to my daughter . Highly recommended !
5 #### I had this book as a child and loved it . It disappeared and I found it again on Amazon . Stevenson 's poems are charming , although they may be an acquired taste . However , the Tasha Tudor illustrations are wonderful . Her work was more widely known when I was a kid ( a long time ago ) but they have stood up to time . Some may find them treacley and Thomas Kincaid - ish , and while they are highly decorative they capture the sense of scene quite well .
5 #### I bought this book to give to my student who somehow grew up without hearing the wonder poems in this book .
5 #### Stevenson has always been a favorite of mine . My grandfathther met him , most likely on the occasion of his marriage to Fannie Osbourne . One of my grandfather 's proffessors of theology officiated at the wedding . They spent their honeymoon near St. Helena , California . There is a a very nice RLS museum there . d wahl
5 #### Every child should have a copy of A Child 's Garden of Verses . I sent one to my Great - Grand kids . Both my children and grand daughters loved it .
5 #### I was given this book as a child . The book finally fell apart , being read quite often by me , then my two sons . So I was pleased to find it on Amazon . I gave it to my grandchildren
5 #### I had this collection as a child . My children had it read to them and they , in turn , read it to their children . Now my great grand daughter will enjoy the same precious poems .
5 #### The classic rhymes in A Child 's Garden of Verses is soothing at any age . My original book was a children 's edition with no author details . I enjoyed reading the short biography included in the front of this edition -- although I would have preferred the bio to be at the back of the book . This is a pleasing , comfortable children 's ( and adults ) classic .
4 #### I had this book as a kid and my dad read it to me all the time . Now as an aunt I bought it for my nieces for Christmas . They love it and I love the memories it brings back !
5 #### This was a beautiful book of poetry from my childhood . I just gave it to my niece for her 1st birthday . Shipped timely and in perfect condition .
5 #### My mom unused to read me poems from this book as a child , and I have my own copy at home , but I thought it would be a great gift to share with my cousin for her first child .
5 #### There are so many good things to be said about this book . 1 . The illustrations are fantastic . 2 . The poems are classical 3 . The quality of the language used is exceptional 4 . Wonderful bedtime reader What a great book , its going to be one of those that will live on the our book shelf for decades . Highly recommended .
4 #### The product I received was not what I had expected , but a much larger , hard cover edition . I thought I was getting the older version of the one pictured . But I 'm delighted with the book itself . It brought back very fond memories of my early childhood .
5 #### I bought this book to read to my now 3 year old son . I recently started reading a page a day to him and he ca n't wait for the next one . The illustrations are absolutely beautiful ! So glad I bought this one !
5 #### I remember having these stories as a child . Grandparents read them to me . Gives children the " ear " for rhyming and poetry !
5 #### Who wrote , " The world is so full of a number of things , I 'm sure we should all be as happy as kings " ? Did you guess Robert Louis Stevenson ? Poetry is not my favorite form of literature . However , Stevenson is one of my best - loved authors , and I have always liked his poetry because , unlike some other poetry that I have read , it makes sense to me . One of my favorites is " The Swing " : How do you like to go up in a swing , Up in the air so blue ? Oh , I do think it the pleasantest thing Ever a child can do ! Of course , one would buy this edition of A Child 's Garden of Verses not only for Stevenson 's poetry ( this is not a complete version but a newly revised selection ) but also for Brian Wildsmith 's gorgeous , whimsical illustrations . Wildsmith , born in 1931 at the mining village of Penistone in Yorkshire , England , has been called one of the greatest living children 's book illustrators . Stevenson 's poems perfectly capture the make - believe imagination of childhood . What child has not pretended at one time or another that his bed is a ship sailing the wide seas ? And Wildsmith 's stunning , colorful paintings perfectly capture the joyful childhood innocence of Stevenson 's poetry . While the language may be upper class Victorian England , the appeal is universal . This would make a wonderful book for a parent to read aloud while the child gazes at the pictures .
1 #### DO NOT ORDER from Got Books ! I ordered the book featured , with illustrations by Eloise Wilkins which is the book I grew up with and cherished . This book was to be a gift for my grandchild 's birthday , now it 's too late to re - order PLUS Amazon will not accept a return since I bought it from one of their Amazon sellers . What is the point of being an Amazon seller if Amazon wo n't stand behind the product ?
5 #### I had a book of A Child 's Garden of Verses when I was a young girl . Recently I remembered some of the poems and wanted to read them again . When I found this book on Amazon I ordered it right away , and it arrived in just a week . It was beautiful . Much prettier than my original book , and in excellent condition , although it was listed as " used " . It came from Goodwill of Southwest Florida . I am far from a child now , but I am enjoying reading these poems even more now that I did years ago . I will always trust this Goodwill to send a good book to me .
5 #### The art work in this book is beautiful and vibrantly colorful . The poetry is very good . Our family has enjoyed this book and the children love to look through it over and over again .
5 #### Although they are called A Child 's Garden of Verses , these poems of Robert Louis Stevenson just get better and better , especially when you combine them with the lovely , warm illustrations by Jannet Messenger in this enchanting book . The pop - ups add a special touch ; the kites flying , the band marching , chicken wings flapping and the mysterious night rider are all memorable . A really great book .
5 #### My children and I make a habit to read poetry several times a week . I thought the old fashioned wording of these poems would have distracted them to disinterest but that in not the case . They LOVE this book . I think part of the reason is the illustrations include children and are vibrant with colors . Though I thoroughly enjoy my Kindle , this needs to be read with the real hard - covered book in hand .
4 #### A 1001 CBYMRBYGU . I 'm obligated to read all of Stevenson 's oeuvre . My school is named after this man . This book contains a variety of short poems for children written by RLS himself . The poems range from the proscriptive : " A child should always say what 's true And speak when he is spoken to , And behave mannerly at table ; At least as far as he is able . " To : " The world is so full of a number of things , I 'm sure we should all be as happy as kings . "
4 #### I used this book for a child case study and my child loved the poetry in this book . I would say that it is a must have .
5 #### My granddaughter is very happy with this , which is for her daughter . The book was something I remember to this day , which my mother read to me over 75 years ago . " I Have a Little Shadow " , et al , is well remembered .
5 #### Actor Robin Field reads the entire collection of Robert Louis ' Stevenson 's children 's poems , first published in 1885 . Charles H. ' Sylvester ( in Journeys through Bookland ) writes : " Robert Louis ' Stevenson . . . was born in Edinburgh . He was an only son , and most of ' the poems which he wrote for children show that , while his childhood ' was happy , it was perhaps a little lonesome ; that is , most of his poems ' are about one child . . . . He knew all the time that he liked to write ' better than to do anything else . . . Some of his stories , Treasure ' Island , Kidnapped and others , are exciting tales of adventure , which ' any boy might like to read , while his . . . Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde and ' other stories are more distinctively for grown people . However , among ' all his writings there is little more delightful than the poems for ' children , which show how clearly he remembered his own boyhood . " The ' reading is over an hour on one Audio CD .
4 #### This is a beautifully illustrated version of Robert Louis Stevenson 's " A Child 's Garden of Verses . " Brian Wildsmith as usual did an outstanding job . I 'm not positive , but I do n't think this edition has all the poems that are in some of the older editions .
5 #### I loved these verses as they were read to me by my Mother as a child , and wanted to put this book on my Kindle to read to great - grandchildren now that I 'm that age ! Some of these verses just stay with you throughout your life , and I look forward to sharing them now in my Golden Years ! And I know the children will remember them as they grow older too .
3 #### This is a great collection of classic poems , that have kept their spirit and appeal over time . However , this edition needs some serious work on formating for the Kindle . The layout and line breaks are inconsistent , making it difficult to read or recite the poems . the 3 star rating is for the poor formating - not for the content ( which deserves 5 stars ) .
5 #### When I was young and sick in bed , a friend of my parents brought me a beautifully illustrated volume of A Child 's Garden of Verses . He pointed out that Robert Louis Stevenson had also been a sickly child . So I began to read these in bed with a fever and his poetry made so much sense . The book has remained my favorite . In the Kindle version I miss the beautiful illustrations by Fern Bissel Peat , but when I read the poems the pictures from the first book just pop into my head . I still love them . Having them on my Kindle brings a moment of peace to a Kindle so full of murder mysteries and strange happenings . I recommend it for adults as well as children .
5 #### Thirty years ago , I was taught to read with this . Different pictures , same poems . I learned to imagine and believe in ordinary , yet beautiful things . Even today , in my own writing , I smile realizing how and when I learned writing technique just by listening to my mother whisper these poems nightly . Aptly named , RLS has the reader remembering the wonderful days of playing alone and with friends , of delighting in the moment . Your child will gain an understanding of classic children 's poetry , of the rhythm and rhyme . They sound eloquent aloud , and read gentle at bedtime . Anthony Trendl [ ... ]
3 #### All the words are in there , but there are a couple of obvious flaws : 1 . You ca n't access poems from the TOC . In fact , it comes up as a single paragraph . 2 . The poems are n't really formatted as poems , but do n't quite look like paragraphs , either . Just wanted you to know before you add it to your archives . Of course , since it 's free , you 're free to check it out for yourself .
5 #### A great little book , in great shape . Thanks for sending it in such a timely manner .
5 #### These beautiful poems and charming illustrations keep my four - year - old riveted . Whenever we come to some language that she does n't understand , she asks me to explain , then nods and asks me to continue reading . The subject matter of Stevenson 's poems is timeless , forever relevant to the young imagination , so the modern child is willing to work a little at his 19th century words !
5 #### I bought this book for my niece but when I received it , I sat down and could n't help but ready many of the poems . They are sweet and lovely and the illustrations are colorful and captivating . I highly recommend this book .
5 #### I had this book for my daughter when she was a baby in 1974 . I loved the illustrations and has a nostalgic need to find the book again . The book I received was in the same good condition that my daughtwer 's book would have been .
5 #### We have been reading this book for over eight years to our boys ( 10 & 7 ) . It was recommended by our beloved teacher of two year olds for a Mother / Mom little school program , she had been teaching for 18 years and said that the Tasha Tudor illustrations drew the children into being fascinated into listening to the poems . And the poems are about the adventures of a little boy . My boys each have their favorite poems and request having those read to them like little presents . At night , the older one has heard the poems so often , it 's like sleep therapy ... half way through " we built a ship upon the stairs all built of back bedroom chairs ... " and he 's out like a light . But , please for everyone 's sake , get the Tasha Tudor version , it really is superior .
5 #### This is an ageless book filled with some of Robert Louis Stevenson 's most famous poems . Fujikawa beautifully illustrated it , and it is one of those beautiful children 's books that you will want to hang on to long after your children have outgrown their bedtime story time .
5 #### This was such an important book of my childhood that I bought a small supply of them . I give them as gifts at baby showers and young birthdays . Kids seem to love it these days as much as I did in my day . I guess that what makes a classic a classic .
5 #### A great book for getting the little ones to sleep ( the poems read so gently and soothing ) and a wonderful book for learning to read . Many of the poems are just a few lines long and have a simplicity that works well for beginner readers . The pattern and rhyme make each poem somewhat familiar and fun for kids to read , especially if you 've read it aloud several times in the past .
5 #### This is a perfect gift for a child . I remember some of the poems from my childhood , they are ageless . The illustrations are lovely , too .
5 #### My love of poetry started with this wonderful book by Robert Louis Stevenson given to me as a very young lass . The rhymn and meter fascinated me . The imagery takes the reader to exciting places right in ones own world . All of the poems in this book weave a spell over the reader , but " The Swing " still holds a special joy for me . This gift so long ago prompted me to write my own poems . One never knows the influence a book has on a young mind .
1 #### Do not purchase this book if you are looking for the lovely illustrated book of poetry that you might have owned as a child . This piece of trash was apparently scanned from a document , instantly printed and mailed on the same day that I purchased it . There are letters out of place , random marks , weird formatting , strange page numbering with absolutely no redeeming factors to spend $ 8 . There is even a disclaimer in the front of the book that errors might be found ! ! ! I am shocked that AMAZON would even consider selling this as semblance of a " book ! " I immediately returned it for full refund . AMAZON sent a message stating that the book I searched for , A CHILD 'S GARDEN OF VERSES was now avaiable . Without checking it out , I trusted that AMAZON had actually found a used copy of the original book .......... this is not it ! ! ! BEWARE .... you do n't want this copy . There seems to be numerous copies of the original volume available both new and used . Buy another version .... anything would be better than this .
5 #### Decades ago , I was read this book as a child . Something about the writing of Robert Louis Stevenson speaks to imagination of the child . I could picture , perfectly , my bed as a boat ( as described in one of the poems ) . Children not only enjoy the poems , but at the same time , they learn to " hear " poetry , the rhythm , and the rhyming .
5 #### This was the edition of A Child 's Garden of Verses that I had as a child , and I was always besotted by the simple but elegant two color illustrations . There have been many , many , many illustrated versions of this children 's classic , but this is by far the most beautiful I have ever seen . A generation later , I still remember them . I saved most of my picture books for my own children , and this one is one of only a tiny handful that my kids are not allowed to touch , because it is too special to me . Good thing this book is being reprinted , so I can buy them their own copies !
5 #### I had this book as a little girl and loved the poems and colorful pictures ! It 's so good to see that it 's still available . I 'm glad to have another copy .
5 #### I bought this for my 2 year old grandson , thinking it was required childhood reading / listening . We live on opposite ends of the country , so I do n't see him often , but I am amazed at his interest in having me read this book to him . The pictures have incredible detail , which definitely is part of the appeal . But he seems to really enjoy listening to the poems , which contain lovely but archaic language . The last time I read it , on each page I gave him the option of listening to the poem on the left or on the right , and without exception he chose both . Mind you , father and grandfather were bored beyond belief listing to me read . But not my grandson . In fact , one day my daughter asked him what book he wanted to hear , and he chose " the book about Grandma " - he had to show us what he meant , and it was this book . I plan to get him another Tasha Tudor illustrated book for our next visit . One note , when reading aloud I substitute " mama " for " nurse " - what relevance does the concept of a nurse / caretaker have in 21st century United States ?
5 #### I 've enjoyed sharing these poems and illustrations that were a powerful part of my own childhood .
5 #### RLS wrote more than adventure books . His poetry reveals much about his imaginative childhood . Great for all ages !
5 #### I got the book as a gift when I was a child . I read it over the years ( to myself , and to my children ) until the pages were torn and worn . When I found another copy in a bookstore , I bought it ( I was in my mid-30 's at the time ) !
5 #### This is a lovely book with lovely old - fashioned illustrations . A terrific baby shower gift ...
5 #### I grew up in the 70 's ... I had this book it was my mother 's in the 50',s and her mother 's in the 20 's .... it hastens back to a wonderful time of imagination and literacy in children as well as their parents ... really lovely book .. A wonderful swing ride into a time past , and the land of nod
4 #### There is a reason Robert Louis Stevenson is so well - remembered . He had a knack for finding the right word in the right place , and his poems about childhood always hit the right spot . The illustrations in this book complement the rhymes perfectly . Please note that this edition is oversized , and it may be difficult to put on your bookshelf .
5 #### I received this book from a friend at Christmas when I was a child . I always loved it . I sent a copy to my great granddaughters 8th birthday last year with a couple of other story books and she said she loved all of them .
5 #### This is a book we wore to ribbons on our children and grandkids . We loved reading it to them and enjoyed it as much as they did . I purchased three to have on hand as gifts for future Great grandchildren or other lucky recipients .
5 #### A Child 's Garden of Verses stands the test of time . My friends and I all remember this book from childhood . I purchased three this Chrismas . The illustrations are delightful . Gyo Fujikawi has captured the poems exquisitely , especially " The Land of Counterpane " .
5 #### This book brought back memories of my childhood which I can now pass down to my grandchildren .
5 #### I buy this book to give as baby shower gifts . Although not all of my favorite poems are included , its a perfect size for new moms to hold while also holding baby , and the solid boardbook design is perfect for when the baby gets to be a toddler .
5 #### It would be interesting to find out just how many editions of this particular work have been published over the years . Needless to say , this work by Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the granddaddys of all poetry books for young ( and not so young ) children . If you do not have a copy in your child 's library , you really should have . This particular edition is illustrated by Eric Kincaid and of the several various versions published that I own or have read , this is one of my favorite . I simply like the art work . Mr. Kincaid has used soft colors and presented his illustrations in a true Victorian style , something I like . The clothing of the children , the background , etc . are all very well done and done in fine detail . Not only do you get a book of classic writing , but you also receive a feast for the eye with this one . Very much recommend this edition .
5 #### I bought this version of the book for my toddler because I remembered some of these poems from my own childhood . Most importantly , I wanted " The Swing " in a board book version that my daughter would n't destroy . It is a perfect introductory version of RLS 's work for the very young . There are only 8 poems , which suprisingly captivate my 2 - year - old , despite her short attention span . I look forward to sharing the complete book with her when she 's older .
5 #### This edition was a favorite of my sister and I when we were kids . RLS 's poems are delightful , but Ms. Fujikawa 's watercolor illustrations add such charm and lush detail ... and she perfectly captured the multicultural children . I am now the family keeper of our well - worn treasure . This is the most delightfully illustrated version ( in my opinion better even than the wonderful Tasha Tudor 's ) .
5 #### " A Child 's Garden of Verses " , illustrated by Tasha Tudor , is a beautiful book . The poems are so memorable , they are just the thing to get a small child interested in the magic of language and books . Especially perfect to read aloud and share the pictures . Tasha Tudor 's illustrations perfectly capture the magic of the poems . They are just joyous . A meaningful and lasting gift for the very young .
5 #### The illustrations are bright and engaging , complementing the poems nicely . My 4 yo and 2 yo love this book !
5 #### I had never read this book before . It was mentioned in Ingrid Hill 's " Ursula , Under , " so I bought it to read to my daughter . It is an excellent book to introduce poetry to children .
4 #### Thirty years ago , I was taught to read with this . Different pictures , same poems . I learned to imagine and believe in ordinary , yet beautiful things . Even today , in my own writing , I smile realizing how and when I learned a technique , just by listening to my mother whisper these poems nightly . Aptly named , RLS has the reader remembering the wonderful days of playing alone and with friends , of delighting in the moment . This edition only has eight poems . The original collection has many more . As a sampler for your child , this edition may serve well . If you are confident your child will enjoy poetry , buy a longer version , and enjoy many times the pleasure and warmth . All of these years later , these lines to " The Land of Counterpane " come to mind : I was the giant great and still That sits upon the pillow - hill , And sees before him , dale and plain , The pleasant land of counterpane . Your child will gain an understanding of classic children 's poetry , of the rhythm and rhyme . They sound eloquent aloud , and read gentle at bedtime . I fullt recommend " A Child 's Garden of Verses " by Robert Louis Stevenson . Anthony Trendl editor , HungarianBookstore.com
5 #### I cried when I saw this book again . It had been a friend -albeit long - lost- for a long long time . I had the orginal 1957 Little Golden Book until that horrible Garage Sale that Mom had while I was away at college ! Darn I miss that Chatty Cathy doll . But not even an iota as much as I miss my Mama . This is a wonderful and wondrous little book - Eloise Wilkin 's pictures will stay with you and your child forever . Even while I was without it , I could still conjure up in my mind the picture of the blue room in the Land of Counterpane . And more precious than anything , I can still hear my Mother 's voice reading to a toddler me as I see the words and pictures . Buy it now and make forever memories sharing it with a child you love . /TundraVision , Amazon Reviewer .
5 #### The lyrical rhymes and magic of everyday kid 's lives is captivating for even young children . I grew up listening to these poems and my kids have enjoyed them , too . I am particularly fond of the illustrations by Eloise Wilkin . She captures the realism of both landscape and children 's faces . This is a timeless classic .
4 #### This is a nice , extra - sturdy book for toddlers . It includes these eight complete poems : The Land of Counterpane , The Lamplighter , Happy Thought , Foreign Lands , The Cow , My Shadow , The Swing , My Bed is a Boat . Most toddlers wo n't sit still for the complete poems , but you can just read the first few lines until they grow into them , and they 'll have fun looking at the pictures . There are various vintage illustrations in full color by different artists including one of a boy in a tree by Jessie Willcox Smith ( Foreign Lands ) , a charming colored drawing of a Mom showing a bird to her four little ones ( Happy Thought ) , a simple but cute picture of a little girl watching a cow ( The Cow ) and a picture by one of my favorite Child 's Garden of Verses illustrators , Eulalie ( My Bed is a Boat ) . Yet , the cutest picture is the one on the cover by Jessie Willcox Smith . It begs one to wonder why they did n't use her pictures for all the poems . This book is a nice size , bigger than most board books , but still small enough to be handled easily by even very young children .
5 #### Imagine my happiness when I found a copy of the book that night after night my mother had read to me as a child in the late 50s and early 60s - My copy had long fallen apart but this was the correct edition and as I opened the pages the illustrations welcomed me like old friends . I got the flu and my husband kindly read the entire book to me and then next time my Mom came to visit I read a few to her and watched her smile . Expose a child to this book and they will develop a love of poetry , the whimiscal and when you watch Rocky and Bullwinkle next time you will know where Bullwinkle gets all the poems that he recites !
5 #### Most everyone knows that Robert Louis Stevenson was sickly , both as a child and as an adult , and the happy result for the reading public was his nearly feverish flights of imagination . Here , in an edition of his classic " A Child 's Garden of Verses , " that fever is complemented in spades by the fantastical illustrations of English artist Joanna Isles . Isles uses an arsenal of utterly frivolous flowers , borders , insects , birds , kings and queens , fairies , and more to expand upon the imagination exhibited in Stevenson 's poems . The children in these pictures are depicted as being in charge , being at one with their environment , and being delighted to be alive . Some of the illustrations hint at the influence of artists more famed than Isles ( Henri Rousseau appears to be a special favorite of hers -- see the illustration for " The Unseen Playmate , " in which a boy lies down in weeds that might have sprung from the edge of Rousseau 's painting " The Dream " ) . Using both primary colors and pastels , Isles creates a world within the world of Stevenson 's verse . The marriage of the two is a happy one .
5 #### This classic edition of Robert Louis Stevenson 's " A Child 's Garden of Verses " is justly famed because it so beautifully pairs Stevenson 's sometimes exuberant , sometimes melancholy poems on childhood with the extraordinary illustrations of Tasha Tudor . Tudor 's delicate watercolors complement Stevenson 's work almost to the point that you think the two , living in different centuries , must share some time - travel telepathy with each other . All the classic Stevenson pieces are here : " The Swing , " " The Land of Counterpane , " the terrific poem about a child 's shadow . Tudor depicts only children and animals herein -- as it should be -- without the presence of shadow of adults anywhere . Both Stevenson and Tudor understand in their bones that no matter what grown - ups may think , children inhabit a world of their own . That world is mostly beautiful , but sometimes fraught with danger or questions . Those hints are present here , but the overwhelming impression any reader will have will be that of beauty -- both in words and in pictures .
5 #### With it 's delicate Tasha Tudor drawings as a perfect accompiment to these famous poems for children(or the child within).this book is both lovely to look at as well as read . Would make a lovely gift for expectant mom;I'm saving this one for my niece & nephew .. !
4 #### This is a very lovely edition of Stevenson 's " A Child 's Garden of Verses . " The paintings illustrating each poem are well chosen and quite beautiful . The print quality is also excellent . However , I was a little disappointed to see this selection not include some of my favorite poems from Stevenson 's work , most notably " The Pleasant Land of Counterpane . " What is included is exceptionally well done , but this is not the complete Garden of Verses .
5 #### Poems are perfectly chosen words which are a pleasure to read . Writing them is a true art and Robert Louis Stevenson is able to perfect this art by remembering his own childhood . These poems were written between 1881 and 1884 . This is a selection from the most popular collection of poems about childhood in the English language . Each poem is accompanied by evocative paintings , which are as vibrant as the words in each poem . The paintings are impressions of color and light and show children and a few animals on beautiful canvases of cities , gardens , meadows and seas . The poems are about flying kites , cows which give cream to enjoy with apple - tart , flowers where fairies live , children sitting in the warm sun , children on a swing , children playing with toy boats and children playing in gardens who will never grow up as they are frozen in time in the beautiful pictures . Here is an example of part of the first poem in the book . THE WIND I saw you toss the kites on high And blow the birds about the sky ; And all around I heard you pass , Like ladies skirts across the grass- What lovely poems to share with a child . Highly recommended ! ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### We use this hymn book at the mission . It has most of the well - loved oldies from a time gone by . Songs like : " I 'll Fly Away " and " Closer Walk With Thee " . If you like a good singalong , you will really enjoy the " Heavenly Hiway Hymns . " Be blessed .
5 #### I bought this for my husband who plays the piano . He is having a wonderful time playing these old hymns . The music is at times hard to read because we think the book was published for singing from more than playing from . Great purchase though !
5 #### I love reading to my young grandsons , and they sat quietly , enthralled as I read this to them . Dr. Seuss writes wonderful books !
3 #### This is a rhyme book . Since it does not have a good story , my son did n't show much interest when reading it . The stars I give is based on my son 's response to this book .
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with Dr. Seuss ! And my granddaughter agrees with me .
1 #### I agree with the other reviewer who was disappointed by the way this book undermines parents and idealizes defiance and not to mention laziness . The title pretty much sums it up . Hey I 'm no early bird but I do want to try to instill a positive view of early rising and a sense of cooperation and obedience to parents . it 's just not as clever and classic as Dr. Seuss usually is- I guess there 's a reason I had n't heard of it previously . pass- mine went immediately into the donation pile .
4 #### My 7 year old likes dr Seuss this one is cute
5 #### My grandma used to read this to me when I was little , and I absolutely loved it . Now I can read it to my own children !
5 #### This Book should be required reading to ALL children all over the World . Its about how it does n't matter where you came from or how you live , we all have the ability to be a Friend . No judgements .. just Friends . Its beautifully illustrated and I know its being re - released but I have a fear they will change the Amazing graphics .. and if they do change them , I 'll be extremely sad .
5 #### discovered this book at library and loved it so much we wanted our own copy . another great for Dr Seuss
3 #### It 's really a fun book to read . The illustrations are n't by Seuss so I 'm assuming this is probably one he 'd never intended to publish . But it 's out there now . And you 've got your 1 star reviewers up in arms because the kid gets to stay in bed . OH NO ! ( Screams the logical person ) a kid gets to sleep in ? How terrible . I read a review by a " working parent " ( congratulations on being a part of the group known as everybody ) who was so upset that it seems this book will derail her whole life . I think a little good parenting would prevent that . Plus , as a working parent it 's kinda nice when the kids want to sleep in . It gives you a little down time . Was it the best Seuss book ? No . Was it fun ? Yes . Was it illustrated by Seuss ? No . 3 stars .
5 #### One of my favorites as a child and now it 's one of my grand - daughters favorites ! I came in great condition too !
5 #### Great little story , I got the tape & book
5 #### This is a classic that was published in 1967 , before my days . It is under Dr. Seuss 's psuedonym , Theo . LeSieg , or Geisel , backwards . I hunted this down on EBay and paid $ 25 with shipping for a mint condition copy . I really do n't care if it is authentic as I simply wanted a clean copy to share with my son , as my inherited copy is falling to pieces . The original I own does not have the Learn to Read logo in the top right corner of the cover or on the back , and I trust the ones that do are all 2nd prints . It is too bad so many people are asking $ 70 + for this less than original version , though I have no idea why anyone would pay $ 70 + for a musty book . As for the content , it is an every night read with my son . He loves it and asks me the names of each different type of house , testing my knowledge . I strongly encourage anyone to hunt a newer copy of this down . I am intrigued if this book was the inception of my love of travel and see the world , but would n't be surprised if it was . If only they 'd release it again for the masses ...
5 #### Dr. Seuss describes exactly how not only children but a lot of adults feel on some mornings about getting out of their nice warm beds ! I love the message and enjoy reading this book just as much as my grandchildren .
2 #### I love Dr. Seuss . I love reading Dr. Seuss to my little girl . And thus far , she seems to love Dr. Seuss . I am also very familiar with Dr. Seuss -- Green Eggs and Ham , Fox in Socks , and the Sleep Book are just a few of our many favorites . Now , Dr. Seuss has a few rather odd books mixed in with a large company of hits . But even those odd books ' feel ' like Dr. Seuss , with HIS rhymes , HIS non - sense / made - up characters , HIS subtle moral lessons , etc . I am not going to get up today is an odd book ( especially , and I emphasize especially , the ending ) . But unlike some of his other odd books , this one does not ' feel ' like Dr. Seuss . It does not have his goofy but flowing rhymes , it does not have his silly nonsense characters , and the moral lesson is unclear if not even a little un - Seuss like . My own conclusion is that this book was probably not written by Theodore Geisel . I read this book to my little girl once , and unless she specifically asks for it at some point in the future , I will not likely read it to her again . I much prefer our 73rd reading of the Sleep Book or our 94th reading of Green Eggs and Ham to reading this un - Seuss like book a second time .
5 #### We 're a PBS station that takes one of our " stars " to public libraries each summer to encourage children to sign up for the libraries summer reading programs . The children were trilled to meet the Cat in the Hat in person and had their names put in a hat for a Seuss book drawing . The winners were thrilled to pick their own special book that they got to keep forever .
5 #### My grandsons love this book . I will read it over and over until they learn to read it to me .
3 #### The book was in fair shape it did smell like a basement and one of the pages was ripped . That was not in the description of the book when I bought it .
5 #### I loved this book as a child and was bummed when I went to buy a copy for my own children and realized it was out of print . I found a seller on Amazon.com and was thrilled ! Dr. Seuss takes us on a fun trip around the world and we see how children in many areas of the world eat , sleep , play , live , etc . It is a favorite in our house .
5 #### I completely agree with the review above . This was my favorite , favorite book as a child , and I am so happy to find it available at all ( do n't know what happened to my original copy ) . Yes , I too wish it would come back into print , so that more children today could read it . It was probably my first introduction to many different cultures and lifestyles ... even bedouin . It 's a little gem with a beautiful message ... "some houses are marble and some are just tin ... but they 're all all alike when a friend asks you in . "
5 #### School - aged beginner ELLs tackle this book with gusto for several reasons . The irony in the storyline is funny in a way that a beginner in English can still understand . They can reenact it while the teacher reads until the language becomes familiar . The technical words ( specific words not necessary to everyday survival like Maine , Spain , Marines ) do not an impediment to understanding the storyline .
1 #### I just borrowed this book from the library to read to my daughter and I must say it really has a perplexing DUD of an ending . The story is actually cute up until the last page where it just ends suddenly . Even my two - year - old daughter looked up at me wondering if there was any more to the story when we got to the last page . She is intelligent enough to expect something to happen but nothing does . Since it was a library book and therefore not new , I actually examined the book closer to see if perhaps some pages had fallen out at the end but no , it just has a terribly lazy ending to an otherwise cute lead - up . I would definitely NOT recommend this book for the young readers like it was designed for ( ages 5 - 8) because it does n't teach readers about the basics of a story ( beginning , middle and END ) Instead , it might confuse young readers because of it 's lack of an ending .
5 #### The animation is different , but SO cute . I love this story & so does my son . Great video , great story .
5 #### If I ever get around to making a list called " The books that built my brain , " this book will be on it . I had a copy of " Come over to my house " as a child , and the fantastic images of faraway places , diverse people , and different ways to live helped furnish my imagination with wonderful scenery . The pictures stayed with me : the balconied Venetian house , the painted Chinese houseboats , the carvings on the ( Polynesian ? ) house near the hot springs . Every child 's imagination should have room to travel . If you can find it , read it to your kid .
5 #### My son is four years old and he loves this book , requesting I read it to him repeatedly .
1 #### I ca n't believe this book is written by Dr. Seuss ! It is so boring , dull , and has the weirdest ending ever . It teaches bad lessons to kids - all day long the kid refuses to get up and in the end his Mom looks at him sheepishly along with his two siblings while he smiles triumphantly in his bed . " I guess he really means it , " says Mom . Huh ? What kind of lesson is that ? The poetry is not clever , fun or catchy like most of his other works . The illustrations are not done by Dr. Seuss and they are not very interesting or coloful . Very , very ho - hum !
1 #### My wife and I finally stored this book away , because there is nothing redeeming about the message , and it 's not particularly creative in any respect either . The book dwells on a boy 's obstinance / refusal to get out of bed for an entire day ... what a wonderful thought to put in the head of our children . The kid refuses entreaties from his mother and even the police to get out of bed and go to school , and in the end , they just let the kid stay in bed and sleep . So ... the message for my 2 year old is : defy your parents long enough , engage in anti - social behavior , and they will give in and let you have your way . I still have to wonder whether Dr. Seuss actually wrote this one . It 's just horrid , and the rhymes are like a 6th grader 's first attempt at poetry . Blech !
5 #### There 's got to be a starting point to reading with your child and this should be the place . All my kids loved this book , it has humor they instantly identify with and are always entertained by . They never get bored with this one .
4 #### I am a confirmed Dr Seuss hater . My tongue gets twisted , the words can not come , his rhymes are annoying , I do n't think they 're fun . OOOPS ! Seriously , as one who actually dreaded having my toddlers drag their favorite Dr Seuss tomes behind them , and promising a book burning if I had to read GREEN EGGS AND HAM one more time , I have to admit . . . I LOVED THIS BOOK . How many of us can not identify with the main cahracter who simply is NOT going to get up today ? The rhymes may be a bit much ( remember I am not a huge Dr Seuss fan ) but rather than imaginary worlds filled with strange looking thingies , this is a REAL little boy who is just too warm and toasty to get up ! And so , his family , friends and entire TOWN endeavor to get him out of bed . There is a fun repetitiveness , which encourages the kiddies to sing - song along with the chorus " I AM NOT GOING TO GET UP TODAY , " and a playfulness in the illustrations that suggests that they are geared for the grown ups to be entertained by . And finally , when the Mom at the end announces , " HE 'S NOT GOING TO GET UP , " we feel that we are entitled to share in his victory . Not even the UNITED STATES MARINES could get him out of bed ! A fun book to read again and again !
5 #### Joe Schwarcz tells us what to eat and backs his advice up with the best and most verified lab results from all over the world . If you just love chemistry you 'll love this book but if you care about yourself you 'll find him a treasure chest of tips to live a long healthy time .
3 #### This is a good book , lots of useful information , in a nice " bite - sized " mini - chapter format . I work a lot in the field of nutrition and so recognized that a good deal of the information contained in " Apple a Day " is backed by sound medical research and published literature . In other cases , if you are familiar with the medical literature , his analysis seems a bit superficial . That said , the biggest flaw of this book is that the author did not provide citations so other readers could backtrack and check his data and assumptions .
2 #### In " An Apple a Day " the McGill University professor Joe Schwarcz offers salient useful nutritional advice . Eat lots of fruits and vegetables . Meat is fine but make sure you have more whole grains on your plate . Emphasize variety and balance in your diet . Avoid processed foods , especially those high in fat , sugar , and salt . Exercise . There are no miracle foods and short cuts to a healthy diet . That 's great advice that comes at page 353 of this 355 - page book . I have many issues with the structure of the book , the main being Dr. Schwarcz 's decision to divide his book into easily digestible chapters tackling all the major food debates out there : organic , genetically modified , detox , and so on . It would have been a much better book if Dr. Schwarcz structured it around his main thesis : that there are no short cuts to a healthy diet . Science has spent decades and billions of dollars analyzing the different components of food in the hope of distilling the magical qualities of apples and tomatoes , and selling it in a bottle . There is no scientific basis for the overwhelming superiority of a certain vitamin , chemical , or nutritional supplement . Quite the opposite : eating or drinking too much of a good thing can be a bad thing . Seeking balance , moderation , and variety in nutrition is the best and only path to good health .
1 #### Mr Schwarcz has won awards from the American Chemical Society and is appropriately biased in favor of almost all chemicals . He foolishly attempts to defend fluoridation , irradiation , pesticides , dioxin and virtually EVERY chemical in tiny 3 page chapters , despite mountains of evidence to the contrary . He would fail to convince anyone over the age of 12 . The tired arguments of not enough research and small quantities are not harmful are flat out wrong . This book is a joke .
5 #### great book . clarence larkin does a great job explaining daniel and how it relates to the bible and to the future .
3 #### This book was bought for my mom , who is advanced in her studies of prophecy . I have some growing in knowledge .
5 #### This is a classic Larkin book great for Bible study and can be trusted to be accurate .
5 #### Great book . One of the classics by Clarence Larkin . If you want to understand the book of Daniel , this is a great book .
5 #### This Book is a must have with The study Of Revelation Book thy Both really tie together . Joel
5 #### I just finished reading this book , and I will be reading it again and again ! Excellent companion to Bible study ! Arrival date was BEFORE the expected date . Great seller !
5 #### Almost 100 years old and right on the current events . The truth is powerful and timeless .
5 #### Clarence Larkin 's knowledge of the Bible was exemplary . He is a strong dispensationalist so many would have a problem with that position . But I learned so much from reading this book . His insight into Daniel and the times in which he lived apart from what the Bible tells us is tremendous .
5 #### Clarence Larkin always provides a clear , well discerned explanation of the Holy Bible in his books , and he is never outdated .
5 #### As good a book on Daniel that you can find .
5 #### All of Clarence Larkin Books are Great ! It is a good read . You will be able to understand the Prophecy of Daniel the way he explains it and the Charts are detail in a way that is easy to understand . Daniel ties into Revelation and this book will give you a great understanding ! Be Blessed .
5 #### I received the book right away . Any book by Clarence Larkin is good .
5 #### If more of today 's Bible prophecy teachers actually read and understood the book of Daniel they would know what is going on today . I highly recommend you read this book to gain an understanding about why the crisis in the middle east and the rise of ISIS will impact the entire world . I 've read this book 3 times now and get more out of it each time .
5 #### Very good work by Clarence Larkin . I really loved the book and enjoyed reading it . I found it very helpful in my Sunday school teachings .
5 #### This book was written in the 1920 's and a lot of things have happened that Mr. larkin could never have dreamed about , nevertheless his insight is truely amazing and makes the Bible come alive .
5 #### How soon we forget that our purpose on earth is to serve others . In serving others , we in turn will be served . We all need to practice Johnny 's dedication to others . Read this book and you will see the world differently .
5 #### The story of Johnny the Bagger is a must - read ! It has been months since I first read the book but regularly think about the principle of customer service conveyed by Johnny . The story clearly demonstrates that anyone , regardless of physical limitation , can do something memorable and creative to provide great customer service . What a fabulous example in this story .
5 #### This is an inspiring little book . The premise of giving great service includes the emotional component to lead with the heart - to personalize the service experience in such a way as to make it both extraordinary and impossible to duplicate . Out your personal signature on every job , make your customer remember you , and do it in such a way that it is truly from the heart . Inspired and inspiring !
5 #### Practical , common sense book on service in business . To bad so many of us do n't have common sense , in business & focus only on the bottom line . " These stories of extraordinary service provide a tool kit for success , no matter what one 's position in life may be . " Bob Danzig , former CEO , Hearst Newspapers " This book offers practical , usable and critical advice for all organizations through real life stories about how tyhe power of service can impact customer loyalty . " C. Manly Molpus , President and CEO , Grocery Manufacturers of America Want a healthy bottom line ? Give your customers great service . Want to know how ? Read this book . " Harvey Makay , Author of Swim with the Sharks without being eaten alive .
5 #### Great little book that really drives home the concept of going beyond the Customers expectations and " Wow - ing " them with great care . This would be a quick and easy read that would help get the message across quickly on how Associates are supposed to treat their valued Customers .
5 #### This is a short read , it took me at most an hour . It has valuable nuggets of wisdom and a very touching story about Jonny the Bagger . Simple truth : go the extra mile and it will pay off .
1 #### Awkward cadence , lacks the usual old school Berenstain Bear charm ( I despise the newer preachy books but expected this one to be up there with the great The Bear 's Picnic . ) The illustrations might be worth half a star but it 's truly so dreadful I ca n't bring myself to go over a single star .
4 #### Another one of the Berenstain Bears Early Readers . It 's a lot of fun to read , and the rhymes work well . Very bouncy . I do have to suspend the disbelief of even the kidlets a little - they know full well that two children and a dog can not go to the moon alone ! - but that 's all right .
5 #### This book is so cute and so much fun ! We borrowed this book from our local library and then I just had to own it . My kids did n't want to return it to the library . The story line is so cute and it rhymes too which gives it a fun rhythmic sound as you read it aloud . Great book !
5 #### Although Amazon advertises this book for ages 4 - 8 , my wife and I started reading this and other Stan and Jan Berenstain books to our children from 18 months and up . Always a delight , our kids would laugh at the silliness while learning a lesson about life . We started a great habit of reading two or three books before bed , and the kids loved them . Soon , they would memorize many of the phrases , beginning a lifelong passion for reading . Every kid should experience reading books by the Berenstains while growing up . The characters are well developed , the rhyming phrases help kids become enthusiastic about reading , and the messages about life make them think . Bears On The Moon got my son and daughter asking questions about space and interested in the great beyond . Combine this with other fun Berenstain Bear books and your kids will sit enthralled as you turn the pages . Highly recommended .
5 #### " The Berenstain Bears on the Moon , " by Stan and Jan Berenstain , is one of the best in the authors ' excellent series of children 's books . In this installment , Brother and Sister Bear , accompanied by their excitable pet dog , take a rocket trip to the moon and back . Although the book 's primary purpose is entertainment and literacy education , the Berenstains do get some of the science right . The portray the gravity - free environment of the space ship 's interior during the voyage , and they also show that the gravity on the lunar surface is much less than that on Earth . The book is illustrated in the typically appealing Berenstain Bears style . Particularly fun is the orange , green , and purple - colored rocket ship used by the intrepid space travelers . And the rhymes are equally fun . Example : " Two little bears / and one little pup . / They are off to the moon , / going up , up , up ! " This irresistible adventure tale is definitely a high point in a beloved book series .
5 #### I loved this book as a kid . I 've lived in very cold climates since and this story would always come to mind . How handy it would be if I had my own pet dragon to warm me ! Wanted to read it to my children but could n't find it at the library . Wanted a copy of my own . I bought this used and well loved copy . I am just so glad to have it to read and enjoy with my kids .
5 #### The Laughing Dragon is a classic ! ! I am so grateful to have found a copy in good shape for my grand daughter .
5 #### I had been looking for this book for years but could n't remember the title . Was exactly as described , almost in the exact condition as the copy I was given as a kid . I 'm not sure there is any real positive message in this story , or any lessons to be learned but the art is very unique and colorful .
5 #### This is a wonderful story with excellent illustrations . Fortunately , my childhood copy is in great shape , and my three - year - old loves it . Too bad it 's gone out of print .
5 #### This was one of my top favorite books as a kid . Right up there with The Giant Jam Sandwich . It 's a funny book about a laughing dragon , his friend the turtle , and how they save the emperor of Japan . The illustrations are bright and wonderful , and it 's a crying shame it 's gone out of print .
5 #### three stories in one book . the first is about being realistic about your abilities . the second is about self - sufficiency . and the third is about the dangers of starting something you ca nt finish . all in all a great book .
4 #### " I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today ! " is a fun Dr. Seuss book which contains three stories and 1365 words . The book 's Accelerated Reading designation is given as 2.9 which means the text is suitable for children reading at an advanced Second Grade level . [ 2.9 translates as a book that an " average " child should be able to read when in the 9th month of 2nd Grade . It can be enjoyed by people of any age , of course . ] At our house the stories were met with almost universal praise from both the 6 and 8 year old . And what 's nice about Seuss books , besides the rampant craziness , is the fact that children often forget how many words they are reading as they work away at finding out what happens . Summary : : : A fun Seuss reader which contains three stories . The AR designation is 2.9 but the word - magic of story and rhyme makes this book appropriate for non - reading children as well .

5 #### I used to read this book aloud in a church nursery when I was in my 20 's . When I had my daughter at age 36 , I remembered how fun it was to read and how much the kids loved it . I added it to her collection and it is one of her favorites . I just read it to her again the other night and she is ten years old ( not too old for a bedtime story yet ) ! I highly recommend this Seuss favorite .
5 #### These three stories are a wonderful trip for children into an imaginative world , where they learn important lessons , in the most fun way possible . In the first , ` I Can Lick 30 Tigers Today ' the character learns that his bravado does not live up to the reality , in ` The Glunk that Got Thunk ' children learn how insurmountable problems can be solved by working together and keeping a level head , and in ` King Loii Katz ' children learn a very important lesson : That sometimes one has to follow ones own conscience and put a stop to the bandwagon . It only takes one to say ` ENOUGH ' . Beautifully illustrated , and with a wonderful sense of humour and imagination .
5 #### i love all seuss . here 's another for the collection .
5 #### Kinda mis leading I thought this books was about licking tigers but it actually about a kid that has a chip on his shoulder and wants to beat up things
4 #### The language in this book is outdated but the stories are still fun to read . We initially thought licking meant with a tongue not fighting . The tail story is the cutest in the book .
5 #### My children loved this book to the point that we wore it out . Now I have purchased it for my grandchildren . Not only are the illustrations fun and interesting even to very young children , it teaches phonetic reading in a manner that the kids do n't even know they are learning . All the stories are endearing .
5 #### The beautiful part about this book is both the classic life lessons and the somewhat dated references . I had never actually read these stories growing up , so I got this book on a whim since I love so many of the others . The first story , " I can lick 30 Tigers Today " , talks about " licking " but in reference to " beating up " which is not how most people use the word " licking " anymore . The lesson is certainly still applicable : be careful not to over promise what you are capable of , or to not bite off more than you can chew . However , parents might need to explain the alternate meaning ( not that small children are n't already putting everything in their mouth as it is ... ) . Similarly , the third story centers around a Glunk who makes a very lengthy long distance call ( on a LANDLINE ! ! ) which costs a lot of money . These days , with unlimited talk plans we 'll have to explain why this was such a big deal ! Maybe we should reprint a version where the Glunk goes over the family data plan . ( kidding ! ) In my opinion , the best story was the middle one because of the " demo - catic " lesson of not just following along with the crowd and for standing up and saying something when everyone else is being silly . Even if you are the littlest cat in Katzenstein you have the power to influence many ! Great addition to your Suess collection and easy to read all at once or broken up into three installments .
5 #### This is one of our favorite Dr. Seuss collections !
5 #### This has three great stories that reveal the funny side of human nature - probably best understood 1st through 3rd grade . Read aloud for laughs .
5 #### Great classic for kids . The King Looie Katz story about holding up his tail is the best ! Book arrived in mint condition . Very satisfied ! 5 stars .
5 #### I had to buy more Dr. Seuss books for my son to meet his reading challenge at school . This book has three stories in it . He loved them all . Dr. Seuss is great !
5 #### I gave this to one of the babies in the family as a gift . I used to read this to a child who has ended up having to have a lot of courage and faith to live life well . She has succeeded so far .
5 #### I have been reading The Glunk That Got Thunk that is in this book for years to young children in our family . They always enjoy it/
5 #### This book has some of my favorite stories from childhood .
5 #### Great set of stories . My 2 year old loves " King Looie Katz " .
5 #### .I read this book to my daughter when she was 2 - 3 yrs old ; now she 's reading to her son ! ! ! " I can lick 30 Tigers " is one of a couple of Seuss stories in this book
5 #### This is a great book , my kids LOVE to read it and love having it read to them . The three stories in this book are fun for kids of all ages to read .. definitely 5 stars to my family and me ..
5 #### I bought this book for 30 Tigers but remembered King Louie Katz , and the Thinker - Upper stories after we got it in the mail . We love them all !
5 #### My son suggested I get this for my 6 yr . old granddaughter . He had this book as a child and loved it .
3 #### There is nothing wrong with the book , but I was expecting " Other Stories " to be different ones . The older copy I have has some short unique stories in it and I was trying to find those .
5 #### The first time I came across this story I was at a public library . I knew then I would purchase the book . Since then I have been blessed with a very energetic grandson . I definitely knew he 'd love this story . I have read the story to him and to my great nieces and nephews and everyone listened enthusiastically . We Love that there is n't just one story but three stories in this book .
5 #### This is one of the volumes in the complete short stories of Louis L'Amour . Mr. L'Amour , along with Zane Grey , are considered to be the best western writers ever . I think enough of this writer to have bought all six volumes , including two volumes of non - western stories . These are some of the most entertaining storie ever . written .
4 #### This only had a few more stories that I had not read from L'Amour . Still , for anyone who likes a nice series of good Western short stories , this is a decent book .
4 #### Louis Lamour is a great storyteller . They often have an ending one can not envision and they are of the old school in that they almost always turn out OK in the end even though sometimes there are suprize endings . I have all 5 books of his short stories and they are all good .
5 #### I 've read several of these stories and they 're great . I 'm not sure I can agree with the reviewer who said the stories are not by L'Amour . As I look at the index , I note numerous stories which have appeared in previously published versions , such as the " Ghost Maker " and the " Cactus Kid " stories . So if these are not authentic L'Amour then they were n't years ago either when they appeared under his byline . In any case , these are a great read !
5 #### Louis L'Amour , as JOHN WAYNE , stated , " is the best author of the 20th century "
5 #### I am never disappointed with L'Amour but I think I like his short stories best . These are terrific .
5 #### Great short stories from Louis L'Amour . Good clean wild west stories , some violence but it was the wild west .
5 #### Mr l'amour does not write bad stories . Love all his books .
5 #### My bookcase contains 19th - Century material almost entirely . Many authors . I 'm a big collector of Louis L'Amour books . He knows how to tell 19th - Century stories , albeit it fiction , better than any author I 've read . Will order more books .
5 #### Purchased this as a gift for my father in law . He was excited to receive .
5 #### Excellent , as always . I have read all of these stories before in his paperbacks but wanted them in ebook format . I have always greatly preferred his short stories , and this ebook reproduces them faithfully and , more importantly , in easy - to - read form .
5 #### I first read this around the age of 15 , and it left a deep impression . I came back to it recently when picking out books for the next generation , and read it again . Wow . Its combination of three braided stories in three different eras is vivid and emotionally rich . It reads almost like poetry , with every word counting . It may be intended for a " young adult " audience but it is literature .
4 #### This was one of the most difficult books I read as a kid - and so ultimately one of the most satisfying too . Alan Garner in no way talks down to his target audience and here he produced possibly his best work with a plot that demands the reader 's attention . If only all books were this well written !
5 #### Ursula Le Guin described this as : " a bitter , complex , brilliant book " . I 've nothing to add to that . Except this : try to find a copy at all costs . It is one of the best fantasies ever written . Oh , and if you 're wondering : it 's all of 155 pages long .
5 #### My wife and I enjoy all of L'amour 's stories . We like doing business with Amazon too ! Tom Wall Jackson , MO
4 #### An enjoyable collection of western short stories ! ! Nobody does it like Louis L'Amour ! It 's like watching those old black and white westerns on TV on Saturday mornings .
5 #### the more I read the more i appreciate what it takes to be an excellent writer as to a writer . L'amour has been there and donr that so he can back up his writing . I 've been to many places we writes about , so it 's more real to me .
5 #### My Dad is a huge Luis L'Amour fan . Will be getting the rest of the vulumes for him soon . Thanks
5 #### Great little Book - good service as well - great communication . I would highly recommend to anyone . Thanks for everything .
5 #### Had bought this as a gift for my husband to add to his collection . He was very pleased ! Very good transaction .
5 #### I purchased this Louis L'Amour book of collected short stories thru Amazon . I enjoy his books and have been able to find all but a couple to have a complete set of his books .
4 #### Bought this for someone else , I guess they liked it as they use it , not sure what else you would like of my opinion on it
3 #### Another introductory book in the biology of the cell . I would say that the book is divided into mainly two sections , Cell structure and DANA , DANA replications etc . Second part takes almost two thirds of the book . I would prefer to read other Gene books when it comes to that point but for the cell structure , it is not bad . Some colored pictures , computer animations makes it easy to visualize things . Sections called " experimental pathways " scattered throughout the text takes you into current issues related to the subject . They are also quite sophisticated issues rather than practical problems . I think this book requires considerable guidance when read alone . I could not call this book as self sufficient or easy to read one compared to books by Alberts or Baltimore .
5 #### Classic storybook . It was a fave of mine and now my two girls love to read this .
5 #### Wonderful illustrations . A favorite book with my 20 month old .
1 #### This is a wonderful book but there is a much newer 8th edition of Karp available now . There is no reason to buy an older version since much of the information is now out of date !
5 #### Just amazingly funny and sweet - a joy to read .
3 #### Honestly , if there was a .5 rating system I would give this book 3.5/5 stars . The author delivers a great basic look at statistics and I will admit I took away information from it I had previously either not considered or thought about . A mark of a good read for me . Despite having just said it was a good read it unfortunately was not what I had hoped for . I am in to statistics myself , more as an amature stats guy as I do n't dabble in statistics professionally nor do I have an educational background in it , however I am self taught and fairly knowledgeable and that made reading this book comparable to gearing up to watch a gory Hostel type horror movie and instead ending up watching Dracula staring Bela Lugosi . I recommend this book for anyone wanting to gain some knowledge on statistics and probability from a real world percpective . The author definitely delivers there . For anyone who would like to learn more , like how variables affect outcome and what should be taken in to consideration when making those calculations , this book is not for you .
2 #### Maybe I 've been spoiled after reading Freakonomics , which was so clever and unique it was hard to put down , but I found this book to be pretty dull in comparison . Most of the examples were just not that interesting or unique topics to read about , such as gambling odds , political polls , crime statistics and a rehash of the Monte Hall problem from Parade magazine , which was widely written about years ago .
4 #### ' Curious ' is a quick read about our conceptions and misconceptions on common problems like winning lotteries ( do n't buy a ticket ) , winning card games , death , illness , opinion polls and a dozen or so other topics . Fun stuff . You might also read ' Freakanomics ' which is way more esoteric and mind - boggling .
4 #### Shortly after I took this book out at the library I felt a sense of disappointment come over me because I saw the Canadian maple leaf on the spine of the book - making me aware it 's a Canadian author . Being a Canuck myself , I 've never been a big fan of Canadian lit but just as soon as I started reading this book I knew I was in for a treat ! Struck by Lightning is a book about probabilities and randomness in everyday life , intended to inform and entertain readers without requiring any mathematics background . Odds are you 'll like this Lightning strike . These type of books are so much fun ... anecdotes and examples which will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned . And there are not many books that can manage that feat . Lightning strikes are just the start of an exploration of the odds which confront us all . For the booming numbers of poker players there are numerous studies on when to hold em and when to fold em . And for regular casino - goers , there are the odds of each popular game of chance none of which are ever in the player 's favour . But the most fun are those tidbits of probabilities with which you can astound your friends and make some cash if you want to rub your knowledge in their collective faces . ... Amaze your friends , confound your rivals . Buy Struck By Lightning and have some fun .
5 #### I love books like this ! I saw this one , browsed through it a bit and bought it right away because it looked very good - it was . I can confidently say that this is one of the best books of its type . The author explains , in very clear language , the nature of probability and its use in understanding some of the many areas in everyday life that could otherwise remain very obscure or misunderstood . The topics covered include gambling games and methods , the ways casinos operate ( this may be very surprising to many ) , card games and strategies , pre - election polls , certain game shows , the war against spam , weather prediction , and many other areas where probability plays a key role . The author , an expert in the field , writes very well and in such an engaging and often humorous style that the book is almost impossible to put down . Those who read this book will understand a bit more about how the world that we live in actually works . I highly recommended this book to everyone ! !
5 #### very charming story .... probably best for 4 - 5 yr olds ..... and great for parents !
4 #### Needed this for a class . It helps to clarify points of confusion fairly well .
1 #### The publisher only allows this book to be on 3 devices . It says this in the fine print at the bottom of the Amazon page , but stupidly I did not read down that far . It is an essential textbook with great illustrations , really well written , comprehensive and clear . The publisher however is not comfortable with the digital world yet .
5 #### I received everything as promised ; I am very pleased with this purchase . Highly recommend this seller .
5 #### This book is not only delightfully , unflappably British ( " of course " says Sophie 's mum when a Tiger turns up at their door and asks to join them for Tea ) but can also be told with the lights off in English or Mandarin ( we are a bilingual family ) as we drift off to sleep . We have baby milk powder tins set aside to convert into Tiger Food cans - this book steps off the page for our family and forms part of our shared wonder and imagination . Which is a relief , because manufacturing wonder and imagination all on ones own is exhausting . So thank you Judith Kerr and her illustrator .
3 #### Honest review : Purchase this is if you are a doctoral level student looking for excellent cell biology details and experiment run - throughs . If you are a medical , pharmacy , PA , NP , or nursing student , I would not bother with this text , as it is too detailed for that field . Your time would be better spent on another text .
5 #### A favorite book in our family for 2 generations . A tiger comes and eats EVERYTHING in the house . At the end of the book the family goes out for dinner , I laughed as a young mom reading it to my kids thinking what a great idea to get dinner out . Every now and then in our family " The Tiger comes to Tea " and we have to go out . That still makes my husband laugh .
1 #### I d give the story and illustrations 10 stars if I could , but the fact that this had to go in the other room to offgas after giving us a headache makes me want to give it negative 5 stars . Who regulates the books coming out of china these days ! The chemicals are horrendous ! Sweet story time makes us sick thanks to these books !
5 #### Classic . My children loved this story in the 1980s and now my granddaughter loves it too . Highly recommended .
5 #### When I read this story at a local school , there was little reaction to the tiger eating everything in the pantry-- but when he drank all daddys ; beer , , the children said , " Oh , no ! "
5 #### I thought it was delightful . I purchased it for my 8 month old niece who seems to enjoy it too .
4 #### The text is easy to understand and has plenty of images and descriptions to help explain material . The book could be organized more effectively and certain portions could be explained more straightforwardly .
5 #### I 'm a biomedical engineering student at Purdue University , and I needed this book for BIOL 230 . I took it with Prof. Bartlett , who I liked a lot , but I know others thought he was boring . This book is a GREAT book for learning . If you can keep up the reading in this book , then you 're bound to get an A in the class . The class can sometimes go pretty fast and over your head if you do n't read , but it is possible to get by with an okay grade without the book . I also got a free PDF from a friend of the book , but I prefer the physical copy . Overall , I used this book than most of my others , and even in compliment of my BME 201 course material at times . It has FANTASTIC diagrams to teach you Glycolysis , Electron Transport Chain , Photosynthesis , Membrane Transport , etc . An underestimaded tool for the class is Youtube . There are tons of great animations out there that helped me get an A. Good luck !
3 #### Average textbook , not used much for the class . Pretty helpful if I had some clue about what I was reading , but I imagine for someone seeing these concepts for the first time , this would be a nightmare .
3 #### one stop shopping for cell biology , molecular biology , and biochemistry . Karp 's excellent book covers a broad range of subjects in modern molecular and cellular biology , in a compact form that still manages to convey the experimental process . The text is extremely readable , and is organized to be flexible for many different types of courses . I gave it fewer stars because there is a newer edition that retains the content of this older edition plus new information , so I would recommend getting the new up to date edition .
5 #### My children and I love reading this story about the catering dilemma when a tiger shows up for tea and you need to feed him . He eats/ drinks everything including ALL Daddy 's beer ! If only they 'd had some tiger food in the house ... I find this book really captures childrens ' imaginations as they try to work out what they would do in this situation . There are also quite a few valid and intelligent questions , such as how can you drink all the water out of the taps ? Why would a tiger prefer Sophie 's sandwiches to Sophie herself ? Would a tiger get drunk from drinking beer ? ( Some of these questions are from older kids than the intended audience ... ) This whimsical old - fashioned story has a European feel with the landscape and clothing - there is also something decidedly old - fashioned about the family structure with Daddy at work all day ( and the " Ta - da ! " pose when he arrives home from work ) , but this does not detract from the story for me . If it bothers you , you can talk about how family dynamics are different now , although careful not to spoil the magic possibility that a tiger could possibly come to tea .
4 #### Beautiful illustrations- but would modern children begin to understand being invited to " Tea " ?
5 #### My Grandkids have me read it often .... while we drink our tea and watch for tigers ...
4 #### Very nice book . Jumps around on some areas , like for example when trying to explain the steps in glycolysis . But overall it is a good book and explains many aspects clearly . Some topics could 've been a little more concise though . Package was delivered on time and good condition .
4 #### This book got me an A in Cellular and Molecular Biology . The textual explanations are decent , but the images are very clear .
5 #### Although I did n't even use this book for the class that it was required for I am glad that it came in great condition and at a great price !
5 #### When I first read this book to my 3 year old granddaughter she wanted me to read it again and again . It has become her favorite book . Highly recommended .
5 #### I thought this book was reasonably priced and it arrived well within the stated time . I would recommend this seller .
5 #### Surprisingly well written and easy to read . Save yourself from the outrageous cost of new books , and get the old edition . While new discoveries are always being made , it should n't make a difference for school . By the time you need this book , you should be far enough along the way to be required to use peer reviewed articles for new developments anyway .
5 #### An excellent text . I am not a college student , rather a layman with a curiosity about structure & function at the cellular level . This allowed me to purchase an older edition for my own entertainment at a deeply discounted price . It was well worth the investment .
5 #### This is a classic book with messages relevant for both young and old . The young will enjoy Suess ' quirky prose and the wonderful illustrations , and the older reader will take away messages of life 's tendency to be a precarious balancing act .
2 #### the real book is way easier to use , unless weight or space is your main concern . No link to the table of contents . You have to go to the front page and scroll through to it , Graphics are good but it makes page loads very slow , so paging through looking for something takes forever . There are no links to the chapters in the table of contents so you must try to scroll to the right page and same thing for the index in the back . Also they will not let you view the books from the kindle web browser or my iPhone , only a kindle or my table , which greatly reduced it 's usefulness . Ebooks should be better than paperbooks , they have the opportunity . But I have yet to find a single one that I was satisfied with and this one is no different . Its just a really big , slow to load pdf file .
5 #### . Illustrations and keen story line will bring on a smile . Should elicit discussion and appreciation for all . The Tiger , while not perfect , is a takeoff on The Man who Came forTEATIME and cleaned out the fridge .
4 #### Good basic concepts , not short enough for a review but a good first Cell & Mole . Biol . text . Marked up quite a bit but the price was right .
4 #### The drawings in this book are charming , the text is rather simplistic , and at the end , the fact that the Tiger will never again return , leaves even me , an adult reader , disappointed .
4 #### I enjoyed this story and so did my children . I would have given it 5 stars but the reference to beer Ina picture book lowered my score by one star . I otherwise thought the book was quite enjoyable .
3 #### Good book . It has more information than you will be able to digest . It does not guarantee you an A in the class or even a C. It was just too expensive and they do n't give you the answers to the super complicated questions at the end of each chapter ! It is more like an encyclopedia of cell biology . It is not very student friendly . This is more like for a grad student class where you already know all these concepts and just need a quick refresher . My professor idolizes the book author and all the scientists that won the nobel for comming up with these concepts , but that does not help me understand the material . Book author : Please write more clear and with less jargon . I am an undergrad for god sakes ! I m not a cell biologist or biochemist yet . Pictures are nice but the professor did not tested us on the pictures . My class exams were more like 6 multiple chioce(very hard and the professor never took responsibility for correcting his wrong answers ! ) 4 short answer questions , and 4 big essay questions that were 2 pages long each and you had to answer them all . If I were a newby on this , I would just buy the older edition for a buck and use it instead . Good luck on cell bio , will be the hardest bio class you will ever take !
3 #### This was recommended to me and is quite popular however , I just do n't get it . The story is odd- about a tiger who shows up for tea and eats the family out of house and home . Then , they buy new food and go out for dinner . The tiger never returns .... it 's just kind of an odd ending . My three year old is n't too impressed with this one- probably not one I 'd say is a must for your library .
5 #### This book did meet my needs . Thankyou so very much . it 's appreciated . it 's a fantastastic book to read and a lot of fun .
5 #### I purchased this book because i am a potential pre - med student . Let me start by saying i purchased the second book and it was just as good as new and it was delivered pretty quickly . i literally finished a whole chapter in less than 30mins . The diagrams are perfect because it helps you visualize . The language of the book is really simple but not boring . The author writes alot of examples in some of the text just too keep your mined focused and steady . I did my high school 5 years ago and yet i am not as lost as i thought i would be . Really good book . Great layout . easy to understand . Not too many confusing big words . Though if you have no previous knowledge ( high school level ) of biology .. i suggest you read up a little before u use this book . However if you have high school knowledge about basic biology . Then this is a good book for you .
5 #### I read this book when I was 13 years old - have read it atleast 20 times since then . And it has never failed to inspire me - time after time it has helped me to rise over circumstantial setbacks . Sadly the copy I have is over 40 years old , and pages are falling apart . Wish that reprints were available . Douglas Bader had become sort of a role model for me .
5 #### Real heroes are never concerned with being heroic , just with getting on with things . Douglas Bader personifies determination , courage and everything else about true , real heroism . He never made excuses for himself , even as a P.O.W. , and spent a lot of time quietly inspiring others who had suffered to do the best they could ; and he did it one - on - one , not as a public display . When he died , Australian TV devoted 2 hours to his life in a special program the next day , something they had never done for any other British WWII veteran ( he had no major links to Australia ) . Like other reviewers , I read the book as a child , and Bader 's life has inspired me ever since . I would love to give copies of the book to friends , if only I could get some !
5 #### I also read this book as a teenager- for a book report in Health class . I have kept the book for over 20 years and still find it excellent . If it were in paperback , I would give it to others as it shows what a person with disabilities - even way back then -can do . Douglas Bader is certainly one of my heroes .
5 #### This is a nice little story . The story is ridiculous- which is why my toddler / almost pre - schooler and I love it . And the language is not baby - ish , it is a proper book . This is a book that will span many years of reading . Storyline is that a tiger came over and ate and drank everything in the house so when Father got home from work there was nothing for dinner . So he suggests going out to a cafe for dinner . I liked this book so much I have looked up other books by this author that i plan to buy . I will also give this book as a gift .
5 #### Ranking books of this nature is an interesting proposition . First of all it depends while you are here looking at the book , if you need it as a textbook for a course and are looking for a bargain price it is a no brainer - just order it . If you are supplementing other books and you are in the field I think it is also a wise choice as it is very detailed , had great diagrams and is easy to follow . If you are a not a molecular biologist , like me , and are simply keen to learn I think it is a brilliant book on the topic - understanding that this is not my specialty . I can imagine this does not solve all issues in the field , nor could any book , so I would not hesitate for one second in ordering this . I particularly have interest in the mitochondria and this wonderful book looks at this little organelle from many perspectives - so I am more than happy with this purchase . What a great source
4 #### I loved this story as a child , so I wanted a copy for my own children . I was lucky to find a board book format - and now my twin toddlers ( 2 years ) love it too . It 's an excellent little story for learning sequencing . It provides sentence structures a little different and more sophisticated than some other children 's books . It also serves as a fun interactive discussion point , " Do you think that tigers usually drink tea ? Where do they live , in a house ? "
4 #### Bought it as a present for someone else but read it as a boy just when it was originally published
4 #### Was enjoyable and most interesting movie but difficult to understand a lot of the conversations due to the strong English dialect ; however , after movie was viewed , my wife found we could have input English / American translations on the screen .
5 #### This is an inspiring and riveting story . Amazing story , and the personality of Douglas Bader as he meets and surmounts heavy challenges is incredible . Those who have liked Undaunted would like this too .
5 #### Purchased as a gift for a friend who is a pilot . He loved it . To think that this man was able to fly during WWII after having lost both legs is so inspiring .
5 #### We love this book ! It is perfect for children and parents . It 's a great story - the kind you could read over and over and actually enjoy . One of our favorites .
5 #### Another book we discovered when living in England , this is a fun keeper made more fun if read aloud in a British accent . Sophie and her mum are astounded by their unexpected and ravenous guest , but maintain proper manners . Fun repetitious phrases , British terms ( at least in our version ) . Judith Kerr also writes the delightful Mog series&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mog - the - Forgetful - Cat / dp/000717134X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mog the Forgetful Cat</a >
5 #### Kiwi Magazine Review : Tea parties are the perfect occasion for practicing good manners and clever conversation . However , when your guest turns out to be a tiger and eats you out of house and home , it 's a spectacular party to even rival Alice 's tea party . This sweet book tells the tale of the day the tiger came for tea . Methinks it may have been inspired by a stuffed animal sitting at the table but one can only wonder how such a fun story came to be more than 40 years ago .
5 #### Words ca nt describe what this story holds . It is more than a lesson in human courage . Humor , great care and thought went into the story of this mans life .
5 #### that sadly lost parts of both legs and an arm . Despite his own grievous injuries , I think Douglas Bader 's struggles and victories with his own disabilities are so inspirational that any person , soldier or citizen will be inspired by both his recovery and stellar life achievements . Imagine losing both legs in the 1930 's - 40 's , a time when there was little expertise in rehabilitation and artificial limbs . Imagine then going back to flying after such a horrible crash , then excelling during the Battle of Britain , being shot down , captured and not just being a willing prisoner , but making numerous escapes only to be recaptured . The man was such a character ! Attitude is everything . Douglas Bader had such a will to survive and to live a great life , not just an ordinary one . So , I am buying another copy for myself to read and reread . I wish it was available on Kindle so I could take it with me . I will also be buying it for my Sons in Audio version for their drives to work . What better way to start and end your workday ?
5 #### My judgement of a great book is determined by my thought that the story is excellent movie material . Douglas Bader is an excellent example of perseverance against all odds . Too many of us give up too easily . Encourage your family and friends to read this book . It will help them to understand the need to never give up .
5 #### This book is an absolute winner . Every little girl I give it to accepts it immediately as a firm favorite . It all started with my memories of not wanting to return it to the library . Modern little girls like to carry it about with them ( Hoping that someone new will read it to them ? As an opportunity to admire it in public ? Because they ca n't bear the thought of being parted from it ? ) Who knows . All I know is that this is a great book .
5 #### I 've come to appreciate this book more and more over its succeeding editions . It has now replaced both the Alberts et al . and the Lodish et al . books ( both nevertheless excellent ) as my favorite textbook on cell and molecular biology . It is concise , covers a very large range of subjects and has very clear graphics . I think it is better balanced than many of its competitors in the sense that the reader never gets the impression that the author sacrificed certain subjects to give more room to his favorite ones . On many occasions , I was surprised to find things in here that I could n't find in the bigger ( and more " fundamental " ) Alberts and Lodish . It references papers and review articles that are very current , and is very up to date on its content . I think Gerald Karp is doing a very good job with each new iteration of this book and I will recommend it to my students .
5 #### My fiancee bought this book for my daughter and I was a little doubtful at first , but she loves it and knew it off by heart by the time she was 18 months old ! we read it over and over again and she even says good bye , good bye , good bye , good bye to the tiger on the very last page . This was an excellent buy and I 'm looking forward to my younger daughter reading it too .
5 #### This is one of the most complete and easy - to - read book ever ! I have studied with Gerald Karp books since I was an undergraduate student ( Biochemistry , and Karp book was always by my side , very useful ) . This book explain the cellular metabolism , structures ( cytoskeleton , microtubules , filaments , genes , relations between genes and proteins , DNA repair , cell cycle , cell signalling , lot of concepts that are not easy to understand at first , Karp does it very simple . You will love this book . I can strongly recommend it . Another excellent book I can recommend is Molecular Biology of the CELL by Bruce Alberts .... is excellent ! and before you take an exam , I will suggest the " Outline of Molecular and Cell Biology " by the Schaum 's series . Well , that 's it for now , I wish you the best in your career ( I have been there , I know how hard it can be and choose the proper books ! ) and always remember , keep working and practicing , because practice make the Master ! ! :)
5 #### THIS IS A GREAT BOOK ! I'M BUYING A 2ND COPY TO HAVE A MINT CONDITION BOOK FOR LATER . OUR TODDLER WANTED THIS READ 7 TIMES IN A ROW UNTIL WE FINALLY SAID IT 'S NAP TIME . IT 'S NO SURPRISE OVER 3 MILLION COPIES HAVE BEEN SOLD !
5 #### My dad told me about this book and am I ever grateful . The book was an easy and very interesting read . The subject , Douglas Bader , was AMAZING , almost beyond belief . If you have ever suffered serious setbacks in life , particularly due to physical injury , you need to read this book . If you are a history buff , particularly of WW2 , you need to read this book . If none of the above apply , you still need to read this book .
5 #### This book was given to my father as a birthday present from my mother when I was a small boy and I 'm pretty sure it received scant attention from my father ( an ex - WW2 navy man ) and sat on the shelf until I was in my very early teens in the sixties . Well it certainly was in constant use from then on . I think I read it every year until I was almost in my twenties and I 've read it a couple of times since then and will probably again . For anybody interested in aircraft stories , as I am , or just interested in a fine read , this is the book for you . No fiction writer would dare write this story as it is so unlikely and yet it 's all true . Thrilling , inspiring , funny , tragic , it 's a story a man 's unbending determination and being in the right place at the right time . I would recomend this book to anyone interested in a good read .
4 #### An amazing story , and quite well told , not dry . This is actually a real story , retold . Douglas Bader was a fighter pilot , who crashed . He lost both his legs due to the accident , and amazingly managed to get back into the air through sheer force of willpower , guts , and perhaps bloodymindedness .
4 #### This was one of the first war ace biographies I 've ever read , back when I was fourteen . It 's a pleasure to see it published again , to replace my old copy . Of course , Mr. Brickhill seems to be a huge fan of Bader , but who in England is not , even those who realize that Bader had a difficult temper , but a difficult temper that was responsibels for getting back in a warplane in war tiem RAF without both legs ! Good read , a classic .
5 #### Douglas Bader was in the peacetime RAF but lost both legs in a crash . After a miserable few years on civvie street , the war came along and he volunteered . Not only was he accepted , with two prosthetic legs and several years older than most of " the Few " , but the RAF returned him to fighter - plane duty . He became a leading ace until he was shot down , and then he became such a pain to the Germans that they had to take his legs away from him to stop him from escaping . You may remember Brickhill as the author of The Great Escape . This is another spellbinding yarn . Note however that it is more of an inspirational story than a serious biography . In the days when youngsters were more literate than they are today , it would have been called a " boy 's book . " My son - in - law ( who is English ) gave an earlier version of this book to me for a Christmas present . He had to search all the used - book websites to find it . I 'm delighted ( and so is he ) that it 's available again . Bluejacket Books are distributed in the U.S. by Naval Institute Press , so I 'm sure that this is an excellent production and not a cheap reprint . Give it to the " boy " on your list , whether he 's eight or eighty .
4 #### The stirring story of the war hero , Douglas Bader , who lost both legs in a plane crash before the war but came back to become one of the great flying aces of the Battle of Britain . This respectful biography does not disguise the fact that Mr Bader must have been a forceful , difficult personality to deal with . The Germans who imprisoned him after he was shot down certainly found him hard to cope with . After numerous escape attempts they resorted to taking away his artificial legs , and eventually sent him to the POW camp for perennial bad boys , Colditz . After the war Bader went on to a successful career with a petroleum company and continued to fly his own plane all over the world . This is not a dirt - digging , expos biography such as is fashionable in these days of media overload , but it is a bare - bones , well written story of a remarkable man 's remarkable life .
5 #### Originally written in 1954 , I just read this book for the first time . It 's a great biography of a flier who loses both his legs in a crash before WWII , then learns to walk with artificial legs without crutches or a cane . He becomes a top fighter pilot and tactician during the Battle of Britain , then is shot down and taken prisoner . A couple escape attempts land him in the famous Colditz prison for the duration , but he goes on to be a jet setting executive after the war . I thought Brickhill did an exceptional job of writing the story in an entertaining way . While it covered Bader 's whole life from birth to the time of writing , it never dragged .
5 #### I sent my dogeared copy of Reach for the Sky to a legless hero who spoke a few years back at convocation here at Plymouth State College . He said he 'd heard of Douglas Bader , but had n't read the book . Brickhill 's masterpiece tells a tale of heroism without stooping to hero worship . It also tells Bader 's side of the " big wing " tactical controversy during the Battle of Britain ( Len Deighton 's book " Fighter " , tells Air Chief Marshall Dowding 's side ) . We need Reach for the Sky to teach new generations what it taught us , the War Babies , about the courage and values of our fathers . I 'd buy it for my four sons and two daughters , all now facing life as young adults .
3 #### But has a very mildewy smell , and I do n't know if I 'm going to be able to give it to my granddaughter . Sorry . This is the first unpleasant experience I 've had with used or new books through Amazon .
5 #### We bought this , along with a matching tea set , for our young daughter for her birthday . We have had it several months and she loves the stories . The art work is delightful . I bought the tea set from another company and it was n't made in China !
3 #### After visiting London , we have purchased a few of the Paddington books for our kids . There are too many words on the page to read this book to a 2.5 yr old but the 7 yr . old is hooked . Cute plot . Great pictures .
5 #### And enchanting introduction to an enchanting and loveable bear . Timeless yet a nostalgic trip to the London - that - was . A good read for children of all ages , including me . And a hook to draw you into his other tales !
5 #### paddington finds trouble as it finds him and the kids just love it ! amusing , amazing bear who can not ever stay on the sidelines . in all his trials and tribulations , paddington shows it 's okay to be afraid - while using one 's wits into the bargain . ever helpful , he s ' found his way into our kids ' hearts much as Mon . Hulot has - a human and a bear making them laugh and squeal and share the thrills of getting into a jam !
5 #### Great story . Good sturdy book just the right size for a toddler . I could not find this at any book stores but found it here on Amazon . Love it !
5 #### Fabulous book that reads very well to a 3 - 7 year old , and that a 7 - 10 year old can read on their own .
5 #### Arrived more quickly than I was expecting and was exactly what I wanted . Very pleased with this book .
5 #### Really liked this book and am excited to give it as a gift . It arrived early and just as described .
5 #### Paddington is an easy book to read and it 's a fun story . the illustrations are well done . kids like it
5 #### I picked this up with another Paddington to introduce this bear to my little cousin , she 's 4 . I enjoyed sharing it with her & I know she 's going to enjoy him as much as I did when I was little . Thanks so much the pictures nice and it was easy to read to her . Cool !
5 #### I loved this story when I read it to my children - how much more fun to read it to my granddaughter !
5 #### My nephew loves this book . It is a classic and well illustrated . It is a great size to read together and it has been read so many times already ! Definitely a great purchase !
5 #### Perfect book for the little grandaughter who has just discovered Paddington Bear . Her mother loved these books as a child and ow she can experience them . Arrived on time .
5 #### After buying my grandson a small stuffed Paddington Bear I wanted the story to go with it . This book is Paddington 's introduction to London and I loved it . I wish these books were easier to find . The supplier came through for me and I would order more if they can get them .
4 #### I 'm not as fond of the new Paddington design as I am of the old classic style . I remember reading this book when i was little & constantly turning the pages over & over looking at the pictures . Also looking for Paddington 's garden book but I ca n't find any that show the original product . They use the modern cover when the copyright clearly says 1960 's so how can I trust to buy it if they use something else ?
1 #### Never could have imagined writing a 1 - star review for a Paddington Bear book , but here it is . Paddington Bear : My Scrapbook was not what was expected . Instead of being a compilation of all of the things that Paddington experienced , as noted throughout the series , this book is more about how his parents met their horrible end and why he ended up with Aunt Lucy in Darkest Peru , before he stowed away to England . The content was upsetting to my Paddington fan . So if you 're expecting bits from Paddington 's trips with Mr. Gruber or about an adventure with Judy , be prepared instead for a Peruvian earthquake . You know what ? Spare your Paddington fan the heartbreak and keep the wonder and happiness of Paddington intact . Because there is no one like him and no one can bring joy like he can . Let 's keep it that way .
5 #### This was my son 's favorite book when he was a child . He insisted I read it to him every night and he knew the story by heart . I found it very charming and appreciated that the author used an animal as his main character . My son and I are both animal lovers and I believe that is why he loved this story so much . He had a stuffed bear that he would hug while I read him the story night after night !
5 #### It 's Paddington . What 's not to love ? Well , maybe the dust jacket . Kid books and dust jackets just do n't mix well . Another solution is called for . But the books make story time a joy over and over .
5 #### I loved this book as a kid and now love reading it to my nephew . It teaches him the names of so many things in a fun way . Its also a book that kids can read by themselves fairly quickly since most of it entails naming items .
5 #### Theo LeSieg ( also known as Dr. Seuss ) produces a new word book sort of like Hop on Pop but with a continuing plot . A mouse wants to show a bird what a people house is like . The two animals scamper around the house with the mouse naming common household items . But eventually the mouse remembers that there is something else in a people house . People ! The two animals return to the outdoors . Plenty of vocabulary words that children should be familiar with ( although some may not be familiar with a telephone with a dial ) . This is great for helping children learn to read . The words are large and clear ( not small and on a dark background like in some books ) , thus making it even easier to learn .
2 #### This is an appropriate book for kids less than 2 years old . It is a vocabulary book that simply lists a bunch of pictures and the words that goes with the pictures . It lists many of the common every day items that you would find in a house . It is not clever and I dare say , it 's not _ really _ a Dr. Seuss book The Illustration quality is WAY BELOW AVERAGE compared to ANY picture book for young children . Like many books , if its the first one your parents give to you , you will probably love the book . I believe that this is why some other reviewers have raved about this book .
5 #### Wow this book cam fast . it actually passed other orders which I had placed way before it . Very please with the condition and the price ! ! My grand daughter loves this book . Excellent book to teach reading in the early ages .
3 #### The book itself is cute , and I love that they included Dr. Seuss 's drafts at the end of the book . But the first one I got had wibbled pages , as if it has been in moist air . I returned it , and the second one was the same . Either the publisher used cheap production , or there was a production error , or they 'd been sitting in a humid warehouse . Either way , made the book look used and warped .
5 #### Perfect gift for my student teacher . Classic unreleased Seuss book brought to life by modern author and illustrator . If you have n't read this Dr. Seuss book , definitely give it a try !
5 #### This is the 2nd copy I 've bought of this book . It makes a great Kindergarten teacher gift !
5 #### We need more Diffendoofer schools and more teachers like Ms. Bonkers ! We 4yo loves this story . I love its important message , said as only Seuss could .
5 #### Perfect book for my one year old . It 's short enough to keep her attention with lots of colors and pictures , but long enough that I do n't have to read 8 short books to fill in our story time before bed .
5 #### My Kids LOVED this book & so will our 2 new grand babies ! ! !
5 #### One of my favorite Dr. Seuss books . Purchased it 42 years ago for my children , and recently for each one of my grandchildren .
5 #### was a gift fora baby shower where the theme was dr seus
5 #### Fast shippingGreat book .. Highly recommend it for reading to very young children .
5 #### My son loves it and the illustrations are amazing .
5 #### Dr. Seuss is always fun and goofy . I had never heard of Differndoofer Day , but my kids and I loved it the minute we read it together ! Great for any home or classroom .
4 #### I love this book up until the last page where they show the humans throwing the bird and the mouse out the door .
5 #### Read this to my sons whom loved the book . So had to get it for a granddaughter . Still can read this without looking at the words . Love the book !
5 #### This was a really good book for when my sons were 2 and 3 years old , and now I 've been able to read this book to my 5 grandsons at the same age .
5 #### Best book , your grand children will love you for it !
5 #### Excellent ! Students truly understood the humor as it relates to their own mandated testing .
5 #### We bought these for our kids teachers for their end of the year thank you gift . It is such a cute books and they loved them ! Home run !
5 #### This takes me back to my childhood and now my children get the chance to share this memory with me . Thank You
5 #### I love Dr. Seuss books . I bought this one for a lesson plan unit I am doing and for my three year old . Very cute book .
5 #### This is a favorite book . It 's quick to read and a lot of fun , . Our son loved it and now our grandson loves it .
5 #### Loved it when my children were younger and wanted it for my grandchildren . Good for the beginning reader and fun for those who do n't read yet .
5 #### For some reason , I remembered this book from when I was a child . It was read to me at daycare and I always loved it but could n't remember the exact title and could never find it in any local book stores . Finally found it here on amazon and I am so glad to be able to share the same cute book with my kids .
5 #### This is a really special book that was written by Dr. Seuss in his living years . I brought him great joy but also great sorrow because he never felt the book was what he wanted it to be and it ended up being an unpublished piece until after his passing . Upon his passing his secretary and a few friends helped get it published . The story is super cute , the ides is excellent and the fact that they were able to publish one of his works after is passing is great . I love it , I use it in circle time at my daughter 's school and they love it .
5 #### My favorite Dr Seuss book ; rhythm and rhyming is great .
5 #### It was an excellent book . I would think that any Seuss fan would find it fabulous .
5 #### Dr. Seuss ' books are great for children especially to teach rhymes and pronunciation of certain words . We celebrate Read Across America Day each year by reading books written by Dr. Seuss .
5 #### We 're a PBS station that takes one of our " stars " to public libraries each summer to encourage children to sign up for the libraries summer reading programs . The children were trilled to meet the Cat in the Hat in person and had their names put in a hat for a Seuss book drawing . The winners were thrilled to pick their own special book that they got to keep forever .
5 #### We actually use this book twice a year , at the beginning of the school year with the them " Getting to Know You " then make a house . And with Dr. Seuss theme and make a house out of a milk carton . Very cute story .
5 #### Great book . I remember reading this when I was little and now I am reading it to my daughter . Love all the memories it brings back . What 's not to like .
5 #### I love this book ! Especially now when Common Core is being pushed .
5 #### Who does n't love to read Dr Seuss over and over and over . My grandsons never get tired of listening over and over .
3 #### I was disappointed . The announcement said new , so I bought it . it came with the faceplate scribbled on and food stains on two of the pages . Diane Koch
5 #### She is just learning to read and loves Dr. Seuss so it was perfect for her . Her 4 year old brother loved the story too ! Glad we bought this book for them .
4 #### I like it , but at one year old , my son is n't as enthused about it as I am . Maybe he 'll grow into it .
5 #### This one was my favorite as a kid , and I bought it for my 2.5 year old for Christmas . I know he 'll love it , he loves all the Dr. Seuss books .
5 #### I loved this book when I was a small child . Being that it was my favorite , I bought it for my son . Hopefully , he will enjoy it as much as I did .
4 #### This one is a primer for beginning readers : AR 1 The story is about a mouse and a bird who enter a house to take a look around . The artwork is the standard cute and colorful Suessian stuff . The print is VERY large , and it provides good , non - threatening practice for beginning readers . However , unlike other Dr. Seuss books , this one is not as interesting as a read - aloud , and I do n't think you 'll find your children pouring through it the way they will " Cat in the Hat " or " The Butter Battle Book " . Here 's some text so you can see what it 's like . " Come inside , Mr. Bird , " said the mouse . " I 'll show you what there is in a People House ... " " Bananas , bathtub , bottles , brooms ... That 's what you find in people 's rooms " . As you can see most of the text is a list of household items and as a consequence I 'm only giving this book 3 - Stars . While it is a good solid book , it 's not one that I would recommend people buy . Pam T~ mom and reviewer at BooksForKids - Reviews
5 #### The book was in GREAT condition ! It arrived quickly and I was very happy with my order . I will definitely order again .
5 #### You need this one TOO in your childs library . THIS is a very fun book and will create FUN times to share while reading with your child .
5 #### Wonderful . THE book to read to your students prior to testing . Gives confidence to students before the ubiquitous testing .
5 #### This book about the " differenter " school called Diffendoofer is actually not 100 % written by Dr. Seuss . This is his story concept , but he never completed it . After he died , the publisher brought in poet Jack Prelutsky and illustrator Lane Smith to finish it . The story is wacky as you would expect from both Dr. Seuss and Prelutsky . It is written in silly rhyme . The illustrations are a mixture of the new ( Smith ) , and the old ( Dr. Seuss ) pasted in , which gives it the feel of a tribute to Dr. Seuss . I enjoyed the silliness about this school where they learn " lots of things not taught in other schools . " Although the rhyming is at times forced , it is still a lot of fun . Great for all ages .
5 #### Love this ! Gave it as a gift to my son 's kindergarten teacher .
5 #### I bought this book for teacher appreciation week for two teachers and they both loved it . I admit I read them before I gifted them and It is an amazing story of teaching children to think differently and to be confident in what they learn , my favorite line is " we taught you how to think " Mrs. Bonkers is a wonderful teacher and all the characters have special talents . The teachers LOVED this book , I was there when one of the teachers read it to the class , a second grade class and the kids were laughing out loud and the fact that the book has the original sketches and background history in it really impressed the teacher , she was so excited . This book is great for teachers or parents , I admit after giving the teachers their book I had to buy my own copy :)
5 #### You ca n't hardly go wrong with Dr. Seuss . This is a good read . It is about two divergent educational approaches to how schools are run . Dr. Seuss continues to educate all of us with this book .
5 #### I LOVE this book . I am a teacher and this book helps my kids understand that standardized testing is not the end all be all , it 's what they can do with the knowledge they have . It also has helped some of my colleagues and I to come to the conclusion that if we teach the kids to think , that is more important than teaching them to take the test , and by teaching them to think , we will be teaching them what they need for the test .
5 #### this book is pure fun . My children ( I teach second grade ) delight in this wonderfully zany school and its hard to believe teachers and policies .
5 #### My teacher friends and I love it b / c we agree w/ the theme that school should be about learning to THINK and having FUN , not just passing tests ! My 3- yr . old granddaughter loved it , said she would love to go to Diffendoofer School .
3 #### Not Bad but there are other better Dr. Seuss Books . I had to buy this for a class in college .
5 #### I purchased this book and others to read aloud to my class before the annual state testing started . With as much emphasis that is being placed on teachers and students , it is great to be able to make light of it all for a little while . I recommend this book for your 3rd , 4th , and 5th graders !
5 #### The entire family has enjoyed this . We love the rhyme , the story , the pictures , and the pure creativity of it all ! . We have all also enjoyed the history behind this book ! Buy it ! you 'll enjoy it .
5 #### The book celebrates the kind of uniqueness and individual difference good schools foster . The movement towards schools narrowing their curriculum to what is tested on a standardized test and threatening to close schools that do n't fall in line making all schools a " Flobbertown " is a serious issue this book indirectly addresses . The book invites reflection on our own experiences in schools , our relationships with teachers , and how they ask questions that reveal the world to their students . It expresses Suess 's value of creative thinking .
5 #### Great read aloud for my class before standardized testing . Easing students ' anxiety was my goal . This is only one way I reached my goal .
5 #### It was so wonderful to see an author and an illustrator take the time to complete a Dr. Seuss book and pay such homage to him .
5 #### Item was in perfect condition , and I am happy to add it to my collection for my future classroom once I become a teacher !
3 #### Okay story . Okay rhymes . Pretty good ideas . But this just does n't quite hit the Seuss mark . Hey , it 's hard to be consistently great . This is a worthy attempt , worth a few reads .
5 #### This is a great book to give to a good teacher at the end of the school year . It is all about praising thinking and creativity and that learning is fun .
5 #### I read this book to my education majors in Foundations of Education . Such a great commentary on proficiency testing . A must read for all educators .
5 #### we love Dr. Seuss books ! This one was no different- this was purchased as part of a basket of gifts for the teacher ( 2nd grade ) and the kids all liked it , and the teacher- ( me too ! ) cute book . In great shape !
4 #### Used book subs for an out of print book . Needed to complete our collection . Will make my grandson very happy !
5 #### Purchased for a friend , and given at her going away party . She read the book to our group after dinner , and everyone loved it .
5 #### an excellent book if you are in the education business and even better book if you love Suess ! Dr. Suess died in the making of this book . 2 other artists / poets finished this book . They did a great job capturing the essence of Dr Suess . the book pokes fun at the dreaded state test and encourages kids to think not just recite facts for a test . a great read ! !
5 #### I was so excited to see a new Dr. Seuss book . At first the illustrations bothered me - so different from what you expect in a Dr. Seuss book . Still , my kids , not having grown up on his work , did not have the same expectations . By the time they discovered that the principal might take his eyebrows off , they were hooked !
5 #### My brother shared this book with me a couple years ago . He enjoyed reading it with his two young kids . They loved both the school and teachers in the stories . The book highlights what schools should be about ; student interest , learning , excitement , fun ; in contrast to what often takes over in schools today -- tests , meaps , rules . I found it motivating and keep it on my desk at work ( at school ) to remind me of what 's important .
5 #### This book is great ! I teach school and I think I might start using this as a lead - in to begin reviewing for standardized tests . Just to increase student morale with a little Seuss humor ! Would also be great to amuse teachers at the last faculty meeting before standardized testing begins . Highly recommended .
5 #### At Diffendoofer School , students learn essential life skills --"listening , smelling , laughing , and yelling " and " how to tie knots in neckerchiefs and noodles , how to tell chrysanthemums from miniature poodles . " The delightful Diffendoofer School may be closed , forcing the students to attend Flobbertown School , where everyone does " everything the same . . They dress in just one style . They sing one song , they never dance , they march in single file . . . Their lunches have no taste at all , Their dogs are scared to bark . " Naturally , the Diffendoofer creative thinking students rally to save the day and the school . The characters are quirky but all too real . I particularly like giving this book to young people to encourage their spirit and creativity , as a preemptive strike against the peer - pressured conformity of adolescence . ( As an added bonus , many of Ted Geisel 's original sketches and concepts are included in a post - script titled " How This Book Came to Be " . )
5 #### My son loves this book . Tries to read it on his own .
5 #### I do like green eggs and ham , but it is a little long so I decided to order the book with the cd so that my kids can listen to it whenever they want on their little cd player . This also came in handy when I got the flu and could n't read to them . They enjoyed this book and followed along with the cd . The notification to turn the page is subtle and not a loud " ding " .
1 #### I love that its a board book but I do n't like that its a flap book . My daughter will just want to rip the flaps off .
5 #### Ca nt get better than this classic . There are many flaps on each page for kids to interact with . This book is super durable and has a page of stickers at the end to place in the story if wanted .
5 #### Classic book . Beautifully illustrated . Ca n't go wrong with this .
5 #### Kids love this book ! My class celebrated by eating ' green ' eggs and ham .
5 #### It 's a birthday gift for my granddaughter who 's learning to read . I ca n't wait for her to open it .
3 #### This is a good book for toddlers . Decent size but I do n't like how much of the original story is cut .
5 #### I read it to my children and now I read it to my grandchildren . It 's great !
5 #### Just another book by Dr Seuss to add to my grandsons collection and he loves it !
5 #### " What i like about the book is at the end of the book the fell in the water and this green man said ill try green egg and ham sam i am and what i did not like about it is that first the green man keep on saying i do not want to try green eggs and ham and sam wants him to try it and a favorite part of the book was when they went to different places . " - 3rd grade student , FL
5 #### Great item . Very well made . Packaged securely . Happy . Will buy again .
5 #### I love reading to my 7 month daughter . She seems to enjoy listening to Dr. Seuss books and so do I
5 #### As advertised , good for the price . As with all Dr. Seuss , ca n't go wrong !
5 #### Dr. Seuss , Got to have it for your kiddos . Read to them every night . Enjoy the simple things of life . This book is one of those simple things of life .
5 #### Our favorite Dr. Seuss book that we gave to our granddaughter as a gift .
5 #### My young nephew told me months ago that this book was his favorite but he did n't have it . I gave him his own copy and he stopped what he was doing to read it !
5 #### A classic Dr. Seuss book that my son loves . It 's a cute story that 's great for bedtime or during the day . It also has inspired some great green breakfasts in our house ! The only thing is that it 's a little long so be prepared going into it ! As a reference , my son is 2 , so anything over 5 pages is a little long .
5 #### This is one of my favorite childhood books . I 'm married to a Muslim , so I will be changing the word ' ham ' to ' lamb ' throughout the book since we do n't eat ham / pork . :)
5 #### It was funny and I liked the poem . I liked the characters . It moved really fast . I liked Dr. Seuss .
5 #### I loved this book when I was a kid and bought it for a baby shower . Arrived on time .
5 #### If you 've been living in a cave for the past century and know nothing about this book then you 're in for a treat ! ! Typical rhyming , nonsensical Dr. Seuss book . One of my all time favorites ! !
5 #### classic great book , when my 3 year old is n't eating well , I call her " sam I am " and she knows what I 'm talking about . HA ! !
5 #### This book has been my favorite since I was a child . Awesome for teaching rhyming words . Recommend to anyone for a child read .
5 #### Always a classic read ! Just purchased it because I could n't find my hard copy to have my grandson read to me . Yep ! Classic read . I guess I 'll get the next Dr. Seuss book .
5 #### This is another great Dr. Seuss book . It teaches kids to appreciate what they have and to not run away from their problems but rather to face them head on . It 's a little long and episodic in the middle , but the message is delivered in such a fun clever way that I still think it deserves 5 stars .
4 #### This book had pop ups in it . I 'm not sure that I like it as much as the original .
5 #### Geisel was always a bit transgressive in his subject matter ( The Cat in the Hat is about kids home alone , letting an abusive stranger into the house ) , but this is more pointed than most . Every child immediately perceives that green eggs and ham are just gross , very much like the disgusting food that strange adults try to get you to eat . In this case it turns out the stuff is essentially candy , but the narrator is right to refuse it up to the end . There seems to be some confusion about the publication date of this book . I know people who had it at least as early as 1959 , yet we keep seeing an Aug 1960 date for the 1st edition . Either this claim is in error , or the publisher distributed copies of it 18 months before the nominal , official publication date . It was definitely in people 's hands well before One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish .
1 #### I wanted the books not the Kendal version - what a ripoff I want my money back
5 #### I love this book . I read it to my students to show how awesome stories and pictures can be . A must read !
5 #### My grandkids liked this book so much , they requested green eggs and ham for breakfast . I used food coloring and they ate it all .
4 #### I have just read Mr Wilde for the first time , though I am a prolific quoter of one - liners taken from my ' Wit of Wilde ' . I urge you to read him . This book was the funniest thing I have read in a long time . It certainly brightened up a very dark and depressing end of semester for me . Mr Wilde is a genius ! He has got himself another devoted fan !
4 #### I was first introduced to this play when I was in college . It is a funny and warm story on how important it is to know who you are . It was because of this play that I got into reading plays by various writers , but this one will always be my favorite . I have read this book so many times , that I lost count and I still get the same thrill out of it .
5 #### Never saw the play itself ; found the reading of it to be remarkably funny .
5 #### This was funny ! The writing is sharp and witty , the characters are relatable but humorous , and the plot just had me laughing in suspense . Great read !
5 #### This play completely cracked me up . I could n't stop laughing . It is timeless .
5 #### This is such a fun read ! Best play ever !
5 #### Definitely a satire on marriage and the social elite in manners . It was humorous .
5 #### A humorous gem by Oscar Wilde ! Recently came back to this fantastic book and had such a great time !
5 #### Great farce play ! ! ! Wilde is the best , " Be yourself ; everyone else is already taken . "
5 #### so easy to purchase required reading books for my kids on Amazon !
4 #### The book is nice . The kids like the flaps . But the stickers seem pointless .
2 #### Not Dr. Seuss ' finest . Do nt know why is so famous .
5 #### Great for my 19 month old twin granddaughters . At this age I sort of speed read it to them . They are fascinated by the pictures , of course .
5 #### bought for grandson to add to his library . perfect
5 #### My Daughter 's favorite Dr Seuss story so far . It is the only one she picks up and " reads " on her own
5 #### My son loved this one . He has read it over and over again and cracks up laughing every time
5 #### Great book . But you might just be better off buying a Dr Seuss collection instead of this book individually .
5 #### Always a classic , never a bore . The best reading there is to animate and story tell with your little ones .
5 #### Such a classic ! One of our all - time favorites . My son is really into this book right now . He is such a picky eater and he loves to tell me he wo n't eat stuff but I have fun with it repeating the different places asking will he eat it here or there or with this Or that and he loves to tell me I wo n't I wo n't ... But then I always tell him but what happens at the end ? He finally agrees to try and loves them ! So it helps a little with picky eater kids and is just a cute book in general . Highly recommend !
5 #### As always a wonderful Dr. Seuss book . Arrived in perfect condition . Would recommend
5 #### I grew up with The Sneetches , Green Eggs and Ham , and Yertle the Turtle , but only discovered this one as an adult . Wonderful wonderful wonderful . I learned almost everything I needed to know from Dr. Seuss .
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham was the first book I learned to read . My husband and I have 5 Beatufil children and when they were younger we would read this book to them almost daily . Thanks for being a part of my generations . I can wait to read it to my grandchildren one day . Antwinette Scott , Author of " Woobee 's Journey " A book for children going through the loss of a loved one .
5 #### One of my favorite books growing up . Drove my folks nuts with it when I memorized it .
5 #### The rhythm of the story , the building of the places to eat green eggs and ham , the characters in the pictures , we 'll never forget you Sam - I - am ! I read this book endlessly to my children , and now I 'm reading it to my grandchildren . A true classic . Thank you , Dr Suess .
3 #### I purchased this for my daughter after remembering it from my childhood . My husband and i were a little disappointed . We love cat and the hat and my daughter does too . This one is very repetitive which to a certain extent all Dr. Seuss books are , but green eggs and ham is more so in my opinion . My daughter lost interest in this pretty quickly .
5 #### Do I like Green Eggs and Ham ? Why , yes I do ! We learn about two people from two different walks of life . The real story here is do n't be prejudiced about something different until you weight out all options and really get to know what s what . Heres one of the most cleverly - written childrens books that never grows old . I never tire of this book and its subtle message .
3 #### The pages are in good shape , but I was under the impression I was buying a new book . What I received is a book with a musty oder and a dirty half rubbed off sticker from TJMaxx !
5 #### Great price to own the book and have a read - a - long cd with storytelling option . Good value !
5 #### gave to my grandson he is learning how to read
5 #### Made some for my grandson . Finally getting him to eat breakfast !
5 #### A good , classic children 's book that I always employ to get the toddlers to try new things !
5 #### What else can be said ? Great book , Dr. Seuss is the best
5 #### I like this book . It 's worth more than a look . This book you should buy . You will see I tell you no lie .
4 #### A classic Dr. Seuss book . It has been read at bedtime I almost have it memorized !
5 #### my daughter grew u [ on these books . Best ever for phonics and pronunciation .
5 #### This book looks brand new , even tho it 's used . Got it to read to my grandkids . Great purchase !
5 #### Like all Dr. Seuss books , this is a great book for children . From the reviews of teachers and such , it 's also a good book for children who are just learning to read . Ol Sam I Am goes through a series of adventures , and each page has pictures related to the words on the page . My two and three year old grandchildren enjoy it immensely . We even made green eggs , using pesto sauce . On balance the book is better than the eggs ! But the kids liked the ham .
5 #### Is there a Dr. Suess book that is not good ? All his books are 10 star books !
3 #### The quality of this used item was n't as good as I was expecting .
5 #### Love ! Enjoyed reading this to my 4 year old son !
5 #### A young man going out on his own for the first time encounters difficulty . He gets lured on and on by the Utopian promises of various characters , and finally realizes that the best solution is to take responsibility for his own well - being .
5 #### My little brother 's favorite book when he was little , soon to be my nephew 's favorite .
5 #### There is nothing like the Dr Seuss series ! Great fun to read with your child !
5 #### Really love this one ( it 's one of my favorites ! ) . It teaches how fun it can be to try different things . In particular , of course , different foods .
5 #### Book shipped brand new and my 5 year old loves the addition to her library !
5 #### Great classic book purchased for our grand daughter , she loves it .
5 #### We have enjoyed this story for generations now . It is a proven winner ! !
5 #### This book is a classic and takes me back to my childhood ! Now I 'm reading it to my son and he loves it too . This is a nice hardcover and a perfect size for little hands . It 's our 4th Dr. Seuss book added to our collection and it wo n't be the last .
5 #### I love it . I used to have my mom read this book over and over . I memorized the lines . Love this .
5 #### Such a great book for kids who always seem to want more and better !
5 #### A Classic . My kids love it . They loved our old copy to pieces , so this was a replacement .
5 #### Classic read , love this story . Amazing , helped my little Russian girl learn English in a WEEK .
5 #### Only 50 words and the best Suess book after Oh , the Places You 'll go . Fun to read as an adult too !
5 #### It 's Green Eggs and Ham , It 's a classic and my kids love it !
5 #### My 2 year old great niece was so happy to get this book . She was jumping up and down with the book in her hand . She even slept with it under her pillow . This morning she told me that she wanted to go to Solla Sollew .
5 #### This is a favorite in our house , for our 6 month old baby ! It 's so fun to read , no wonder it 's a classic . I just bought it as a gift for my 5 year old niece as well .
5 #### I love Dr. Seuss ! I have over 20 of his books and wanted this specific book for a long time . It 's a great story about learning that you have to face your problems , no matter what . A lot of times it 's really easy for one to want to avoid certain things going on in life . This story reflects on that . A great read for everyone !
5 #### Classic Timeless Book ... your troubles will have troubles with you after this book . Dr. Seuss is all the self - help you 'll ever need
3 #### I got this thinking it would be great to read to my one year old and because it 's a board book she could n't rip pages . But though it is a board book , it has flip up tabs she can tear out . Really adorable and comes with peel and stick stickers would be great for an older child .
5 #### This is a Seuss book that we 'd never heard of until we found it at my grandmother in law 's house . We read it to the kids , they loved it , and so did we , so we bought our own copy and it 's become a frequently read selection to my 2- and 4 - year olds . It 's a great selection about how the grass is n't always greener on the other side and to be happy with what you 've got ( or where you live ) .
5 #### i love all seuss . here 's another for the collection .
5 #### I should read this more often , especially since the whole world is nuts ! PLUS , it has HAM , and that makes it special .
5 #### I purchased this book ( as well as all of the other Dr. Seuss books ) as soon as they became available for the Kindle . It helped that there was a great promotional price at the time but the real motivator was to have them for my , at that time , infant grandson to read . Fast forward a couple of years and I realized that while the Kindle version is great to have ( especially when on - the - go ) , nothing really replaces having the actual book in hand for a toddler . My grandson is now almost three years old and can handle the delicate process of turning thin , paper pages . He loves to sit and read books to himself or to his baby sister . Because of this new realization , I have decided to pick up the books in this series in hardback format . Green Eggs and Ham is one of the wonderful books I remember from my own childhood and I love the book 's rhymes and illustrations . It was one of the Dr. Seuss books that I purchased and read to my children when they were young . We still have those old books but I gave them to my daughters when they moved away from home so they could keep an important piece of their childhood with them . I now get to have the opportunity to buy them again and enjoy reading them to a new generation .
5 #### Dr Seuss is awesome . If for some bizarre reason you do n't know Dr Seuss , do n't worry , Just buy this book for your kid .
5 #### Part of my daughter 's " children 's book theme " baby shower . Made an entree to go along with it .
5 #### My favorite growing up and now my toddler loves it
5 #### I love that I can get the same books we read as children for my boys . Thank you !
5 #### Came in new , great condition and was exactly what was expected !
5 #### Book has been around for so many years . My 8 year old daughter has loved this book since she was little and I read it to her . Good book just like most of Dr. Seuss books . Would recommend this for any kids collection .
5 #### Building my Dr. Seuss collection for the grand kids who LLLLLLOVE his books !
5 #### Great book to read to your children and grands the way I did mine ! ! !
5 #### Perfect for what I want in very decent condition
5 #### I read these books to my baby . It 's so easy to read these cute little stories in a way that a baby will respond to . It 's so much fun to share with him stories / books that I too grew up with !
5 #### A favorite of all times ! Fantastic book with art and story , alike ! Delightful !
2 #### A little bit annoying . One fish two fish is better
5 #### Timeless . Just love it , years back when it was for my children and now for my granddaughter .
5 #### Excellent condition , shipped quickly , all the kids love it !
5 #### My 3 year old grandson loved all of the Dr. Suess Books he received . Got his dad reading them to him very often . By far this is his favorite . He has memorized phrases throughout the book . One can find him reading the book by himself too .
5 #### A classic , we quote the lines , my almost 3 year old and I , whenever something we are n't sure we will like comes up . It 's a great lesson , easy rhyming reading and just plain fun .
5 #### I am glad to be able to share a part of my childhood with my child !
5 #### My granddaughter loves to read ... and at 8 years old this book was perfect ! !
5 #### The ultimate in salesmanship ! Persistence prevails ! He asks alot of questions and qualified the environment in which Sam 's friend might try them , on the potty reading his paper ? No . On a crazy train that lands in the sea ? No . In the dark ? No . Finally he gets the demo in the clients hands , or mouth as it is , and guess what ? Yes ! He loves them ! Thank you Sam I am ! This is the first book I read all the way through by myself and now it 's my daughter 's favorite . I highly recommend the green eggs and ham . Or " sam , sam!"as my daughter would say .
5 #### A childhood classic . If you have kids around it is a must have . Fun book and great lessons about trying new foods .
5 #### Dr. Seuss was the hippest cat a kid could ever know . He gave me hope that I would n't have to grow up to be like my parents .
5 #### Great condition and love that it 's a little bit bigger than what it used to be :) a classic book for little ones and they love it ! Received quickly and efficiently too !
5 #### Mine and my daughters favorite . Easy to read but silly enough to be fun .
5 #### My Delta Kappa Gamma group celebrates Dr. Seuss 's birthday each March . It was a joy to have this new copy of Green Eggs and Ham for party this year !
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham tells you about eating new foods . Kids ages 1 to 10 will love the book . Buy the book and find out what happens .
5 #### The first Dr. Seuss book I remember owning as a kid . I read it over and over . Good message , typical colorful , trippy illustrations and places .
5 #### This is one of my favorite Dr. Seuss classic books , but it seems to be less well - known ! I highly recommend it , especially if you loved&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Oh - The - Places - You - ll - Go / dp/0679805273 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Oh , The Places You 'll Go!</a > . It has a similar message about pushing through hard times and meeting challenges head on ! I love reading it to my children , and was glad to see it was still available .
5 #### A classic ! My son asked for this for Christmas and loves reading it at bedtimes .
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham has always been one of my all time favorite books . My copy was getting worn since it was mine as child . I am a cerfified elementary school teacher that is right now teaching preschool with a great class of three year olds . We were celebrating Dr. Seuss 's birthday and we could not have a celebration without having Green Eggs and Ham . The children absolutely loved the book . They learned the phrases that were repeated and would start repeating them with me . I loved watching them learn thru reading . It is amazing what 3 year olds can learn if you give them the opportunity . The Cd was great as well . I have it playing during play time and they will stop and listen and repeat the parts they know while playing . You know you have a great book when they stop playing to interact with it . I am very pleased I bought this book . I will be able to use it yaear after year .
5 #### What can I say ? Dr. Seuss is always wonderful , and fun to read to , and with , your kids . Great read for Dr. Seuss week !
5 #### I Love this book ! It is one of my favorites from growing up and I was so excited to be able to purchase this again for a baby shower . I obviously had to read it before I wrapped it up and it is still as wonderful as I remember and brought me back to the good old days . I ca n't wait till I have wee ones of my own and purchase again .
4 #### I do n't think I ever read this Dr. Seuss before buying it , it likeit
5 #### I 've been reading Dr Seuss books since I was a small child . Here I am at 29 reading the very same books to my own child , now 5 . She loves them as much as I did ... still do lol They are fun to read , fun to hear and they really bring out a lot of imagination ! Kids love reading and listening to these silly " tongue - twisting " books ! I 'm not alone in my high recommendation ! Green Eggs & Ham I 'd simply delightful :) This book came as a specific request from my 5 yr old girl , who has been awaiting it 's arrival anxiously .... a whole 2 days is like a year to kids lol and today it came ... we opened it and read it immediately ... four times lol These books make kids WANT to read ! & thst , in my opinion , is the best part ! This book was delivered through prime and cost was low . Thumbs up all around , and a must - have for any kids bookcase :) Ps ... 2 pics posted ... 2nd is blurry , but the book is not lol just a bad shot
4 #### The grandson loves this old classic . Long live the books of Dr. Seuss .
5 #### Purshased for my granddaughter this is a classic . Good books never go out of session & this is one of the best for children .
5 #### This is by far my three - year - old 's favorite book ! We read it so much that he has it memorized ! Awesome book ! Love Dr. Seuss !
5 #### Classic children 's book . Great for a child 's 1st book !
5 #### Always a generational favorite . Gifted to a young friend with a " Green Eggs " floor puzzle . He could hardly wait to get to the puzzle , already knowing and loving the book .
5 #### This is a classic ! My kids love this book ! !
5 #### Okay , obviously this is one of the best - known books of all time . And it 's so highly regarded that this review is all but meaningless . If you want it , you 're buying it , and reviews pretty much are n't going to matter . I just want to note that the real brilliance here is not a funny story or great rhythm or fun artwork . It 's the readability . This is an AMAZING book for your young reader to start with . There are only 50 different words in this story , and most of them are introduced with images to serve as context clues . There is a good chance this was the first book you read on your own , and it will likely the first book your child reads on their own . A worthy tradition to keep going for another generation .
5 #### i had trouble too but not with this book go zeus
5 #### My Granddaughter is only 20 months old , but these Dr. Seuss books were the first books I read and the first books that I purchased for my children . Sometimes she likes me to read it to her and sometimes she just likes the feel of flipping the pages because her books from her parents are the thick , cardboard like books . I 'll keep reading and the older she gets , the more I believe she will appreciate it .
5 #### My daughter loves this book ( she 's 23 months ) mostly because there is a train in it and she loves trains . I like the message and she lets me read the whole thing .
5 #### I got a ton of these Dr. Seuss CD Read Along Books for my first grade listening center . My kids really love them since many of my students are already familiar with most of these stories . This seller was better than others .
5 #### I love this book . Great beginning reader for kids . The pop ups are fun for kids . I purchased for my collection on my kindle .
5 #### I love all of the Dr. Seuss books to read to my kids .
5 #### My nephew wanted this book for Christmas . It is such a cute book and a classic !
5 #### This was my favorite Dr. Seuss book as a child and it remains so today . This book with its clever , but simple rhymes makes it the best book to give to friends with children .
5 #### Awesome book . Exactly what we were looking for . My daughter wanted her very own copy . This is the same book that I read as a kid . It is great to get a hardback book for the price of a paperback . Amazon is great . You have to love two - day shipping with Prime .
5 #### He likes the river wahoo and the name Solla Sollew.the book has great rhyming . He thinks all six year old should read it out loud to their parents like he did .
5 #### The classic book for bedtime ! As always , great quality book . Shipped on time
5 #### A classic ! Just like many , I grew up with this and other Dr. Seuss books so I was happy to buy it for my children . My son , now 3 , mentions Sam I Am every time we remind him that he may like something that he 's refused without trying . I 'd say a third of the time he is encouraged to actually try it . He refused eggs from infancy until the week after we started reading this book . As he 's shoveling them down he shouts " I like it ! I like green eggs and ham ! " This was an unexpected outcome of simply wanting to share some of my childhood favorites with my kids . As a mom struggling to get enough protein into my meat - phoebic toddler I could n't be happier !
5 #### A classic and a favorite of mine growing up , now trying to read it to my 3 year old twins , they 're not too receptive to it yet but I think very soon they will be . Definitely go for the hardcover version , just wish the corners were a little less ' sharp , ' we did n't leave the books out when the kids were younger to be safe .
5 #### My new favorite ! A definite must to add to your bookshelf .
5 #### My kids and now my grandkids love this book .
5 #### Who does n't love Dr Seuss ! This is a must have for any child 's library , whether large or small child that is .
5 #### What can I say - this has been a classic since before I was young , and my children love it . I think I may have exceeded 1,000,000 readings of this book , one way or another , and we still all enjoy it :)
5 #### All time favorite and feel that each parent should order and read this book to their children . number 1 pick ..
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham was my favorite book growing up , and it was my daughter 's favorite book , and it is fast becoming my grandsons favorite book . I think that is the best review you could get , so get this book !
5 #### Love this book and am anxious to hear how my Great Granddaughter likes it when she 's old enough to hear it .
5 #### I tutor an adult literacy student whose native language is not English . I bought this book to read to her , and have her read to me , as a tool in understanding rhyming . She enjoyed it so much and laughed the entire time . She had a better understanding of rhyming and loved the book ! Mission accomplished .
5 #### This is a classic in children 's literature . This book was a part of a baby shower for my upcoming grandson ... ham sandwiches with green deviled eggs ! It was perfect !
5 #### Now you got it ! Tell me " neither here nor there ! " You are doing great . Just like this book !
5 #### A classic . If someone did n't give this book five stars they probably hate America .
3 #### My daughter enjoyed this book . She thought it to be funny and one of the most inspiring books she has ever read
5 #### This is the book I always begged my grandmother to read me . Now , it is the book I give to all the new sweet babies in my life . May you always enjoy life 's green eggs and ham !
5 #### Never loses it appeal . The 5 year old is able to read on his own which is a great boost for him .
5 #### LOVE it ! ! ! My daughter who is new at reading is able to practice her reading with this book . We love it ! !
5 #### Who DOESN'T love Green Eggs and Ham ? Heck , even mister Grouch Guy liked Green Eggs and Ham after the story was over ! You do not like them , so you say , try them , try them , and you may ! He would eat them with a goat , he would eat them on a boat ! In the rain , in the dark , on a train , in a car and in a tree , they are so good so good you see ! He would eat them in a box , he would eat them with a fox . He would eat them in a house , with a mouse ! He would eat them here or there , he would eat them ANYWHERE ! He does he does so like green eggs and ham , he does he likes them , thank you thank you , Sam I Am ! Beginning readers love this book for it 's simple words fun story , and silly ( but sneakily educational ) simplistic didactic rhythm of the poem , which helps young readers to learn and remember ( ask yourself why you still remember the words to this book after so many years ! ) . Additionally , it enforces the lesson to TRY something , even if it looks weird , you may like them ! You can not say you do n't like something until you have tried it !
5 #### Great book for new readers , really builds confidence with the repetition .
5 #### I love this book ! I loved it as a child , I read it to my children and now I have the joy of reading it to my granddaughter .
4 #### My son loves this book . Probably his favorite dr Seuss book . It is a bit of a tongue twister though .
5 #### I do not want green eggs and ham , I do not want them , Sam I am ! I can recite this in my sleep , having read it to my kids , nieces , nephews and now , grand 's that enjoy the telling so much they want it read twice .. at least .
5 #### I loved this book as a young girl , so I ordered it for myself as an adult to share with my grandchildren . Excellent illustrations . The story is not only fun it gives great advice for dealing with life 's challenges . Worth every penny !
5 #### One of the greatest books ever for children to learn how to read ! They enjoy hearing it so much that they are anxious to read it for themselves . The zany tale and the easy , rhyming words make it so much easier for them to do so . Read it to my children and grandchildren . Have also given it as gifts many times .
5 #### love this book , me and my daughter who like the cat in the hat is a nag for eating , the book also has some sort of lesson to learn .
5 #### I adore this book ! Any child would love this ! ( Grown ups too ) !
5 #### Another fabulous read by the best preschool children 's author ever .
5 #### This book will always be one of my favorites ! I love reading it on any given day to make me smile . What can I say , I 'm still a kid at heart .
5 #### Super good book for a six year old boy ! We loved it , so much fun to read ! Thank you Dr. Seuss .
5 #### One of the famous Dr. Seuss books is , Green Eggs and Ham . In Green Eggs and Ham , you meet the two main characters . Through this book , Sam tries to get his friend to eat green eggs and ham for the first time . Of course his friend does not want to try new food so Sam tries to change the scenery for which his friend will eat them . The whole book rhymes and is great on teaching rhyme . Read more of my review at : [ ... ]
5 #### I love how brand new the book is and comes with the sticker of authenticity
5 #### Oh yeah ! One of Dr. Seuss 's best . You can really " ham " it up while reading to the young set .
5 #### I got this book for my best friends daughter , and she absolutely loved the book ! Glad to see old classics still being popular !
3 #### Love the book , but purchased for Kindle and the print is too small . Tried increasing font , but for some reason childen's / picture books do n't seem to work the same way . My son is a beginner reader and 12pt is too small . Frustrating .
5 #### Classic book that should be in every kids library ! This is a fun rhyming and rhythmic book . Enjoyable for all !
5 #### How does a mere mortal review anything Dr. Seuss has ever done ? Characters - creative and hysterical , stories - absolutely delightful , different , and rhyming to quirky perfection . Kids are sucked in , completely . Adults will NEVER get bored reading his work to their kids or grandkids . Never . The ideas he had are so completely different , kids want to hear them over and over . His books are a regular on my granddaugher 's nightstand , and at least one is read each night , no matter what else may be read also . Amazon 's price on these hardcovers is awesome too , as usual . We love and will never forget you Dr. Seuss ! Thank you Amazon .
5 #### Got ta love anything Dr. Seuss . I grew up on these and so will all my children . This was my favorite as a child and it is now my sons favorite too . Passing it on to the next generation .
5 #### This is my favorite Dr. Seuss book and I 'm pleased to have such a wonderful copy . Amazon / Kindle did a great job here and I 'm happy they sell it at a reasonable price in order to share the stories with others .
5 #### Like Shakespeare , Dr. Seuss is a must read and useful forever . Who can resist smiling when complaining about something and met with a response of " would you like it in a box ... with a fox ... ? " In all his books Dr. Seuss captures the human condition and makes it delightfully fun to explore .
5 #### Dr. Seuss is always a great book for kids of all ages . He does a great job at expressing rhyming words . These books are extremely durable and a great staple for every child 's library .
1 #### This review is for the KINDLE EDITION only . Do not buy this book digitally . It 's very hard to turn the pages . It caused my kindle paperwhite to slow way down and freeze . Green Eggs and Ham is one of the best children 's books there are . I highly recommend it . But not on a kindle .
5 #### One of my child 's favorite books ever . Now I have it on my iPad Kindle app too !
5 #### Great message and great delivery . Just like you know you 're gon na get from the Dr. He has a genius way of giving deep lessons in an entertaining way with fantastic art .
5 #### I bought this book because one of my 5 year old granddaughters wanted the book . She just loves it when I read it to her .
1 #### Words , which ca n't be enlarged in my Kindle , ca n't be read by my son .
5 #### My all - time favorite Seuss . You 've got to read it ; the last page is just perfect . It 's my family 's motto now .
5 #### A SUESSIAN CLASSIC ! ! ! Oh how I like to review books . I discuss them after taking looks . I discuss them before hanging hooks . I discuss them while hiding in nooks ! What can I say ? Dr Suess just brings out the playful joyous side in me . And is n't that the whole point ? Dr Suess makes books that are fun to read to kids and that kids can easily start to read themselves ! Dr Suess made me love reading as a child and now 30 years later Dr Suess 's magic works on my daughter as she wo n't put these books down . And since my daughter is a picky eater , Green Eggs and Ham has a particularly relevant message ( TRY food before declaring you hate it ) that actually worked once to convince my daughter to try something new . All in all Green Eggs and Ham is a must have for your Dr Suess library . It 's one of his all time best !
5 #### Its wonderful as I remember . My daughter is really enjoying it and reading it over and over again is easy in the kindle
5 #### One of the best beginning reader books ever published
5 #### My 4 year old son is crazy about it ... goes to show how timeless it is .
5 #### Also bought the Spanish version for my grandson . Both books excellent !
5 #### Eggs and Ham :D When I read the title I just had to read it . Very funny :D
5 #### What can I say this is Dr. Seuss ' Green eggs and ham . I bet every child in every country that has access to books knows this one . Dr. Seuss is the best children 's books because it is imagination unleashed . These books are classics and no matter what generation all children and love and enjoy these books .
5 #### A book for all ages because it teaches persistence . When you know something is good , you do n't take no for an answer . Of course , soemtimes persistence gets a little much from a little tyke in a grocery store ! " Mommy , mommy , can I have .... ! Please , PUL - eeze , Daddy ! Just one .... " But that 's life and let 's enjoy it , and share it with the little kids . The rhymes and rhythms in this book are perfect , with flowing word patterns and repetition . A reader can also involve young listeners in a dialogue : " What do you think ? Should the big fellow try the eggs and ham ? Should Sam - I - Am leave him alone , just take no for an answer ? What would you do ? " So it could really be a thinking experience too . But this continues to puzzle me . I know the illustrations picture green eggs AND green ham . But the story ONLY says green eggs , not necessarily the ham part . Green meat of any kind means it is likely spoiled ! Hmmm ... ask : " When should n't you eat green ham ? Or even green eggs ? What would that mean ? " And what if a person is a vegetarian or kosher ? " Are there times when you should just take someone 's no as the final answer ? " Ah , now we 've turned this simple and long - honored book into a lesson in ethics !
5 #### Does this really need a review ? Well here is a short one . I purchased a few of these for my kindle and I read them to my baby in my belly . Once I start reading the baby starts moving around enjoying the sounds of the different rhymes within the book . Love it ! The best of the Dr. Seuss books !
5 #### Dr. Seuss books are always well worth purchasing to pass down from generation to generation .
4 #### Fun book , my 3 year old likes it and we make silly stories from it , like purple eggs and orange ham . :)
5 #### No review is necessary for this classic . I 've had more students become fluent readers with this book than any other .
5 #### My daughters loved this book when they were little . I ordered this to give to my daughter at her baby shower to read to my first grandchild . The book arrived in a timely manner .
5 #### You can not say anything bad about a Dr. Seuss book , they are classics
5 #### Shared with my daughter this classic of childhood , not sure the moral or direction and dissection of the plot . It 's just awesome
5 #### I love Dr. Seuss and I loved this book .
5 #### A must in any home library . Ours disappeared in a move so we had to get a new !
5 #### One of my all time favorite Dr. Suess books . Great for parents to read to little kids , or as an early reader starting maybe age 4 & up . Also great for young English language learners , as the words are short , the rhymes are fun , the repetitive phrases really drill the vocabulary , and the story is so funny that it does n't feel like work .
5 #### What I love best are the facial expressions -- wonderful characterizations ! Also the sense of rollicking fun , with the gentle suggestion not to be afraid to try something new .
5 #### Seriously ? We need to review Green Eggs and Ham ? A classic .
5 #### This was my childhood favorite and my daughter loves it as well . Since buying this book , she had me read it to her the past 3 nights in a row . I wanted to knock it one star for being annoying but that would be an unfair assessment .
5 #### I had this book when I was a kid and now that I have my own , figured he should have a copy too . It 's like magic , immediately became my son 's favorite . All he does is go around the house saying , " I do not like green eggs and ham , SAM I AM ! ! ! ! " at the top of his lungs . 10 stars if I could .
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham is a modern classic book full of fun words and pictures to entertain my 2.5 year old grandson . He enjoys repeating the creative words and phrases , and has even memorized some of the book already ! . The story moves quickly and is accompanied by colorful pictures , which provide great entertainment for story time with grammy . Also , I prefer hardback books like this one for the long lasting value .
5 #### I love this book ! It is as much fun for me to read it to my grandchildren as it is for them to listen to me reading it . Both of my grandchildren LOVE Dr. Seuss books , and this one is definitely a favorite .
1 #### We love 95%of Dr Seuss but this falls into that category of questionable reading for children . I know in the end he discovers he likes green eggs and ham but all the way through the book what your child remembers is " I do not like"-over and over and over .... Reinforcing negativity over and over and over . As an adult it 's annoying to read and I cringe thinking I 'm telling my child over and over that " I do not like " things . We love lots of Dr Seuss but this one has been removed from our library .
5 #### Dr. Seuss .. need I say more ? Helps my grandkid try new foods !
5 #### what is not to love from this old classic ! ! ! constructed like it always has been .
4 #### great price for this classic and it arrived quickly !
5 #### Finally bought a copy for my kid . Could not be happier with condition and price . Thank you !
5 #### This book is an all time favorite . I read this book as a child and I thought that my son would love it . He did and I would recommend it to others .
5 #### I always loved Dr Seuss and now I have the privilege to read them to my kids classic never goes out if style .
5 #### I 'm almost 40 and had never read until tonight because of Read Across America week . Loved it . Highly recommended for kids of all ages .
5 #### My grandkids love it and so does my husband . They all sit together and he reads it out loud with voices . It 's wonderful . The six year old can read it by herself .
3 #### I love this book but it came with mildew on the pages :(
5 #### This is a nightly favorite for our 3yo . A great classic that I 'm happy my daughter enjoys too .
5 #### Fun bedtime story reading for a child . I 'm sure it fills his dreams with fun and whimsy . For mom and dad , fun rhyming tongue twisters to remind you of your own childhood .
5 #### Even as a classic this book is enjoyed by my great granddaughter .
5 #### This book is great , we all know that , right ? My favorite thing about it is that I can bring it up every time my children do n't want to try a new food . Just thinking about the story can sometimes be enough to get them to try something new ( sometimes ) .
5 #### My grandson 's new favorite book . Shipping was fast for Christmas time .
5 #### Who does n't love Dr Seuss ? I have a grown up son - we have this nice thing wherein I purchase 2 of the same childhood books which we shared and read together during his childhood , give one to him for he and his future , and keep one for myself for use when I become a grandmother . we have now decided to run through all of the Dr Seuss books - what a great collection that is going to be - this one was his favorite of this series !
4 #### This had amazing potential to keep the child 's attention , with its snappy rhyme and action throughout . At first glance , it looks like it is encouraging children to refuse to eat their supper . However , in the end , when all the cajoling does n't work , and the psuedo parent , ( Sam I AM ) gives up , does the ( pseudo child ) decide to try it . Moral of the story ? Do n't refuse to eat what your parents give you : Try it , you might like it .
5 #### I bought the Kindle format . My daughter ( 4yrs old ) loves to read this story before bedtime . Simple , fun and funny . :)
5 #### I loved this book as a child and now my children also enjoy it . Timeless classic !
5 #### We were n't looking for anything too incredibly fancy , so the used option was great for us ! We have a 3 year old who just loves Dr. Seuss books , and we know he is going to put some wear and tear on them himself . Why buy new ? Same story , but with less heart ache if it gets scribbled on or torn . Thanks for the book ! :)
5 #### Bought for my 4 year old son who loves books with audio .
5 #### Who does n't like Green Eggs and Ham ? It 's a classic .
5 #### This was always one of my favorites so I wanted to share it with my class . Great purchase .
5 #### I think this book is a good read it is funny how dr Seuss makes everything rhyme when he writes books that children and anyone would like to read .
5 #### Classic Book . Bought this as a replacement for my two year old twins and when this one gets worn out I will repurchase . Fast delivery and in good condition .
4 #### Hard to read on kindle to a three year old
5 #### One of my favorites so I sent it to my grandchildren in the States ! Thank goodness for Amazon !
5 #### This one is my personal favorite from when I was a child and that was a very very long time ago . It was a used book and in very good condition . I was very pleased with the purchase .
4 #### Purchased the e - book for tutoring purposes . I like that I can zoom in on the text and have it with me in one device and not have to carry extras .
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham is one of Dr. Seuss ' exceptional books . We 've had many Grandchildren enjoy this one .
5 #### What can I say , it 's a classic . My son , almost 5 , loves this book as much as I did when I was his age . I love reading it together and seeing him excited to read .
5 #### We love , love , love , this lift - the - flap book . Green Eggs and Ham is a great story . Toddlers love lifting flaps . But this book is even better than that . Many of the flaps are constructed very cleverly so that the flap , when opened , connects with and changes the illustration on the page to further the story . It really is a fun book for both children and adults to read . I highly recommend it for kids ages 18 m - 5y . My only complaint is that the book comes with a sheet of stickers , some of which are meant to be added to the last page . I wish that the last page just had the illustrations and that the stickers were just extra or not included at all . While we placed the stickers in their intended place , some of them have since been torn out so now the flaps are just empty . But , that is a small complaint that should n't stop you from buying this great book .
5 #### I loved this as a kid and now I love it as a parent . Makes reading to my children fun
5 #### Try it and you will see ! So much fun for Brynn and me . Read it now and you will see .
5 #### what can one add about Dr. Seuss books but great for any child
5 #### I loved reading this book to my son and I 'm sure my greatgranddaughter will love it .
5 #### This is a classic . At this price point , I was able to purchase this book for my friends son birthday party . He enjoys the book a lot as I did when I was a kid .
5 #### Giving to my niece and nephew .... I read them the book when they were small and left in my care . I actually made green eggs and ham for them the next morning .... great memory !
5 #### Love this Dr. Seuss book . Great addition to any library .
3 #### I would have given it 5 stars since I love the book but the Kindle could not read it for me and my grand kids so it only gets three stars .
5 #### Our 5 year loves it .... We are using the book as a bed time story , and bring it up the story when he does n't want to eating something during dinner . It opens him up to try new things ....
4 #### Classic Dr. Seuss book teaches kids that they ca n't know if they like a food if they do n't try it . My daughter loves this book and we made green eggs and ham for lunch which she thought was hilarious !
5 #### This has the sight words little one need to start their reading careers . My grandson and I read it together and he was very excited to be able to read on his own .
5 #### Great buy ! ! My baby loves them and is so happy cuz he got movies lol !
5 #### Hay ! did you guys know that Dr. Seuss fight in a war ! You will be green out to green eggs and ham . I love the food it is the great food ever .
5 #### Always good -- so grateful these " old " new things are published ! !
5 #### It is Green Eggs and Ham . Why are you even reading reviews ?
5 #### excellent book , i read it quite often to my 3 year old .
2 #### This book is super annoying to read . It 's so repetitive .
5 #### Great condition , we have been reading it since we receive for our 4 year old , every night .
5 #### This book got into my dreams and made me name my son Sam . That is how much we love it ! ! !
5 #### I love watching my grandson so involved in listening and watching as I read to him
5 #### I read it to my sweetie who had never heard of it ( YES REALLY ! ) talk about one of the best laughs I 've had in ages ! He was so bothered by Sam I am ... ha ha To be fair he was just about to go to bed after a long long LONG day and I made him listen to my Dr. Seuss story , to which his final response : " I do n't believe he 's a real doctor any more than I think Dr. Spock was either " ha haha . Who knew all these years later I 'd have so much fun with one of my favorite children 's books . My dear sweetie is 27 years older than I am so there can be some generational issues that made this so much fun . My point ? Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss is great fun no matter how old you are or whenever you read it ! !
4 #### my grandson loves being able to read this on my kindle
5 #### This has to be the best book to learn how to read from . My kids are having so much fun , that they forget they are reading . Thank you Dr. Seuss
4 #### This book was a bit reminiscent of Alexander and the No Good Very Bad Day where bad days happen , but do n't they happen to all of us ? In this book by Dr. Seuss , the character is having a rough time in his town so when he is enticed by another to find a better land where nothing bad ever happens , he goes on a journey to find the place . The problem is , everything bad that could happen along the way does . When he finally arrives , he realizes that being home is not such a bad thing . He returns , but arms himself against the bad things that may come his way . This book is one of the longer Dr. Seuss books so it may need more than one sitting to finish it . The message is a great one . Bad things can and will happen wherever you are . Instead of running , prepare yourself to stand up against these bad things . This book is full of Dr. Seuss ' standard nonsensical prose and illustrations that make him the wonderful author he is .
5 #### At this moment in time this is my son 's favourite book . We read it at least 3xs a day ... every day . We have got to the point where we know the story of by heart . My name is also Sam , and that rhyme with Ham . This is fact that I have been trying to ignore all my life until now . This is a classic book . There is little more I can say that has not already said in the many other reviews of this book . It is though completely fabulous and a must have book for any child . It is fun , the illustrations superb and the message positive . You should always be open to trying new things , you never know you may like them .
5 #### My granddaughter and I LOVE reading this story together ! We highly recommend it to everyone . Dr. Seuss is the best !
5 #### A great book to read aloud to very little ones as rhymes & repetitions are such fun ! A nine - month - old I gave this book to as a gift is mesmerized by it and sits through an entire reading each and every time .
5 #### This is one of the best Dr. Seuss books out there . Why not try something new ? ! Also great for kids learning to read .
5 #### Product received as advertised would do business with seller again , Thanks
1 #### This is a good example of " negotiating . " The child ( although drawn larger to assert him / herself ) refuses to try a food . Finally after refusing the child takes full control of the situation saying s / he will try the food only after the parent " let 's him be . " This is a great way to teach your children that they can negotiate with their parents . Yes , this may be where they learn that from the Doctor ?
5 #### I would read it in a box and I would read it with a fox !
5 #### It 's Dr. Seuss , my little boy loves it and I do n't mind reading it over and over again to him .
5 #### This is the best sales manual ever written , thank Sam I Am , you taught me that it takes perseverance to succeed .
5 #### I bought this for my great - grandson , the 3rd generation in our family growing up with Dr. Seuss
5 #### The best way to learn to read . My kindergartener can read these by himself :)
5 #### THE CHILDREN AND I LOVE THIS BOOK . READ IT TO MY CHILDREN , GRANDCHILDREN NOW MY GREAT GRANDCHILDREN ..
5 #### for my grandson who will be born later this year --- can nearly recite this from heart from my own children 's days !
5 #### enjoyed the book with family over and over again
5 #### Wonderful book - great for the beginning reader . Kindle version is just as colorful and fun to read as the hard copy , and is priced reasonably .
5 #### once I persuaded him to stop flipping the pages , my 2 - 1/2 year old grandson , who watches too many vapid videos and whiny tv shows , laughed out loud .
4 #### We love this book and its nice to have it on the go for bed time stories
5 #### My 3 year old grandson loves it . It ' just like the hsrd cover , but it has the allure of electronic devices ! Grest tocalm him just after play and priorto nap .
5 #### Timeless classic ! My son is just beginning to read , and he has been picking up the words in this book quickly . I believe this is due to the humorous nature of the book . The fact that it gives him a giggle helps him to remember they words vs. a book that has short dry sentences .
5 #### The rhyming is so well done and makes sense , which is a feat that is difficult to accomplish .
5 #### As a kid I thought Sam - I - Am was the name of the guy refusing the aforementioned discolored breakfast , but now I know , and knowing is half the battle . ( Did they ever tell us what the other half of the battle was ? )
5 #### I read this book to my daughter when she was 2 - 4 yrs and I got this copy to read to my grandson ! Kids love the Seuss alliteration and assonance .
5 #### Reminds me when I was little . Arrived in same condition as described .
5 #### The little one loves it so much that my husband and I pretend to ignore her as she walks back and forth between us with puppy dog eyes waving the book back and forth until one of us succumbs . Usually my husband , the weak sauce that he is . Avoid . Eye . Contact . Do n't read this to your 13 month old until you are prepared for the consequences . The most severe one being that you 'll be saying " I do not like green eggs and ham , I do not like them Sam - I - Am " as you fall asleep , and then have unpleasant green breakfast food filled dreams . You have been warned .
5 #### Classic Dr. Suess - All children should have this in their collection
4 #### A classic the kids continue to love . Ebooks are soo easy on the road . Just wish it was audible as this book is for your children who most likely ca n't read on their own yet and I ca n't read to them and drive at the same time . Audible would get this listing 5 stars .
5 #### My children are adults and I read all of these books to them but I now have nephews and nieces I read this too . A new generation to spread the joy . I have this memorized but the pictures are wonderful .
5 #### Brings back memories of when I was a child and I enjoy reading it to my daughter .
5 #### Bought for our grandchild # 5 . Have bought it for every grandkid . This is a family favorite and hope they carry on the tradition .
5 #### Almost got my son eating eggs . A great way to introduce the concept of " picky eaters " to kids . Yes there are other 's and yes you eventually do try and like the food .
5 #### This classic children 's book is so perfect for gift giving . Baby shower , birthday party , hostess gift for her children , and any time is the right time to gift a copy of this hardcover book . With easy to read rhyme , it is easy to see why Sam is dubious over these green eggs and ham . I mean , would you eat green eggs ? ? I thought not . Pick this up to read with your favorite person . Age does n't matter when you a need a break filled with whimsy .
5 #### I read this to a cerebral palsy child I care for . She loves it and since I 'm reading it to her on my Kindle , she can turn the pages . Thanks
5 #### And I bought it to pass on to the next generation for a couple of baby showers that asked to bring a children 's book
5 #### My children , grandchildren and great - grandchildren love this book . I even ( after all this years ) go around quoting Sam I am .
5 #### All time favorite book . I read it growing up and my child loves it . Shipped quickly and in great shape .
5 #### Great book , excellent message , my kids loved it . They really enjoy the images and the rhymes . They like me to read it with them over and over again .
5 #### I Love Reading The Bible , And Dr. Seuss Book , I Love Reading Them On My Tablet , I Well Tell , And I Will Tell MY Family And Friends .
5 #### This book by Dr. Seuss and has the rhymes that kids would like . However , when I attempted to read it to my 3 year old great grandson , he soon said , " I do n't like this book , " and began looking for something else to do . It may well be that my reading did not portray the sounds that the poetry suggests . Or it may have been that others had already read this book to him , and he was ready to find other things to occupy his time . This is a typical Dr. Seuss work , and I recommend it for young children .
5 #### What can I say , but we " Both " love this book ! ! I wish I could get the " Board " version , as the paper pages will be vulnerable to tearing , but we are happy . Little guy loves the pace and repetitive reciting of the story ! ! A little work for the reader , but fun all the same ! ! In the top 3 out of around 35 books ! !
4 #### I bought this book for several of my great grandchildren as I had gotten them for my own children . They were passed on to all our children . My family enjoyed them and it helped them to learn to read .
5 #### My daughter loves the rhyme and the rhythm of the words . I would recommend it for any child ! Classic book
5 #### The book came in perfect condition and is just how I remember it from when I was a child ! I love all of the Dr. Seuss books , but this is my favorite . I glad my children can now enjoy it also .
5 #### One can simply never have enough Dr. Seuss . I was reminded to get a new copy when I was reading about speech development in babies . It was doctor recommended . I have been buying this book for 25 years and every copy gets loved to death by a new kid or kids .
5 #### This is a classic book all children seem to love . Good ol' Dr Suess just ca n't be beat . Building a collection .
5 #### My kids grew up with Dr. Seuss and I wanted to get some of his books for my grandkids . Like them .
5 #### The rhythm of the story is very soothing to my toddler ! ! ! She really likes the drawings and the animals ! ! I recommend reading this story at bedtime ! ! ! !
5 #### I remember reading this book as a child and loving it . Now that I m an adult with young children of my own , its fun to share something that we have in common . We all enjoy the same book . Its fun , catchy , and most of all , it teaches an important lesson . Do nt knock something until you give it a try . After all , how do you know you do n't like something until you try it at least one time ? This book has a special place in my heart . I encourage anyone with kids to get this book . Whether you read it to them or they read it themselves , it is a book that every child should read growing up . T.S. Charles Author of young adult book , " Consumed . " Available on Amazon .
5 #### My Great - grandbaby loves this book and even asks for it by name . I am so glad to have it on my Kindle Fire and will put other Dr. Seuss books on my Kindle Fire . When she gets old enough she will be able to do it herself . She is only17 months old .
5 #### ham is not kosher because it is ham . would you like green eggs and ham ? i know the eggs are green but what color is the ham ? ? ? is it also green ? ? ? yes it is sam - i - am . fred is my name and pie is my passion .
5 #### Another big hit in our house ! ! My boys love the rhymes of these classic stories and reminds me of my childhood !
5 #### Still as much fun to read now as it was MANY years ago when I was a little girl . Now I 'm enjoying reading it to my granddaughter . What a hoot !
5 #### My daughter specifically requested this for my grandson 's birthday ! Who can not like a Dr. Seuss book ? This is one he will remember all his life . He loves to read and loves to laugh . Dr. Seuss provides both !
5 #### My 3.5 year old loves me reading any / all Dr. Seuss books . The rhythm of his writing is easy to read and add inflection in order to keep my son 's attention and enhance his interaction with the story telling .
5 #### My little sister loved it ! She liked the green eggs and ham and Sam I am . it 's a classic for all ages !
5 #### This is a must - read book from Dr. Seuss aka Theodore Geisel . My ESL tutee will love this book to enhance his confidence and pride in attending kindergarten in late summer . Dr. Seuss rings the bell for young readers . Share the joy of reading .
5 #### Love this one . Get a bat , now my troubles have trouble too ! Would n't think a childrens story would end in that direction . glad it did . My kiddo loves it too
5 #### This is a book that I have always loved . It is a good book for beginners to start reading with , it is funny and the words rhyme and are easy to learn and remember , I am a Cat in the Hat fan .
5 #### I grew up with Dr. Seuss books and I was so excited to see a board book / flap book for little kids . My boys love this book and know all the words already .
1 #### * * Spoiler Alert * * I will give away the ending so stop reading if you do n't want the spoiler . Synopses : a local dealer pressures a buyer into ingesting a strange substance for " free " . During 80 % of the book , the protagonist clearly says " No " , but the substance dealer continues to pressure . In the end the protagonist is defeated , ingests the substance , and shows signs of addiction proclaiming outrageous ways in which he 'll take this new substance . There is no evidence that the antagonist will continue to provide free samples of the substance once the main character is addicted . This is done in rhyme & marketed to children . Many parents view this as a very positive book ( as you can see from the reviews on Amazon ) . This author probably has 3 books in my top ten creepiest books of all time . Like this one , most antagonists exhibit extreme lack of respect of individual boundaries and dismiss the protests and views of others in careless disregard .
5 #### I have been reading this book for thirty years , maybe more , and no one ever tires of it . Dr. Seuss is wonderful , and everything he published before his death is worth reading over and over .
5 #### We just love this book , also bought many others , illustrations & story are fun , it 's definitely a 5 star purchase
5 #### When I was a kid I had the one that came with a cassette ( a what ? ) . It was my favorite book . My dad still had it and he gave it to my daughter . Sadly the cassette was lost to time . Great artwork and story . Very very highly recommended to all Dr. Seuss fans .
5 #### Purchase this for my 6 year old after they learn about this book and made green eggs and ham at daycare .
5 #### I bought this for a gift since all my former books got very old and started falling apart . Hopefully this grand daughter will use it for her children when she gets married .
5 #### What could be better than Green Eggs and Ham ? Green Eggs and Ham with plenty of flaps to open and discover what 's behind them ! The last pages even have stickers you can place under the flaps . A great version of a great classic . Younger children ( 2 - 4 ) will love the flaps , and older children ( 4 - 6 years ) will love the stickers . Everyone loves the story .
5 #### Loved this book as a child so I had to buy it for my children they lived it just as much !
3 #### This book of course has a good message -- be open - minded , be willing to try new things , and do n't make up your mind about things without trying them -- but for me as a child , the most enjoyable thing about reading it was the way the words sounded . They rolled off the tongue and were easy to memorize and recite along with Mom or Dad , and it went on for such a long time with Sam I Am popping up in increasingly absurd places and situations to try to get the protagonist to try green eggs and ham . I was a little annoyed in later years that maybe Sam could n't just take a hint and respect the main character 's opinion -- I mean heck , if he wants to live his life unaware of the glory that is eating green eggs and ham , it 's his right , is n't it?--but considering he did n't really seem to have a reason to NOT try it except for sheer stubbornness , I did n't think this message was problematic . My mother attempted to actually make eggs and ham green for us one time using food coloring , and I think we were kind of grossed out .
5 #### Book came quickly , & in perfect shape . A classic favorite that is a great gift for any young pre - reader you know .
5 #### This book was one of my childhood favorites , so when I had a daughter I knew I had to get her a copy . This book is very entertaining and follows the main character as he nags his friend in trying to try green eggs and ham . Very cute . Highly Recommend .
5 #### I bought this book for my niece , and on the inside of the book I wrote : " I am giving you this book because every little girl should have it . It is great fun to read . " However , this book is not just for little girls or boys ; it is a perfect book for people of all ages .
5 #### My daughter loves to read . You ca nt go wrong with these classic books . She loves this story and most of Dr. Seuss .
5 #### Always a delight to re read this classic , Dr. Seuss is so much more than nursery rhymes . It 's lessons and topics still resonate with me to this day , especially with the little ones .
2 #### I actuaslly ca n't review this , because I never received it ! It never showed up on my Kindle & when I tried to order it again , I was told I had purchased the title . Not a happy customer on this transaction !
5 #### This book is not as much fun to me as " Fox in Socks " due to the very redundant nature of the text . But I recognize that the repetitiousness of it is probably a good thing for teaching kids to understand both spoken and then written words when they are small . The illustrations certainly are fun ... I love the train passengers and engineer all with these calm , happy expressions on their faces page after page as they careen down the fantastically rickety track , fly off the end of the rails , plunge vertically towards the sea , smash into a ship , and drift about in the water .
5 #### This is a great beginners book . My daughter loved it and now I bought it for my grandson . Buy it you wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### love it ! it is timeless . and it is best when read with exaggerated tones which show kids possible reactions like surprise
5 #### Rhyming beautifully , Dr Seuss writes this book in a fun poetic way . One character does n't want to try green eggs and ham , once he does , he likes it . It is a great way to encourage kids to try new things .
5 #### In Green Eggs and Ham Sam I am wants a dog to eat green eggs and ham but the dog does nt want to . Sam I am tries to get the dog to eat green eggs and ham by asking him lots and lots of questions . In the end Sam I am gets the dog to eat green eggs and ham . Read the book to find out if he likes it . My favorite part is when Sam gets the dog to eat green eggs and ham because the dog does nt want Sam I am to bother him anymore . When I read it it makes me laugh so so hard . I think you should read it because it will make laugh so so hard too because Sam I am says do you want to eat it with a fox or with a box and more things too . I like the pictures because the trees look funny . I think kids should read it because it is hilarious .
5 #### This is my absolute FAVORITE Dr. Seuss book . My children grew up with me reading it to them and their classmates at school and now I read it to my grandkids . If you have n't ever read this story you should get it for your young ones as it is a fun read !
5 #### A classic book that I have enjoyed reading as a child and enjoyed having read to me by children . A nice way to get the feel of the English language properly spoken .
5 #### This is a classic ! I really lime being able to read books to my son that were read to me when I was growing up ...
5 #### I have read my daughter green eggs and ham every night before bed since she was two . ( Nearly two years now ) . Tonight I could not find our print version , so I looked to see if it was available for kindle . With some trepidation , I opened the file . Typically , graphics - heavy kids books do not look good on Kindle . Not so for GEAH . It looks totally professional and has a feature where you can double tap the text to enlarge it without ruining the image . Now I want to get the whole Seuss library on my Kindle app !
5 #### We love Dr Suess in this house . My five year old loves reading me this book time and time again .
5 #### So when you take a classic that I love and add lift and look , how can you loose ? Love this one .
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham never gets boring . All the children I 've read it to keep on asking to hear it again and again . Highly recommend it for all children
5 #### She loves this book . She smiles and giggles when I read to her . I 'm glad I have it on my kindle .
5 #### I love reading this book to my son while using my kindle fire . It is the my favorite way to read to him
5 #### This is a gift for my 3 and 5 - year old nephew for Christmas 2013 . They have yet to recieve it , but who does n't LOVE Green Eggs and Ham ? This is a classic book great for any child and/or family to enjoy .
5 #### This is the first book I ever got as a child , at about age 3 or 4 . A few years ago , at my Toastmasters Club , during one of the short impromptu speeches , I surprised myself by quoting about 8 lines from memory , off the top of my head . Knew I had to get it again , so I recently bought if for myself . Just as great as when I was a kid . I love how the pages smell ! Every adult should have this on their bookshelf . :)
5 #### Great quality and bright colors . Purchased for my niece for Christmas . Very nice sized and feels good to hold . Who does n't look classic Dr. Seuss ?
5 #### I have always liked Dr. Seuss ' books and movies while growing up . I order the very nice , clean , undamaged book for my Early Childhood Education Class for a presentation slideshow . Although I changed my major I kept the book and guess what , my grandchildren love this book and Dr. Suess . Amazing . I intend on passing this book down the family line for all to have a funny story book to read to the children in the family for , hopefully , generations to come . The book I bought was used but in excellent condition , and the pages resemble fresh new , clean , and unmarred . Everyone should own a few of the Dr. Seuss ' books in their home .
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham , what more can I say ! Dr. Seuss was brilliant and you can never have too many of his books .
5 #### My now 20 yr old son loved this when he was a child and I got it for my 5 yr old and she loves it as wwell . One of the few books she will want to be read to her or sit and " read " it herself .
5 #### I do not eat green eggs and ham but I love this book . I read it to my children , and now to my grandchildren . They love the rhyming , and I love Dr. Seuss . I would recommend this book for any child , no matter what age .
5 #### A classic book every child should have on their bookshelf . My daughter has always loved this story , and I enjoy reading it .
5 #### This is a fun book we love to read to the grandkids . And it teaches a little bit about the journey not always being easy , keep going .
5 #### One of the best children 's books ever written in my opinion . The artwork and the stories are so much fun .
5 #### This lesser - known work of the good Doctor is just as readable and has just as much zany wordsmithing and art as the rest , but has a somewhat more mature plot .
5 #### This is one of my favorite book from the Dr Seuss collection.and I love reading it to my son.he like it too ..
5 #### This is my absolute favorite Dr Seuss book , and I can not figure out why most people have n't heard of it . A wonderful story with a solid message about finding things to be satisfied with instead of looking for the unattainable , I also find it to be quite quotable in my daily life ( " we NEVER can win with so many Poozers " ) .
5 #### I 'm 58 years old and still love this piece of my childhood . This was one of the first books I remember reading on my own . Good rhyming , fun imagery in both words and pictures . And a good message about trying something you 're not sure about .
5 #### I 'm forced to read it , yes I am . I 'm forced to read it , because I can . My son he loves it , he is a fan . But he ca n't read it , so stuck I am .
5 #### Awesome book ! Can not wait to read it to all of my students year after year for the poetry lesson .
5 #### I have loved Green Eggs and Ham as long as I can remember . We read it to our daughters and now we are reading it to our granddaughters and grandson ( who is , by the way , named Sam ) .
4 #### I ca n't believe that I still love this book . I just read it to my one year old and he enjoyed it so much that I had to read it twice before he went to sleep .
5 #### I love this book and now I can share it with my granddaughter . She loves my kindle , now we can read this classic when we do n't have the hard copy . Great buy to share
5 #### Theodore Geisel , aka , Dr Seuss , was a brilliant man . Not only did he graduate from Dartmouth , but after his death , his family gave the Medical School a very large endowment . It is now known as the Geisel School Of Medicine . Green eggs and ham , may have very well sent many to seek medical advice . I wonder how many of our children remember this book , ' Green Eggs And Ham ' as one of the first books in their memory . The vivid , colorful pictures , the rhyming rhyme of the words . The nonsense of it all hit their funny bones as much as it does for the adults . " I do not like Green Eggs and Ham , I do not like it Sam I am " . How often every day do we hear those words ? Never mind that fool of a Senator who read these books , that almost spoiled my day . But , we must overcome that foolish incident , and move on . I really do like eggs and ham , just not the green ones . The entire set of books by Dr Seuss , is one of the heritages of our lives . Read them all , laugh out loud , have a good time . Highly Recommended . prisrob 10 - 17 - 13
5 #### Of all Dr. Seuss books , this is the most memorable for me , and now my kids love it ( along with all other Dr. Seuss books ) . It 's a classic that children should hear . And with the repetition throughout , it 's a good tool for beginner readers as well . My kids love to finish the sentences for me when I 'm reading . It 's also exciting to see my children trying to sound out the words themselves now .
5 #### My son loves when I read him dr Seuss . He loves the pictures and the rhyming . Reading them to him makes me remember when my mom read them to me
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham is one of those iconic Seuss books that every child should read . Dr. Seuss entertainingly reminds young children that judging food by whether they have eaten it before or by how it looks is not a credible approach . The thing that makes this a great book for young children is that it is a book that they can read with little help from adults but it is one that adults will enjoy sharing with their children . Green Eggs and Ham will be one of those well - worn books that kids will want to read over and over again .
5 #### I LOVE THIS BOOK IT IS A GREAT BOOK AND I THINK MY 3 YEAR COUSIN WOULD LIKE THIS BOOK
5 #### I bought Dr. Suess when my kids were young and hated reading them . They seemed too silly to me in my twenties . What a pompous ass I was at twenty ! I read GEWH to my grandson and discovered the whimsy and fun of the lyrical words . I was a concrete kind of reader . I wanted my characters to be more recognizable . There is nothing in the world like a Dr. Suess book . Imagination takes flight with absurd situations to try something new . I should have " tried it " when I was younger . Given this new type of story a chance . I might have " liked it , Sam - I - Am . " GEAH taught this old grandmother that without testing and reaching , you are missing out on some of the most delicious things in life .
5 #### This was my first favorite book and still ranks way up the list . I would read Green Eggs and Ham again and again . I would read it in a house or with a mouse . I would read it in a box or with a fox . I would read it here or there . I do , I do like Seuss ' Green Eggs and Ham . ... and that is why it is my gift of choice for a baby gift . -jack
5 #### My son gives this book 5 happy stars ! I remember this book from when I was young , now I get to share with my baby
5 #### A timeless classic , beyond any shadow of a doubt . The perfect , perfect book for beginning readers , as outstanding now as it was generations ago . I recommend it to anyone - you ca n't go wrong .
5 #### My granddaughter , Jessica , reads this book every night before bed . She is only in first grade , but she tries hard because this is easily her favorite book .
5 #### I 'm now starting to send Dr Seuss books to my great - grandson . My children , including this great -grandson 's grandmother had these books to read . Oh , how I wish I had kept them and passed them down through the generations . I got this one because of the title , Sam I am , Green Eggs and Ham . We got this book for my son who was a Sam and read it to him many times . He is gone now and so I am starting , who would be his great nephew , his own Green eggs and ham . What a wonderful series of books these are and I 'm looking forward to giving all that I can to my great = grandson . Thank You Dr Seuss
5 #### Of course Green Eggs and Ham is a funny classic , so there is no need to review the story line here . The repetitive words helped my new reader and the condition of the book was pristine . thanks !
5 #### Arguably , no . Green Eggs and Ham is possibly the best children 's book ever . Consisting of a total of 49 different one - syllable words ( and a single two - syllable word -- anywhere ) , Dr. Seuss was able to create the nearly perfect children 's story . Catchy , educational , and even with a subtle moral message ( one that few will protest ) . And here 's the catch : it might be a children 's book , but adults will ( and do ) love it too . If you are considering beginning or adding to a collection of Children 's Books or even just Dr Seuss books , this one is an absolute MUST HAVE .
5 #### The first time I took my brother to the main VA building in downtown Charleston I had my little boy with me . The very kind lady at the Information Desk gave my son a book to read while we were there . It was : Green Eggs and Ham . I 've tried reading a few other Suess books to my son before but they just seemed a bit too long for him . Not so with Green Eggs and Ham . He sat still and listened to the entire story . And so did most of the grizzled veterans that were sitting with us in the waiting room . It turns out that Green Eggs and Ham is my brother 's favorite book ( not just one of his favorites ) . When we finished at the VA I tried to return the book to very kind lady . She would n't take it back and told us it was for my little boy . So now , not only do I love this book , I love the memory associated with it .
5 #### I love Dr. Seuss . I love the illustrations and the stories . This is my favorite book . It is a great story for both children and adults .
5 #### Our daugher loved this book 41 years ago and it has n't changed to please smalll children to this day . Our great grand neice loved it and even asked if she could have gren eggs and ham . No telling what children think or come up with .
5 #### This was the very first book I learned to read and its been a favorite ever since . Your kids will love it .
5 #### I was really obsessed with this book as a child . So far , I think we 've read this one at least thirty times . I am starting to get tired of it since I have to read it so much , but my daughter is now obsessed with it . However , as more books come she gives it a night off every now and then . :) But still , not very often . She only has two others she is as crazy about so far . Go , Dog , Go and Ten Apples up on Top .
5 #### My grandchild was reading this book at the end of kindergarten all by herself .. she so enjoyed it . If you have young ones learning to read it 's a great gift .
5 #### Amazing story , wonderful fun for kids and a good nighttime read for them . A must have for any kid ( or adult who enjoys Dr. Seuss 's brilliant work :) )
5 #### This book is wonderful for every generation I had this book when I was little and now my grand daughter has it ! Who ca nt love the story of Green Eggs and Ham ! Love it ! Very fast delivery too ! Thank you so much !
5 #### Such a good book . Always has been , always will be . I remember reading this story in kindergarten , and my son loves it just as much as I used to !
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Green Eggs and Ham ... especially for little ones who refuse to try new foods ! An excellent beginning reader book with great illustrations , inventive rhymes , and reading repetition for practice . One of my , and my family 's , favorites from when we were learning how to read . Every kid 's ( and adult 's ) home library requires this one .
5 #### Seriously , how could you go wrong with classic Seuss ? Unlike the butchered board books , the hardcovers are just like I remember them .
5 #### I love reading , and this was indeed a great read . Purchased for a great kid in my life & she enjoys it .
5 #### Everyone knows " The Lorax " and " The Grinch . " A lot of people also know " Oh the Places You 'll Go " and " The Butter Battle Book " and maybe a few others . Not every Dr. Seuss book is as good as those are , but to me this one ranks up with them , and yet no one has heard of it . So when I get the chance to recommend a Seuss book this is the one I always reach for .
5 #### A classic Seuss tale . Helps me teach my students about trying new thing before they say they do n't like them . Like Math for instance !
5 #### My son loves this book , loves the flaps and loved putting the stickers on the last page . I have fond memories of this book from my childhood , so it was nice to see a new generation enjoying it too . Unfortunately it did not convince my picky eater to try new foods .. oh well !
5 #### Just what we were looking for to complete our Dr Seuss collection ! So happy with this purchase ! Brand new & perfect !
5 #### As always , Dr. Seuss does n't disappoint . Very enjoyable . Kids of every culture can understand and enjoy it . I do like Green Eggs and Ham .
5 #### I bought this book as an Easter Bunny present for my daughter and she loves it , great condition and perfect for her .
5 #### This is a great book for kids . Great book for parents and grandparents to read . Dr seuss books are classic for children of many ages .
5 #### Dr. Seuss Books are Classic and A Must Read for Kids ! My children read them , my grandchildren read them and now I am buying them for my great grandson ! I love that they have the stuffed character available now for all of the individual books .
5 #### A great but hard to find book that I sought out for my teenage son as a subtle and humorous way to suggest that life may be full of troubles , but the best way to deal with them is by confronting them - not by running from them .
5 #### This book has been read to my children and now is being read to their children , it is lots of fun .
5 #### I remember my dad reading me Dr. Seuss books when I was a kid . Here 's hoping that my kids find as much enjoyment with these as I did .
5 #### Whenever my brother in law 's kids have a sleepover at our house they love to hear me read"Green Eggs and Ham " . And at the end of every page we Chorus on last line"Sam - I - am " . All of us have so much fun . Most of Dr. Suess 's books are like that . Fun for the reader and listener both . You get happy excited vibe coming from kids while reading it . I love most of the books I bought for my kids . And have read it many times to them . This one is my most favorite among all I have .
4 #### Fantastic book for kids ! So imaginative and creative . Easy read that children will find delightful ! Dr. Seuss is always brilliant ! His stories and rhymes are fun and entertaining ! Some of my all time favorites ! ! Such a great way to entertain children and get them interested in reading !
3 #### The book was missing pages and several pages were drawn on . I was hoping for a better book . One that I could read the whole story to my daughter . I was miss led by the description of the book .
5 #### I thought it would be hard to improve upon a Dr. Seuss book , but I was wrong . This book makes the fun , rhyming Green Eggs & Ham interactive for the children , and engages them even more . The small flaps are fun for little fingers to lift . We have the regular book version and this flap book , and both are used equally . Highly recommend Dr. Seuss for children in any book form . Long beloved and remembered from this grandma 's childhood as well . They have certainly stood the test of time .
5 #### Green eggs and ham by Dr. Suess is a rhyming book about Sam trying to convince someone to eat green eggs and ham . Green eggs and ham is the best book .You'll enjoy this book because it 's fun One reason I like green eggs and ham because it 's funny I think it 's funny because in one of the pictures Sam was flying . And a train was stuck in a boat . It made me laugh . Another reason I like green eggs and ham is because it is easy to read .I think it 's easy to read because pictures helps you . Another reason I think it 's easy to read is because words are repeated and once you read a paragraph you memorized it then when you get to the next page you know what it says . So next time you read a book I recommend you read green eggs and ham I recommend it to kindergartiners .
5 #### My 5 year old niece loves Dr. Seuss books and wanted this for Christmas . She already has it memorized ! It was the perfect gift .
5 #### This book is great for beginning readers since there are tons of sight words throughout the story . Its one that kids really enjoy reading over and over again as well . If you are a first time parent I suggest that you add Green Eggs and Ham to your child 's book collection . You will find out why Dr. Seuss is still one of the most celebrated authors of all time . Many American schools celebrate his birthday every year and we do n't even do that for our own president . My daughter 's preschool teacher actually cooked green eggs and ham for her class and the kids loved it almost as much as the book !
5 #### We bought the book for our youngest son . Dr Suess books are great for beginning readers . We bought several others as well .
5 #### After years of quoting from this book to my children I bought it for Christmas this year . This is a great book with a timeless message . We all enjoyed reading it together on Christmas day .
5 #### If you have heard of Dr. Seuss , than you have heard of Green Eggs and Ham . This book is one of the most famous books that Dr. Seuss wrote in his lifetime . It 's a great story of two friends becoming friends after persistence , annoying badgering , begging , and pleading . The clever rhymes of this book and the funny , silly creatures that are encountered should be enjoyed by children and adults alike . I got this book for a steal through an Amazon seller . In addition to the book almost being given to me because it was so cheap , Green Eggs and Ham arrived on my doorstep within a week of purchase , and is in excellent condition . I would recommend this book , the seller , and Amazon to any one in the world that enjoys smiling .
5 #### My Sons Really enjoy it They want to hear the story every night , even as they get older they still listen
5 #### This is a timeless cleverly written story about getting kids to try different foods they think they do n't like . It even reminds us adults as we read it to not just think we do n't like something but to give it a try now and then .
5 #### Could n't wait to get this I had looked at local store and they did not have this classic . Was so glad to get it and read it with my niece !
5 #### hard cover , good quality- quick shipment . classic story for children , excellent read , would suggest for any age ! like like like !
5 #### It is a normal size book that arrived quickly and was well package . No damage to the cover . Will be giving this as a gift ...

[ ... ]
5 #### I used to read this book to my daughter , with great emotion , and good rhythm . She loved it . For a little kid , it 's great . It 's a classic . One of Dr. Seuss ' best .
5 #### There 's nothing bad to say . The rhythm , the sound , the point , the feeling , the drawings , the characters are all amazing . If you want to read to your children this is the perfect choice because you can enjoy reading it too . The rhythms are seriously great which makes it fun to read out loud .
5 #### I read this book as a child , and it was read to me . I was once served green eggs and ham , as a kid ... I read it to my older daughter , with great emotion , and she still remembers that years later . I read it tonight , to my younger daughter . Rhythm catches the subconscious mind much better than prose . This has rhyme , as well . We have forgotten the value of rhyme . In the old days , students would memorize what they learned , in rhyming verse , because rhyme is easier to remember . Twas the night before Christmas ... we have so much visual pollution in our culture , we do n't remember the simple rhyme . This is a fun book , for toddlers , and for adults reading it.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Hop - on - Pop / dp/039480029X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Hop on Pop</a>&nbsp;is also fun .
5 #### I recently purchased this book ( hardcover ) for my 2 year old toddler and he just loves it . It uses simple vocabulary that he has just started using and it rhymes so he knows what to expect and repeat the words with me when reading . It has become one of our favorite books . Surprisingly,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Cat - in - the - Hat / dp/039480001X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Cat in the Hat</a > , another of Dr Seuss books recommended for youngsters , has not been a smash with my boy .
5 #### How many times have parents said that to their kids ? Well , this book proves that it can be good advice . The result of a bet with his publisher over whether he could create a book with a plot with only 50 words , this Dr. Seuss classic finds us following an argument between an unnamed character and Sam - I - Am . Sam wants the other character to try green eggs and ham , and the other character refuses . Sam keeps asking him to try to in new places or with new things , but he always refuses . Will he give in ? What will happen when he does ? Okay , so the limited number of words means the book gets repetitive . Every refusal includes everything that 's been said before . But in true Dr. Seuss fashion , the rhythm and rhymes make it so much fun . I read this book to my niece this weekend , and I was n't ready for it to end . The words are all easy enough that a beginning reader should have no trouble with them , if they do n't already have the book memorized . And Dr. Seuss 's fun illustrations certainly help . They are stylized as always , but they work to convey the story . This is definitely a classic from the pen of Dr. Seuss . It belongs in every kid 's collection .
5 #### We are 4th and 5th grade students . We have Dr. Seuss thoughts in our heads . My group and I like the rhymes ; here 's an example , I would not could not in the rain , not in the dark , not on a train , not in a car not in a tree . I do not like them Sam you see . Not in a house , not in a box , not with a mouse , not with a fox . I will not eat them here or there , I do not like them anywhere . The things that we eat are good if you try them out and you might like it . We do so love the messages because the messages tells us that we should try new things ... eat the things that we think we do not like becuase you might end up liking it . On Dr. Seuss 's birthday , our cafteria served green eggs and ham . I think some of my classmates ate green eggs and ham and they liked it even when they thought they would n't . I like the words he uses because he makes them intereting and easy to read for little kids to learn how to read for school and to get better at reading . The lesson is to try something new and do not judge a book by it 's cover .
5 #### This book is a classic ! And I read it and read it from age 2 - 22 ! It 's a very fun and inspiring book with rhyme , that repeats , but there lies in the fun !
1 #### This book is suitable with adults with its message that " the devil you know is better than the one you do n't know " , but for children it is just scary . The protagonist dreams of a better place , where he does n't get attacked , and on his journey to the mystical place where there are few problems , he runs into more and more problems , some of them being violent , others of abandonment and betrayal and the pictures going with these scenes are scary for children . The ending of the book is not the fulfillment of the dream , but the return to the beginning , to the problems he knows . Maybe from an adult perspective it makes sense to tackle the problems at hand rather than to dream of escape , but children need the mystical place and a happy ending , which this book certainly does n't have . The last picture is one of violence . I usually like Dr. Seuss books , but this book got ruined by the message .
5 #### I love this story ! I bought this for my 16 month old daughter and the stickers and the flaps keep her attention . She loves it and I love reading it to her !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R18RHSGV34668F " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1SogvyInES.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/911WeROV77S.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;this item is under review , but is the book I was sent . this is the 50th Anniversary version .
3 #### I did n't like this book when I was a child . The illustrations were kind of strange , and the text was so repetitive and arbitrary . I bought a copy recently ( now that I 'm an adult ) to give it another chance , and I still ca n't see why it 's so popular . I think there are hundreds of better childrens ' books .
5 #### Dr. Seuss really knew how to entertain children . Give them silly characters , audacious plots , and easy - to - remember rhyme schemes and they 're delighted . The big colorful pictures only heighten the experience . This is one of the books that you as an adult , will memorize -- because they 'll ask you to read it again , and again , and again . As an educator and parent , I can attest to the value of using these books for lessons with phonics . Once they learn the pattern ( consonant - vowel - consonant ) , they form their own words . For example : ' can ' is the basis for ' man ' ; ' pan ' ; ' fan ' , etc . This is education at its best ; enjoyable and fun for both you and your child . The hardback , shiny cover is both durable and eye - catching . The pages are of sufficient weight paper that they will not tear easily . Little hands will be able to hold it , as it is lightweight . The print is quite large ; big enough for little fingers to trace words or letters . I must share a personal note here . A group of friends and I decided to give copies of our own children 's best - loved books to one anothers ' newly - born grandchildren . One of my sons stopped by yesterday as I was wrapping three of the favorites . He actually picked up and read this book . The smile on his face as he turned the pages was priceless .
5 #### In addition to being wildly entertaining , this is one of the greatest " sales " books of all time ! Take a look at the persistence that the main character has in trying to get the other character to try Green Eggs & Ham . Ask your kids what lessons they can come up with from the two characters interacting together !
5 #### This my son 's absolute favorite bedtime book right not . He 's 3 . I actually have my mother 's copy of this book of this book . Three generations have loved this book and it 's still in great condition ! The boardbook was just o - kay , but when I started reading the full hard cover version to him , he really loved it . I fell into the trap that many parents did and bought a ton of the Dr. Suess series books in boardbook form before my son was born , only to realize that the stories are abridged and not as good as the original . The board books were a great introduction for him as an infant , short reads and sturdy , easy to clean . But a lot of the charm of Dr. Suess books is lost in the boardbook version . Many authors offer the whole book in boardbook form , so it took me awhile to realize why the Dr. Suess ones were n't as appealing to me or my son . So with the Dr. Suess books I had to buy all the books again in hardcover so he would have the whole story as a toddler . If I had known this I would have just purchased a few board books , and started collecting the hardcover versions much sooner !
5 #### We just love this book . We can read it over and over and over and over .... well you get the point ! Your kids will love this book !
5 #### I bought this book for my baby . I grew up in Latin America so I 'm not really familiar with Dr. Seuss ' books but it had such good reviews that I went ahead and ordered it ; I could n't be more pleased . At only three months old , my baby daughter is truly captivated by the rhyming sounds . I 've read many books to her but only this one and The Cat in the Hat are able to calm her down .
5 #### Very clever adaptation of a classic . The flaps added interest to the already interesting illustrations . The stickers included might be too old for some of the youngest readers .
5 #### " Green Eggs and Ham " is a timeless Dr. Seuss picture book first published in 1960 . I grew up with this book and have enjoyed sharing it with my kids and grandchildren . Wonderful wacky rhymes and weird whimsical illustrations . Dr. Seuss was a genius . Why do n't you make your kids green eggs and ham and at the same time read this book to them !
5 #### This book is fun and an easy read , and it makes my son laugh . I love to hear him ask for the " haaaaaam " book !
5 #### The Hebrew translation is excellent and idiomatic , and as the reviewer above mentions , the word " ham " is never translated . I had the idea to transform the pictures of ham to lamb . I googled " lamb chop recipes " and carefully cut out and pasted pictures of lamb on top of every picture of green ham . Now I read the book to the children ( when I translate it to English ) as " Green Eggs and Lamb " ! I have made the book kosher ! The children love it , too .
5 #### Numerous American children grew reading Dr. Seuss stories . I grew up reading Dr. Seuss and I have continued the tradition with my children . The Seuss stories are so original that kids always seem to get pulled into the characters ( and the wonderful illustrations ) . I have a feeling that future generations of children will still read Dr. Seuss .
5 #### The book arrived in pristine condition and was delivered before I believed it would arrive . Dr. Seuss books offer a rare form of learning . They include fun ! Green Eggs and Ham is a book most of my nieces and nephews have now and it is one that they still like to have read to them quite a lot .
5 #### My kids loved this book when they were younger . They asked me to read it so many times I memorized most of it . Apparently they did too because sometimes they would " read " it to me ( from memory ) before they knew how to read . They loved the colorful pictures and opening the little flaps to read the text underneath . It 's a short book and very easy to read before bedtime . We bought some of the other Dr Seuss books but none compared to Green Eggs and Ham .
5 #### One of the best children 's book ever written . I am happy it is still available . My girlfirends Grandson adores it .
5 #### This book is fantastic ! It is my favorite Dr. Seuss book and one of my favorite read - aloud books of all time . I have been an elementary teacher for the past ten years and every class I have read it to loves it and my own kids do also . It has colorful and funny illustrations and the words flow like a story - length poem . The moral of the story is basically that the grass is n't always greener , that no matter where you go there will be problems , so just deal with the problems instead of trying to find a problem - free place . It is funny , entertaining and a joy to read for children or adults .
4 #### This is my most favorite Seuss book . It was in fairly good cond ... but mailed in a thin manila envelope , no padding on corners . The corners were bent , otherwise , ok . Patricia
5 #### What child finds it hard to identify with this character ? ! Sam tries to force this foreign - looking concoction over and over and is met with heels digging in deeper and deeper . The sing - song lyrics , the really neat places Sam suggests are finally no match for the character and low and behold HE LIKES GREEN EGGS AND HAM ! This is a great early reader favorite with rhyming words that make it easy to decipher unknown vocabulary . Early readers enjoy the story line as well . I have read this book to so many children I have nearly memorized it . Like some preschool songs , many of the phrases in this book find a place in everyday events . " I do not like green eggs and ham . I do not like them Sam I Am . " But , this book is a keeper !
5 #### The first thing that impressed me about this book is how smoothly the translation captures the rhythm of the original English text , which I know very well . The Hebrew works unbelievably well ; somebody put a great deal of thought into it . The rhymes rarely feel " forced , " and are often quite clever and funny . The second thing that struck me , only after a couple of readings , is that despite the English title , the Hebrew version does not mention what is on the plate AT ALL . This is probably a strategic move , as many Hebrew - speaking children either would n't know what ham was or would be disgusted by it ( and not just by its greenness ! ) . The Hebrew title translates literally to , " I 'm not hungry and I do n't like it . " What " it " is remains a mystery . Luckily , there is still the happy ending to look forward to , when " Sheiv , " the beleaguered central character ( Sam , in English ) , gets to taste the greenish substance and acknowledge that , hey , he may have been a little hungry after all . In any language , with a translation this good , this is a fun book to read , and I 'd highly recommend this to English - speaking families , like ours , who are trying to build up a library of Hebrew translations of familiar stories .
4 #### This is a little odd , even for Seuss . An unidentified thing , our narrator , is having a rough day . He trips , he gets stung ... and every time he looks around to prevent it from happening again , something new shows up on his unwatched side ! Finally he bumps into a man going to Solla Sollew , where they do n't have troubles - or at least , very few . And this starts his whole troublesome trip . He was safer at home ! He finally arrives , exhausted , only to find out that they 've misplaced the key and he ca n't get in , and anyway their troubles in Solla Sollew are just starting thanks to the misplaced key , but there 's an even more PERFECT place down the ways a bit ... Not for our intrepid hero , though . He gets a big stick and goes home , deciding any troubles will have trouble with him first . This last scene may bother some parents because of the implied violence . Me , I 'm busier wondering how he 'll use that stick to intimidate a rock that trips him up . There is n't a very clear moral , if that 's what you go for . Still and all , I like this one .
4 #### The book is probably one of my top 5 children 's stories . I read it countless times when I was little , and I always loved the perfect flowing rhymes , and the mischievous , Sam - I - Am . Now , as an adult , I also greatly appreciate Dr. Suess ' message of not being afraid to try new things , a good lesson that I think any child can benefit from . My daughter likes this book also , and as an added bonus you get a CD . The CD is probably not as good as a parent reading the book aloud , but my daughter seems to like listening to it when I ca n't read it to her . Darien Summers , author of&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Mischievous - Hare / dp/1432746022 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Mischievous Hare</a > , a childrens book .
5 #### I thought this was a very intelligent type of way for young children to learn rhyming words . I like the theme of the book and the way it was put together . It was about how this boss type of character swore up and down how he did n't like green eggs and ham , and how he would n't eat them in certain locations or with certain animals . It 's a very entertaining type of book for children , and that 's coming from experience . I loved dr.suess 's creative kiddy books when I was younger and now watching my little sister develop into a toddler , she seems to love the books too . ! I recommend these books to all youth across the world ! CASHMERE ' FUDGE
3 #### No one can argue against Green Eggs and Ham 's importance in children 's literature , nor question Dr. Seuss ' skill at successfully writing a book with only fifty unique words ( and all but one are monosyllabic ! ) . But you would also be right if you see Sam - I - am 's dogged persistence as an example of peer pressure , even if the end justifies the means . Are we teaching children that " No Means No " only the first dozen times ? So if you want a fun rhyming book to deal with a picky eater , try&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Alfi - Beasti - Don - t - Eat - That - Picture - Puffin / dp/014056909X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Alfi Beasti Do n't Eat That ( Picture Puffin)</a>&nbsp;instead .
4 #### I know the other reviews said that these were not all Dr Seuss books but I was still a little disappointed when I got the package . Luckily , I had want some of the Bernstein Bears books but my husband would not let me buy them , so I was happy to get some of them and he did not complain . My daughter did not care which books we had gotten her she just wanted to play with them all Christmas day , saying , " What 's that " with every turn of the page ! :)
5 #### Who has n't read it . From childhood these treasured books come out once more to be read to our own children . Even for an adult , I find them to be quite entertaining . The story is basically about a persistent , Sam I am , who keeps trying to get his friend to eat green eggs and ham , until one day , his persistence pays off . The moral of the story : you may like it if you try it . Lord bless Scott
5 #### DYLAN WEILER Dr. Seuss is one of the best authors that ever lived and one of his best books is Green Eggs and Ham . Sam I ams little annoying person is trying to get Sam I am to eat green eggs and ham with different animals and different places . This book rhymed a lot which made it cool . It is great for kids . IT kept me interested to see f he actually ate them . Also the pictures were amazing they had a lot of color . This is a great kids book it rhymed a lot . So I think you should read it .
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham is the ultimate Dr. Seuss classic . I have yet to meet a child who has n't fallen in love with the goofy illustrations and rhyming text ! They beg to hear it again and again and soon they can recite it ! Dr. Seuss books are wonderful for learning speech , as the rhyming sounds help a toddler 's brain learn language , and it is an excellent book for pre - reading children . They say a child needs to hear a thousand books read to the child before learning to read , and this should definitely be one of those books . But watch out ... your child may ask to hear Green Eggs and Ham a thousand times !
5 #### Forty years ago my daughter taught herself to read with this book . Its still here and so is she . And of course , so are countless other adults who also learned their primary skills with Dr. Seuss . Hint to librarians everywhere : Kensington Library , in Northern California , makes jello " green eggs " for their annual Seuss festival . ( Shhh ... pass it on ! )
5 #### As is the case with all of his books , this is a book that will delight kids . The rhymes are catchy and the illustrations are wonderful . It is a book that will stimulate your child 's imagination . Just watch out or your children might be asking you for green eggs with ham ! I am sure that Dr. Seuss left an indelible mark on my own imagination . His brand of humor undoubtedly touched my own since I am now the author of an outrageously funny adult novel entitled " The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude . " Green Eggs with Ham is a classic . Even if you 're not a child , it will delight you . Davis Aujourd'hui , author
5 #### My daughter just started reading and this is one of the easier Dr. Seuss books for the beginning reader . I caught her reading it to herself . She got halfway until it got a bit long . The repetitiveness , the simplicity of the words , the rhyming , all work together to help her along . I am always impressed with Dr. Seuss 's ability to turn a small number of words into an engaging story with a moral to boot . 5 stars for Green Eggs and Ham .
5 #### Let me start by saying that yes I know Green eggs and ham is a childrens book . Simple concepts are so important when it comes to any aspect of business whether it is communication , sales or leadership . What can a salesperson learn from Green eggs and ham ? Well go ahead an read how many times Sam I am takes no and does not walk away . This is a short book that could be kept in your car , in a desk drawer or even on the book case . If you are having a bad day pick it up and read it . Laugh then fix your composure then go sell something .
5 #### What a great book . We used green eggs and " Stripples " at our house to eat after Kevin could read " Green Eggs and Ham " He enjoyed it very much . But his Baby Brother Caleb would not touch the stuff ! He felt any thing green could not be edible . What a great book .
5 #### One of the best parts of being a Baby Boomer is that we grew up with a seemingly endless supply of Dr. Seuss books . Some were message books , some are literary wonders but I believe this book really is the doctor at his most subtle witty best . Although all Seuss books are a joy to read aloud , this one is especially good ( the list of injuries in an early fall the hero takes still comes easily to my memory ) and it gets the point across that one can not successfully avoid trouble without the preachy sentiment in the Lorax . I must have read the book hundreds of times before the sentiment finally soaked into my silly brain but the philosophy has been a guiding light ever since . I was lucky enough to meet the good doctor once , at a reception in San Diego . I was so overwhelmed by the circumstance , I could hardly speak coherently , much less make conversation . Although I forgot almost every other word in the English language ( including my name ) I did manage to blurt out " Solla Sollew was my favorite book in grade school ! " I certainly did not create an admirable impression that day . But the doctor did and his book still does . Read it , enjoy it and take it to heart .
5 #### My Daughter loves this book it is 1 of 2 books she reads every night . I loved Green Eggs and Ham as a child and still laugh when I read it with her .
5 #### The tale of a picky eater this goofy book has a sing song - y sound , bright art and an a sense of over the top that kids love .
2 #### I love the book Green Eggs and Ham . I bought the BOARD BOOK for my 2 year old to enjoy . With all of the flaps it was not sturdy enough and within 24 hours the book was ripped to shreads from opening and closing the flaps . He loved the book . I do n't think he was exceptionally rough . Due to his lack of fine motor skills he worked the flaps and caused the rips . We have no other board books that were ripped to shreds from normal use . Board books are for toddlers not preschoolers that have a concept of books .
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham is always a favorite for all ages . It brings back wonderful fun reading times . Love the Ca that is included .
4 #### We all know this book , no need for me to re - iterate the plot . What makes it work , though , is that Dr. Seuss understood the importance of breaking the rules - something many of his imitators never grasp . He did n't stick to a rhyme scheme or a meter all the time , he varied it and dropped it when needed . That makes his books readable instead of mind - numbing - even when you 're reading them for the 1000th time straight :)
5 #### Green Eggs and Ham By Dr. Seuss Green Eggs and Ham " I will not eat green eggs and ham , I will not eat them , Sam - I - am " . I remember my younger sister learning to read , with Green Eggs and Ham . My four children have learned to read with Green Eggs and Ham . And now , a new generation of my family , my grandchildren are reading Green Eggs and Ham . It has been a family tradition , when a child can read this book on their own ; we celebrate by making green eggs and ham for dinner . We have eaten them in a box , we have eaten them with a fox , ( well maybe not a fox ) . We only make the scrambled eggs green , not the ham .

5 #### As a mom of a 24 and an 8 year old ( I know . . . big surprise ) I am firmly of the opinion that Dr. Seuss is the greatest American philosopher ! In this book he urges us to try things that we may be afraid of or even repelled by . Many folks think this book applies only to food but I think he is urging us to be more brave in all avenues of life . We need to listen to those around us urging us expand our horizons . I believe that if we go for it and ' take a bite of the egg and ham ' then we too will say " Thank you , thank you Sam - I - am . "
5 #### This is a great book . I bought this book because my husband enjoyed this book when he was a child . He still enjoys this book today and reads it to our 6 year old son . The lesson we learned from this book is there are always some problems no matter where you go . I highly recommend this book because it 's fun to read , educational , and it never gets old .
5 #### we all know the story . When I got this book I got to experience it in a whole new way ! The babies in my class loved the fact that there were flaps we had to lift to find parts of the story . Get this book !
5 #### My dad was , is , and will always be a huge Dr. Seuss fan . He read this , as well as all the other Seuss classics , to me as a child . I had a devil of a time finding it a few years ago ; had to special order it . It has an honored place on my bookshelf . It taught me two valuable lessons : 1 ) Tackle your problems instead of running away from them , and 2 ) The grass is not necessarily greener on the other side . Those two bits of knowledge have stuck with me for many years and led me through many challenging times . Thank you , Dr. Seuss !
5 #### I bought this and a few other Dr Seuss books for my son 's 2nd birthday and this one is by far his favorite ( though he also likes ' The Foot Book ' and ' One Fish , Two Fish ... ' ) . I credit this book with improving my son 's vocabulary quite a bit . His pronunciation of common words in this book such as train , mouse , like , etc ... has improved greatly . He enjoys to read along and point to the characters as I read about them in the story . I imagine this would be a good book for kids just learning to read as well , since the words are short and the sentences have a simple structure to them . Additionally , the story is easy enough for a youngster to follow but also fun for adults to read ... which is nice since my son wants me to read it 7 or 8 times a day .
5 #### Got this to replace the tattered copy we were using . This book was always a favorite of mine and continues to be so even now when we read it with our son . New books are great , but you can never go wrong introducing your children to the classics , especially when they rhyme . And maybe even your kids will learn the lesson that trying new food is ok , but probably they will just like that the book is so silly .
1 #### This book has too many small flaps and is annoying . Buy the regular version , not this one with several tiny flaps on each page , which you have to open to read the text .
5 #### A great book . Perhaps it 's a little repetitive for those of us who have read it 15 times to our children , but at its heart this is an uplifting , joyful book . Try it - you 'll like it !
5 #### What can I say , Dr Seuss is popular for a good reason . These are fun for all ages . The rhyming , the cute stories , the good morals . These books make reading for homework fun .
4 #### Dr Seuss is most definitely responsible for putting a lot of people off their dinner , and also for encouraging the experimentation with food coloring in a whole range of normal foodstuffs that probably did not need spectrum alteration in the first place . What a devious , sneaky and subversive publication .
5 #### This book is great for all ages . This book is great for children who are just learning to read and who need help with rhyming . The book is small enough that a child can hold it themselves and do n't have to worry about harming the book or dropping it .
5 #### I just started reading this to my almost 18mo old girl . It gets very wordy and repetetive , and I thought she did n't like it because she kept wanting to skip over the pages that had over 5 lines of print , but she does really love it so much that if I put it down and pick up another book , she howls and throws a temper tantrum .
5 #### Whenever my children were not feeling well , I would bring out " Green Eggs and Ham " to read over and over and over ... I was very ill and each of my 3 children took turns reading this same story to me . I hope this book lives on forever ! Amazondotcom has the BEST deals on TOP quality items !
5 #### The green eggs and ham You Must read ! Green eggs and ham because is good for your brain to get smart . Then you will get really smart . You should read this Book !
5 #### Although I could not recall the text of the book , I remembered the book fondly from my childhood . Recently purchasing and reading to my toddler son helped me remember why . Timeless classic . My great grandchildren will surely love as well .
4 #### My friend purchased this book and uses it to urge her 4 year old to try new food . I purchased it and my 3 year old loves it . It is now part of our nightly reading routine .
5 #### Much has been written about how Green Eggs and Ham is about leaving our comfort zone to try new things , and how it 's like an allegory of telemarketeers changing their tactics in order to sell their products . However , I would like to mention the amazing thing about how Dr. Seuss only used 50 words for this book . Seuss has come up with a hilarious story with his rhymed silliness , but this story allows us to see how the negations get compounded as this cumulative story progresses , no matter how many settings Sam - I - am persuades his client to eat his plate of green eggs and ham . This is truly an exhilarating book that should count as one of Seuss 's masterpieces .
5 #### I know my 6 - month - old does not understand this book , but he laughs and wriggles when we bring it out . It 's a little long for him right now , but he does seem to listen and looks at the pictures . This was one of my favorites growing up , so it was one of the first I bought while I was pregnant . It 's as wonderful now as it was then !
5 #### This is my two year old son 's favorite book . He throws this on my lap about 10 times a day . Its perfect for nightime reading . Not to long or too short . The Dr. seuss books are a great way to introduce grammer as well , A must have for any childrens library .
4 #### One of the first books I got to read and it 's a rollicking one . A favorite to read along with for both parent and child .
5 #### My son loves this book and the lift - and - look flaps are nice addition . You ca n't go wrong with this book .
5 #### This book lasts through the generations . I loved it and now my son does ! A great lesson about judging new foods before you try them .
5 #### So now you 're an adult . Or think you are . Your New Age " wisdom " books , CDs , etc . , that you 've accumulated - throw them away . Right now ! You 've been to the mountain and back , confronted your inner demons , your inner child , your inner wild man ( or woman , or both ) . Look , you do n't need to meditate on a mountaintop or see an analyst to " get it . " Go back to basics . From the child - like Sam - I - Am you will learn perseverance , creativity , and humor . The flop - eared , grown - up grouch in the tall hat will teach you trust , the courage to try new things , the ability to look beyond appearances , humility , gratitude , and the joy of simple , nourishing food . This is a book to be savored , to be read aloud in the company of children and friends . Go ahead : laugh , cry . Make it a part of you . Try out new voices . Imagine what might " go " with green eggs & ham : A pint of Guinness ? Black - eyed peas ? Tomato aspic ? A dish of Rocky Road ? Buy 10 copies and give them to your friends . Your enemies , too . Spread the joy of a wonderful classic .
5 #### This book lets you learn 28 vowel - spellings using 60 vocabulary words .
5 #### If you read this book once , you know the story . So why do you , and your kid , read it over , and over , and over ? It is hypnotic . It is entertaining . The art is ... interesting ! . The poetic nature of the text is soothing and charming . You can use vocal variety as you read it . Your son or daughter anticipates that next phrase , that next page . These facors interact and ... make a classic . Interestingly , I 've seen a comic opera ( a " bouffe " ) version of Green Eggs and Ham . You KNOW how it is going to end . Yet it is STILL entertaining ! Ah , there is a magic formula here , repeated in many ( but not all ) of Dr. Seuss ' books , that force a smile over a frown , and make a rainy day sunny . First published in 1960 , I would anticipate this book being on shelves in 2060 and beyond . " I DO like them , Sam I am ! "
5 #### I absolutely love Dr. Seuss , and this book is one that I only first read later in life . I absolutely love it - a story about travelling to the perfect place and when you get there , realizing that the place you really wanted to be was where you came from in the first place . Very very good - I highly recommend it .
5 #### Adults and children alike can so relate to the little hero of " I Had Trouble Getting to Solla Sollew " : many readers will have had moments of wanting to travel to a kind of paradise like " the city of Solla Sollew / On the banks of the beautiful River Wah - hoo " ; many readers will relate to the beautiful illustration of the little creature dreaming that he was " sleeping on billowy billows / Of soft silk and satin marshmallow - stuffed pillows . " Readers will feel for the struggle fo this protagnoist , a classically illustrated Dr. Seuss creature , who longs to escape his troubles . In the end , this creature is able to resist the temptation to enter into further escape , declining the offer of the Doorman of Solla Sollew to seek out the city of " Boola Boo Ball / On the banks of the beautiful River Woo - Wall / Where they never have troubles ! No troubles at all ! " Instead , our hero turns to face his trials and tribulations , and readers admire and respect him for this . Escaping is a wonderful dream , and Dr. Seuss captures this with his vivid illustrations of the outskirts of the city of Solla Sollew . Yet facing one 's hardships is courageous , and Dr. Seuss delivers this message beautifully .
5 #### Our granddaughter received this as a Christmas gift . Even though at 27 months she does not yet read by herself , she does like to have stories read to her . Since receiving this book , she has requested it be read to her at least twice a day . The pictures are simple , but colorful and entertaining . Rhyming verses make it fun . Dr. Seuss has written many wonderful books and Green Eggs and Ham is one of the best .
5 #### After THE CAT IN THE HAT , GREEN EGGS AND HAM may be the best - known , best - loved book by Dr. Seuss , and with good reason . Even the youngest of children will understand the basic concept : the unnamed main character simply does NOT want to try green eggs and ham , not here , not there , not now , not later , not in a car , not in a tree ... well , you get the idea . As usual , Seuss 's rhyming is delightfully silly and sure to leave kids and adults alike with big smiles on their faces . The simple vocabulary used makes it an excellent book for beginning readers to read on their own , but the book is also ideal for parents and children to read together . Highly recommended !
5 #### I treasure this book . Ca n't even begin to approximate how many times I have read it . This is perhaps the most fun book to read aloud of all books . As with the majority of my generation , I grew up on Dr. Seuss ... There is no doubt that he was a great inspiration to me and that his work helped to fuel my passion for writing empowering children 's books . Green Eggs and Ham is such a classic because it incorporates some of the most brilliant of his illustrative work , with timeless characters . Once you have read it aloud , the cadence with which this book is written stays deep within your soul and raises its memory head whenever someone emulates it . It is a rhythm that Dr. Seuss was the master of ... and it surely affected me . This is where my inspiration from Seuss came to pass ... packing such an important message for children into a vibrantly imaginative world of characters and scenery is where Seuss set the benchmark for my generation to strive . Come meet Sam I am ... and set the tone for all children 's tales to follow . This book is timeless and it is my hopes that it will never go away !

5 #### This was my mother 's favorite book to read to us . And quote to us in order to get us to try her new dinner recipes . I am over 50 now and I hope to use this to get the children that visit to try some different foods .
4 #### So we know who Sam is , but what is the other fellow 's name ? My 1 1/2 year old wants to know . Other than that , this is a must have and a classic of course . My son loves it .
5 #### Not only does this book make a good case for trying new foods ( a big plus right off the bat ) , it does so in the inimitable rhyme of Dr. Seuss . What more can be said ? This is a classic among classics , truly the good Dr. at his best . So , I will read it in a boat And I will read it with a goat And on a plane and on a train And in the dark and in the rain I will read it here and there Yes , I will read it everywhere !
5 #### I remember reading this when I was very little . Such a humerous tale .
5 #### As a child I loved Dr. Seuss ' books because they were so silly and loony . Nothing quite like them has ever come along since . Take the opening of this classic , " Green Eggs and Ham . " A fellow introduces himself by telling us his name is Sam . Out of the blue , another character inquites whether he likes green eggs and ham . This leap is the purest kind of hard - edged absurdity ; nowadays if you tried to sell a children 's editor or agent on this kind of thing , they would ask for more context , inquire who these characters are and what is their relationship , and why does this fellow want the other to try this food so much , and why green eggs , and blah blah blah instead of just admiring the fact , as most small kids will , that this thing is beyond zany and funny as hell ! ! ! Sure , it has an ostensible lesson about trying new foods , but it 's also such a playful piece of nutcase fun that it will stand forever as a simple rhyming reader classic .
5 #### The good doctor is most certainly laughing at the many " interpretations " of this book . After reading Madhaus 's review I could only think that he must never have read the Occultic interpretation involving the Ego , Vedic texts , the Chakras , and all that jazz . Or the more practical insistence that the book is an instruction book for sales people in being persistent with reluctant customers . It 's a kid 's book , OK ? My 3 - year - old son likes the book and my father - in - law loves reading it to him . In his interpretation , Sam 's " customer " is stubborn and angry almost to the point of violence which seems to keep my son 's attention extremely well . Supposedly , this story is the product of a friendly bet between Geisel and Bennett Cerf that he could not write an entire book using only 50 words . True or not , this anecdote is much more interesting to me than some of the constructions of deep , hidden meanings with which our enlightened friends continue to plague and belabor us .
5 #### If you have young children , take them to the book store and go to the children 's section . Peruse through the latest offerings . Pick the ones that look interesting and then start reading aloud to your children . It becomes clear quickly why works by Dr. Seuss is still popular after all these years . It 's a tribute to his genius that so many writers tried to imitate his works but none has succeeded . Dr. Seuss continues the tradition of Mother Goose , with the catchy , often non - sensical rhymes that are joy to read aloud and sticks in your mind . Most children 's books are not designed to read out aloud , and young toddlers quickly lose interest . Combined with the whimsical and creative illustrations , my little sons love his books as much as I did when I was a child . The simple rhymes of this book allowed by 2 - year old to actually memorize some passages and read along with me aloud . So ... If you have n't read ' Green Eggs and Ham ' , Try them , Try them , and You will Say , I do ! I like them , Sam - I - am !
5 #### To be honest , if you have n't read " Green Eggs and Ham " yet , you 're truly missing out . This is a timeless classic and one both parent and child will enjoy . It 's a " must have " in your early learning library . Dr. Seuss creatively uses repetition and silly circumstances to help children learn to read . Tidbit : " In 1960 Bennett Cerf bet Geisel $ 50 that he could n't write an entire book using only fifty words . The result was Green Eggs and Ham . " The simple fact that you are considering this book and reading this review is testimonial to your willingness to take an active part in your child 's development . There is no more noble cause and we at GoKidsGrow LLC salute you . All the best to you and yours .
5 #### At an age well over 30 , I still remembered this book fondly from my childhood . I bought it for my goddaughter when she was 3 and she loved to have me read it to her time and again . She is 4 now and has memorized the book and " reads " the right words that go with each page . As memorization is a child 's first step in learning to read , I have no doubt that she will actually be learning to recognize the written words in no time . As another reviewer said , 5 stars is too little for this wonderful book .
5 #### This Dr. Seuss classic story is underappareciated by readers young and old . The verse is creative and enchanting , and reminiscent of that old stand - by , " There 's a Wocket In My Pocket " , with its fantastical inventions . Not to mention , this particular story teaches a valuable lesson about how " the grass is always greener on the other side " . If you 're a Seuss fan and have n't checked this one out yet , give it a try .
5 #### This is very well written and unlike some children 's books has a valuable lesson . Learning to appreciate different foods means learning about different cultures and becoming more well rounded . A well rounded diet is also the key to long life . Too much chicken and beef is not only unhealthy but hurts the environment . The first time I tried anchovies , I could n't wait to take them off the pizza . Later on , I fell in love with anchovies . Now I order pizza with nothing but anchovies ! I even leave off the cheese ! Some people even suggested I join AA but my anchovy addiction goes far beyond rehabilitation ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### " Green Eggs & Ham " is my favorite book by Dr. Seuss . I have even read it in Spanish , though my Spanish is VERY weak , it was fun to read . I have read this book so many times that I have it memorized . It is great when little kids want me to read the book because I get all excited during the reading and will make funny faces when Sam I Am offers green eggs and ham . This book is a classic and just plain fun to read . To add to the " Green Eggs & Ham " fun , try making green eggs for breakfast .
5 #### I have been a BIG Dr Seuss fan for the past 40 years , and I have a confession : this one is even better than his more famous THE CAT IN THE HAT . ( So why is this only 27,000 on the list and the more famous book in the top 10 ? Go buy tens of copies of THIS book for all your children , nephews , nieces , grandkids , godchildren and get those ratings changed .... ) It is to me even cleverer than its famous companion , and gets children interested in not just reading but language as well - my wife , another old Seuss fan , got her love of language and puns from books like this and your children will too . OK , let them read THE CAT IN THE HAT , but then make sure that they enjoy this one too and see if they do n't actually enjoy it more . Christopher Catherwood , 40 years a Dr Seuss fan and author of CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE
5 #### I have always loved " Green Eggs and Ham " along with the rest of the Dr Suess books and it 's great to see it back on the best - seller list . If you havn't read it , rush out and buy a copy now - and buy the Cat in the Hat and The Cat in the Hat comes Back at the same time ! Come on , Christmas is just around the corner , and reading this to kids , or to oneself is a treat !
5 #### I loved this book as a child , I love this book as a parent . It 's a very good one for beginning readers , because most of the words are easy - to - read in terms of phonics . With just a few phonics rules , most kids can master this book pretty quickly . As for the subject of the book , it 's brilliant . Every child can relate to the topic of being afraid of a new food that looks weird . It 's so imaginative ... really , a wild enough story to satisfy any child .
5 #### As a child , someone read this book to me only once , and I looked for it ever afterward . It seemed more magical , somehow , than all the other Doctor Sues books . In college , I stumbled across it again and bought it . Its still one of my favoritesa great pick - me - up if you 're feeling beat , definitely good for college students . The story is about a fellow who has troubles and so goes looking for the beautiful city of Solla Sollew , on the banks of the beautiful river wha - hoo , where they never have troubles , at least very few ! Well , as you can imagine , he has a terrible time getting to Solla Sollewflood ands wars and wild beastsand when he finally gets there , he discovers that the advantages of Solla Sollew have been somewhat exaggerated . He ends up going back home with a new attitude . The story is n't any different than many similar stories , but the rhymes are particularly lyrical , the artwork particularly funny . I pull it out every few months and read it , and I laugh every time .
5 #### I am now a parent with a child . Of course I have purchased Dr , Seuss books for my child , including this one . I ended up reading this book so much to my child , I have memorized the entire book and can recite it upon demand . My child is older now and has moved onto other readings . He still reads Green Eggs and Ham when he thinks no one is watching . I now have a little skit I perform for small children of friends . The moral of the book try new things . Sam keeps to get his new friend to try green eggs and ham with more ridiculous ways of eating them as the story progresses . The book is both colorfull , fun and ca n't miss with both children and adults . Dr. Seuss wrote a learn to read book that is fun to read . This is his genious . Teach children a difficult task by making it fun and thus they want to do it . If you want to put a smile upon a shy child 's face , ask them if they would like to try green eggs and ham in a house or with a mouse . highly recommended .
4 #### This was my absolute favorite Suess book when I was little . It always seemed to me to be larger in every way than the other Seuss books , and in fact my copy ( which I have carefully preserved almost 40 years now ) was indeed physically larger in size . The format of a quest was as appealing to me as a youngster as it is to all of us in its many more mature formats . Like all Seuss books , it is a little wierd and twisted - I am not always sure that is a good thing , but I loved the alliteration of phrases like " the perilous poozers of pomplemoose pass " . As many have noted , the plot of a character facing his troubles in stead of searching for greener pastures was clearly evident to me as a 4 year old . I learned from this book that there are key slapping slippards everywhere , and that troubles that seem large at first can be faced with determination and preparation . The illustrations to me seem more detailed than most Seuss fare , with greater variety of strange characters and settings .
5 #### Get this book for your kids - they will love you for it ! Although you may end up hating it they 'll have you reading it so much . :-) It was my absolute favorite book growing up , and my dad still knows every word by heart ( so do I ) , and still groans loudly when I mention it . He was very good at reading it out loud , though , I think it is easy to do with this book . All the cool sounds and the rhyming and the patterns in the words were one of the things that turned me on to reading as a kid and showed me just how fun it could be .
5 #### " Green Eggs and Ham " ... is there any doubt that it 's a five star book ? This is one of Dr. Seuss 's many classics and a favorite of children and adults generation after generation . Definitely pick it up and add it to your collection .
5 #### One of the finest children 's books ever written . I enjoyed this story so much , that I passed it on to my kids . I do n't remember if I read this as a kid . I do remember having this read to me in 9th grade in Journalism class for our semster final . Kind of a wierd semster final right . Well , it proved to be an interesting day . I remember enjoying this book , and loving everything that the main character said . Dr. Seuss was quite a genuis for coming with imaginative ways to tell a story and make a point .
5 #### Good for kids of all ages . This book really does n't have a moral to it , but it 's a terrific read . Kids would enjoy the rhymes and the fun of reading . Great for beginners getting into longer , but easy books . Dr. Seuss writes great books for kids and is a favorite among adults . If you have never read this story , it 's about this character that does n't want to eat green eggs and ham , he wo n't eat them anywhere . Towards the end he eats some green eggs and ham and he 'll eat them everywhere . I own many of the Dr. Seuss books and still enjoy reading each and everyone of them .
5 #### Dr. Seuss books were my favorites growing up and now they are favorites of my two children . Of all the Seuss books , Green Eggs and Ham is one of the best . My three year old son has memorized much of the book and thinks that it is just hilarious . My five year old is learning to read and this is a great beginning reader book . To top it all off , this is one book that I do n't mind reading for the 100th time !
4 #### GREEN EGGS AND HAM is a wonderful read - aloud book . The language is simple and marvelous and simply marvelous . It sings and lilts . Someone should set it to music . This was one of the first books my four - year - old daughter could read by herself . I loved listening to her read it , which she did with great expression and emphasis . Twice I saw and heard Jesse Jackson read this book on Saturday Night Live . He did it splendidly . I wish I had recorded it . How did anyone ever entice Jackson onto the show just to read GREEN EGGS AND HAM ? The book also has a lesson to teach : Do n't knock it if you have n't tried it . In the main , this is a good lesson to learn , but some things should n't be tried : smoking , drinking , other drugs , and worse .
5 #### ... I will read this anywhere . Now , the very thought of eating something like green eggs or green ham makes me nervous ... food poisoning and all ... But in Seussland green food does n't mean food that has turned . This is a classic children 's tale ( and the only children 's book that has made my list of best books ever ) that teaches children about keeping an open mind ( and not just with food , this lesson extends to people and other activities ) . It 's well written , and the rhyme and repition not only makes the book fun to read , but also helps in memorization ( yes , your children will be able to recite it along with you ) . The drawings are typical for Seuss , fun and whimsy . It 's a great book for anyone at any age .
5 #### The narrator of the story and lead character is a small furry bear like creature , who leads a happy go lucky existence in the Valley of Vung . This all changes when he is attacked by a host of rather nasty creatures - a very fresh Green Headed Quiligan Quail , a Skritz and a Skrink . Naturally when a chap on a one - wheel wubble offers him a trip to the promised utopia of Solla Sollew ` where they have no troubles , at least very few . ' Unfortunately the journey to Solla Sollew is fraught with difficulties and dangers , and when our friend reaches Solla Sollew , he discovers that the one little problem that Solla Sollew has , makes the city inaccessible . Eventually he comes to the realization that problems need to be faced and can not be run away from . We need to re - examine our thought patterns . A great motivational book , for both children and adults . It was one of my childhood favourites . Dr Seuss ' books always bring back great memories.<P ...
5 #### You can not have more fun teaching your kids to read than by using this book . Because of the repetitive nature of the words it gives them great practice in " total word " recognition , so that when they learn to put the word together , then they quickly learn to recognise it at speed . As for the story - does n't everyone know it by now ? It teaches kids to try food before saying they do n't like it !
5 #### This is a terrific book for kids . They love the story . It 's easy to memorize , and funny , like all Seuss books . What I like best about this one is that it has a great message that is really easy for children to understand . I have used it to convince children to try something new that they were convinced they would hate , be it a food or an activity . The pictures are terrific , too ! Anyone under the age of 6 will love this book , although it 's terrific for the 3 - 5 year range .
5 #### I grew up with Dr Suess books so I could n't wait to share them with my own children . The books are illustrated simply , the text is easy to read and creatively laid out and the silly rhymes make me and my children laugh . What I 've noticed from reading them Dr Suess books ( they are 1 and 2.5 years ) that it has really helped my 2.5 year old with increasing her vocabularly , saying words properly and recognising sounds that a letter or group of letters make . A wonderful series of books to read aloud to your children .
5 #### I think everyone has heard about this great little book . Most children are picky about their food and do n't like trying new ones , so it makes it easy for children to relate too . And the thought of green eggs and ham makes it funny too . It 's one of my favorite books to read to my child . I consider it a classic children 's book .
5 #### Echoing other reviewers , this book deserves more than 5 stars ... my wife and I started reading this and other Seuss books to our children from 6 months on . Always a delight , the kids would laugh at the silliness and cultivate a zest for life at the same time . We starting a great habit of reading two or three Seuss books before bed , and the kids loved them . My wife , an elementary ed teacher , taught me the technic of starting a sentence and letting the kids finish it . I would begin with , " That Sam - I - Am , that Sam - I - Am , I do not like that ... " and our kids would respond in delight with , " Sam - I - Am . " Soon we progressed to just flipping the pages , and the kids would tell the story ! Of course , they had the book memorized , but generating an interest in reading is the first step to learning how to read . Every kid should experience this timeless classic while growing up . Parents will enjoy reading it almost as much as children will enjoy hearing Seuss 's whacky rhymes . Combine it with other fun Seuss books , and your kids will sit enthralled as you turn the pages . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is the longest book I have been able to read to my daughter ( currently 6 months ) that she has sat through . She makes it through " Go Dog . Go " , and several others , but they are n't as long . I am going to guess that the sound of words rhyming so well has an engaging effect even on the very young . This book is undoubtedly a wonderful one for first readers ( and it was in the collection of my two teens when they were young ) but what I 'd really like to impress upon the readers of this review is that this they should n't hesitate to give as a gift or get this book for the very young . It is fun to read for an adult ( I 've been through it dozens of times ) and therefore more likely to be read a lot and even little ones can hear the rhymes even if they do n't know the words . A really really highly strong recommendation .
5 #### Quite possibly one of the most popular children 's books of all time , this story revolves around Sam - I - Am unrelenting attempts to get the grown - up in the story to sample some green eggs and ham . Sam - I - Am presents the meal in several different ways ( in a box , with a fox , on a train , in the rain ) but his cantankerous friend still refuses to eat the peculiar dish . In the end , Sam - I - Am 's determination pays off , prompting his pal to take a bite . The old sourpuss ends up liking green eggs and ham . This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up and I still enjoy reading it to this day . It has timeless appeal , something that you do n't see in a lot of children 's literature nowadays . Dr. Seuss ' trademark rhymes , his colorful illustrations , and his creative cast of characters all combine to make an unforgettable classic . It 's a book for all ages to enjoy . This book has a very simple yet important message : Do n't be afraid to try new things . That can be incorporated into classrooms at just about every level . It can be used to teach kindergartners and first graders to eat their vegetables and it can also be used to teach older students not to be afraid to stand up to one of life 's many challenges . Aside from that , this book could also be used to teach students about poetry and rhyming .
5 #### What can you say about a classic ? Well part of the joy is rediscovering this fun book as an adult , too . In fact , I 've takend this book with friends to nights out at bars , and every time as we start to read it aloud and pass it around ( a good sobriety test too ) others come over and join in . It 's true . In the end everyone loves Green Eggs and Ham .
5 #### What can I add to all the other reviews ? If you do n't read your child GREEN EGGS AND HAM , she will be an uneducated laughingstock , shunned by her peers and ignorant in the ways of her people . Read her GREEN EGGS AND HAM today !
5 #### We 've all read this book , and still whenever I have read this to a group of small children , I feel as if I am enjoying as much as they are . From the pictures to the text , there 's nothing like a good Seuss book , and that this one is .
4 #### The flap and sticker version of this classic Seuss tale is a bit different from the original ( much of the repetition so necessary for beginning readers has been editted or deleted ) . However the FLAPS are a really fun way to get toddlers involved in the action of reading the book - my two year old LOVES it . The STICKERs on the other hand are confusing - only the mouse , fox , and goat have obvious places and ALL on the LAST PAGE . Other stickers do n't appear to go in the book at all . Just put in those stickers and make it a FLAP book - it 's a GREAT FLAP BOOK !
5 #### This is one of the most famous of all kids ' books , and rightly so . In Dr. Seuss 's classic story , Sam tries mightily to persuade his friend to eat some green eggs and ham . His entreaties , followed by the progressively longer refusals are accompanied by whimsical bright drawings against simple backgrounds . One can only say that it is " Seussian . " Whether the denouement will help your kids eat formerly suspicious foods is debatable , but it will probably increase their hunger for more fun reading . A great book for the beginning reader as well !
5 #### . There 's nothing to compare with Dr Suess . After 40 years he still tops the best selling lists . " Green Eggs and Ham " is without doubt one of his best . What is it that makes this book so much fun ? The repetition of the question and the unchanging answer at first could be seen to be very annoying . But it 's the subtle changes , the relentless pleading and the inventive possibilities that intrigue us . Most children and their parents could learn a few tricks in persuasiveness from this book . .
5 #### Read on a Train ... I will read it in a plane ....
5 #### As a child my mom would read Green Eggs and Ham to me when I would n't eat my spinach or my broccoli or my lima beans or whatever it was that I was n't eating . The book explained to me that you do n't know if you like something until you try it . I still have the copy of the book that my mom gave me and I still enjoy opening it up to read the wonderful rhymes of Sam I am and his stuggle with where he wo n't eat Green Eggs and Ham . This is my favorite Dr. Seuss book and I do n't think there are too many people out there that would disagree with me .
5 #### My daughter and I enjoy reading Sam . I remember hiding this book in a " safe " place in the library when I was still in grade school so that I can read it again and again . I particularly like the illustrations and the wordings . In fact , the rhyming gets to you head after a while until you memorize the whole book ! Weird yet funny ! Recommended for kids 2 to 92 !
5 #### This is a true classic . Sam I am is the master of the hard sell . He goes to the greatest lengths to persuade the other character to eat a plate of green eggs and ham . All the rhymes are hysterical . I recommend this book for everybody .
5 #### back in college when i re - discovered the wonders of dr . seuss , this was the book that got me in trouble with my prof for my outrageous suggestion that dr . seuss was one of the finest writers of 20th century america . now that may not seem * so * radical an idea in 2000 , but back in 1975 it was sacrilege ! one of his lesser known books , it is one that has always given me courage to go on in the face of the worst moments . if akin to any other of his books , it would be that penultimate masterpiece " oh the places you 'll go " , but truthfully i prefer " solla sollew " . a great book for kids and grownups .
5 #### This book is a Classic . I never thought that one day I would sit and read this book to my children , but that day has come . My 5 year old knows this book by heart . He can not actually read the words , yet , everyday after school he picks it out from amongst his books to read it to me . I find that endearing . I know that if you have children , Dr. Seuss is a must ! The rhyming lyrics are smooth and musical to the ear and children find " Sam " a riot . This is a great book to be read to children , or for children to read themselves !
5 #### ( If I could rate it twice , it would have ten stars . ) The un - named hero of the story has so many troubles he does n't know what to do , so , on the advice of a passerby , decides to make the trip to Solla Sollew , where they never have troubles ( at least , very few ! ) So begins an odyssey which , after more adventures than you 'll find in any other Seuss , teaches the lesson that it 's better to face troubles than to run away . This book captivated me on my 5th birthday ( the year it was first published ) and is still my favorite . The plot is more complete and complex than any other Seuss , and the moral is as valuable today as when I first read it . A side benefit is the striking use of color ; the Dr. used a more subtle color scheme in Solla Sollew and it enhances the realism of the story . This , as much as any other , is essential Seuss .
5 #### Other reviewers have pointed out that this book teaches useful life lessons , and it does . But it also contains some excellent quotable couplets which can be very useful in family life . Next time you 're supervising the kids at some strenuous chore , try quoting : " This is called teamwork . I furnish the brains ; You furnish the muscles , the aches and the pains ! " ( You 'll know your kids have absorbed the book when they answer : " ... but I 've bought a big bat . I 'm all ready , you see , Now my troubles are going to have troubles with ME ! " )
4 #### While the story here is n't anything overly amazing ( a surprise birthday party ) I simply love all the illustrations ! We get to see how the different creatures / families in Brambly Hedge prepare for the birthday ( and they are all so cute and sweet and thoughtful ) and I loved pouring over all the various houses and rooms and how they fit into the different shaped trees , etc . So beautiful and so enchanting for those of us who love " little things fitting into the world " . The story is sweet , too ( I like that everyone in the town works together ) , but it 's definitely the illustrations that won me over !
5 #### This classic book is always a favorite with the kids ( and adults too ) . Jill Barklem never fails to satisfy .
5 #### My [ ... ] loves this book . You can have so much fun with it as the book builds from a little bug sneezing to a out of control circus parade . The rhymes are well - done . Good for all ages .
5 #### Why this was published under a pen name , I 'll never understand . In my opinion , it 's one of Dr. Seuss ' best books . The rhyme is easy to remember for toddlers , the images are bright and fun , the book about the little bug 's sneeze and the major consequences thereafter is a brilliant encapsulation of chaos theory and the beautifully illustrates the fact that a small event can trigger larger , unforeseen events . Once we discovered this book , it became a nightly read . Highly recommended .
5 #### This book is adorable , and sneaks in a little lesson along with the fun . Ordered this copy , a beautiful edition , to replace an older one given to a kindergarden teacher for her classroom .
5 #### When my two now - grown daughters were young , they received this book as a gift from a relative . It became their all time favorite children 's book . My older daughter has now been reading it to her children for years and now I am getting ready to purchase a copy for my younger daughter who is expecting her first child and has specifically requested " Because a Little Bug Went Ka - choo " . It is an adorable book and we never get tired of reading it . And it really does teach an important lesson that even small acts can have big consequences . I highly recommend it to all parents .
5 #### This is a book for children that has some universal lessons for adults , also . Without a child ( or a parent ) knowing it , they are subtly and pleasantly introduced to the concept of the interconnectedness of life , and the effect that ones actions can have upon others . This message is not hammered home , but is quietly and humorously expounded by the very talented author . I have considered using this book in college classes for discussions of karma , and also for discussions on personal responsibility .
5 #### We got this book for our children and they loved it . It is an excellent book .
5 #### This was one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books ! The story shows the chain of events one little incident can have . I also told my students about the importance of bugs and how they effect the world . Really fun book ! My kinder students loved it .
5 #### Out of his first books as a toddler , this was my son 's favorite . He is now a grown man with a family of his own , but he still remembers the times when my wife and I read this story to him with enthusiasm and play acting . That is why we like to pass a copy of it along as baby shower gifts when possible . It is a simple story with a big message , even the small things that we do or that happen around us can have big consequences .
5 #### This book is adorable ! I wish I was reading this book when I was a kid . Super fun and creative . I 'm gon na love reading this to my son !
5 #### I 'm 40 and this book was a gift from my aunt when I was little , so I bought it for my niece when she was under 2 , hoping it will be a favorite of hers . Never mind the fact she has tons of books !
5 #### SO cute - it 's a great story about " cause and effect . " Bought it for a family member whose child is nicknamed " Bug , " so it got lots of smiles .
5 #### It was so fun reading it to my Grandbabies and watching their eyes light up at what was happening next ! ! !
5 #### I used to read this story to my nephew , 30 + years ago , and bought this one to read to his son . It is such a fun little story .
5 #### favorite book as a child .... had to return it to my library
5 #### This was my sons favorite book when he was little and now I just bought it for my new grandson ! A classic but great book !
5 #### This has to be the funniest book I ever read to a child . I laughed so hard , I had to stop reading till I got myself under control . I read it at a friend 's home . Then , I had to buy a copy for my own grandchildren .
5 #### This was one of our 2 children 's favorite story books . I read it over and over and I never got tired of repeating the story night after night . Now I have the pleasure of reading to our grandchildren with the same joy and delight . It 's fun and lyrical . A family favorite for 2 generations !
5 #### great cause and effect book . My fourth graders loved it !
5 #### One of my very favorite books ever . A favorite in this house .
5 #### Because a little bug went Ka - CHOO , laughter will ensue ! The cause and effect situations are clever and get more outrageous as the story moves on . The pictures are true Doctor Seuss and the characters get into all sorts of scrapes with delightful detail . I recommend this book , it is fun as well as providing a great reading experience . And who can resist the word because , especially when it starts with a little bug !
5 #### Once again , Clarence Larkin does n't have a lot of books available that he has been the author of ( inspired Biblical writer ) - no Christian library is complete without his works .
3 #### I usually really like Clarence Larkin 's work and sometimes read it over and over , but not likely to read this book a second time .
5 #### This book details step by step of events according to the Bibile . This book will remove any doubt anyone has about the coming for the Lord Jesus Christ .
5 #### great book , clarence larkin does a wonderful job with this book . if you want to learn about the second coming this is the book .
5 #### This is a wonderful book but these sellers are taking advantage oof the authors reputation , you can go too larken 's web site at www larkinestate com and purchase this exact same book for 3 dollars and some change . Either way buy the book it is a great book as all his work is .
5 #### This is a great first book in Industrial Engineering . It clearly explains the Industrial Engineering concept of unintended consequences . Its one of my favorites to read to my kids .
5 #### Super fun book and a favorite of my two - year old . It 's a really cute way to introduce the concept of unanticipated consequences .
5 #### I have always loved this story and gave it as a gift for a baby shower . It arrived on time and in good condition
5 #### i found an old copy of this book in my son 's bedroom . I wanted to give new copies to my grandchildren . I was so happy to find this book new for a great price !
5 #### Yes , it is all true and Clariance Larkin has done a beautiful job with his charts and he uses the Bible referances to write the book . If you are searching for truth in a world of ' Anything Goes ' this book is for you . This wonderful little book is backed up all the way with the Bible and only the Bible . I have many of Larkin 's other works , and they are all great ... soul saving ... and life changing !
4 #### If you do n't want to " dive " in to the works of Larkin right away , this is an economic opportunity to sample some of his charts and theology . Contains many of the same charts found in Dispensational Truth . A classic .
5 #### This book was one of my kids favorite books . I often had to read it several times each night . It was read so much that the first one wore out and had to be replaced . Now that I am a grandparent I have bought copies for my kids to read to their kids .
5 #### If I could give this book 100 I would . When my kids were little they loved this book . Now I am watching a 2 1/2 year old and the only book he wants to read is " Ka - choo " . Before we even start to read it he is already telling me what it says . If you do n't have this book for your kids or grandkids get it . You wo n't be disappointed .
4 #### This book provides the same thrill as watching a Rube Goldberg machine in action -- or seeing a million dominoes falling consecutively from the push of a tiny finger . Starting with the sneeze of a little bug , a chain of events takes place that ends in a chaotic parade . The realization that each action is causing something progressively larger builds excitement for the satisfying conclusion ( which shows , though does n't state , that small actions can have big consequences ) . I wonder : How many millions of kids will get to hear this exhilerating story because a loving parent with a soft voice read it to their little kid a long , long time ago ?
5 #### I 'm 42 years old and do n't know how I never heard of this book ! My friend has a 1 yr old and I was browsing through the kids ' books at Border 's today and came across this one copy on display up at the very tippy top of a huge rack(not sure how a kid 's supposed to see that high up but oh well ! ) I flipped through it and just had to have it . Unfortunately I ca n't find this one in board book form which is about the only binding that can survive this kiddo ! But I did have to buy a copy for my personal collection and ordered one to give him later when he 's old enough to not rip all the pages out . It 's SO cute . I 've been lucky enough to find several books that are interesting / cute enough to be read repetitively(just in case I end up babysitting down the road and ' have ' to read to him ! )
5 #### A little bug sneezes and each consequence leads to a bigger one creating in the end total chaos in town , and all because a little bug went ka - choo ! This book is a fun way of introducing the idea that even our smallest actions can have important consequences . The story is funny , and the rhymes are catchy . The book is by Dr. Seuss under another pseudonym , what else could we expect from the good doctor but a hilarious story that children will love ? ? ?
5 #### I love this book and so does my toddler . We have read it many , many times and immensely enjoy both the story and the illustrations . I do n't mind reading it over and over because I feel like I see some new detail in the illustration that I did n't see the first 50 times we read it together . It 's a delight for anyone reading it .
4 #### The consequences were far reaching and wide ranging when one little bug sneezed - just what happens , it ripples out and are quite fun . The illustrations are rich and warm , soft curves and good colours with lots going on in each to maintain interest in repeated readings of it . This has beautiful rhythm to it and is easy for children to get predictive about , learning to anticipate and the value of language , and rhythm . As an adult I get a bit bored with it - it is quite fun but not for repeated readings , but it is high on the reading request list at home so it gets read repeatedly at the moment .
2 #### The places of interest are numbered on a map in each chapter , and the place name appears by the number in a tiny box . These numbers are not cross - referenced in the text , the referenced place name is only marked by bold face . One has to read and count the bold faces text occurrences until finding the one looking for , or prepare for the trip by writing the numbers at the line end of each occurrence of the place . Or search through the index !
5 #### This guide is best used ahead of time , to prepare for the next days tour of the section of Rome you wish to see , as the detail and historical background for the walk are more than you can use on the spot for the first time . It is the antithesis of a simple pictorial guide , in its depth and appeal to the intellectual or historian wishing to savor the richness of the sights . I have enjoyed using it to tour galleries to get background information about the art works , and find the degree of detail appealing to flesh in the details of what can otherwise be a flood of visual information , and give the day some structure .
4 #### This book is extremely interesting , well - written , and detailed . A good one to have in the hotel room and read at the end of the day ( especially if you have someone to read some of the passages to , it is such good writing , ) preparing for the next day 's sight - seeing . However , it is too heavy and detailed to carry around with you and refer to during the day , unless you and your partner are willing to share the toting , and one carries this book and the other carries everything else !
5 #### As a repeat visitor to Rome and owner of countless guide books to Rome , , , I was delighted to receive this updated version of Masson's"Companion Guide to Rome " . This book is not easy , , , and must be digested slowly ... Having said that , , it is chock full of details , history , back ground information that is lacking in other guide books .... There are no hotel / restaurant recommendations in this book ... but instead a series of walks , though all parts of the city ( and beyond ) ... Additional guide books to consider adding to this are Michelin Green Guide to Rome , Terroir Guide to Food in Rome and Rick Steve 's Rome ... which all offer food and lodging recommnedations In previous visits to Rome,,,I felt that I was missing out ... i.e. I would pass a ruin or monument and could not locate any information in my guide books .... Thankfully Masson and Fort cover most all of the various sights . Even if you do not take the outlined walks , this book is valuable .. For example , I was near to Capitoline Hill , , , so I referenced this location , using handy index and found all sorts of nearby sights .... This books provided the information about the " unveiling " at the Gesu Church , ( daily ) ... and this is truly one of the great sights in Rome ... This is " The Guide Book " to Rome .. Arawakoff
5 #### Back in the 70 's my parents lived in Rome for several years and to this day my mother swears by this ' guide ' . It 's not exactly portable but according to her it is the most in depth book ( ( ( ever ) ) ) published on Rome . It says a lot coming from an Italian Art & History lover and bibliophile .
5 #### I used this book extensively when we lived in Rome in the late 1970s . It is for the person who has some time to wander around Rome , not necessarily hitting the major tourist sites . I 'm replacing my copy before my next visit - the old one has literally fallen apart with use .
5 #### Do n't go to Rome without ( Unless you have a private guide ) . This book made my visits to the Forum , Vatican , Coliseum , Museums and numerous public fountains and sculptures 100x more enjoyable by adding a much deeper layer of understanding . Wonderful .
3 #### I bought A Companion Guide to Rome by Masson based on 5 - star recommendations from Amazon , and for me it was not a worthwhile purchase . The authors ( it has been revised several times ) offer infinite detail and historical tid bits , but it actually offers little that was n't already in the Green Guide , and it is too heavy and too much reading in my opinion to do on site , while walking around . It was a nice reference , but I should have looked for it in the library and just borrowed it .
5 #### Thus book remains a great achievement of travel writing , head and shoulders about other " walking " travel guides . The walks are thoughtfully designed to comprehensively cover the city ; Georgina Masson 's writing is cultured , individual and excellent , and the book is chock full of interesting background detail to bring the city alive . Rome is a unique and fascinating place and she definitely gets it ! Wore out one copy of this book ( earlier edition purchased in ' 78 ) and am now working on the second , unfortunately much heavier edition , also not the current one . Not a book for the short - stay or casual visitor who just wants to hit the top sites , but if you want to do some in depth exploration , a tremendous resource ( definitely a read ahead resource ) . Buy this book while you can - its gone out of print a couple of times so far !
5 #### Even at 20 years old , I still love Seuss . The silly word play always made me laugh , and I always figured the good Dr. was sending us messages on more levels than we could comprehend . The first time I picked this book up I was expecting a clever , bouncy , colorful edition of seuss , however , it just scared me . The message is very clear , and very startling . Maybe it is a good book for children to read , after all , they are the future . But then again , Suess only wrote 30 % of his material throughout his carreer for children . I really love this book .
5 #### Dr. Seuss , always teaching us great lessons through imaginary worlds and silly rhymes . Do yourself a favor and get every book he wrote !
5 #### Not sure how I never read this Dr. Suess book until I bought it for my son . It is a funny , ridiculously silly story , as most of Suess ' books are . It also teaches a great lesson about tolerance of others ' differences .
5 #### I 'm an expert at reading Dr. Seuss . I 've been reading his books to my daughters for the past 18 years . This book is FANTASTIC . This is my new favorite . We were laughing half the time because it 's quite funny . If your a Seuss fan , you need this book .
5 #### Love Theo books ! ! Use this book for Social Skills class to teach about discrimination .
3 #### This Dr. Seuss book is not one that I can read to my students . The whole " wall and others " is too sensitive a topic right now .
5 #### We love all the books that dr seuss puts out They are fun to read and the kids like reading them too
5 #### Really , it 's my 3 - 1/2 year old grandson who loves it and asks to have it read to him over and over again . Interesting ending that has provoked a fair amount of discussion with him ... Who does win ? Does anyone ? Is there such a thing as really winning in this situation ?
4 #### Strange book . I do n't know whether Dr. Seuss meant it to be an anti - war parable or a warning parable about the necessity to maintain vigilance and a strong defense capability . I guess it depends on whether you are a Liberal or a Conservative . Whichever way you lean , this odd little story will support your belief , whether it be " peace through weakness " or " peace through strength . " I wo n't say which lesson I draw from the book -- to me it 's clear , but you should read it yourself .
5 #### Fav book of all time I ca n't tell you how deep and meaningful this story is . Just read it !
5 #### We love this book ! It 's a classic for teaching differences .
5 #### My son loves to read Dr. Suess books to his daughters
5 #### I love Dr. Seuss . What else can I tell you ? This one is as classic as all his others .
5 #### You just ca n't go wrong with a Dr. Seuss book , and this is one I had actually never read before . Definitely recommend !
5 #### I grew up loving this book and now my kids can read it too .
1 #### Sometimes there is a real right and a real wrong , but even without getting into a political debate about the genuine evilness of communism and how it was that the USA so fortunately won the Cold War , I do not care for this book on other levels as well . Basically this book was not even written for kids ... it was written for adults or maybe just for the author himself . Small kids are not going to know what the tiny pill - like bombs at the end represent , and if the book did give them any inkling of that it would be entirely inappropriate for small kids . Also the story runs in a sort of a loop that was handled so clumsily that I as an adult was confused by it .
5 #### Building my Dr. Seuss collection for the grand kids who LLLLLLOVE his books !
4 #### The butter battle book by Dr. Seuss Two different families and each one butters their bread differently . Rhyming silly children 's book that uses your imagination . received this book from National Library Service for my BARD ( Braille Audio Reading Device ) .
5 #### My father bought me this book the year it came out . I believe I was 4 or 5 . He used the book to teach me to accept other 's differences because anger and hatred lead to the destruction of everyone on both sides . The message has stuck with me into adulthood . The book ends with readers not knowing what happened next which opens up discussion " What do you think happens next ? " " What can be done to fix this ? "
5 #### After reading this book religiously when I was a child I wanted my children to have the same memories . Dr. Seuss never disappoints . Perfect quality of the book itself was icing on the cake when the Amazon box came to our door .
4 #### The words were OK , just a few stumbles , the pictures were WONDERFUL the weapons were hilarious , the uniforms were full of shiny . But why did one side all wear blue and one side all wore orange ?
5 #### Just like all Dr. Seuss 's books , it was fun .
2 #### This book may be a fable of the Cold War , but it 's literary antecedent can be found in a work published 290 years ago . In the fourth chapter of Gulliver 's sojourn to Lilliput , he is told about a terrible war between two factions . One group breaks eggs at the wide end to eat them , and thosr who break eggs at the narrow end have become their mortal enemies . I am not accusing the late great Dr. Seuss of plagiarism , but admire how he transformed Swift ' s material .
5 #### this was my favorite Dr. Seuss book , when i was young . I loved the artwork . I remember asking my mom about the ending and I remember her saying something like , " well , they got over it ... but what about the jelly , duh duh duhhh . " The whole story is made ridiculous and exaggerated to the point that even a child could understand that no one would do something so stupid over something so small . fallowing that logic we can apply it to our daily lives and tolerate when someone is n't a fan of our favorite sports team / band / movie / actor/ ... , not to mention the big things like politics and religion .
5 #### My favorite Dr. Seuss book , regarding mutually assured destruction .
4 #### Collected it in preparation to costuming Seussical at local HS this Spring
5 #### Very under - appreciated Dr. Seuss book . I love the story and history behind the story . Great lessons to teach a child .
5 #### Grew up on them , my kid will too . Great books .
5 #### Great book for kids & it does a great job of showing cold war hostilities during the arms race .
5 #### seus he was a great one so are his books
5 #### Great book . I used it as a sermon illustration concerning the need for peace . Great pictures , bold colors .
5 #### Oh , how can you not love a good Seuss ? If you liked Sneetches or Yertle , this will be up your alley . Interesting kind of social commentary , but with the awesome inventiveness of Seuss . It 's a little violent- talking about blowing each other up and stuff ... it is a book about battle , after all . But I think it 's valuable . It 's a pretty long story for Seuss . Maybe stick to others for preschool aged children based on reference to violence and length , but you 'll know what 's right for your family . And if you are just looking for another Seuss to add to your collection ? Do it .
5 #### Well that escalated quickly . I had no idea Dr. Seuss was so dark and creepy . This apocalyptic nightmare scared me . I think I 'll read the Stand for the third time just to wash the bad taste out of my soul .
5 #### I use many of his books for my guidance lessons in elementary school .
4 #### The book arrived and I was excited because it was a gift . However , the edges were all bent . The pages inside were fine but the outside corner edges were wrinkled and bent . Either it was like that when it was shipped out orbit was really beat up during the mailing process , not sure which .
5 #### Dr. Seuss satirizes the Cold War , but it really is a great story to discuss acceptance with children .
5 #### This book is amazing . Great message , great delivery . The people who have reviewed this saying that the message is for adults do n't seem to understand how you teach values to children . No child would read this and be concerned about what a deep message was in it . But the deep message that it does deliver can help to show children early how war is not the answer .
5 #### Most people know Dr Seuss for his light - hearted children 's books . Fewer people know that he wrote highly political commentaries into some of his children stories . The Butter Battle Book is a commentary on the Cold War , though it could be applicable to other wars , too . Very good book . It is extremely entertaining to read aloud . The lilt and flow of the poetry is admirable and entertaining . One of my favorite by Seuss .
4 #### I would give this to a High School student , studying the Cold War . For a kids ' book , it is n't very kid - friendly .
4 #### This was Seuss ' take on the Cold War / arms race . As such , it 's a bit dated but worth a read as a reminder of how insane MAD was .
4 #### a good way to teach kids the value of cooperation . I will use this to teach boys the futility of war
5 #### I got this for my daughter because I loved this book as a child . Even though the cold war is long gone , I like the lesson of how silly it can be to escalate a confrontation instead of finding a lasting solution . Also , I love Dr. Suess 's art .
5 #### This is a wonderful book , and we value the focus on social issues and older kids ' material in Dr. Seuss ' later work . This book is , of course , about the Cold War and the question of who might drop the bomb first . My husband and I grew up during the Cold War and , interestingly , both of us thought there were pages missing when we got to the end of the book . It 's a cliff - hanger . Of course , when this was written in 1984 , no one knew how the real - world version of this story was going to end .
5 #### well done Dr. Seuss . This book is an odd ball and really will be mostly lost by young readers . They 'll find the pages and pictures funny , but there is a deeper theme that is bravely charged . Huge fans of cold war paranoia will be a bit upset .
5 #### I used this book to teach my 7th grade students about the cold war . We pointed out elements of propaganda , Mutual Assured Destruction , and even a little bit about allegories ( among other things ) . They all " got it " and loved the story .
5 #### I do n't know how I missed this gem of a book as a child reading Dr. Suess . My children really enjoy it .
5 #### This cartoon adaptation of the Cold War is always humorous . The kids are sure to love it and the title is always fun to say !
5 #### I use this book to end my Cold War unit plan in 9th grade US history . They love that they 're being read a children 's story . I love the moment when they realize WHY I 'm reading them a children 's story .
5 #### Dr. Seuss is and always has been incredible . This book is not only a great story for my younger sister , but also a great story to read and look into as an adult . There are many concepts we do n't catch as kids . As a matter of fact I had to do a report using Dr. Seuss books as references . This was a perfect example .
4 #### Even I was kind of stumped that the book does n't have a neatly tied together ending . Only because I was reading it to my 4 and 6 year old , and an ending like that , open - ended , was a bit of a reach for them . The 4 - year old just walked away , did n't seem to care . My 6 - year old up until that point had never really experiences a book that does n't have a traditional " ending " so mostly had a lot of questions as to what happens next , how do we know ... versus really thinking about the subject matter . She and I did engage in a brief discussion about that , but still it was a bit over her head . It was tough explaining about bombs and destruction , she still is n't aware about what war is , the history of the world , that sort of thing . Neither child has asked to read it again . So ... I do n't know , it really is n't a grabbing story , not my fave Dr Seuss book , but because I do think its clever and teaches a very important and deep ideas to kids , I gave it 4 stars . I like that is is n't really dumbed down .
5 #### Used the book to impart the basis for the beginnings of and proliferation of the globalized " Cold War . " Its simplicity should n't be overlooked as to its contents .
5 #### Besides being perfectly written , this story is ideal for teaching kids not to fight . In the story there are two towns who disagree on which side of the bread to put their butter on . Each side creates a bigger weapon to combat the other town 's last creation and it just goes back and forth and back and forth . It is funny and goofy and the weapons are fantastically fun ! But in the end I can talk to my kids and say " did they fix anything with their weapons ? " " So if you hit Johnny , and then Johnny hits you and you hit Johnny , when does it stop ? Does it fix anything ? What could happen when we fight ? " I believe that this liturature is great for teaching kids to use their words or to simply move on . It is also perfect for teaching students how to " pick their battles , " what I consider to be an underrated skill . Buttering your bread on one side or the other is n't really a great reason to fight . The kids laugh and it starts a discussion that involves much critical thinking .
5 #### The Butter Battle Book was my favorite Dr. Seuss cartoon growing up . Now that I 'm an adult I found the book that I did n't even know existed . Of course I had to make it mine . A must have for any true Dr. Seuss Fan
2 #### I love the Doc . but the words are so small you ca n't read them . Maybe the fire is different . Disapointed
5 #### It so happens that the Yooks and the Zooks ca n't stand each other because , as each sneeringly believes , the other is different . And being different is entirely silly . Certainly unacceptable , and , now , assuredly dangerous . So , they 're going to fight . Well ... , at least , they 're going to threaten each other . The problem is : What good is a threat if you ca n't carry it out ? Fortunately , both sides are AFRAID to do more than ACT tough . But that 's only because both are EQUALLY tough -- for now . In the end , the Yooks and the Zooks , both , come up with their own , final , blow - you - to - smithereens weapon . Their problem still remains : Who 's tough enough to use it first ? Or is it : Who 's foolish enough ? A scary story about today and your future .

5 #### I have always loved Dr. Seuss ! The Butter Battle Book is a great Seuss - ian look at the follies of mankind as we attempt to have the biggest , best , fastest , " most - est " weapons . The characters are relateable and the drawings are typical Dr. Seuss . Such a fun read . I first read this book , from a book fair , while waiting on a parent to arrive at her scheduled conference with me . I thoroughly enjoyed it then and did when I read it before giving it to my niece 's first - grade daughter . As a child , I would read and re - read and re - read my Dr. Seuss books . I hope that my grand - niece will enjoy doing the same with The Butter Battle Book !
3 #### The book was in good condition and I was able to use it for my classroom setting . I was pleased with the quality .
5 #### Thank you for a very nice transaction . This first addition book was just what I was looking for as a gift . The book is used , but is in very good condition . It will make a nice gift this Christmas .
5 #### This is a great product , exactly what the description states . I am satisfied with my purchase . I would highly recommend it .
5 #### Like many , I love Dr. Seuss ... and I really love his books that have a deeper level of meaning . This book was once banned because it showed the folly of the Cold War and arms races . I think its great that children reading the book could see how silly the situation these characters got themselves into , but apparently many adults could not . This book is obviously still relevant today and great for getting kids to think critically .
4 #### Like all Dr. Seuss books this book has a message . I wo n't go farther to prevent spoiling it for anyone else . The only thing I found frustrating was the fact that there was no resolution to this book . Did they ever become accepting of the other ?
5 #### Bought this for my grandsons at the suggestion of a college Professor . Great book . Read it to my grandchildren . What a great lesson the book contained .
5 #### I remember reading this book as a child and bought it to read to my son . The story 's message and moral is timeless . Plus , got ta love Dr. Seuss !
5 #### This book is fun and teaches a great lesson ! You can not go wrong by purchasing this book . Try it , you 'll like it !
5 #### This is our family 's favorite Dr. Seuss book . It has some very clever rhymes and makes a very valid point about the flaws in humans that can lead to a situation such as the cold war , or any war for that matter .
2 #### I was at the library and wanted to pick up something for my son , so I grabbed this one because I 'd never heard of it and the bright orange cover was eye catching . Yesterday was Seuss ' birthday , so I read this to them before bed . My son had read it the day before on his own . I was pretty surprised at the obvious war theme . Even though my kids did n't pick up on the serious undertones of it ( because after all , they 're warring over buttered bread ) , I sure did and I was n't prepared for it at all . I get what he was trying to do , but somehow the message coming across in this one differed wildly than the one in the Lorax and I did n't like it . The worst part for us though , was the non - ending . Stories for kids should have beginnings , middles , and ends and for him to leave it where he did was just awful . My kids were really frustrated with the ending and so was I.
5 #### This is a great little book ! As always , Love Dr. Seuss , who is possibly our top philosopher . All adults as well as children would benefit from reading and real studies of his books .
5 #### In a house with 4 young boys , i feel i am constantly saying , " there are things worth fighting for ( freedom , family , religion ) your stuffed snake ( or fill in the blank ) is not one of them . " I love this book . The message is wonderful ... don't fight over silly things it turns into a mess fast . We 've often had one of our boys turn his toast upside down and start munching it at breakfast and the morning is started with giggles because of this book .
5 #### When this book came out , there was an uproar about the subject . Everyone should read this book at least once . If it does n't make you consider our lives and how we progress along the road of weapons , I worry for you .
3 #### I wanted this book thinking that it would be an easy read for my students and future children . I generally love Dr. Seuss books but when I began readying this book , I noticed that the sentences were confusing . I realize that Dr. Seuss wrote many of his books a long time ago , but as an ESL teacher , I do n't think my students will understand the story . Many of the words used are tongue twisters . The book is also too long and my students will get bored halfway through . The storyline is great but the book is too long and wordy .
5 #### I like to read this book to students who are of elementary age over a few days time . The author playfully introduces the idea of settling disputes without fighting . Still there is a very serious edge and the story makes kids think . With bullying in our schools and battles worldwide , it is very appreciated . The book arrived promptly and in good shape .
5 #### I was born in 1985 , and Dr. Seuss published this in 1984 ... I think my parents bought it when my mom was still pregnant with me . Both of my parents were military . My mother was a Russian Linguist during the cold war and my father was part of the MI comunity so I think this book hit them as perfect ! My sister and I were raised on Dr. Seuss but The Butter Battle Book and The Lorax were always my favorits . I now have two kids of myown and I read at least two Dr. Seuss stories to them every night before bed . Dr. Seuss still has a way of teaching children moral and common scence leasons in a way that your child does nt know that they are learning . My daughter is 5 and her favorit is Yertle The Turtle , and my son , who 's 2 , requires me to read The Sneetches every night ... and at nap time if he can get away with it . I would recommend Dr. Seuss to anyone ... not just parents or grandparents . I think my dad still reads them without kids anywhere near him , and he 's in his 50s . The leasons in these books are n't just for kids . Note : If your kids do n't like to go to bed , read Dr. Seuss 's Sleep Book to them . My kids have yet to stay awake through it , and it works the imagination , so their dreams and imaginations are strong ! It 's a tongue twister , but it works really well !
1 #### There 's a reason this book 's popularity pales in comparison with the gazillion other wonderful books Dr. Seuss created . I believe Dr. Seuss was a genius , and my political leanings are in line with his . The only explanation I can come up with for this book is that it was n't intended for children or non - violent adults , but rather to send to war mongers to show them the error of their ways . My five and seven year old daughters found it downright disturbing . I " accidentally " skipped over much of it when I saw the look of sadness , concern , and utter confusion on their faces . It details a war between two nations , and the somewhat silly names for the weaponry are not nearly enough to make the increasingly morbid arms race palatable . There are just so many better Dr. Seuss books : for big kids and adults , try " Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are " , " Oh , the Places You Will Go " , or " Happy Birthday to You " ; for little kids , read " One Fish , Two Fish , Red Fish , Blue Fish " , " Go Dog , Go ! " , and " Dr. Seuss 's ABC " . These are a much better representation of this man 's talent , and just a tiny taste of the incredible treasures he left for the world to enjoy . P.S. ANYTHING adapted by Tish Rabe for Dr. Seuss is excellent as well , and great for intelligent elementary - aged kids .
5 #### Dr Seuss reaks of fun . I have never read a Dr Seuss book I did n't like ! !
3 #### I bought this Seuss because it was rated as a number one with NewYork . I thought it was over the top Cold warish and it simplified the problem in a very trivial way . I would not recommend it to anyone and was quit disappionted in the strong political nature of this book . Thumbs down ):
5 #### This book was written years after the Lorax , but it certainly has a lot in common with Suess ' most controversial and perhaps powerful book . The book is essentially an allegory of the cold war . With two different ideologies battling it out in secret rooms with weapons that are never used . Like the Lorax , this book is great for children and adults alike , because it discusses such an important subject in such an accessible and colorful way . Adults will see the parallel between the book and the conflict of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. and children will see an allegory for themes such as racism , and other thoughtless ignorances . This is a powerful book , and in my belief an essential part of anyone 's libary . If you are the mother or father of a young child , my reccomendation goes much deeper . Use this book as a way to start a discussion on any conflict that does n't make sense to the child . I highly recommend this book to anyone , especially as a teaching aid .
5 #### It 's one of Seuss 's later works , written in the 1980s . It presents , in kid - friendly idiom , the inane causes of war . Although presented as silliness , the conflict rapidly escalates through successively goofier armaments . The end shows the entire populace descending into underground shelters with the Big - Boy Boomeroo about to be launched by both sides at once . The presentation is Seussish and silly , a real contrast to his hawkish WWII editorial cartoons . Still , it 's grimly familiar to anyone who lived in the 1950s and 60s . Bomb shelters and the threat of mutually assured destruction were daily realities then , and their memory is still sharp . Maybe , if kids see insanity early enough , they 'll learn to avoid it . At worst , they 'll have yet another of Seuss 's charming stories behind them . //wiredweird
5 #### With enchanting rhyme and whimsical illustrations , Dr. Suess delivers a children 's book with lots to consider . The butter side up Yooks and the butter side down Zooks are a parody of the cold war , and the crescendo builds as the trivial evolves into a weapons race , culminating with a stalemate with each side having a " Big Boy Boomeroo " . The younger readers will be enchanted by the rhythm of the tale and the lesson that grandpa imparts will be better understood by the older readers . Actually , a wonderful book for all ages . Pair this book with THE LORAX ( a once " banned " Suess book ! ) and you 'll have my favorite baby shower gift .
5 #### " Butter Battle " tells the story of the Yooks and Zooks , two identical races living on two sides of a high wall , differing only in how they butter their bread . The book is about passing on prejudice and hatred to children , when grandfather reveals the terrible bread - buttering practices of those who live on the other side . It 's about hair - trigger readiness for war , and the arms race . All this , with Seuss ' rhyming prose and vivid , funny illustrations . " Butter Battle " was a departure for Dr. Seuss , a serious book about the nature of war and the nuclear arms race . Perhaps he wrote it with the Cold War in mind , and some object that the book trivializes the nature of that conflict . But our history since 1984 provides too many examples of what Seuss was talking about -- the Balkan conflicts , India - Pakistan , the Middle East . The book is n't widely available ( except on Amazon ! ) but it 's certainly worth tracking down . I used it in an " English as a Second Language " class on discrimination and prejudice . They loved it !
4 #### The title above should be prefaced by ' as far as I know ' , since I have n't read everything by Dr. Seuss , but anyway ... This book tries to show the folly of war , specifically the cold war , and arms races , by all of Dr. Seuss 's usual tricks : the creation of new words for objects representative of things in our own world , and beautiful , colorful environments which act as twisted mirror images of our own world . The book also , however , can be viewed as showing the necessity of arms races , since , as the book implies , if one side does n't match the threat of the other , than the other will strike . The only problem I see with it though , is that the entire book , especially the ending , might be a bit too much for younger kids , which is what Dr. Seuss 's audiance has become . Sadly older children ( 10 to 12 ) would probably much rather read something that seems more mature , since by this age they 're perfectly capable of reading chapter books . A surprisingly well writen political commentary by a children 's author , The Butter Battle Book can easily be viewed as a Seuss classic .
5 #### This one was recommended by a friend who is also an " older " kid at heart when I told him The Lorax is my favorite Seuss book . Makes a great gift for a kid or a kid at heart . And who can beat the great Seuss illustrations !
5 #### I 'm waiting for some one to write a thesis on the aspects of social responsibility in the books of Dr. Seuss . Here , the great Doctor shows us that events on the world stage can all be comprehended by children because this is what happens in the playground : My one is bigger than your one . The book demands a discussion at the end and thus it is best for introducing in a group setting . This book develops the themes of " The Sneetches " , " The Lorax " and " Yertle the Turtle " where human failings : greed , pride , power are illustrated without pointing the finger at any nation or sector . Read and think . The success of this book can be measured in the number of military academies that ban it from their library collections .
4 #### Given the end of the cold war , this book seems a little out of date , but there continue to be valuable lessons about escalation and defining people that are different as enemies . I would recommend the Sneetches , rather than the butter battle book .
5 #### How did they do it ? Build an empire , erect bathhouses and apartment buildings , provide running water and sub - floor heating ... MacAuley begins with the emperial surveyors laying out the streets of the city they will build : town planning with fine attention to the details that are a hallmark in this stunning and valuable series . The book reveals the work in progress ... a Sim City in a book . This treasure provides links in many directions : to The Gladiator and Asterix , to Roman studies and literature , and to architecture and engineering in all its modern carnations . Enjoy ! I add this series to my list of " 1000 books I would give to any child " .
5 #### If you 're an adult who still has youthful curiousity but does n't have the time for scholarly works , these books by Macaulay are delightful discoveries . This Roman City book is a particular delight explaining how locations were selected and how cities were organized around roman social order and plain common sense . It knocks down the " arrogance of the modern " to realize how clever our ancestors were . Oh yeah , and kids who love to build with Legos will love this book to .
4 #### Another of a series of books by this author about architecture and building projects through the ages , City brings the reader face to face with the problems , challenges and triumphs of Roman engineering and construction . The illustrations done in a wonderful pen and ink are as vivid as any photograph could have ever been and may are quite amusing as well as educational and enlightening . The text is explanatory , but not overly detailed and this is by no means a college level treatise on Roman civilization . It is however fun to read and illuminates the practices of the antiquities for younger readers . Adult readers will enjoy the humor depicted in some of the drawings and the text and illustrations are informative for them as well . This may also be a good book for school rooms where much reference is made to the times of the Roman Empire in general study . It 's a worthy addition to any library .
5 #### Wow ! What a cool book ! I bought this for my kids who will be taking Latin next year . It has a great layout with good information about how things were built in the Roman days . I enjoyed reading it myself as well !
5 #### I bought this book as a young architect .... such a wonderful book !
4 #### Nicely done . I would have appreciated an entry showing the density of renters in an insulae
5 #### Macaulay is the master of simplifying complex topics . He 's easy to follow , extremely well illustrated , and gripping -- which is a lot to be said for an historic architecture series ! If you like to know how things work , buy any of his books .
3 #### I actually enjoyed the book . It was informative and a easy read . I also learned a lot . When I checked it our i thought it was about something else ? ?
5 #### A wonderful , illustrated overview that is good for adults and children alike . Very informative , and now I would like a map of the location of buildings in Rome to go with this book .
5 #### A very cool book that shows what a Roman city was like .
5 #### What a wonderful book . Beautifully illustrated . If you are interested in Roman cities and their planning and infrastucture , this shows it all . Great effort has gone into each illustration .
5 #### This is one that I order form TSR some time ago !
5 #### Loved it ! Perfect for people of all ages who want to understand the gist of the Roman way of life
5 #### I love books by David Macaulay and I am student of ancient Rome . The details of the planning and construction of a city of the Roman Empire are amazing . The foresight of the city planners is proved when the city ultimately grows to 50,000 inhabitants and the city services still function smoothly . Construction methods are shown with detailed drawings . All in all , this book is a fascinating study of city planning two thousand years ago . Highly recommended .
4 #### Fascinating book a real treat for those interested in Ancient Rome . easy to understand and it will keep your attention without costing you too much time !
5 #### I love these books . They show how Rome was constructed in beautiful detail . I 'd recommend all of David Macaulay 's books . Maybe they 'll come as a set someday .
5 #### I found this book easy to read , with excellent pictures . We need our young people interested in engineering and understand what it means . Fascinating ! Fantastic books for young engineers ( to be ) !
5 #### If you are n't familiar with David Macaulay 's books , this is a good introduction . He does wonderful books about historic architecture , with really wonderful , detailed drawings . Thoughtful children ( and adults ) will enjoy going back to the book again and again to study the drawings and read the text . Well done .
5 #### This is one of a series of wonderful books for children and adults . The drawings are worth the price of the volume .
5 #### Fascinating and fun read ! Although I am a scholar of ancient history and civilisations , I learned some interesting details . R
4 #### I brought this on a trip to Italy with my grandson . In retrospect , I should have bought it for his device ahead of time . It is clear and informative , and somewhat to my surprise , the illustrations work on an iPad .
5 #### Macaulay famously published books aimed at scholastic youth , which follow an architectural narrative , and City stays just in step . The book deals with the construction of an Ancient Roman city , and introduces the reader to expansionist Roman culture . Relying heavily on visuals , the book provides children plenty to enjoy with an easy - to - follow pace . Children are certainly not the only ones who can enjoy these books though , and I purchased this one in particular for artistic and historical reference - better as just a handbook for this , since these books are detailed but not expansive past their subject matter . It might be a little humbling , but we adults can pick these up and find a comforting welcome into a new subject . I recommend for : parents who want their child to learn a little more outside of school , artists , writers , and architecture enthusiasts . It 's not very complex but it is thorough .
5 #### My wife brought this book home after picking it up for the kid 's home school curriculum , but I managed to get my hands on it first . I am both a fan of architecture and of Rome so a book like this is incredibly interesting to me . Understanding now how they built their roads , aqueducts , sewage systems and even sidewalks gives me a whole new appreciation for the Roman sense of planning , order and preparation . Each page of this book highlights one area of the construction of a pretend city called Verbonia from the planning and site prep to its completion 20 years later . Each page will typically have a short paragraph about a step in the cities construction and then some beautifully drawn details . Though I read through the book in about an hour one could easily spend twice as lone going through the drawings in detail . Due to this City would also serve as an awesome reference book just to have in one 's library . I can easily recommend this book to just about anybody as its appeal will be broad . The fact that me and my six year old both jumped on it when my wife brought it home attests to this . I got the chance to flip through this author 's book on Pyramids and it is just as good . Highly Recommended
5 #### I bought this and the other David Macaulay books because I loved them as a child . I used Pyramid for a research paper in 7th or 8th grade and fell in love with the author 's visual and to the point storytelling style . Just as I remembered !
4 #### The drawings are good , the " urban planning " thoughts are good , and some youngsters will like it quite a lot . I 've given a number of Macaulay books to kids , and somehow I think this will not be quite so popular with them . Well done as always .
5 #### A book , for children and adults , shows us how a Roman city was built , from the ground up . First they make a plan , deciding on how many people will live in the city , where the forums will go , the roads , the walls , the markets , theater , amphitheater and temples . They bring the stone to make the walls and aqueducts . We see how people live in the city , as the book explores the homes , businesses , public spaces and sewer system . We get to see the final , complete , form of the city , full of busy streets , crowded markets , happy homes and tall walls .
4 #### I ordered this book for the purpose of understanding Roman constuction of a city . It is definitely an excellent source for those who wish to know how Rome may have organized it 's sattelite cities . The books is concise and filled with illustrations to aid the reader in imagining what a Grand scheme a Roman Engineered city must have been ( especially considering what setbacks in civilization would come later through the middle ages ) . I really enjoyed this book , the only setback I have with it is that it is maybe too good at summarizing it 's subject . It is a brief read , more belonging to the non - fiction section of a ' Young Adults ' library than a history loving ' Adult ' . It is a little ... sanitized in Roman Rule , and skirts around the visciousness of Italy . One would be inclined to believe the Romans were peaceful while reading this , and forget that they were a civilization bent on subjugaition of foreign lands , and brutal in justice for all citizens . That is the only reason I hold back 1 star ; there is much more that could be told , and considering the excellent detail the rest of the book gives , it could have abbreviated LESS in it 's timeline , and the reader would have been much more in debt to the author for having done so . I want MORE ! A very good source of Roman city information . Well recommended .
4 #### The only reason I gave this book 4 stars rather than 5 is that David Macaulay has set the bar so high for himself over the years by writing and illustrating some real masterpieces such as Castle and Cathedral . City is also a great book , just not quite as amazing as others he has written . I bought this for my son , who has always been intrigued by construction projects , but I have also enjoyed it quite a bit .
5 #### In this book , David Macaulay expertly describes and illustrates the construction of the imaginary Roman city of Verbonia . It is based hundreds of real Roman cities built between 300 B.C. and A.D. 150 . I was amazed at the planning that went into the city , and the systematic and precise manner that everything was managed . I was fascinated to learn how they built the aqueducts for the city 's water supply , even going through hills , and the sewer system underground to keep the city sanitary . The architecture of the forum and baths was so intriguing . Of course , this might be expected from the author of " The Way Things Work " ! His detailed drawings are fabulous . This a terrific book for learning about Roman cities in this time period and for studying the way the cities were put together to provide for all the needs of the inhabitants .
5 #### When taken together as a collection , Macaulay 's books , from Castle and Cathedral and Pyramid , Mill , Unbuilding , Mosque , and most definitely this one , City , create what is probably the most readable , retainable , and approachable exploration of the story of architecture that 's out there . These books , each highlighting an era and a project , are all a lot of fun to look at , read , and think about , and in this volume , City , the foundation and construction of a Roman population center is detailed . From the explanation for why the Romans built cities from scratch , to the selection and preparation of the site , to the actual erection of a brand new city , Macaulay leaves nothing unexplored or unexplained . These books are as enjoyable for adults as they are for children , and are truly classics of our time .
5 #### When David Macaulay published this book in 1974 , he was following in the path of the great American illustrators Edwin Tunis and Eric Sloane . They produced many memorable history books for young adults in the years following the Second World War . Tunis and Sloane blended well written history with well done pen and pencil illustrations . " City " follows the standard convention of beginning with a parcel of undeveloped land and showing the building process as the project progresses to a completed Roman city . What makes this book so important is that David Macauley was able to expand the age paremeters and produce a beautiful book that could appeal to both young children and adults . His skills as a story teller and illustrator allowed people to look architecture and history in a new light . There are other illustrators with stronger drafting skills but there is nobody with more imagination . Macaulay is not afraid to enter into an image and tear it apart and look at it from many different viewpoints . There is a sense of movement and playfulness in his illustrations that make him unique . This book is so important in the history of children 's non - fiction literature because David Macaulay opened the doors for a whole series of children 's book illustrators who have produced hundreds of illustrated history books .
5 #### This video presentation of the building of the city of Rome is a must for anyone interested in the classics or architecture . I intend to share it with my Latin classes so that they can appreciate the genius of the Roman civilization . Did you know the Romans invented building arches with cement ? Warmly , Robert D. Askren , Ph . D.
5 #### I am a huge fan of David Macaulay 's historically based line drawings . I found myself drawn into the images and fact - based fictional story . I forgot I borrowed this for my children ! After you read the book , you may want to view the PBS video Roman City hosted by Mr. Macaulay . It features footage of ruines as well as animation sequences that follow the story set - up in City . Be sure to include this book in your study of 1st century BC / AD Rome- you wo n't be disappointed !
5 #### If you 're studying Rome , you NEED this book ! There are no pretty colored pictures here , no photos either , just very clear , exceptionally detailed line drawings that make it apparent even to quite young students ( I used this with a grade 3 homeschool student ) how very much " modern " life owes to Roman engineering genius .
5 #### an excellent book ... provides insight on roman architecture .. i especially love the explanation and graphics on the construction of aqueducts ... excellent ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I had the good fortune to receive this book as a gift some twenty years ago as a child . The basic premise is simple enough : these people from another time and country are going to build something , and the book is going to show us how they did it . The text itself , as with many children 's books , is relatively simple , but the intricate pen - and - ink drawings are spellbinding . Time and again I would go back to CITY , and pore over the pictures , often discovering some previously - overlooked detail that Macaulay had included . I highly recommend CITY , and Macaulay 's other architectural books , to both children and adults . Most children are inherently curious , and interested in how things are made , why they work , and who made them . Macaulay teaches those things in his books , but more importantly , the books draw the reader in and stimulate the imagination . There 's a hands - on history lesson inherent in each of these books , a brief glimpse at other cultures around the globe and in different times . Whether it 's ancient Egypt , classical Rome , medieval France , or 18th Century America , the worlds in Macaulay 's books are always fascinating to visit .
5 #### David Macaulay 's works are always entertaining , educational and literate , and this is no exception . A multitude of black - and - white line drawings illustrate the story of Roman urban planners as they design and construct a new city on the Roman empire 's frontier . Every stage is explained thoroughly using text , illustrations and charts , from developing a master plan through construction . Tools are explained , cross - sections are used to good effect and specific projects such as a house , a road , a bridge and aqueduct , the forum and central market , public baths , the sewer system and an amphitheater and theater are represented . The book ends with a one - page glossary . If you or a student you know is interested in Roman engineering , this would be a marvelous book to read .
5 #### As a teacher I constantly seek new resources for the classroom . I teach high school and find this resources reaches all levels . My own college student sat down and devoured this book . You will not be dissappointed as Mr. MacAulay once again dissects the difficult and dry and produces an interesting and accesible resource on Rome .
5 #### I read this book before going to Pompeii and Herculeum , and it greatly enriched my appreciation for and understanding of those sites . Guidebooks may help you develop a general idea as to the use of a particular building , usually help you find that building , and may give you an idea as to what that building looked like 2000 years ago . This book gives you a brief , easily accessible account of what life was like in these places and helps you identify and understand little details that you otherwise would have either missed or puzzled over . It will greatly increase your appreciation for the Romans as engineers and urban planners !
5 #### Years ago I purchased this book to read to my classroom . I loved t he artwork as well as the verse . The book had long since disappeared . I found it again here . I am thrilled .
5 #### One of the most beautiful poems I have ever read . The illustrations add so much to the story . Everyone should read it !
5 #### This book is out of print and I 've been looking for a copy for years . It 's a perfect gift for someone who 's important in your life .
4 #### A grand book for children . It 's a keeper . It was an old book that became well known and the illustrations are great .
5 #### I recently shared this book with someone very special to me . The illustrations are rich and beautiful . The story is ageless and exquisite . The story centers on that , despite physical distance and forms , an unlikely pairing of two beings can love each other and have the faith to allow life to unfold the way it should . Both protagonists ( Lion and Blue the Brazilian Butterfly ) find themselves in love , yet must first take their own individual paths to get to a point at which they can be together . It is implied that both need to grow , explore , learn on their own first in order to be the very best for each other . Individual transformation , courage , hope , and most importantly , love are explored in this haunting story that is suitable for adults as well as children .
5 #### I originally bought this book for my granddaughter but was so taken with the charm and love expressed in the paintings that I also got it for myself as well as for other nieces ..... this belongs on your keep it forever shelf .
5 #### The same book I had as a kid ... the 2 color drawings and the text explain the processes . It probably changed my life - having the whole world of engineering opened up to me at the ripe old age of 7 ( yes , I was 7 when my folks got it for me ) pretty much opened my eyes to that entire side of what was possible , and taught me to think through processes and imagine what else was possible . I think ... seriously ... my education and career were influenced positively from reading this book as a young child .
5 #### I received this as a gift from my parents when I was 8 ( and the book was new ) . It literally changed my entire way of thinking about things , my thought processes , and made such a huge difference in my life path I can not explain it . MANY nights with a flashlight under the covers were spent with this fascinating book ... It really needs to be republished .
5 #### This book , along with Volume 2 , provides a clearly understandable explanation of industrial processes that pre - digital 20th century western civilization depended upon . Every entry carries a modestly detailed text explaining the process and at least one full page of step - by - step graphical illustrations . If we ever needed to rebuild society , this would be a starting point reference book . Also , if you 're a high school student in need of an understanding of Industry - Commerce - Law , then time spent with the two volumes of the set will be well invested . Impress your guidance counselor and college interviewers along the way !
5 #### These were my favorite books when I was about ten years old . I read them and reread them until " I knew " how all those " things " worked ! They are worn and a little dirty now but I still cherish them . Sadly they are showing their age : the focus of the text and the drawing slowly diverges from what is now relevant . Nevertheless , their crisp industrial focus still shines through , and still gives these books their beauty .
5 #### Thoroughly traces Hemingway 's whole life from birth to shotgun finale . Splendidly done by Baker . I am in agreement with the previous reviewer ; this bio is up there with Manchester 's bio of Winston Churchill .
4 #### I 'm not a reader of Hemingway 's work but became interested in him when I read The Paris Wife about Hadley Richardson his first wife but do love some of his short stories I 've read in anthologies . This is a large book and so far I happy with the details it fills in before and after Hadley and up until his death . It paints a clear picture of the events and times that shaped Hemingway 's perspective and ultimately his writing . The book reads well and I 'm almost finished and already am wishing there were more photos included .
5 #### This reads as if it were written by Hemingway . His life story done very well . Unfortunately not available on kindle . I had to buy first a used paperback which was falling apart and the print too small . Then I bought a hardback . It is OK but not in great condition . I had this book new when it came out but gave it away some years ago and wanted to re read it . Kindle , why is it not available ? Publisher , you are losing money to the used book people !
5 #### I have read most of the major biographies concerning Hemingway .. (I am more fastinated with Hemingway the man than his actual work , I have to admit ) . This is by far the best . Well written , well researched . I must admit to be a Baker fan , so perhaps my view my be slanted here . I do recommend the books reading , and do recommend you add this one to your collection .
5 #### This is one of the most perfectly paced novels I have ever read , and I have read hundreds of books in my life . Like many writers , Oppel can make you care about his characters , but that is just one of the levels on which SKYBREAKER succeeds . His ability to twist a cliche sideways and make it ring true is superb . His tactful descriptions of Matt and Kate 's feelings for each other are realistic and enjoyable . The adventure aspects abound , yet never seem rushed or over done . All in all a very entertaining book , and one that I hope is just the second in a long running series .
2 #### I had just finished telling my husband how much I appreciated the careful development of the boy / girl friendship of the first book and , in The Boundless too , when it was all ruined in chapter two of this one ...... It kills me to give this such a low rating especially considering I only made it to chapter three ! However I was listening to this in audio form with my 9 year old son and felt the relationship development was absolutely inappropriate and unnecessary . When Kate grabs his hand he " warms in all his private parts " and when they leave the restaurant he pushes her into a corner and kisses her passionately " wanting all of her " and then she responds that " a kiss like that would normally merit a propasal " but that 's okay because she does n't agree with those " old fashion " views . Children are already struggling with all the wrong messages about their relationships , their bodies , and when physical love is acceptable and I think the author simply went with the new cultural norm . It adds nothing to the book but takes all the charm and character built in the first one away .
5 #### Gave this to my husband and he loves Kenneth Oppel 's writing . He read a previous one and like it so much that I ordered this one for him which he said was even better than the first . Will try to find another to purchase for him .
5 #### Book two in a series my sons and I have loved ! Great voice , unique world . Excellent adventure set in Earth 's sky and incorporating old technology in a way that feels fresh and new . Clean youth adventure .
5 #### This book was so amazing that when I read it I felt like I was inside the book ! The thought that boats could actually fly is AWESOME !
5 #### Great reading ... it kept me interested to the end . Science fiction with good plot and characters made for easy enjoyable reading .
5 #### This was an amazing sequel to Air born . This is a must read for any adventure readers . It has a great story line that will have you hooked in no time at all .
5 #### Loved the Airborn series . Fantastic and full of adventure . A must read trilogy for boys . My sons read them around 7th grade and loved them along with " the Maze Runner " trilogy .
5 #### Got this book for my son . He loved it ! So much so that I 've bought the other books in the series . He says he would recommend the series to anyone . He has actually read them all at least twice .
5 #### My grandson does n't like to read , so I gave it a try since my granddaughter loves other books by this author !
5 #### I liked the story line , the writing skills of the author , and I 'm interested in flight . What more could one ask of a relaxing , entertaining , and fun book to read .
5 #### If you like dangerous gross and adventure books this is the perfect book for you . You have to read this
5 #### I really enjoyed Mr. Oppels Skybreaker and look forward to his other novels ! I hope Airborn is available to read very soon . .
5 #### If you have n't dived into this series , then stop now and get a copy of Airbourne . If you 've read Airbourne and want to know what Matt and Kate are up to next , get Skybreaker . This is an incredible high - altitude adventure with fully realized characters , an engrossing story and plenty of things that keep you guessing .
5 #### I got started on this series as a fluke . I saw someone recommend it , it sounded interesting , so I decided to purchase the first one - I quickly ordered the second one when I realized how great the books were . All three of the books were better than I ever expected ! I highly recommend this series to anyone who likes to daydream , anyone who has a mind , and anyone who has a heart . Wonderful books . In this one , the second book , Matt Cruse and his friend Kate de Vries find themselves on an adventure to find a lost airship , dangling somewhere in the frigid , unwelcoming atmosphere . As usual , trouble finds them and follows them aboard the ship . They fight for their lives and for the honor of the man who owned the lost airship . They make amazing discoveries and take their findings back with them . Again , lovely book full of imagery and adventure . You wo n't regret buying this book !
5 #### I picked the first book in this series up on impulse and really enjoyed it ! This author has created a believeable and fascinating alternate world . Strongly recommmend ! !
4 #### Continues the story very well . Oppel has a very fluid style that makes you imagine you are there . The ending is great .
5 #### Simply an amazing book , greatly paced and very dramatic . Finished it in less than two days and found myself reading whenever I had a chance . Just as exciting as the first .
5 #### Excellent sequel to the Matt Cruse series . Very well - written story set in an alternate earth . You wo n't put it down .
5 #### In the second adventure of a trilogy , Matt Cruse becomes the only person on Earth with the coordinates of a legendary lost airship when he sees it during a training mission . This makes him the central figure as several parties race for the ship and the treasure rumored to be aboard , all unaware of the dangerous creatures that await . Author Kenneth Oppel follows up on Matt 's first adventure with a superior sequel . He has created a fascinating setting : I do n't believe the actual year is ever cited , but it feels like the early twentieth century in an alternate history where the Hindenburg disaster never soured the general public on lighter - than - air craft and a substance called hydrium makes immense airships feasible . Against this backdrop , he tells a cracking adventure reminiscent of the best pulp adventures , with involving characters and a romance that does n't feel cloying and juvenile . He writes some great action set pieces , but they never feel forced or contrived . Highly recommended .
5 #### Many people would probably call Kenneth Oppel 's " Matt Cruse " series a steampunk tale , after all it has airships ! But calling this series steampunk is doing it a disservice , while Oppel does borrow from modern steampunk , what starts to become apparent to me , with this the second book in series , is that what he has actually done is simply continue the " golden " era of pulps into the thirties and forties as if the first and second world wars had never happened . In a word , it is " Brilliant " . All three of these books read like any number of Edgar Rice Burrows tales and each one seems to me to fit a specific subgenre in early pulps , in book two , which is the one I qualify as the most " Action / Adventure " of the trilogy , Matt joins an expedition to the unheard of altitude of 30,000 feet to recover a lost luxury liner where he finds a cold airless wasteland and fantastical creatures of the unexplored heights ! This series is just plain old fashion fun and I highly recommend it to everyone but most especially to anyone who grew up reading pulps or wants a glimpse back to what people imagined in a time when a great deal of our own planet was still one full of mysteries galore .
4 #### An enjoyable novel to read . It was a little bit fantasy , a little bit science fiction , a little romance , a little adventure . Something for everybody !
5 #### Love this book and Oppel is an incredible writer . You do n't want to miss this series ! ! If you love Rick Riordan or PW Catanese 's Umber Series then you will LOVE these . Rich fantasy adventure and suspense set in this cool kind of almost steampunk Victorian setting . By the way this is book # 2 of this series - I highly recommend you start with Airborn the first in this series . You can read this and follow the story but honestly you wo n't want to skip any of these .
5 #### I finished Airborn and could n't wait for the second book . I found Skybreaker to be even better than Airborn -- engaging characters , fast action , a true sense of creepy mystery concerning the lost airship . I rushed through supper just so I could finish the last nerve - tingling 100 pages . It 's the best book I have read all year . Now I ca n't wait to read the third book !
5 #### Skybreaker is an excellent book . The sequal to Airborn , the fun and action continues . I can hardly wait to read the third !
5 #### Matt Cruse , former cabin boy of the airship Aurora , continues his adventures in Skybreaker . Matt and his friend Kate discover the coordinates to a long lost ship , the Hyperion , which may contain gold , inventions , and a taxidermy display among other rumoured riches to be discovered . One of the major obstacles is that the Hyperion is in Skyberia with high altitudes and cold temperatures making the salvage much more difficult . There are also the pirates to deal with ... This book was just as entertaining and unputdownable as Airborn . The action was fast and furious with many heartstopping moments . As an adult reader , I enjoyed the relationship between Matt and Kate which was interesting but kept at a level that will not lose younger readers interests . Looking forward to Starclimber !
5 #### If anyone asked me about this book , they would watch me as I gave a little jump of excitement and tell them that it was just amazing . " Skybreaker " is the sequel to " Airborn " , set in a time where there are airships , no airplanes . In these two books , the main character is Matt Cruse , a boy who is born in the air . " Skybreaker " tells about the spotting of a long - lost ship , " Hyperion " . This leads on an entire search for the riches that could await them on the ship that disappeared forty years ago . " Skybreaker " is full of action and suspense . In many ways , I could count this as one of the most exciting books that I have ever read .
5 #### My daughter and I loved this series . The first two books were the best . The descriptive language is just right , not so much that a younger reader would be bored , and enough that any reader can have the right pictures in their heads . This is a good old fashioned adventure story with both a boy and girl adventurer . I appreciated the lack of stereotyping re . gender . I also appreciated that the story was ' clean ' without being too moralistic . My daughter loves a romance element in her books ( I do n't ) and this series does have that . I definitely do n't appreciate the reviewers who suggest that this is a good series specifically for boys . Just say no to gender stereotyping already ! I would highly recommend , could n't think of any reason to take away stars .
5 #### My husband and I , our nine - year old son and my 12 - year old nephew have all passed around this novel and each thoroughly enjoyed it . A sequel that does n't disappoint !
5 #### I really love this author ! I am a junior high school English teacher , and this is a series I have recently come upon that I love recommending to my above - average - reader students , especially boys . Most of them have never heard of it , but they always come back after reading it with such positive reviews . They love it ! It 's so imaginative and unique and just loaded with old - fashioned action and adventure ! The characters are so charming and fun and easy to relate to . When someone first gave me Airborn , I looked at the cover and thought , " Airships ? Ick . Boring . " But I could n't have been more mistaken . It was a delightful , compelling read . I enjoyed it thoroughly ! And I liked SkyBreaker even more ! So original and exciting ! I 'm already watching like a hawk for the next in the series ! Ca n't wait !
5 #### " Skybreaker " is lucky . Or just good . See , unlike most sequels to excellent , successful books , " Skybreaker " is something strange and delightfully surprising - a good book that can stand alone , by itself . While many of the characters are the same ( seeing as it 's about the same people ) , and while sparks of inspiration from " Airborn " appear , it is still original , different , interesting , and exciting in its own way . If need be , this book could have just been a book , not a sequel . And what a joy that is . " Skybreaker " gives us something different , but still cool . Matt and Kate ( heroes from " Airborn " ) have grown a little and things are different . For example , Matt is finally fulfilling his dream of studying about airships ( which turns out to be a whole lot harder than he imagined ) . After an incident of near death ( and obeying a captain 's foolish orders ) , Matt finds himself in a dangerous position of knowing the coordinates of the " Titanic " of the sky . This ship , " The Hyperion " , at dangerously high altitudes , is the treasure ship of the sky , thought to be a myth . Everyone wants to be in on the gold that can supposedly be found there . And so begins a new journey . Emotions run high as the altitude grows , and there 's plenty of plot to the adventure as well . Written clearly and quickly , " Skybreaker " will provide readers with another grand tale from Oppel . It flows well , is engaging , and on the whole enjoyable and exciting . Very fun !
5 #### A wonderful fantasy adventure read . This is a book written with an adolescent audience in mind , however it has the writing quality and story line to keep most adult fantasy / adventure lovers contented . Personally I liked this book better than " Airborn " , ( which I felt had some very convienent solutions to solve some of its near impossible situations ) . This book , ( featuring the same main charcters and the same zepellin like airships ) , seemed to me , to have a better conclusions for the various twists and turns that the heroes encountered . I found this book hard to put down and would have no hesitancy in recommending it for anyone what wants an interesting , action packed story . 5 Stars !
5 #### An excellent follow - up to Airborne . The characters are smart , interesting , and a joy to watch as they tumble through this adventure . Oppel is able to take even the slow parts of the book and make them interesting with interactions and character growth that builds where the first book left off . I highly recommend the first book and this one , a quick read , reminds me of a good adventure like Indiana Jones . Rumor has it a third one is in the works , can not wait for it .
5 #### Airborn was great , and Skybreaker is even better . As with Airborn , Skybreaker is not without its flaws , like that at some points it feels a little padded , and that I could n't shake the " Hermione Granger " feeling from Kate , but those are quibbles I guess and do n't hold me back from recommending the book highly . Unlike Airborn , Skybreaker spends most of its time in the sky , and I felt that it was more enjoyable for that ( and more of a page turner ) as a result . Plus the subject matter was more interesting to me , as I suspect it will be for most people ( and the customer reviews here seem to support that notion ) . It 's a real rip - roaring adventure . They 're in development on a movie version of Airborn , but assuming it does well enough to allow a sequel , it 's the sequel that will be the better film ( if it lives up to the material ) . Hopefully there will be a third book and more . I 'll definitely be there for them if they continue to be as well written as these first two . Actually that 's another point I should make : The writing is very good . I mean the real nitty - gritty of the writing-- the word choices , the pacing , the mood , the well - placed humor , etc . It 's very vivid without going into too much detail , and it reads very smoothly .
4 #### Having read " Skybreaker " without having read " Airborn " , I can still enthusiastically recommend this yarn . Too often , sequels depend on the earlier volume and have little integrity as stand - alone titles . And this one stands boldly on its own , head and shoulders above many other YA adventure books . This is a richly detailed alternative - history / light fantasy with interesting characters and intriguing turns of plot , all set in a unique , pseudo - realistic world . Precocious younger readers will enjoy the manageable complexity and scientific elements ; older readers will share Matt 's desire to assert his independence and prove his worth . Parents and teachers may rest assured that it is uncontroversial , with the possible exception of a scene or social drinking and cigar smooking .
5 #### I was so eager to get to SKYBREAKER after AIRBORN I ordered it from the bookstore , started it and five hours later was done . I could n't put it down . After AIRBORN I had no idea what else could happen to Matt and Kate , but Oppell continues to surprise and astound you with his vivid imagination and talent to bring his story to life . As I read about their adventures in obtaining a mystical , ghost - like air - ship in the sky , I felt as if I was seeing the movie in my head . His attention to detail and ability to bring the characters to life leave you wanting more . You also find yourself cheering on Matt and Kate , and a few other new characters , as they try to obtain what everyone else has failed at ... the elusive HYPERION . Now , I 'm am anxiously awaiting a 3rd book ! This second book was just as good as the first , similar to Harry Potter in nature this book will appeal to all kinds of adults and children . I would recommend reading AIRBORN before reading this one to get the full background on our hero , Matt Cruse !
5 #### For as long as he 's been in the air , Matt Cruse has heard of the Hyperion , a ship filled with all kinds of treasures . He thinks it 's a myth - until he sees it for himself , hundreds of miles in the air . Now Matt is the only one who knows the coordinates of this ship , and people daring enough to risk it . The cold and high altitude alone seems to make it impossible . Does he even want to get tangled in another adventure ? But whether he does or not , Matt is pulled into a whirlwind of new purpose . Along with him come the admirable Mr. Slater , the mysterious Nadira , Kate and her chaperone , and the crew . All have different reasons why they want to find the ship . But Matt and his friends are n't the only ones after the contents of the Hyperion , and it 's a race against time to find it . A world frozen in time , and strange creatures prove that along with untold treasure comes untold danger ... in the end , Matt has to decide what 's most important . Kenneth Oppel has written a sequel that soars to incredible heights , being even better than it 's predecessor ! I got this book in Harper Collins First Look program as an advanced reading copy , and I really enjoyed it .
4 #### This sequel is better than the original book in the series . Oppel continues a very good bildungsroman series for the Young Adult audience . He has done a particularly good job of constructing an enjoyable alternative universe which has a Victorian flavor with alternate Victorian type technology , though more advanced in some ways , and an alternate biology as well . Both the alternate history and biology are particularly well done . Characterization and plotting is quite well done with the teen romantic elements handled sensibly . The plot is clever and the conclusion of this book is worthy of the better Spielberg Indiana Jones movies ( Oppel was apparently once a scriptwriter ) . A superior book for this genre .
4 #### I happen to think Hemingway is one of the most overrated novelists of the 20th century , but this particular book is " a good read . " Hemingway does deal with many subjects such as duty , brutalization , love , or loyalty , all the while telling a good , moving story . Not my vote for " the great American novel " , but worth reading .
5 #### Hemmingway touched my heart as a reader in a way no author ever has . I can not put down in words to describe the kind of masterpiece this novel is .
5 #### You understand you have to like Hemingway . This work embodied his distinct style of writing , the spare , yet eloquent manner that is known as his . Hemingway 's ability to saddle every word with meaning and emotion is at it 's ripest in this work , where he writes a war story that encompasses the entire spectrum of the human experience , form love to hate , spite to sacrifice . While the Spanish Civil War included tens of thousands , Hemingway writes of a handful of people who represent the whole of the country . Heroes do not always win in Hemingway 's world , but in their defeat , they do win . The bravery and ultimate sacrifice of the protagonist captures that bitter fact of life . This novel has a meaning and lesson that can only be appreciated and understood by those who have read it . It would be a loss not to .
5 #### This should be read at least once by all men , and all those who hope to become a man someday .
5 #### One of the all time greatest war books . A nuanced , beautiful view of life under threat of destruction .
2 #### I am obviously not a Hemingway fan . I did not get the character development that would keep me engaged and the stilted dialog did not do for me what I believe the author intended . The time period is the Spanish Civil War and I believe Hemingway was trying to let the reader know the dialog was in Spanish and we were " reading the subtitles " or something of the sort . There was considerable repetition of non - essentials that I found terribly boring . This was a book I was reading for my book club and left for vacation before I could check it out at my local library so I borrowed one from the library in the town where we stayed and then ordered this when I got home . I got about half - way through and just could n't make myself read any more .
5 #### Hemingway 's masterpiece is a timeless classic and so well composed . As a reader , I dove into this book heavily and got immersed into the life of a soldier turned gentleman seeking the affections of a beautiful woman . A classic read for anyone that wants to know more about Hemingway 's writing style and storytelling .
1 #### Found , that after murdering her parents and a brutal rape , that more sex for a virgin girl was to be her cure for her anxiety was pure stupid . Hopefully , Hem was just using it as an allegory for Spain 's plight . If you thought my sentence structure stinks , wait till you read the book .
5 #### I love Hemingway and this is one of my favorites .
5 #### This classic was a Christmas present , and was thoroughly enjoyed .
5 #### Great book . I enjoyed reading this . Very well written and has withstood the test of time . Still a great read in 2018 .
5 #### This is a tough uncompromising powerful book done as only Hemingway can . Hemingway put his hands into the entrails of life , his writing transcends rights or wrongs of morality politics history to be simply truthful . A profoundly human story of war , life , and love ...
5 #### This indeed is perhaps his best work as he places you inside the characters which are sketched precisely . Written in the middle of his career it captures much of his style . The images are clear and magnetic . The ending is gripping . One can feel the intense purpose and need to take out this bridge and yet see the fragilities of military strategy and execution . Certainly 4.5 to 5 stars and from my reading of most of his books and all of his short stories , this is my choice to recommend if one has to pick a single book . Cactus Ken
5 #### To hell with war . Read this book - its more about beauty than war , which makes the war bits all the more poignant but horrific . On to Gellhorn .
1 #### Watch out ! the link takes you to a short editon
3 #### I personally found this book way too long and slow - moving . I read A Farewell to Arms many years ago and remembered liking it better ( perhaps it was shorter ? ) . I stuck with it , and did like how it ended . But the copy I had contained numerous typos , which seems weird for a classic like this , and I found certain things annoying , like saying " the " Pilar or " the Maria " at times ( but not at others ) . I found this in another review - it was strange how he used the word " obscenity " instead of using a curse word . A quote near the end I enjoyed : " War is a bitchery " . Should n't it have been " War is an obscenity " ? Glad I read it , but done with Hemingway .
1 #### God ... was this a disappointment . I always heard how great Hemmingway 's writing was . It may be simple , but the story was crap . Just does not have much of a plot and it moves really slow . Must have been a different age .
5 #### For many people , Ernest Hemingway was the complete macho man writer . He actually was in combat and experienced what he wrote . This made many of his works believable and credible . For Whom the Bell Tolls is probably the best example of this . This book centered around s soldier in Spanish Civil War who 's has the job of blowing up a bridge . Hemingway puts great emphasis on the thoughts and feelings of this soldier . The reader gets a real sense of what it was like to be alive during this chaotic time . I can imagine how much thought Hemingway put into every single line in this book This book tragic and at the same time , it is a testament to how good a book can possibly be written . This is Ernest Hemingway 's finest work and I have read this book several times .
2 #### I found it somewhat difficult to follow and it was not as engaging to me .
1 #### Feel totally ripped off here . This is an abridged book , but nowhere does it say that on Amazon . I 'm sure the original is better . It 's not even a well - done abridgement . Obviously I have n't read the unabridged book , but I 've read enough Hemingway to know that an awful lot of the richness of his characters is missing .
5 #### A great read especially for those of us that are familiar with the Spanish civil war and events prior to our conflict with Germany
5 #### while I am not a big Hemingway fan - this particular book was just terrific .
3 #### The Kindle version of For Whom the Bell Tolls is not very good . I do n't know if that is because it is an abridged version like other reviewers claim or whether its just not a good story . If the Kindle version is indeed abridged , I would have expected Amazon.com to alert buyers that it was so . Basically , For Whom the Bell Tolls is the story of a critical mission by a band of rebels accompanied by an American sympathizer fighting for the Republic against the Fascists in Spain during the Spanish Civil War ( 1936 - 1939 ) . The rebels mission was to blow up a bridge , but the interplay among the characters leading up to the attack dominate the story .
3 #### This book is ok . Maybe I was expecting too much since it 's Hemingway , but I did n't find this story very compelling .
1 #### Abridged . 109 pages with extra large font . No publisher noted . DO NOT PURCHASE . Since there is no notation that this is abridged , there is no way to know in advance that every sentence not immediately not related to the main story line is omitted . Not worth the trouble and expense to return , but makes me think twice about trusting Amazon selections . Caveat emptor .
5 #### What can I say .... it 's Earnest Hemingway ... you love him .... or ? ? I holds my interest and I 'm a fan of Hemingway ..
1 #### Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs . I suggest you download a sample first to ensure you are getting the unabridged version . Hemingway 's actual pride is amazing , but this is not it . Amazon needs to pull this offering from its options , AND give the money back to everyone who was suckered into buying it
5 #### One of the seminal books of my life - having lived through the period . Hemingway at his best - lucid and romantic - and whether or not accurate historically , evocative of the cross - current antecedents to World War 2 .
5 #### I finally read a Ernest Hemingway novel . I am so glad I did . He truly was able to paint a picture with words . I felt I was there with the people in the hills of Spain . I now want to learn more about that civil war .
5 #### I have the original vinyl , was really pleased to play a quality sound reproduction .
5 #### I read this first as a high school student and lo these many years later , re - read it in preparation for a trip to Spain . It 's even better reading it as a seasoned adult . There 's a reason Hemingway was lauded as a writer . This tale breathes , and though I knew the ending , found myself absorbed in the story . Compelling read .
5 #### It 's Hemingway , it 's amazing , what else could one possibly say about this great work from this great man ?
5 #### This is a great classic novel that everyone should read .
4 #### It was as if Hemingway was cutting his teeth in writing this book . The last two chapters contain more poignancy than any of the others . Definitely worth the read , and , I might add , it is definitely worth looking at the history of this other civil war to put things in context .
1 #### Though his is my favorite Hemingway novel , this copy is full of errors such as missing periods . The relatively new and cheaper copies of Hemingway 's works that have become public domain and are sold on Amazon are not correct copies . This is a shame . It seems an easy fix for the worthless company selling these copies .
5 #### A wonderful tale of life , love , and loss . Hemingway focuses in on the details of what happens during war and leads the reader on a very emotional ride .
4 #### This is one of Hemingway 's longer novels and as others mentioned , perhaps it could have been shorter . The novel drags at times . Perhaps typical of the author 's style , he adds a lot of detail to events to make it seem to the reader like they are there alongside the characters . Although the author is incredible at this , it works better in his shorter novels like Farewell to Arms or The Sun Also Rises . Still , it is a great work and gives a glimpse into the people and issues surrounding the Spanish Civil War . Hemingway 's novels seem to have a way of evoking emotion from me and this one was no exception .
5 #### One of Hemingway 's best novels . Inside look at Facism and the period of the civil war in Spain and the cultures that were effected by the War . A love story with plenty of intrigue with the fascinating American political sympathizer , Robert Jordan .
3 #### Legendary writer , but understand it was written in a different time with a different style . If you love the classics , you 'll like it . If you 're used to more contemporary books , you will probably have a tough time getting into it . Good story , second Hemingway book I 've read , but I felt ' A Farewell to Arms ' was better . Would not recommend unless you fall into at least one of three categories : 1 . You have to read it for school 2 . You love Hemingway books and his writing style 3 . You love reading the classics and are experienced at reading books from the era .
4 #### The last hundred or so pages were thrilling , but the beginning of the book is rather slow . That said , it 's worth the read .
1 #### The kindle edition I read was a " knock - off " Hemingway . The text was weird and not lined up . When there was an obvious expletive in the dialogue , it actually was deleted and the word " obscenity " was placed .
5 #### Lots of testosterone . Beautiful stupid women . Ugly mean women and dripping with symbolism . Such a fun read . Now I think I 'll read another .
1 #### First Hemingway book I have read . It will be the last ! Could n't get through more than 100 pages . Written like a 10 year old . I do n't get his popularity .
1 #### I really hated this book - yes , I know it 's an American classic and all , and seems like everyone likes Hemmingway as an author , but this sure did nothing for me . Written as a small incident during the Spanish Civil War , I found it totally uninteresting and totally unbelievable - there was just no way I could " suspend my disbelief " , no matter how hard I tried - the storyline takes forever to unfold , telling the tale of a soldier sent to blow up a bridge during an impending attack 2 days hence and drags and drags and drags , never even getting to the " action " of the attack on the bridge - that 's bad enough , but Hemmingway somehow wants us to believe his totally UNBELIVEABLE story of the band of rebels and their interwoven relationship , during which the soldier and a girl somehow IMMEDIATELY fall into a deep and incredible love affair - WOW , what a disappointing piece of writing and an incredible waste of time reading this - absolutely nothing of interest or BELIEVABILITY in this boring and long drawn out story ......
5 #### I listened to this book on audio . I had never gotten around to it in my youth . The story still held up and the narrator did a great job . I got into the saga of Robert Jordan and Maria . Now I need to watch the movie version with Gary Cooper . The bad part of reading this book was that after listening to this quality fiction I next went to the audio on THE CIRCLE . The CIRCLE will probably be okay as far as it goes but the jarring comparison between quality Hemingway and this book is dramatic and a let down I will have to watch out doing this in the future .
4 #### I read in amazement , knowing of Hemingway 's fame I still felt surprise at his writing ability . When I read his Paris book he would return to his wife after a long day of writing by longhand . I now understand how difficult that must have been : to constantly be thinking of and feeling the tiny details while laboriously writing each word . This story of the Spanish civil war comes to the reader with such descriptive details that one can feel the dirt on their clothes and under the fingernails , and the cold dew of the morning . After all it is the details which causes a book to be readable and believable .
3 #### Tedious , not thought provoking , insipid and repetitive dialogue . Only one character with any depth was Pilar . Chapters involving Maria literally made me speak out loud " please make it stop " . Is all of his writing in the same style ? I really wanted to love Hemingway but this was truly awful .
4 #### Always direct and never boring . This is not my favorite Hemmingway story but still in the top five . I love the way he wrote .
1 #### I am talking about kindle version . this book is full of typos . I told amazon to revise this book but it is still same . Do not buy this book , it is worthless . Prabhat prakashan and amazon are kidding us .
3 #### just not into Hemingway , but at least I tried
4 #### Hemingway set this in the Spanish Civil War ( 1936 - 39 ) . Robert Jordan is an American professor of Spanish from Montana who has journeyed to Spain to fight against the Fascists / Nationalists on behalf of the Communists / Leftists . He is a dynamiter who has been tasked with blowing up a bridge . He spends a few days with Pablo 's band of guerrilla fighters . He falls in love with a young woman named Maria who has experienced a number of atrocities . In one long chapter , Hemingway describes the horror in which the Communists slaughtered Nationalists and their sympathizers in small towns at the outbreak of the war . He also has a somber tale of the last stand of another guerrilla party . There is love , loss , suspicion , betrayal , hope and regret that run throughout this . At times , Hemingway goes on longer than one may like . The payoff is in the end though . It ends brilliantly . This is not Hemingway 's best book on war - that would be " A Farewell to Arms . "
1 #### The kindle version is missing whole sentences , paragraphs , even pages . The book is worth reading , but get a hard copy or find a different e - book version .
5 #### Ca n't believe I 've never read this book . What a masterful job of storytelling . Historical fiction the way it ought to be .
5 #### I did n't finish it yet , but I am loving this book . Ernest Hemingway was the man !
5 #### Bought this book as a gift for my son . He liked it very much .
1 #### It 's a great book but the Kindle version sucks . Need my money back !
3 #### Like many reviewers I found it slow - paced . I , too , was annoyed by the typos and " obscenities " in the Kindle version . Come on , it 's not a children 's book . For the record , the speech ( use of " thou " ) is neither old - fashioned or formal . It 's an attempt to show in English the informal version of " you " as used among equals in Spanish . Cf . " tutoyer " in French . The sad part is you come to care for these characters but you know it will end badly .
2 #### Papa must have been on a binge when writing this novel .
5 #### Having begun to " read into " Hemingway a bit , one begins to realise that everything about his style , including the lack of correct grammar , ( as well as being the first writer to use the contracted form in literature , as everybody knows ) , has to do with conveying the feeling and the atmosphere of the places he is writing about , The more you read him , the more you read him , kind of thing . Hemingway 's ability to create emotion and atmosphere that " takes you there " , where the action is , is surprising , to say the least . Another : " ca n't put it down".book . A good read ! For those who do n't already know Hemingway .
5 #### This is the best of the Hemingway books , I am reading them all now that I am retired .
5 #### One of my favorite books . Hemingway has something of a minimalistic prose , yet hardly lacks powers of description . There 's a sort of eloquence in his not being so verbose ; something about omitting the excess yields a greater sense of profundity . For Whom the Bell Tolls has suspense , romance , camaraderie , war , and Robert Jordan , who is totally the man .
4 #### A very good story , but the author is somewhat wordy .
5 #### In the initial and final scene of the novel , teh protagonist , Robert Jordan , is alone lying on pine needles in the forest . That Jordan is alone ties into a major theme of the book . Jordan is a dynamiter who has been assigned to blow a bridge to prevent Fascist reinforcements being sent to repel an Republican attack in teh Spanish Civil War . Jordan , like everyone else , is caught up in great forces that are beyond specific human control . Even Golz , the Republican commanding general , is powerless to forestall the attack once it is set in motion to almost certain failure . Each individual must decide for themselves how they will deal with these forces . Some choose duty ; some choose to delight in cruelty . The partisan bands that Jordan recruits are bands of individuals each with their own motivations . They are together but each is alone in dealing with the overwhelming social forces driving the civil war . The novel is a series of character sketches revealing possible responses . Each must choose their own way and each must do this alone just as Jordan does at the beginning and the end of the novel .
5 #### Great read . A classic love story set during the Spanish Civil War . Captures the brevity and passions of life in war time .
1 #### How this novel came to be so renowned is something I ca n't for the life of me understand . About 90 % of the plot is delivered via conversations between the characters in a sort of proletariat narrative style that I found tiresome after only a few pages . I confess that I must lack the elevated culture needed to appreciate the rich imagery and gripping themes of such a complicated novel . It might have been easier if I did n't have to wade through the " thee " and " thine " and if Hemingway had just told the story instead of writing 480 pages of forced dialogue . To me it was an over - complicated story about a communist college professor who leaves America to go fight in a communist rebellion in Spain during which he is ordered to blow up a bridge . Along the way he seduces some local teenage girl , who is desperate to feel loved after being raped and abused . We 'd definitely call it pedophilia today , due to their age differences . He also reminisces about living it up and rubbing elbows with the communist leaders in a posh hotel they 've commandeered . He listens to some stories about the heinous atrocities and war crimes the communists commit in the outset of the uprising . It guess it 's supposed to be about the characters , not what happens , but I could n't care less ... it was boring as hell and I wish I had my money and time back .
1 #### I ca n't believe Uncle Ernie won the Nobel . There is no saying for taste . Why have people thought for the last 90 + years his writing , and this work in particular is so outstanding . Except for Old Man , possibly . Max Perkins knew how to hype . As did EH . This book sounds awkward in its translation and Amazon 's censorship surely did n't help . A man who was a macho - obcessed , egotiistical alcoholic finally found out reality in Idaho .
3 #### There 's something about one American 's self - importance in a small Spanish rebel group 's movement that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
5 #### I can not believe that we did not read this book in high school . It was recommended by a friend . It was hard to put down .
2 #### Not really thrilled . I 'll read more to see if I am a Hemingway fan . Old Man And The Sea was better imho .
5 #### Such a well - written book . Hemingway wrote vividly of what were then recent times , so this tale now stands as something of a taste of history come alive
5 #### Hemingway hits the heights in this novel . He wanted to compete with the heavyweights of writing , the big Russian novelists , and he gets there here . He risks a certain awkwardness here in order to extend his reach , reminding me of passages of Victor Hugo and Dostoevsky . Possibly Hemingway 's best novel , probably better than the perfection of The Sun Also Rises .
4 #### I reread this story because I recently went to Spain . I did n't love Heminway 's writing as much as I had remembered
5 #### Good Hemingway , maybe a little darker than some of the others
3 #### great characters and great story , however there was so much dialogue that It seemed like a screenplay
5 #### This is a strange , yet beautiful , book . Its strangeness comes from Hemingways insouciant approach to grammatical structure , syntax , and translation . One could even go as far as to say that the storyline and character development , albeit powerful , may also seem slow and tedious . What one can not deny , however , is Hemingways brilliant , surgical descriptions of what his characters feel , their thought processes , and their desires . Sure , it is a war novel with some compelling battle scenes , but for me the essence , the beauty , of the novel lies in between these scenes . If you want a fast , exciting , love story about the Spanish Civil War you might be better off looking elsewhere . But , if you want to know what killing and dying are like , what a broken leg or a bullet feel like , what absinthe or wine actually evoke in ones long - desiccated brain cells , or , what making love in the middle of the forest , in the middle of a cool night to a person you know you would like to spend eternity with but was only granted three days ; in essence if you want to know what life , in its most fugacious of moments , is really like then start reading For Whom the Bell Tolls and you will not be disappointed .
5 #### I read Hemingway 's masterpiece in high school , quickly followed by The Old Man and the Sea . Fifty years later , this novel seems like a new read . With my own life experiences in mind , each page offered insight and relevance . The possibility of love at first sight , and finding your soul mate amidst the chaos of war and death , was both sad and uplifting .
3 #### An excellent story but could easily had 50 to 100 pages edited out and been a much better read , it bogs down in several spots . Sometimes less is more
3 #### The author Ernest Hemingway has been my best author ever but this story had me quite confused although I know beforehand that that was his style of writing but personally I just kept reading just to finish the book . I really ca n't remember the ending of the book . The good part is he has so many other good books to read so I 'll pass this one as a fail in his part .
4 #### I enjoyed this book presented by Audible.com . I had never watched the movie so read this with fresh interest . It was an edge - of - your - seat story about a war described effectively through Hemingway 's mastery of the language . Although quite graphic ( it 's not a book for children ) it is a very well - developed story , with so much interesting detail I could picture every scene . The characters are colourful and vivid , the battles breathtakingly realistic , the ending ... not what this reader wanted . Even so , it was disappointing to reach the end .
3 #### I love Hemingway on Writing and A Moveable Feast as both have helped me become a better writer . The Old Man and the Sea made a huge impression on me as a kid , and Hemingway has always struck me as the ideal writer . This would be a perfect fit , right ? I do n't know why , but I 'm finding this book a little bit slow . I 'm still working on it , about 50 % complete , and not feeling the urgency to pick it up that I like to feel with nonfiction . No judgement until I 'm done , but I ca n't help but feel like Hemingway the Writer might be great than Hemingway the writer ...
2 #### One of the classics from Papa Bear . However , as much as I wanted to , I just could n't get into it . Maybe it 's the writing maybe it 's the slow dialog driven story with little action actually taking place . I gave it a go and after 100 pages or so , put it down . Thoroughly meh .
5 #### Having heard references to it most of my life , I finally decided to read it . I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would . Some very dark subject matter , but it had enough humour and romance sprinkled in to keep it from getting depressing . Excellent book .
5 #### This is perhaps my favorite of Hemingway 's major novels . I just re - read it . I revere it now for very different reasons than when I read it as a teenager , but I loved the world Hemingway created in it , and the ideas it embodies . He was a consummately romantic author . It 's nice every once in a while to return to a simpler time and simpler world . However , for many this is probably not an easy read .
3 #### If you are seeking to read a classic Hemingway I recommend A Farewell to Arms or the very much underrated To Have and Have Not before reading Bells . Bells is a solid story that would have been great at half the length . The language is vulgar and monotonous and the pacing is ponderous blasphemous I know but also true . The ending is classic and rewarding for those who persevere but do not make this you first novel from Papa .
5 #### The story deals with one man 's mission to blow up a bridge . But Hemingway does more than that with this masterpiece . He deals with Robert , the mercenary , and his interaction with the Republic group and him falling in love with a group member with a troubled past . Also there are epic flashbacks with one of the main group members and also Robert past . There 's a lot of info and every character introduced is treated as important to book .
2 #### With the exception of a few scenes , I found this a tedious read . Scholars please do n't jump me on this review . Yes , Hemingway can turn a pretty phrase now and then in this barren desert of a book .
1 #### This has always been one of my favorite books and I had n't read it a few years , so I took a chance and bought the audio version to listen to during a cross - country road trip . It . Is . Awful . Like , painfully awful . I actually like Campbell Scott as an actor , but no , no , no - he just does n't have the gravitas needed to narrate Hemingway . ( Be sure to listen to the audio sample before you buy ... )
1 #### I imagine that the reputation of this book as a classic has others afraid to admit that it is truly terrible . The book has a few , fleeting moments of absolute genius ( El Sordo 's fight , Pablo 's first uprising , etc . ) , but overall the book is horribly boring and completely unrealistic , at least to any American who has perhaps never experienced early 20th century Spanish culture . This entire book is basically a love story between main character , Robert Jordan , and Maria , set against the Spanish Civil War . What makes this so unrealistic is that the book takes place entirely over only three days , and at the beginning of the book Jordan and Maria have not yet met . So , in the course of just THREE DAYS , we are expected to believe that they go from complete strangers to in love in a way that defies comprehension . Not only is this unrealistic , but it is also SO BORING . There are literally entire chapters of just Robert Jordan and Maria telling each other how much they love each other . This book is described as a war novel , but its only a war novel in the sense that it takes place during the war . There is very little actual war that happens in this book . Basically , the book is boring . It was a struggle to get through , and I only finished it because my OCD forces me to finish books I have started . But I hated it .
3 #### I may have it in college . Or tried to . It 's a good tale with salient history and philisophy . But it is too long in light years and the writing is below average . I agree with those who argue Hemingway was not a great writer but perhaps a good story teller with an unusual narrative that gets very tiresome .
5 #### It 's wonderful to return occasionally to the books that have stood the test of time . Like Faulkner and Fitzgerald , Hemingway still knows exactly what words to use and what story to tell .
5 #### I love Hemingway 's works and have read all . He writes in a new style copied by many people . A rather breathless writing ... short and to the point .
5 #### If you read this book many years ago , it is worth reading again now .
1 #### I am not sure why I finished this book other then to say I have read a Hemingway . I have had root cannels that were less painful .
5 #### Have you ever read any Hemingway before ? Did you come to this title because ( a ) it is one of his best known works ( b ) you think you know a bit about Hemingway and therefore ( c ) there will be lots of blood , guts , heroics and manly goings - on ? I thought this might be a good introduction to Hemingway - a good adventure story with lots of action and heroism - a story i could enjoy in case I did not like the prose . Well , prepare to be delighted . The book contains all the things in the headline of this review and is absolutely not an action adventure story . It is a " true " story about the nature of war and how people affect it and are affected by it . What Mr Hemingway taught me is that he is a writer foremost and everything else after . He reminds us that he has been in actual war and that it affects very normal everyday people in generally awful ways . For them ( us ) there is no happy ending . If , like me , you have put off reading Hemingway because his novels were set decades ago , please put aside your apprehension and pick up this ( or any other ) book by him .
2 #### I wanted to read it because it is a classic and i like historical novels . However , it moves exceedingly slowly . I was able to persevere through about 2/3rds of it but just could not finish it . I wanted to get to the blowing up of the bridge but it is just too much of a waste of time .
5 #### Fantastic . I read this to get a better understanding of why Hemingway is seen as a great author . I will advise you to stick with the book . Like " A Clockwork Orange " , at the beginning the text can be hard to work through . It is because Hemingway was capturing what it 's like to speak a foreign language among native speakers . One of my favorite books that I read in 2015
3 #### I 'm glad I read it , but it was rather slow going for me . Lots of introspection by the main character . It made me do some research on the Spanish Civil War . Very interesting .
4 #### A master piece . The story of few nights into the fascist lines during the Spanish Civil war , where many things happen simultaneously and love and war share the same room . The alter ego of Ernest Hemingway makes many thoughts about the sense of our lives , it could be applicable for those times or perfectly in the current ones . The loneliness of the main character gives us the idea that life is for ourselves and for ours decisions and the end stresses the idea of building our own fate .
5 #### I read this book 40 years ago . I appreciated it even more this time .
5 #### superb story so very well written ..... passionate , sad , angry , suspensful ..... a great book deserving of a read .
5 #### For me this was a re - read after a span of 40 + years . I was dumbfounded by my most recent impressions and narrative images . I 've developed as a reader , certainly , but this time around I was captured by the drama , the characterizations , the depth of understanding of every aspect of the personal and political narrative . Plus , the subtle shift of language , Spanish to English and the distinction of the thinking and expression of the different characters . And the contemporary nature of terrorism and political applications to our ' world , ' these " Bells " continue to toll for everyone . Not forgetting the drama , the timeline of several plot developments . I was captured . I was armed . And I was in love , too .
5 #### Simply brilliant . Gripping and impossible to put down . He takes you by your heart and mind and refuses to let go . I ought to have read this and other Hemingway sooner . My life might have been enriched and more wisely led had I done so . The ending was a disappointment and struck me as artificial in more than one way . Saying that , however , does not suggest what might have brought to novel to a more satisfactory conclusion . After all , we already know the war was lost in the end . Not why , but that it was . So perhaps Hemingway 's ending , or something like it , was unavoidable . I have already commented on Hemingway 's difficulties with endings in my review of Farewell to Arms . Nodding to his admirable , Nobel - winning economy of style , I wo n't repeat it here .
4 #### Supposedly it is Hemingway 's best novel , and having not read any other of his works , I will say it was quite good and am impressed . The use of syntax and older styles of modern English to show when they are speaking in Spanish ( and having actual Spanish peppered in ) was refreshing and felt authentic . The plot , they must blow up a bridge with a ragtag band of rebels to assist in an attack , was good . And , of course , the love story was believable . My one complaint is sometimes the internal narratives would go on , and on , and on , and on . It was effective as a literary device to show a rambling conscious , but it got tiresome . Other than that , Hemingway 's beautiful descriptions of war , love , and even the mundane task of putting a notebook in a breast pocket of a baggy shirt are reasons to enjoy reading this book . I particularly liked the recounting of what they did to the fascists in the village - I felt like I was there .
5 #### you know what you 're gettign with hemingway . never fails to deliver
5 #### Hemingway shows his masterful ability to express profound ideas through a narrative made up primarily of action and dialogue . The reader follows a taut string , like the wire stretched by the dynamiter to the charge . He hopes the wire will be long enough so he can stay clear of the explosion when it comes , but he ca n't escape it 's awesome power .
2 #### Slow & boring until the last 150 pages . Only stuck with it to say I 'd read this classic book .
5 #### Ernest Hemingway 's place in the history of literature grows by the decade . This work is timeless even if it is set in a civil war that took place during the 1930s . Superbly written , this story is about ordinary people who took up arms during the Spanish Civil War . Only Hemingway could have told the story with such nuance , colour and passion .
3 #### Some insights into developments before WWII . Good drama among / between characters .
5 #### A fatalistic depiction of the Spanish Civil War and a stark reminder that no one is safe from war .
3 #### Ah , Robert Jordan Robert Jordan Robert Jordan . Maybe all authors repeated their main characters ' full names back then but it got to the point where I loved reading pages that described other character 's activities : Pilar Pablo Maria Karkov Augustin Anselmo . Then it was back to Robert Jordan Robert Jordan Robert Jordan . Yes , Hemingway ( or rather Ernest Hemingway ) does have a way with words when describing character 's inner thoughts during wartime and maybe it did n't bother me as much as other reviewers . I think this novel is considered a " classic " because Ernest Hemingway ( darn , he 's got me doing it now ) was pretty much the first to write in his style , maybe not , maybe I 'm reaching here ) . Regardless , I may have read all of his novels back in the day and now that I 'm a " mature " adult I 'm revisiting his novels but he 's sure not my favorite author at this point . I 'm giving it three stars because EH does know the mind workings of men in combat , sounding pretty authentic .
3 #### I will admit first that I am not an Ernest Hemingway fan . I think he 's an overrated author . I find his writing boring and too elementary . With that said , this book was fairly entertaining . There was a lot more to it than " The Sun Also Rises " for example . This book actually has a plot , and an interesting one at that . Hemingway spends a lot of time focusing on the love relationship that develops between the main protagonist and a young woman . Unfortunately it is quite boring because I feel the woman is not a well developed character . In my opinion , it 's essentially a good short story that he stretched out with a lot of filler to be a novel .
2 #### I know it 's a classic , but I could n't relate to any of the characters , and decided not to even finish reading it . Just not enjoyable for me !
5 #### There are war stories and there are war stories . Hemingway 's reputation is solidified by this one , principally because of its alternating internal monologs , character constructions , and its fastidiousness of understanding of the Spanish Civil War . You learn a lot along the way . In Homage to Catalonia , Orwell wrote " first of all the physical memories : the sounds , the smells , the surfaces of things " Hemingway has all of those in spades . I do n't give 5s easily .
3 #### Hemingway was a fascinating guy , but an overrated writer . The book is good , but not great .
1 #### Because of the title and the author , I slogged through this ... but I think it would be better in Spanish or not at all . The sentence structure jumps a lot making it stifr ( subj - verb , subj - verb ) . The narrations switch mid - sentence from third person to first person regularly . This may be to get the info to the reader and then jump in the head of the character , but it 's confusing . The repetition is over the top . Again , it often shows the obsession of thought of a character , but it makes me want to jump to the next paragraph . Do n't think I missed anything when I did that . I like some other of Mr Hemingway 's literary contributions , and I do recall watching this movie when much younger , but ugh ... Only finished because it was a looong plane ride and I thought I should to understand what others see . Either I failed or EH did .
3 #### This book is a little dated and the Spanish dialogue and the interpretation becomes a little tiring . The use of " obscenity " instead of the real word is cute but was a requirement in order to get published at that time .
4 #### One of most difficult reads that I have encountered . Primarily because of the location and the use of Spanish phrases and individual words that need translation from time to time . All and all it was a really good story that just continued to get better as I got further into the story .
5 #### This book really made me think . Fantastically well written . A great author at the heights of his ability .
4 #### This was the first Hemingway book I have read . I really enjoyed it . Yes , it is fairly repetitive at points with the dialogue . But , it was a strong , rich story that I really truly enjoyed . I plan on reading more Hemingway in the future .
5 #### Fascinating , OK , sometimes a little boring but a jewel for the English language . I realised two things ; Whenever I had time I HAD to continue reading and I could not stop thinking , imagining what was happening in the book . A must for ESL students to broaden their vocabulary .
5 #### Hemingway had a wonderful talent for writing romantic / love scenes . As you read it , it 's strange to remember that this is all happening over the course of a few days . So much is going on inside with the characters : their thoughts and feelings about things . In some ways it 's predictable , but I still enjoyed it .
5 #### How someone can write so forcefully and completely and so simply baffles me . And I could n't put this wonderful delicious friend of a book down .
4 #### Compelling story about a small group of rebels in the sSpanish civil war 1936 - 39 .
5 #### If you do n't know Hemingway this is a great start . Young writers can profit from his simple sentence structure .
5 #### Hemingway has perfect balance telling this story . A balance between characters , war and love . At chapter 39 I was tempted to move forward to the end of the book to see the final outcome but I felt that was cheating the words of the author who wonderfully described the journey up to that point . So moving to the end I was satisfied that the decision was not correct , that would be cheating the author and would not be mine to take . Most of all , moving ahead at that point is something I never do , but this story and this author challenged me .
3 #### This book has the Hemingway gritty voice . War is hell . People become victims of themselves as influenced by their circumstances.the love story was too obligatory , too perfect and too predictable . Had to read the study aid to see why it was so highly considered .
5 #### Book looks good and arrived in a short amount of time .
4 #### This is Hemingway 's war novel . It deals with modern war of the 1930s with a kind of objectivity that is not found in " Farewell to Arms " . It is the second time I 've read this novel in almost fifty years and I must say it does not travel well , though it does not disappoint as far as its coverage of making war goes . The relationship between Roberto and Maria seems dated , overly romanticized , and too convenient as a plot device , especially since Hemingway seemed to be taking extra trouble -- for instance the way he renders guerilla and gypsy profanity in the text as " obscenity " -- to be authentic in his writing . The depiction of the various guerilla soldiers and gypsies as well as the Royalist soldiers is worth reading the book for . The ebook publication had few problems .
5 #### I enjoyed the book the whole way through . The different point of views through the different characters ' writings was an interesting was to deveop the story line . As the story develops , the more characters you get to " see " . Worth the read !
5 #### Just a quick note : I recently reread this when I was reminded of the complexities of the Spanish Civil War by a magazine article . The book did what I dimly remembered it did : it showed the local , human dimension of the war rather than the history book battle of ideologies we usually see . What I had nt remmbered was the subtlety and complexity of the love story . I ve always thought Hemingways ability to present love has been underrated by many people who prefer to focus on the unwillingness of many of his characters to talk about their feelings . Its true , his characters generally do n't have much to say on the subject , and even their inner monologues tend to be sparse , but Hemingway still manages to express his characters deep , vital and nuanced feelings . I think the lack of verbiage is part a reflection of the view expressed by many of his characters that it does nt do to talk about significant things too much and part the simple fact that the characters themselves do n't understand what they 're feeling . Hemingway was a fabulous writer , and much of his work , though clearly rooted in his time period , still stands up to scrutiny today .
5 #### Excellent book . No one writes like Hemingway . Every dedicated reader ought to explore his work .
5 #### Incredible story . Classic . Must read . Hemingway at his best .
4 #### After finishing this book I feel like I want to read it again in order to fully appreciate it . The book 's dialogue is written in English but is describing conversations that are occurring in Spanish . So Hemingway writes in formal old English and following the syntax of the Spanish language . This makes it a more authentic experience but somewhat more difficult to read . Most of the story concerns the thoughts of the main characters as they prepare themselves to die in battle very soon . So be prepared for a depressing set of thoughts and expressions .
4 #### This is my favorite by Hemingway thus far . Loved all the characters , all seemed very life - like . Enjoyed his mastery over writing the characters dialogue , their exact Spanish dialect . Different , but enjoyable . Definitely liked the main character , Robert . Wish the ending had been different , though . I wanted a happy ending , I suppose , where they all got away . That 's why I gave it 4 stars . I 'd recommend it to all whom love classic novels , as well as historical fiction , action , or war novels . Many would love this book .
4 #### Hemingway is an extremely famous author but for me , some of his books do not live up to the legend . This , however , is my favourite . Just read it .
4 #### My friends hate Hemingway because of Old Man and the Sea . I promise you this book is n't another required reading snooze fest . This reads better for youth . I could n't put it down during summer after my Junior year of high school .
5 #### I hate this book but he service was great . I had to read it for a history class . It 's good if you like this genre or this writer but I was n't crazy about it
5 #### This is one of Ernest 's best books , about love , war , life and the dangers of death in warfare . Written just three years after the Spanish Civil War , it puts the human cost of conflict in perspective , involves , betrayal , and the naive notions of trust in a difficult world . As with many of his earlier books , For Whom the Bell Tolls , is the story of love and devotion , cut short by chance , and world forces that were girding for the Second World War . ( Germany and Italy both sent " volunteers " to fight the Spanish Loyalists under Franco , a brutal dictator . Still as fresh and engaging as when it was released in 1940 . If you love good writing , get , For Whom the Bell Tolls .
2 #### Story could have been better , at least i expected it to be . Not satisfied , to long sentences , cloudy explanations .
5 #### This novel is classic Hemingway , It recounts several days in the life of robery Jordan , tasked by the leftists io infiltrate enemy lines and dynamite a bridge to support an upcoming attack against the Fascist forces . It is the story of a man 's actions in war and his sense of honor and the choices men must make in times of conflict . This book has been sitting on my shelf for 40 years , unread , and now , it has activated my thirst for all things Hemingway .
5 #### A real masterpiece . Could n't put in down . I look to re - reading certain of his other works
5 #### This book provided some insight into the Spanish Civil war that caused me to do some research ; and verify . My previous interest in the Spanish Civil War was the popular version that it was dominated by Germany and Italy . Specifically the trial of their weapons and tactics . I now know that the Russians were very involved on the Republican side and used this conflict to try their terror tactics and political manipulation .
5 #### Outstanding war novel , colorful and consuming description of atmosphere within a guerrilla group during civil war , mixed with human stories , philosophy , and some romance
3 #### I enjoyed the story , but it could be slow at times . I prefer Hemingway 's " The Old Man and the Sea " .
5 #### There are only a few books I 've read more than once or twice , and this is one of them . I come back to it every year . I remember it as if I 'd breathed the air the myself and had my own feet on the ground . It 's an amazing thing .
5 #### Excellent character development and a look into an almost forgotten piece of world history . One of the best war novels I have read .
5 #### I read exerpts from this book in college but never finished the whole thing . Sorry that I took so long to read it in its entirety . Excellent read . Great characters and an ending that made me want to cry .
5 #### I started this book but had to set it aside as I had another one assigned to read first . Will get back to it soon I hope . Enjoyed what I did read . Obviously Ernest Hemingway does not need any kudos from me as this is a classic .
4 #### Hemingway was a bit wordy in this book , albeit appropriate . Took a bit to read . I liked his other novels better , but one should certainly read this one too ...
5 #### A well written reminder of the Spanish Civil War which is not remembered by many Americans .
5 #### This is not an easy read , but is a most rewarding read . Written as a translation from familiar Spanish , the ' thee 's and thou 's " may take the reader a bit of time to get used to . Hemingway makes a number of statements during the book about religion that were interesting . For the last 10 % or so of the book , I could n't put it down ! Powerfully written , it is in every way a classic well worth reading .
5 #### Hemingway 's book is a true 20th - century classic . His language is poetic and the characters are vibrant and real . It is a very touching story with a heart - breaking ending . His portrayal of romance and intimacy is extremely beautiful - poetry . For anyone who cares about great literature , this is a must read !
3 #### It is hard to get past the archaic language . Thee , thou , dost , wilt . And the main character , Robert Jordan , is always referred to by full name . I had read it many years ago and had forgotten how awkward to language is .
5 #### I like Hemingway 's form of writing . The story is based on historical events , and thus it 's very interesting to me . I learned a lot from it about the Spanish Civil War and about their culture and attitudes .
5 #### This was the first Hemingway I have read . Thoroughly impressive . Beautifully written .
5 #### Great love story . Wonderful insight into human nature . Slow narrative during horrendous wartime conditions in the Spanish mountains . Reflective and insightful of Spanish customs , religion , etc .
3 #### I had never read any Hemingway and so decided to try one . Overall , it was a good ( but not great ) read . The characters are well drawn and believable and his writing is descriptive and evocative . I would have rated it higher but the plot was not of particular interest to me ( it 's about an American who is on a mission to blow up a bridge with the help of some guerillas during the Spanish Civil War ) . One point I really liked was his use " mucking " as an obcenity , rather the f - word , as persumably this was more acceptable at the time !
4 #### This book is everything it is described as : stark , brutal , beautiful , sad , simple and touching . While I prefer some of Hemingway 's other work ( notably , The Sun Also Rises ) due to the prose and style , this book goes deeper and explores the impact of war and love in a more fulfilling fashion . Highly recommended .
5 #### What can you say about Hemingway that has n't been said ?
5 #### I 'm auditing a graduate class of 20th Century history based on Ernest Heminway 's life which includes some of his works . This is classical Hemiingway , weaving possible actual real acquaintances into his fictional accounts . He actually witnessed the Spanish Civil War as a journalist at the Republican front , so the reader gets a feel for the Guadarrama Mountains , an area I have visited . Having met Spaniards , including an occasional gypsy , Hemingway 's romanticized portrayals come more to life for me . At 68 years of age and having taught college history for 18 years and traveled to Spain four times , the author 's narratives seem more meaningful and enjoyable to me . Just my personal perspective , but I look forward to reading the rest of his works .
5 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls is a book about many things . One important message ; happiness is not measured by the length of ones life .
5 #### Among his greatest , without a doubt . A must in your Hemingway library . Search Hemingway at gordonsgoodreads.com
5 #### great book . Makes me wonder why I hated having to read it in high school .
5 #### Overall it was as good as I thought it would be , but in some ways I was surprised how much it underwhelmed me . For instance , I found myself bored again and again with the back - story . It did n't seem to move the story along and its only purpose seemed to be increasing the page count . I also found the dialogue between Robert and Maria to be very strange at times . Normal people would n't be saying these things . I think I 'll read The Old Man and the Sea after I finish The Good Soldier ( which is good so far , but different ) and I 'll probably like Old Man more than this one .
5 #### Being a Hemingway fan I thought this was one of his earliest best .
5 #### If you have n't read Hemingway , this book will make you love his writing . The subject is war of course , and that 's not pretty , but he says so many amazing things with so few words . Beautiful in it 's way .
4 #### A great story and in the space of just a few days you feel like you 've known the characters your whole life and are taking part in their experiences .
4 #### Very simply this a story that everyone should read I first read it 40 years ago and it is just as good today as it was then
3 #### It is probably arrogant to not think Hemingway 's work is great . However , I do n't like fiction and only read this to learn more about the Spanish civil war . It was helpful about that objective and the story was ok . However , in the end I probably should have stuck with non - fiction . I have never liked the " person " Hemingway and this book did n't change my mind . As I read I kept thinking about Hemingway 's Communist loyalty . That made me mad . Also , I do n't like love stories . The good news is the American Communist " hero / lover " dies at the end .
5 #### Hemingway is a superb writer with great emotional depth in describing the Spanich Civil War .
3 #### Ok , the man is the master . The guy who invented modern English literature and all that . He fought wars and this book is about one of them , the Spanish Civil War , which Hemingway witnessed as a reporter . Here , the main character is also an American , in this case an university professor who decided to fight for the Spanish republic and is caught in the midst of a guerrilla group trying to demolish a bridge , a secret mission given to him by a Russian general who is planning an offensive to change the course of the war against the fascists . Our hero arrives at his destination and , in four days everything happens : he finds the love of his life , he understands that maybe the noble cause of the republicans is already corrupt , he reconciles with his father , he understands all about human nature and , well , it is only possible that all that finishes in one way . Honestly , it is a bit to much and at certain points the book suffers from the urge that Hemingway has to get it quickly and exhaustively . Some passages are very good , even memorable , but in general it was a dragging experience . It took me much more than the four days during which the story unfolds to finish it . Worth the reading , for purely historical reasons , but I left with something missing here . And a bit disappointed .
4 #### gritty and desperate and hopeless . no one tells a tale like this as well as Hemingway . if you have n't read it , read it .
3 #### A little dated . The thou and thy and obscenities were a distraction . Most revealing were Hemingway 's insights into suicide
3 #### I was supposed to read this book in high school , but skimmed over it instead of reading it . I decided to go back and read it and now I understand why I skimmed . The story was good , but I do n't know why he is considered one of the great authors of our time . His writing , in my opinion , is boring and confusing . I did not care for his grammar or run - on sentences . I found it difficult to follow his use of the word " obscenity " in place of the actual word . I finally caught on half way through a long paragraph . He also switches from using " thee " and " thou " to " you " and " your . " It was just confusing to follow . Other than that , the story was good , though his descriptions are tedious . He is a long - winded writer .
5 #### This was my first Hemingway novel , and I 'm hooked . There is love , hate , war , peace , life , and death . A must read !
3 #### Reviewing a true classic of American literature is never easy , and in the case of Hemingways For Whom the Bell Tolls , it becomes even more difficult . I first read Hemingway ( The Sun Also Rises ) in college , more than fifty years ago . I remember at the time being unimpressed , unlike many of the reviewers of that book here on Amazon . My goal in life has been , for years , to read at least one of the classics each month . So I am quite able to appreciate the differences in various writing styles starting with Homer and all his descendants . For example , a few months ago I read Lord Jim , by James Conrad . As a reader , I found it quite intriguing . As a writer , I found myself highlighting many passages that caught my imagination with Conrads beautiful prose that delivered complex ideas or emotions , and vivid descriptions that imprinted themselves on my mind . In contrast , in FWTBT I found only two passages particularly memorable . The writing , aside from its many new and unique techniques , is definitely literary , as opposed to the story - tellers . I also found Hemingways style to be ponderous and repetitious So if the reader is searching for a good , compelling story that holds your interest while it delivers its message , then FWTBT will leave you disenchanted . If you are seeking a literary tale that describes the confusion and immorality of war , then Hemingway will not disappoint .
5 #### I had to stop this twice so I would n't get choked up . Campbell Scott 's reading brings this classic to life .
3 #### Excellent book , but there were issues with this Kindle version and bad editing .
5 #### ... this novel is a classic .. the civil war of Spain is covered in a story of great drama .. it provides me with an insight of this historical event with a story .. a background to understand what was going on at this moment of time ... as always , Hemingway is still at the top of that small group of exceptional writers ..
5 #### Beautiful soft paperback . Great font and size and spacing , important as I grow older and the eyes care about these things . Great story .
5 #### This is a classic and there is really no need to write anything on the story . A book for all generations ' reading . Its timing , its description of people 's minds , its description of action scenes , all of it , makes the book a must to read for everybody .
5 #### What can I say that has n't been said before ? This is a masterpiece of American literature . There is an immediacy and intensity to the prose that captures the imagination .
5 #### Read the first 50 pages and put it down and have n't opened it in since . Great book , just need more time .
5 #### My first Hemingway book . I made a vow when I got my kindle , that I would read the " classics . " To say this is a book about war , would be a disservice to the reader . Really about love , forgiveness , fear , hope , and living " in the moment . " Who knew Hemingway was so zen ? ! Read this book !
5 #### Finally got around to reading this classic . It was worth the wait . Great book .
5 #### It 's a little slow but certainly a great novel if you have the patience .
4 #### Interesting story , but drawn out second by second , breath by breath of 4 days . Made for a long read . Interesting tough for a classic
4 #### A great novel with histrical and human dramas that inters tus all ! !
3 #### I really did n't like this book . I gave it three stars in deference to Hemingway 's fame . As reminiscences of war go , it is probably quite accurate , except for the ending . The gory and grisly scenes were not ones I would have voluntarily chosen to read , but this was a book club selection . Hemingway 's style may have been revolutionary at the time , but ( forgive me ) it reminds me of my elementary school reading textbooks , " See Jane run . See Spot run . Run , Spot , run ! " Also , Hemingway includes a lot of Spanish phrases , which he does or does not translate , to show you he learned Spanish .
5 #### Best Hemingway by far . If you do n't read this book , you 'll never know you what an amazing read you missed out on . READ THIS ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I loved this book . It takes you right into the war zone -- you feel it .
5 #### I 'm not sure what I can say about Ernest Hemingway that wo n't seem superfluous to what has been said for so many years before . For Whom The Bell Tolls is the best written book I have ever read . Ernest Hemingway was a gifted genius and if you have n't read this book and are considering whether you should or not , just read it . It is beautiful and brutal and tender and real and I 'm going to go on and read more of what this great writer has left us . I only hope you get the same pleasure I received reading this masterpiece .
5 #### I came to Hemingway late in life . Enjoyed several of his books , Movable Feast is very good but this is the best so far . What struck me most was Hemmingways profound understanding of thoughts under a variety of circumstances . Great read .
4 #### I had trouble understanding some of the stylized writing , however , he nailed his characters , in particular , " Rabbit " .
3 #### There are quotes in this book that are so relevant and important that they are in my notebook . I use one of them often .
5 #### This story takes place during the Spanish Civil War and is about an American Robert Jordan who joins the International Brigades . He is on assignment to blow up a bridge . The story is largely about Jordan and those he recruits to help him . The interaction between the characters is earthy and colorful . The author does an exceptional job at bringing them to life figuratively speaking . He paints a believable picture of their behavior , suspicions , doubts , beliefs , love and trust and difficulties . What happens in a few days feels like a year 's worth of experiences . This reading is for adults .
5 #### I just re - read this after twenty years . Since then , I 've been to my own war as a Marine Infantryman . Papa 's characterization of interacting with indigenous forces is spot on , as is his storytelling . Compelling use of language to convey emotion . Fantastic read .
5 #### This was the first Hemingway novel that I 've read . I 've enjoyed some of his short stories . This novel is very good . The characters are vivid , the dialog is second to none , and the atmosphere it creates in the readers mind is very realistic . Reading books like this makes me want to write .
4 #### I wish there were a Spanish dictionary appended to the book . I knew from the beginning the story would end badly , but enjoyed the writing .
5 #### Hemingway 's insight into the human heart is without peer .
3 #### A good story well told but not as good as I was expecting .
5 #### Hemingway brings a harsh narrative to the stories I grew up hearing about the dust bowl and the Great Depression from my mother and grandmother who lived in Arkansas during this period . Truly the great American novel , beautifully written .
1 #### When I was 18 ( more than 50 years ago ) I started reading " Across the River and into the Trees " . Hated it - never got past 50 pages . Recently I thought I should give Hemingway another chance , and have been reading his first three novels . Guess what - I do n't like any of them . They are all bad in different ways , but For Whom the Bell Tolls is particularly bad . This is the one where " the earth moves " ! The one where the Spanish speak a weird and annoying 18th century English . The one where Hemingway 's supposedly terse style can go on for dozens of pages of very boring digressions . At least 200 pages should have been cut out . An interesting read anyway because I ca n't understand why this very dated and flawed novel gets plenty of 5 star ratings .
5 #### It 's an excellent piece of literature . It is a hard read at points and includes scenes that make you question why Hemingway put them in the book . However , its style is interesting , and its themes remain valid to this day . Well worth the read .
3 #### Finally ... Somehow during high school , college and grad school I dodged having to read a book by this author . Not an English major , but science and business major . So I read it and it was okay , not sure if I am missing something , but I found it very drawn out , and the ending to be anti - climatic . Will give him another go , but was disappointed .
1 #### I 'm Sane ! I 'm Sane after all ! I just picked up this and Old man , and I reeled when I saw the meaningless mumbo jumbo and dry dialogues . I felt depressed at a world that appreciates something that is so senseless to me . But the first and second star reviews have raised my spirits ! I thought really bad overrated authors only existed today but looks like even the big names are frauds . The " Lazy and messy " review by G Mon really nailed it as do several others . Puc'me but there are some silly pretentious people around raving about this garbage - famous author my rear . I only even flipped through it myself , did n't dare to read it . As soon as as I saw the inane blather I almost wanted to choke the book to death . With these dull Robert Jordan types talking like this in his head no wonder Ernie chose to snuff it . If there 's one thing I 've learned through much trial and error over the years is - DON'T STRUGGLE to like and endure something even if it 's rated the best thing there is ! Funny how agnostics and atheists have no trouble forming their own blind religion . Too many confused teachers despair about kids not reading , but did you consider WHAT you 're asking them to read ? ? There 's no such thing as an OBJECTIVE classic ! Take this heavy fat volume of Hummingbird 's and shove it right up your !
5 #### You know when you pick up a Hemingway book that it is going to end in tragedy , but I still found myself wondering and hoping that this one might end differently . Hemingway was a reporter in Spain during that country 's civil war ( 1936 - 39 ) , so he knows firsthand about what he is writing - not merely the landscape and city names , but the mindset of the people , the devastation wrought by the war , the inhumanity of each side toward the other , and all the small human tragedies interwoven with the national tragedy . The dialogue might seem strange to someone who does n't know Spanish ; all the dialogue is written as if it were directly translated from Spanish , including the formal addresses " thee " and " thou , " and things like that . If you know Spanish it wo n't bother you ; if you do n't know Spanish , the dialogue ( although not the narration ) reads a bit like Shakespeare , and maybe even makes this book feel a little more classy than his other writing . At the end of the day , I love Hemingway , and he is a legend for a reason . Buy this book .
1 #### I was disappointed in this book . I usually do n't have a problem with dialects , etc . , but this got on my last nerve . I 'm not sure I finished it . Expected much more judging by all the hype .
4 #### This is a great novel . A young American is fighting for the Republic against Franco 's forces during the Spanish Civil War . The story recounts his roughly three days leading up to and including the objective he has been tasked to complete with the help of some local partizans . I would give five stars were it not for the way in which Hemmingway translates the intimate pronouns in Spanish ( namely the second person " tu " ) into the archaic " thee " ( and accompanying " thou " , " thine " , etc ) . There is a boatload of this dialog and I felt it detracts from the story , since in this modern age such terms seem archaic . One feels as if he 's reading the King James Bible at times . Beyond that , the story builds to the climactic mission on the third morning , and the action is spellbinding . A definite addition to my favorites list .
1 #### To much Hemingway ways of communication , did not enjoy at all
5 #### This is a classic , so I wo n't say much other than it is one of the best I have ever read .
5 #### Great story ... that I probably had n't read since high school ! What a story - teller ! I 'm going to go back to read more Hemingway .
3 #### I have tried reading Ernest Hemingway for the third different book and I have difficulty reading him . The prose is difficult to follow for he generally does not say who is talking and it makes hard reading for me . This is the last book of his I will read .
5 #### Rad book . I 've been living in Spain for the last 9 months and loved reading this book while here . I found the story and characters to be very genuine .
4 #### It was Hemingway , it was a classic , it was a satisfying read . Enough said . Not as moving as the Old Man and the Sea .
5 #### Very exciting . There is something special about Hemingway . I can see why this was a classic . Interesting use of the language .
4 #### Ca n't get any better than Hemingway but there were too many deleted words . PLease state this is an edited version .
5 #### Fifty years after my first reading , I enjoyed it all over again , this time near the scene of the action in Spain . Flawed in some ways , as critics have noted , it remains a powerful and arresting story .
5 #### Autobiographical , descriptive to the detail of character and surroundings , grasping human nature at is bitterest and its sweetest , a pleasure to read indeed !
4 #### I am starting to read these classics now because I goofed off too much in school . As I read sotries like this and the other classics I regret now reading them in school . I missed so much . '
3 #### Bought this because its my favorite Hemingway but , was looking forward to the reproduction dust jacket that was featured in the description . Disappointed .
3 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway is the story of Robert Jordan , a young man who is caught up making explosives for the rebels in the Spanish Civil War . He 's contemplative and slow - to - act , the opposite of the explosives he is in charge of detonating . We meet up with Jordan once he is tasked to blow up a bridge , a bridge that is pivotal to the war effort . He goes into the mountains to meet with a band of rebels who are to help him destroy the bridge and attack the base on the other side of the bridge . Jordan meets and falls in love with a young Spanish woman Maria and the story reaches it 's climax when he is forced to make a tough decision and blow the bridge without the proper equipment . Like many of Hemingway 's novels , For Whom the Bell Tolls was quite wordy . There was a lot of talk and not a lot of action . Honestly , I preferred Hemingway 's The Old Man and the Sea and A Farewell to Arms . The novel was interesting . I 'm glad I powered through it , as it is considered a classic , but not my favorite of his work . Excellent writer , but I 've seen better work out of him . -Sarah [ ... ]
4 #### As I read him I just liked his books . Great stories , have read most of his works and just gel with him .
5 #### Hemingway really did excellent work when he wrote this novel based on his experiences covering the war in Spain . I especially liked his description of his main characters female lover . It gives a good idea of what the guerrillas did behind Fran cos lines . I really enjoyed the ugly women who had in her life many young handsome swashbuckling lovers who were matadors . This reminds me of advice I have given to women many times in my life essentially if you are a women and you like a guy pursue him it 's really a buyers market for women when it comes to men in that respect .
2 #### I did n't like it -- too depressing -- killings , , blood , war -- who needs it , even if t was Hemmingway . The main character in the book , Robert , may have been a self study of Hemmingway himself ! !
5 #### I 've been looking for a nice paperback copy to add to my collection and this was it ! ! ! Very good condition and good price .
4 #### Precise and elegiac in the opening pages , ponderous and self - indulgent for much of the middle , and finally , at its end , heartbreakingly genuine . It 's fashionable these days to poke fun at Hemingway 's excesses , but when the stars aligned , my god that man could surely write .
4 #### A great read , and informative about that era of history . My first Hemingway book . but not my last . Thank you .
5 #### Geez , who am I as a novice author to make a comment or review on Hemingway . I read this book to gain an insight into dialogue . What an insight that was . It runs from start to finish . I had an advantage of having seen the film , albeit a long time ago but , that made the book even more interesing to me personally as I could not only read the dialogue but visualise the characters better and hear them in my mind . It taught me a great deal and I hope some of it will rub off into my own future scribbles . I will now be reading other works of his
5 #### Hemingway is arguably one of the best war novelists to have ever lived , and For Whom the Bell Tolls shows why . He describes the scenery so well that one can picture witnessing the landscape first hand . The characters are pretty well developed too . Definitely great for those who love war novels , historical fiction , and/or love stories .
5 #### I read many , many books . I read many good books . But I read few books that are masterpieces and that I * know * are masterpieces before I 've even finished them . This is one of them . Hemingway is a writer of many virtues and his share of faults . All his virtues and few of his faults are on display here . He brings to life a little skirmish in a " little " war that would perhaps be largely forgotten by most of the world were it not for this very book . His characterizations ( with the exception of Maria , who however well she serves her purpose , is still , frankly insipid ) are brilliant . Jordan is easily one of his most likable and relatable heroes , Pilar one of his best female characters . The conflict , and especially the climax in the last fifty pages , is electric . Thought - provoking , moving , entertaining - what more can you ask from a book ?
5 #### This is one of Hemingway 's most powerful novels . It has everything ; Gripping characters , both realistic and unrealistic , mystery , suspense , unexpected facts , fear , drama , history . There are not enough superlatives to describe this classic novel . Do nt miss reading this one .
5 #### I enjoy the character development and vivid descriptions of his narrative . I 'm glad after all these years to finally finding out why Hemingway is ranked so highly as a writer .
5 #### It 's hard to write a a concise review for this wonderful novel that would begin to capture the emotion and vitality within its pages . Read the Amazon description for a plot summary ; but do n't be fooled into thinking it 's a black and white story about the Spanish Revolution . Hemingway has an amazing way of capturing the sheer humanity of the whole undertaking . The Reds , the fascists , the anarchists and the uncommitted are all examined and ultimately shown as being human beings first , and political creatures second . At the same time it is the ultimate war novel and love story . Hemingway delves into Jordan 's perspective of the characters and is vivid in his description of the Spanish countryside while also maintaining a near stream of consciousness of intelligent thoughts . The simultaneous vitality and fatalism of the characters is amazing . Truly a wonderful book .
5 #### I became hooked on Hemingway long ago when I was in college , and this is the book that got me hooked . In English composition we were being taught how to write interesting sentences , for instance , how many adjectives you could use in describing a person walking down the street . Then I read Hemingway and realized you could write , " He walked down the street " , because walking was n't the important thing . The important thing was what was in the heart of the person walking down the street . When Hemingway won the Nobel Prize the committee mentioned THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA , but it would be hard to imagine Hemingway winning the Nobel Prize and becoming one of the three giants of twentieth century American literature without FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS . I would recommend this book , but be careful , you just might get hooked on Hemingway .
5 #### What do you say about such a classic . Many classic writers are difficult to read but EH takes you through the story with brilliant ease and depth if characters .
5 #### Ernest Hemingway 's FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is not only a war novel but also a story of life , love , lost and ultimately death . Robert Jordan lives to fight with the republican guerillas and he dies fighting alongside them . He lived a life that meant more to him than living in American suburbia with his wife and two children and a dog , working a nine - to - five job . That would n't be Robert Jordan , or Ernest Hemingway . Hemingway 's minimalist writing reflects the pristine snow trails and pine forests , which reflect loneliness and death but also love and hope . Like a full moon reflected in a still lake . A poetry of war and camaraderie , where the violence of the writing would only temper the tragedy of lost . To experience these feelings is to experience the beauty of Hemingway 's writing . For a war novel , there are n't many battle scenes . But we get to feel Robert Jordan 's subdued emotions against the violence of war . The power of his love for Maria is that it could n't be consummated . In the end , he chooses the only path consistent with his other choices : to fight to the end and risk capture and torture rather than have his comrades shoot him .

1 #### I feel bad giving a one star review on this because the paperback is printed very well and it looks very high class .... but this one is all Hemingway 's fault . I LOVE classic books . I am an avid reader and I read books by Faulkner , Proust , Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Victor Hugo in my free time . I was not assigned this and actually , if anything , I set out predisposed to like this book ; that said , there were very few good things about this book . If you want to learn more about the Spanish civil war , this book might be for you - but if you care about characters , plot or writing style , this book is destined to disappoint . I ca n't believe I 'm saying this about someone whose name is synonomous with a writer ( eg . " I 'm no Hemingway but ... " ) , but this book was poorly written .
5 #### I have made it to my mid thirties without having read any Hemingway . This book was fascinating . I could n't put it down . This is a " classic " that is imminently readable and thought provoking .
5 #### The bell tolls for lost ideals , noble futility , the transient moments of tenderness in the ugliness of civil war . This is one of the greatest American writers at the height of his powers - by turns lyrical & tough , showing the worst & best of us , idealism & cynicism , courage & cowardice , loyalty & treachery , skill & incompetence .
4 #### Good job of capturing the insanity of military organizations and the horrors of war . Gets a little melodramatic at the end .
4 #### Review based on 180 gram LP . Wow , my copy looks just like it does in Amazon : label & all I bought this years ago when I was collecting 180 gram LPs . I may of seen the movie twice because I always have been an Ingrid Bergman fan . The mere sight of seeing her in tears on the front cover is enough to buy the album . The music of coarse goes with the 1943 film " For Whom The Bells Tolls " a remake of an Ernest Hemingway 's novel which she stars with Gary Cooper . It 's the Spanish Civil War before World War 2 with the Loyalists against the Fascists . Gary Cooper plays Robert Jordan , a dynamite expert not interested in life until he meets Ingrid Bergman who plays an orphan girl that was mishandled by the Fascists . They fall in love until an untimely end . The music is by Victor Young & many say this is his finest creation . Typical 1940ish bombastic semi - classical music intermixed with Spanish dancing tunes . Recording is top notch with wide clean stereo . Not bad , but not as good as those tears .
4 #### Amazing writer . A little long in some places , but definitely a worth read . I would definitely recommend this book , especially if you enjoy historical novels .
5 #### Who am I or anyone else to critique this masterpiece ? I like to read a wide variety and the classics have a beloved place in the cycle . This book is a masterpiece , pure and simply a masterpiece .
5 #### For someone interested in WWII history and Hemingway this is a great read . Could n't put it down . Just spend the money and buy it you wo n't regret it .
5 #### For many years I wanted to read it again - after read it when I was teenager Having it on my Kindle was nice Reading it with more mature eyes give it additional perspective great book
5 #### Hemingway has written a masterpiece , weaving together the human with the politics of the war in a tapestry richly layered . The evocation of Robert Jordan 's love for Maria is poignant and convincing . The existential threat facing everyone is played out according to their moral stance and passion . The climax of the book is an exquisite melding together of everything that came before . I reread it after many years while in Spain , a fortuitous experience . The final passage brought me to tears .
4 #### It is a very good story , with a few life leasons you can learn . I really enjoy Hemingway books . Classic 's
5 #### Can never get enough of Hemingway 's crisp classic . This is a great example of his up close and personal style .
4 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls takes the reader on a three and a half day journey starring Robert Jordan who is assigned with blowing up a bridge . He is in Spain and the fighting is between fascists and the Republicans ( Robert Jordans side ) . It accounts his time with a group of guerrilla fighters . While the writing drags on at times and in the beginning it is difficult to tell what or whom the dialogue is between , it is a pretty good book . Topics such as love between Maria and Jordan , the psychology of soldiers , and who God is are covered in this book .
5 #### This story is a classic . It details events that occurred during the Spanish civil war of the late 1930s when fascism was on the rise in Western Europe . In 1944 , in my adolescent romanticism , I had become immutably bonded to the characters and Ingrid Bergman after seeing the movie that had just come out . Now , 70 years later and reading the details of the love affair , I was to discover that I understood practically nothing of the historical significance in which the story takes place . The atmosphere of the guerrilla cave and escapades left a deep impression on me that was never to be forgotten . Should you read this novel , I might suggest that seeing the movie first might place the characters most strongly in their rightful desperate and fateful surroundings as so skillfully described by the author .
5 #### This was my second time to read it . I watched the movie with Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman and had to read the book again . Of course , the book is better than the movie . Great read - love Hemingway books .
5 #### 5 Stars is not enough for this classic book . You will not put it down . I think it ' his best work . Steve Tuers
3 #### I did not care much for the story . It was before my time so I have no connection to the events . The big looser for me was the writing style . It was probably a well accepted style at the time but just does not fit in today . Hemingway changed his style several times in his life and this is just an example of a style that went astray . I enjoyed " The old man and the sea " which was written quite differenty . The fact that there was only one person involved made a difference .
2 #### Trite , by the numbers love story with spectacularly banal romantic dialogue . The author does n't bother with much setting or character development . The two lead characters are two dimensional , with the girl too good to be true . He drinks on practically every page : Wine , beer , cognac , vermouth , brandy , whiskey and soda ; morning , noon or night . It 's hard to imagine what anyone thinks is so great about this book .
4 #### Classic story well enjoyed . Wanted to reread Hemingway . Passed it on to a friend to enjoy also . Recommend it highly
5 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls is perhaps one of the greatest books of the 20th Century . Set in revolutionary Spain about 1933 or so , the book covers less than a week of real time , as American Republican Partisan Robert Jordan assists a band of guerrillas in blowing up a bridge in preparation for a major Republican attack . Hemingway is a master storyteller , and the weaving of love , life , death , and the horrors and deceit of war are well developed . You know the ending at the beginning , and yet the development of the story and characters are so rich and so complete that there is little to do but wistfully tear up during the last chapter . The book is a page turner , and a must read treasure of 20th Century literature .
4 #### A very intense tale of war and the local people involved in the cause fighting for their country however they can .
5 #### If you like Hemmingway , you will like this book . Classic tale of the Spanish Civil War prior to WWII . Enjoy !
5 #### I did n't always like it , but loved it . What a writer . So many writing rules were broken but Hemingway can get away with it to its betterment . Everyone should read the masters .
5 #### This is the first EH books I have read . I love reading history and war related books because I want to get a sense of what it would be like to live in a desperate time under extreme conditions . I found this book to be exciting with excellent characters and an excellent story . I will probably read more of his works . I recommend .
3 #### Hemingway delivered as expected , great story . However , when I ordered a hardback edition I did n't expect it to be the version provided to grade school children , complete with censorship . The overall size of the book and quality of the cover were not what I had expected . Maybe you should consider flagging this as the " adolescent version " .
3 #### I tried to get through it , I really did . But then I remembered what a chore it was in High School when two of his novels were required reading . It bored me stiff then , and it does now . But I have found that with Hemingway , he 's either your cup of tea , or he is n't . The characters are shallow , and I do n't like his writing style , in any of his stories . Personal choice , to each his own . As the reviews show , some love it , some do n't . I do n't . But at least I wo n't resort to name calling like some reviewers do , when someone does n't share their opinion . If you 've never read it , give it a try , you may love it . If you do n't , its not indicative of your intelligence level as some would have us believe .
3 #### " For Whom the Bell Tolls " tells the story of young American Spanish teacher who goes to volunteer in the Spanish civil war . The entire novel takes place over 72 hours in which Robert Jordon , the young American , is responsible , as part of a bigger attack , to bomb a bridge and by that ensure that the Fascists wo n't be able to send reinforcements after the attack has begun . During those intense 72 hours , Robert Jordon falls in love with Maria , a Spanish girl whose family was murdered by the Fascists . ( Is n't it amazing how Hemingway 's characters always manage to fall in love faster than it takes one to finish smoking a cigarette ? ) The story follows Robert Jordon 's preparations for the attack and his relationship with Maria and the guerrilla fighters who will assist him with the attack . I am fairly puzzled by this novel , which is considered by many to be Hemingway 's best . It offers brilliant observations into the mind of his solider and the psychological aspects of participating in war and how Jordon copes with the hardships of it . While reading some parts of this novel , I was fully absorbed and captivated . In others , I felt it was rather long - winded . Perhaps some editing would have been handy . Although I do n't think it is Hemingway 's best , I do recommend it to Hemingway 's fans .
5 #### This is a timeless novel written by one of our most celebrated novelist of the 20th century . I love reading it over and over again .
5 #### Forget the Lost Generation stories and The Old Man and the Sea . This is Hemingway 's true masterwork , giving more actual insight into a volatile period of world history
5 #### This by far is my favorite book by Hemingway , very informative about Guerrilla warfare and great character building . This is a definite read , you will keep turning the pages on this one !
5 #### The title says everything , I guess . A genius being genial . Like when one listens to certain musicians and realizes that he 's not merely listening , he 's going through an experience . Go for it !
4 #### I think Hemingway has the fame he does because of his life and not his works . This is my favorite Hemingway novel ( admittedly , I have n't read all of them ) and I give it four stars because it deals with Spain and I like the plot . Even so , Hemingway thought he spoke Spanish , which he decidedly did not . Early in the novel , while discussing the procurement of horses , someone says something to which another character says " Less bad . " I do n't know if that 's Hemingway , a translator taking this from a Spanish edition or what , but " menos mal " does not translate to " less bad . " It 's " all right , " " better yet , " or whatever phrase makes sense . " Less bad " is just wrong . I agree with those who question Hemingway 's putative brilliance . I think his life is far more interesting than any of his works that I 've read . Still , I enjoyed the plot of this novel .
5 #### If for no other reason , this looks impressive as s * * * on a bookshelf to any chick who values good literature . However , if you 're not an empty husk of a human being , this is a phenomenal story about love and war that illuminates human emotion and connection so thoroughly , you 'll hate that your own life does n't carry as much meaning . I only gave it five stars because there were no more to give .
5 #### What could be better than Hemmingway ? More Hemmingway . I learned about this short epilogue on the program " Hemmingway in Cuba " was broadcast April 6 , 2013 on my local pbs station . There is a joint effort by Cuban and American scholars to preserve all the materials left at his home in Cuba . I am not a scholar , but want to share this with other readers of Hemmingway . This Epilogue for " For Whom the Bell Tolls " was found in the basement of Finca Vigia . Epilogue It was night when Golz rode in a staff car on the road down from the pass to El Escorial .
5 #### As for most of us I was forced to read this book in school , now I can read it because I want to . I 've really enjoyed this book and plan on reading more of Ernest Hemingway 's offerings .
5 #### My first Hemingway was Men Without Women , a collection of short stories , and I was so bored with it . After that , I pretty much put Hemingway on my black list , because if I could n't stand his short stories , there 's no way I 'll get through a whole novel . Man was I wrong . I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend . All I can say is wow ! This book is truly beautiful ; the characters , the scenes , and all the emotions that goes with it . The whole story takes place in 4 days . It 's about a man who 's on a mission to blow up a bridge and to do so he needs to work with the local guerrillas . Each character is unique , and the all the things one man can learn about life in just 4 days . Definitely one of my favorite books of all time . I look forward to checking out his other novels as well .
5 #### Ernest Hemmingway is one of the greatest writers when it comes writing about old school spain . it was a great read . strongly recommended although a bit complicated .
4 #### I apologize for a mistake here - my review was for " Winter in Madrid " by C J Samson - as you can see I went to read Hemingway afaterwards Flash backs and forwards not immediately possibleto say when and where one is in the story . I should have read the history of the period before opening it as if one is not genned up on the history of the Spanish civil war and after , is not easy to orientate one self in the book I read Hemingway again afterwards and I think one can say that the author did good documentation .
4 #### I enjoyed the book , did not care for the ending but am satisfied as I 'm making an attempt to read some of the classics . I have read books about Hemingway but am now trying to read some of his material .
1 #### I do n't get what all the fuss was about Hemmingway being such a great author . This story sucked , especially the ending . It just ends ! And what 's with " rope - soled shoes " ? He must use this phrase twenty times in the first couple chapters when describing someone . Then there 's this schmuck , the main character , Robert Jordan , who has a screw loose . He keeps having a two way conversation with himself . I know I sometimes say something to myself like : " Boy Jeff that was a pretty stupid thing to do ! " , but I do n't answer myself back ! About the only positive thing I can say about this book is that some of the stuff in it about suicide sheds some light on why Hemmingway blew his brains out later in life . Boy , to think that this is touted as probably Hemmingway 's best work ! If that 's the case then one Hemmingway book is enough for me . Now you take Dostoyevsky , there was a writer !
5 #### This is a tough book to write about . How many ways are there to say " brilliant " ? This was a re - read for me of a war story and love story . The book far surpasses both . It was the first to describe war as it really is : with flawed heroes , horrible treatment of the civilian population by both sides , guerrillas who are both cruel and afraid , madmen in commanding positions , etc . It also tells about the Spanish Civil War , so for people are unaware that there actually was such a war , it is an eye - opener on the prelude to WWII . The book is appalling and beautiful at the same time . Please read it or re - read it !
5 #### 10 stars ? 20 stars ? For Whom the Bell Tolls is one of the great works of literature . REALLY , Amazon . There are certain books for which your asking for a review exposes the need for your system to have better information and more specific query criteria before requesting a review .
1 #### Hemingway is my favorite all - time author and I love his writing style but this book drags on for the entirety . The only excitement I can remember was some dialogue from a character named Pablo who made some threats . How this is considered to be a classic I have no idea . I slowly plodded two thirds into this book and simply gave up . But then again " The Old Man and the Sea , " considered another classic , was brutal but also boring and basically a pamphlet . I urge everyone to pick up Hemingway 's Complete Short Stories . Those are really his best work and I have read all 500 or 600 pages TWICE . That is how brilliant and fascinating the stories are . They never get old , there are endless lessons about sadness , life , loss in those short stories that ANY GENERATION can relate to . He simply masterfully sums up in less words what it would take most writers much longer to express . As a matter of fact , they would not be able to express them in nearly the same way . Hemingway I am convinced is better served as a short story writer than a novelist . I have tried to read 7 or 8 Hemingway novels and have given them a chance but the only one 's that impressed me were the books that were actually collections of his short stories .
5 #### HEMINGWAY IS MY FAV ! I SUGGEST YOU READ THIS IF YOU WANT A GREAT LOVE STORY ..... OF COURSE , HE IS THE MASTER !
5 #### What can I say ? He is so scant of description but so full of story . I read his books over and over about his war stories . They almost are n't war stories but preludes to battle where the battle is almost inconsequencial . You are already a conrade of the character . You just lost a friend .
4 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls is a Hemingway less affected by his modernist tendencies than To Have and Have Not yet not as uninfluenced as The Old Man and the Sea . Also , there is a good deal of sexual discussion and activity , though all of it is done in an explicit - yet - entirely - implied manner exclusive to Hemingway 's style . This story of the American professor who joins the Spanish Communists in their fight against the fascists explores love , morality , Communism , duty , awareness of death , and bravery in the face of death . Specifically , impending doom expedites and deepens the life and love of the characters . A good first read but not necessarily worth a return .
5 #### This story is one of a kind . Hemingway is unique unto himself .
5 #### The presentation of this book is enjoyable own excellent work , which can be read nimbly and with some ease and this time .
4 #### This is another book you must read before you die if you have such a list in the making . This is why some books are called important with the potential to change both you and the world you live in
4 #### I very much enjoyed this book , it is not one of my favorites , but I am very happy I read it . I recommend it for people who enjoy Ernest Hemingway as a writer , but if you are new to him , I would do a little bit of research on this book before deciding to read it .
5 #### The vendor had it to me before Christmas , my nephew loved it and it was better than pictured ! It was a perfect replica of a first edition .
5 #### Hemingway is one of the best known authors worldwide and with good reason . As someone with limited knowledge of European history and a complete ignorance of the events of the Spanish Civil War , this had me engrossed and wanting to learn more . It had me so engrossed that I nearly wanted to go join a rebel movement and dedicate myself to war a la Robert Jordan . This book has the vital ingredients of sex and war and mixed together with Hemingway 's unbelievably creative writing style , makes for one of the best works of fiction of all time .
5 #### When my mother passed away last year I found a first edition signed copy of this book that she received as a graduation present in 1940 . I am preserving this copy , but wanted to read the text again . I decided that a kindle copy would help maintain the condition of the original . I had forgotten the unique use of language in that original edition and the Kindle edition is the same as that original . It was one of my mother 's favorites and I understand why .
5 #### Good read . The main characters in the book are almost alive . Robert , Maria and Pilar keep the dialog alive but in some cases the details are too extensive . Hard to not keep reading each night to find out what happens to Robert and Maria and , of course , the bridge . Hemmingway is a favorite .
5 #### War is ugly and this story could just as easily be placed in Afganistan . The love scenes between Robert and Maria were very moving .
5 #### People seem to forget the older classics -- especially after they 're made into a movie . This is definitely worth a re - read . Enjoy it more the second time and if you have teenagers , encourage them to read it -- even if it is't required in school .
5 #### Well , I 'm embarrased to say that it took me until late in life to finally get around to reading this gem . And oh , what a gem it is . Robert Jordan is one of those characters that just stays with you . I found myself a bit envious of his adventure , at least for a while ( do n't want to give anything away ) . For me , having never fought in a war , the sense of romanticism , mingled with the clear tragedy , seemed a realistic picture of what it must be like . Ultimately , I admire the sense of duty and honor so many of these characters display , and I wonder how many people share that kind of personal commitment today . I like to think it 's still a high number ( certainly we see it our military men and women ) , but I ca n't help but wonder ....... This book is a 5 - star read all the way around . Read it . You wo n't be sorry .
2 #### It took me far too long to struggle my way through this novel . Hemingway 's attempts to capture the flavor of Spanish syntax make the narrative sound artificial and , at times , ludicrous . Furthermore he often had characters engage in lengthy exchanges which would resolve into nothing , leaving the reader to wonder what profound point he missed . When , in fact , there really was no point at all . Overly long and arduous . Something to be foisted upon unhappy high - schoolers . Hemingway 's just not the sort whose style appeals to .
4 #### Hemingway has a way of narrating that you really feel he 's written a true story . While I like his narrative , it becomes a little boring sometimes . A book for school , or to take when vacationing .
5 #### I had only read The Old Man and The Sea before this novel . This book just grabbed me and I had to read it until I finished it . The trademark Hemingway style of silence is present here . The landscape and environment are as much a part of the story as the characters . It took getting used to pages of describing the landscape so deeply , but once I went along for the ride I enjoyed the novel immensely . The plot seems conventional , that 's fine for me .
5 #### This book is the ghost of what was once Heroic about men from a time long ago . It is anti - douche bag and , thus , probably not popular in modern times .
4 #### Thanks you very much for your work . It was fast , good and on time . We did nor expect such a quick shipment .
3 #### There is nothing wrong with Hemingway 's skill and technique . What I fell in love with in his writing is all here , except his conciseness . This story could have been 200 pages shorter and all the better for it . But Hemingway was responding to critics that accused him of the very conciseness that made his other works a rhythmic masterpiece of storytelling narrative . Hemingway understood technique better than any writer , and why he let criticism overrule better judgment destroys the pace and rhythmic flow of this story . For a three day period , 470 pages is a lot of cave dwelling , talking , eating and drinking . The stories of Pilar while important also drag the story in pacing . Robert Jordan 's train of thought - well let 's just say that is a mighty long train . The relationship between Jordan and Maria is a quick and welcome breath of distraction from the mundane cave proceedings . This is still worthy of a read , but you are going to have to spend some time with it and , dare say , slug through some excessive chapters where the rhythm and flow of the story comes to a crawl .
4 #### This is a novel about the Spanish Civi War , specifically the story of an American who works with a group of partisans to sabotage a bridge . The story takes place over three days but the book runs in excess of four hundred pages . As a result , the pace can get slow at times . No background is given on the war , but Hemingway 's sympathies are clear : the fascists must be defeated , and the worth of personal sacrifices is determined in how they further the greater good . Hemingway develops some interesting characters , particularly " Pablo , " a disillusioned partisan leader whose murderous actions in support of a noble cause lead him to alcoholism and defeatism . The American protagonist is most interesting : a cynic who still believes in a cause outside himself . The romantic relationship between the American and a Spanish girl was not the novel 's strength ; Hemingway did not make his career drafting love stories . Although a bit slow , some of the scenes are fantastic . In particular , the flashback to the murder of fascist sympathizers in a small village is one of the most horrifying chapters I have ever read . Likewise , an account of a partisan group 's last stand on a hilltop puts most Hollywood action movies to shame . Liked the book but did not love it . Probably for people who really dig Hemingway or want a bottom - up look at the Spanish conflict .
3 #### I love to read and very rarely put a book down but I had a hard time staying interested or excited about this book . I decided I will finish the book after reading other stuff so maybe when I finish it I will appreciate it more .
4 #### Can I add anything to what has already been said ? Well , I find this to be Hemingway 's best piece of literature . The story is interesting ( though sometimes the dialogue can come across as odd to me , it 's from a different time , so some difference is to be expected ) . Especially interesting was the protagonist 's work ( a perfect example of UW , in my opinion ) , and what he did . Read it , enjoy it .
5 #### I was expecting to loathe this book . It was nothing like I expected . Yes , For Whom the Bell Tolls is about war . There are all the horrors of war in this book . But nothing was extraneous , gratuitous , undeserved . And the book was about so much more than just war . Hemingway delves into relationships and honor and courage and heroism . It is a great book .
5 #### Wonderful way to get what I want without leaving home . Trusted service , fast , cost effective . My husband wanted this book and is quite enjoying it .
5 #### In the team photo of ' best books I 've ever read ' , I feel a desire to re - read this one every 10 years or so . It 's definitely a ' love it or hate it ' effort -- in particular , the language used can be off - putting as Hemingway tries to convey the beauty of the Spanish language through the use of archaic English . I think it works , though the necessary linguistic convolutions needed to express obscenities gets tedious . The plot is well - constructed , giving an adequate amount of motion as it moves between the love story and the action sequences . Hemingway 's flair for description are on full display -- whether it 's the scenery , military weapons , food or people he gets to the heart of the matter swiftly and decisively . The themes Hemingway pursues throughout his career are present in this work -- androgyny , suicide , the outdoors , shooting and depression are all rolled into it . These themes provide layering and texture that helps propel the novel forward without dipping into an emotional morass . A book to treasure , by a master of the art .
5 #### This is my first exposure to Ernest Hemingway and , after reading it , I wonder how I could go through eight years of high school and college and not read one Hemingway book . I loved this book ! I have never taken so quickly to a piece of classic literature . Hemingway 's style is powerful , evocative , and dramatic . And yet none of the prose is overly verbose or bombastic . This tale , set over four days in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War , follows Robert Jordan , an American fighting in the International Brigade , and his preparations for a bridge demolition . During that time , he falls in love with the beautiful and tragic Maria as well as befriends the group of guerrillas he is working with . During those four days , Jordan loves , idealizes , and submits to his dutiful fate more passionately than most men ever will . If you have never read Hemingway before , I suggest you do so right away . This book is a great one to start with and I know that I will be looking to read more of his works soon .
4 #### So after I bought the book , I was watching Pawn Stars and freaking george stephanopoulos was about to buy the book when him and rick decide they should give away the ending . i almost put the book on the shelf till i forgot what they said , but i decided to read it anyway . i actually think it may have enhanced my experience with it , but i ca n't be sure if i would have enjoyed it more had i not known the ending . anyway , this was the first war novel i read , and i thought it was fantastic . at first i had problems with the character of maria , but by the end really liked her . all of the other characters i thought were well developed and interesting . i really liked that the story took place over the course of only a few days . i would definitely recommend it to others .
4 #### First things first , if you want a quick thriller than this is not the book for you . If what you want is a compelling , thought provoking , and an informative narrative of guerrila 's in the Spanish civil war than this is up your alley . Even with its slow pace and limited conflict lessons are learned in every chapter . Everything from how to treat unreliable ally 's to how to deal with love in war . Hemmingway 's writting is somewhat repetitive , but in its elegance completely bareable . Having only read The Old Man and the Sea , I ca n't compare it to his other longer fiction , to me For Whom the Bell Tolls was a more rewarding read . With a great cast of characters that constantly enrich plot , all with back stories that build character developement . Robert Jordan the main character gives an American familiarity to the story making it even more accessible to today 's readers . Hemmingway has a way with words that puts you in the story , with Robert Jordan 's up 's and down 's , you understand him , you want to be him . Anyone who has n't read Hemmingway 's work but enjoys any American classics from Steinbeck to McCarthy will find this read enjoyable and rewarding .
3 #### This version of the book has been censored to the point where parts of the dialog are difficult to understand . Anyone who is familiar with Hemingway should know to expect some profanity . The book itself is very good . I 'm only about half way through it and I like the style ; the pace tends to drag a little in places .
5 #### As inspired as I was after " The Sun Also Rises " , I am even more crushed by this one . If you have any idea of writing something real someday , steer well clear of " For Whom the Bell Tolls . " What a genius work of character development and atmosphere .
5 #### This is another masterly work from Hemingway . When he gets it right , he gets it OH so right . You have more tight , evocative language that conjure up the landscapes the characters live in , and wonderful characterisation so that you fully engage and sympathise with them . This is a great look at the Spanish civil war from the guerrillas point of view , with the assistance of an American explosives expert . It has romance , chivalry , betrayal , adventure and the rougher side of human nature . What more could you want from one novel ? If you like Hemingway then this is another great novel and if you 're new to him , this may not be the best starting place , but you 'll still not be disappointed . Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .
3 #### With vivid , descriptive prose , Hemingway takes us into the mind of a soldier . Focused on duty and his mission , our main character encounters love among the carnage , but even that does not sway him from his duty . Though at times a bit long - winded , Hemingway brings the internal battle of war to the surface . The self - talk that goes on shows the conflict behind the rough exterior . We also see the useless deaths that take place because of the uncertainties that come with war .
5 #### I have 2 degrees in English Lit and this is my all - time favorite book . Hemmingway is my favorite author and I believe this is his best novel .
4 #### Of course For Whom the Bell Tolls is in English , but everyone speaks Spanish . Hemingway tries to create Spanish sounding English by stretching the syntax of English nearly to its breaking point , by rendering Spanish - ism into odd English phrases , like " what passes with thee ? " for que pasa , a common Spanish greeting . Hemingway also uses archaic English usages to present forms that exist in Spanish , but are gone from English , like thee and thou for the second person pronoun . It makes for strange but captivating reading . Here is a writer rendering English into Spanish forms . The results are startling and not always enjoyable ; but it always gives you the impression that you have entered another world . If the novel was written in more fluid English , the result would not have been so unusual . The very clumsiness of the language reminds the reader that this is a novel that is taking place in another , somewhat more formal language . And the English bears that imprint . When we read For Whom the Bell Tolls we can see English both reaching into its past to create diction of current usage , as well as using an odd and foreign syntax to give the illusion of another language . Often , this effect was criticized . But an open reading of this novel shows what an effective technique this is and how well it does the heavy lifting of expressing another culture 's values on the level of language from one tongue to another .
5 #### One of my favorite books of all time . Granted , there are some dry parts in the book but other parts well make up for it .
5 #### I 've probably read this book over 4 or 5 times throughout the years , first having read it as part of an assignment in a High School English class . This is my absolute favorite book , and I 'll tell you why . As many reviewers have already pointed out , this book is enjoyable on so many levels : the characters are deep and complex ; the questions about their purpose are deep . As a native Spanish speaker , I truly enjoy this book much more because Hemingway 's prose is an exact translation of how the characters would speak in their Spanish setting , which I only realize now living in Puerto Rico and re - reading this masterpiece after many years ( and two war tours ) . The conversations , which may seem awkward to a non - Spanish speaker , are perfectly natural if translated into Spanish , adding to the realism of his tale . Chalk this up to Hemingway 's genius and his ability to create realistic worlds in which his characters live and die .
5 #### This book gathers momentum slowly , but I guarantee that if you stick with it to the end you will be very well rewarded . I enjoyed this book for insight into history as well as military tactics . It 's almost like you are behind enemy lines , eavesdropping on what is happening . But the last 40 to 50 pages swiftly gathers momentum both in action and emotional impact . But intertwined is this heart - wrenching love story , at least at the end it 's heart - wrenching . I 've read four of Hemingway 's books , but this one ranks easily at the top . There is so much emotion and character in this book , the stuff that makes us human and heroic , and that makes Hemingway so great . The last 40 pages or so builds so much emotion , suspense , and excitement you can not put it down -- the mission climaxes , the love story climaxes , what a ride ! ! !
5 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls is one of Hemingway 's masterpieces . The novel is set during the Spanish Civil War and at the center of it is Robert Jordan an American who has joined the international brigades supporting the democratic Spanish government against the Fascist insurgency led by Fransisco Franco . The focus is onJordan and the loyalist guerillas he is with and their mission of blowing up a key bridge which would enable the loyalists to trap a fascist army , The other part of the novel focuses on Jordans relationships with the guerillas particularily a young woman named Maria . Jordan and Maria fall in love and it is a compelling story but Jordans relationships with the guerilla leader Pablo and his wife Pilar as well as the other loyalists are also compelling . The novel has an air of tragedy about it for the fascists destroy a large loyalist army before the bridge can be demolished and we know that the Fascists end up winning the war . Jordan is one of Hemingways most compelling heroes and he carries the novels . You see Spain through his eyes and Hemingway makes you believe you are in Spain in late 1938 . This is a great novel and I recommend it highly
2 #### I read the first 100 pages and the plot of blowing up a bridge was fine , although the plot is exceedingly slow . Hemingway does a good job with describing the details of the surroundings . The main character Robert Jordan will have an observation of another character that is insightful . Then the old guide Anselmo will have the same observation . Then the old woman Pilar would have the same observation . Then the guerrilla guard will have the same observation . Why is everyone talking about the exact same observation ? It seems pretty bad writing and a poor understanding of human nature for everyone to be echoing Robert Jordan 's thoughts . But that amaturish style was n't what turned me off of the book . It was the horrible love story . I 'm a woman in my 30s and maybe this kind of tripe would appeal to guys , but the love story was not only exceedingly unrealistic , but also stupid and insulting to women . I was curious how this horrible love story would end , so then I read the last 20 pages of the book . The ending of the love story was even worse than the beginning . This book was not only not insightful about human nature , it actually ran counter to human nature . I do like Hemingway 's book " The Sun Also Rises . " That book is a simple story , but well done . I recommend that book over For Whom the Bell Tolls .
3 #### I disagree with the reviewers that bash the literal Spanish translation ( I actually kind of enjoyed it for the most part ) , but I also agree fully with those who say that parts ( loooong parts ) of this book are slow . Really slow . I 'm also with those who are annoyed by the constant use of Robert Jordan 's full name . He 's the only " Robert " or " Jordan " in the book , so why ca n't Hemingway just pick one and stick with it ? An abridged version ( taking out half of the flashbacks ) would have kept up the pace of the story better , and at 300 pages or so this would have been a much more enjoyable read . I finished the whole thing ( 500 pages ) in about 3 days , but I 'll admit to skimming through many of the flashbacks ( the obvious exception being Pilar 's flashback about Pablo killing the Fascists ) . Overall - not great , but good enough to get through . Would love to see an abridged version .
2 #### I listened to this on audio book over several days , it felt like forever . I was n't too impressed . It was slow , slow , and did I mention slow . Then when it was interesting , it was n't even worth all the slowness . Wo n't be sampling Hemingway again anytime soon .
5 #### EXCERPTED FROM " GOD 'S COUNTRY " BY STEVEN TRAVERS " For Whom the Bell Tolls " is based upon Hemingway?s support for the anti - Communists fighting in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s . He and many other Americans went over to fight in the war , which some say was a " dress rehearsal " for World War II . It did not materialize into the kind of idealized Spanish government that many had sacrificed for . The fascistic Francisco Franco ended up ruling an isolationist Spain until the 1970s . While the nation is now Democratic , the Franco regime was the final event that took Spain from greatness to mediocrity . Hemingway also wrote a stageplay about the Spanish Civil War called " The Fifth Column " .
5 #### I have an original copy of For Whom the Bell Tolls that my grandfather gave me . For years I read the poem at the beginning of the book , ( which has the same title as the book itself ) but had never read the content . It is amazing that after years of reflecting on that poem , that reading the actual content of this classic meant so much more . As I am sure was Hemingway 's intention , you can literraly reflect on that poem back through every single chapter in the book , and each time the poem will have a new meaning for the reader . This is a true sign , in my opinion , of a great author . I need to read this novel again , to pick up on some of the hidden inuendos and nuances I might have missed the first time , but that too will be time well - spent . This is a phenomenal book , by a bona fide , talented classic author . It is worth reading , reflecting upon , and reading again .
5 #### Rave about Hemingway : it 's been done . Complete envy of the power of his dialogue to characterize : wallowing in it ( as a writer ) I 'm here to rave about the audiobook reader Campbell Scott . If he does not speak fluent Spanish , he sure fooled me ; in the delivery and staccato pacing of dialogue , the pronunciation of names , the perfect accent for each character , and the timing and understanding in general . The flat affect of the voice of Robert Jordan was perfect as well . It is obviously written in English but you feel you are hearing , thinking , feeling Spanish , and the formality and structure of the language , and even the " obscenity - ied " out cursing sound believable and natural . Other times when a reader attempts accents it comes off as contrived and ends up being farcical , but Campbell Scott does a brilliant job for the voices of each of the characters , from the lightness of Maria to the childlike Joaquin to the solidness of Pilar and the heavy paced tones of Pablo . A treat to listen to . I will look for other audiobooks Campbell Scott has done the reading for !
5 #### Yes , I said " historical novel , " because , even in H. 's day , history passed by very quickly . It 's this novel A Farewell to Arms , and The Old Man and the Sea that , for me , are the real crown jewels of Hemingway 's output . Even if you 're just interested in the historical aspect of the The Spanish Civil War , you 'll get much out of this work . There is n't much more I can add that has n't already been said .
3 #### The author 's style is strong and detailed , but with so little happening over so many pages , I found myself becoming impatient with the story . Perhaps just a sign of the times and my own personal taste , I put the book down after reading only half of it . In reflection , the characters , the settings and the building of the story line are all quite beautiful as a whole , but the pace was just too stretched out for me to endure . Perhaps I 'll pick it up again sometime .
5 #### This tackles several questions : How war shapes men , past and present and what a real hero is . Set in the Spanish Civil War , the story revolves around the experiences of a volunteer fighter , an American college professor named Robert Jordan . Filled with idealism at first , watch him reconsider as he faces the prospect of his own death . One of Hemingway 's finest .
5 #### This book should be a " must read " for everyone . It is one of the top twenty - five books of modern times .
4 #### In the past few days I have finished reading the internationally acclaimed book " For Whom The Bell Tolls " by Ernest Hemingway . Before I began reading this book I had heard and read from many that the book was a classic and a very good read ; after finishing the book I have to say that I completely agree . This book well deserves the praise that it has been given over the years ; it is a classic in every sense of the word . From Hemingway 's unmatched descriptions of the beautiful Spanish countryside to the deep inner thoughts and struggles of the people . Hemingway has captured the true inner feelings of the Spanish people in their struggle for their idea of freedom , from the gripping oppression of fascism . Yet he goes even further , in the unlikely relationship that develops between Robert Jordan and recently rescued Maria . He is still able to show that there is always some good even in some of the darkest situations . From betrayals and tragedy to unlikely and unexpected aid Hemingway covers all spectrums and interests The only criticism I can give this book is concerning the ending which I personally found unsatisfying but that is for you to decide for yourself . In conclusion I find this book to be a great read for any who feel they are a skilled enough reader to fully appreciate the majesty of this work of art .
5 #### Robert Jordan is a young American fighting against the fascists in the Spanish Civil War . He is sent into the mountains to make contact with a small band of guerillas to blow a bridge in support of an offensive . Hemingway 's tremendous strength of drawing characters that the reader comes to know and care about is on full display in " For Whom the Bell Tolls . " Jordan falls in love with the young woman , Maria , who is seeking refuge from a world that has robbed her of her childhood innocence . There is Pablo , the former leader who has seen the futility of the war and can not face the day without dulling his mind with wine . There is Pilar , Pablo 's mate , who longs for her youth , but has now assumed the role of leader and mother to the small group of fighters . Robert Jordan and the reader come to know the dynamics of the group quite well . Jordan wrestles with the necessity of endangering the group of people for " the cause . " This book depicts the contrast of war 's brutality with the camaraderie of friends . " For Whom the Bell Tolls " is considered a classic for a reason . This is a book that has aged well and will stick with the reader for a long time .
5 #### I do not like to give too high merit to anything , be it book , movie , CD , simply because I think the imagination can conjure up things reality can not deliver on . But I feel a responsibilty to share my thoughts - my true impressions of the book , unbridled by any fear of corruption by doing so . Maybe it was the John Donne quote , maybe it was the writing style , or maybe it was the incredible , moving story that made me , directly after finishing the book , put it down and think it was one of the greatest things I had ever read . Trying to say WHY would take too long and probably not make much sense to anyone else . But I suppose I owe it to readers to try . Here is what you need to know . This is a love story , a war story , in a sense , a God story ( but not what you probably are thinking ) . It powerfully , deeply , honestly portrays the human experience , in all its doubting , hating , loving , sorrowing fullness . Read this book . And give it time , because it starts somewhat slow and may turn current readers , who want all action and want to be told plainly everything ( they do n't like to think or discover meaning for themselves ! ) Even if you do n't like it , you wo n't be the worse , and at least you can say you 've read one of America 's best novels ( that I have read ) .
3 #### this book is a drunkolgue . of course , it 's very well written . the style , is a style of a superb journalist . but the characters ' alcoholism is piercing . the choices they make are hardly romantic , rather they are tragic . the emptiness of the spirit hidden behind the spirit of alcohol pierces through . how so many mice and men have fashioned their lives after this novel puzzles me .
4 #### Hemingway is a master storyteller , and FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a fine example of that mastery . The strengths lie in character development , and thematic presentation . The weaknesses lie in it 's style , and language . For example , the use of what passes for colloquial Spanish , particularly in it 's profane form , seems artificial and clumsy . I also think elements of the plot tend to weaken or dilute the overall effect of the climax , like when Pilar reads Jordan 's palm to tell his future , thus foreshadowing events to come . That being said , this is a very inspirational book , and Hemingway has a knack for grabbing the reader 's attention , and keeping it . He is especially good in his short fiction , and an excellent example of that can be found within this novel , when Pilar tells the tale of her village . It is perhaps , the single most riveting and effective part of the novel . FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is of course one of the great novels to deal with sacrifice for righteous causes , and devotion to higher ideals . It reminds me , in a way , of A TALE OF TWO CITIES , in that respect . It is a great noble work , and an indictment of war . There is also a great personal love story here . Hemingway writes ( maybe intentionally ) very cinematic novels .
3 #### On the back cover of this paperback it 's noted that Hemingway is known for his " terse " sentences . Did the person writing this " blurb " read the book ? Probably not . In parts of this novel the author writes as if possessed by James Joyce , in a stream of consciousness style with long sentences . That 's OK , or would be , if they added to the novel but , sorry , they do n't . The author is also repetitive , repeating the same point over and over in some cases . But there is no reason in terms of the plot in writing the same point over and over in this book except to ( in my opinion ) stretch this novella out into almost 500 pages . The first couple and the last couple of chapters are essentially where the action is . One has to ask why this story is so revered and I think the answer is because the author was so admired . The press especially hero - worshiped Hemingway and perhaps this explains the too - much praise for this work . Still , not a bad book and when it 's good , it 's very good .
2 #### In case you stumble upon this review amidst all of the other droning articles , I 'll try to keep mine short . This was my first Hemingway , I finished it just recently , and man is he overrated . There are moments of greatness within the pages , and as for the simple act of creating a story , placing characters and orchestrating a chain of events , the guy was n't bad . Unfortunately his pretentious writing style bleeds through on nearly every single page , so absurdly that it disrupts from the actual story . I loved the characters , I was intrigued by the plot , but halfway through I realized that I was FORCING myself to continue reading because the poor old bastard kept getting so far gone on his cheesy tangents of love , and of the minor backstories of characters found only within the backstories of supporting characters ( Pilar 's matador 's tale that consumed four or five pages ) that the story suffered greatly . Hemingway fancied himself a wordsmith I suppose , and therefore managed to crowbar the word " now " about fifty times into a single paragraph , often repeating the word up to four times in a row , and the truly funny part is that people regard him as a genius for it . So after experiencing Hemingway I can honestly say that I wo n't be going back , and I can only envy his success .
4 #### Hemingway has a way of getting into our heads . The characters are plain spoken ; almost Shakespearean at times ; with powerful , philosophical paragraphs sprayed in . His interest in bullfighting is obvious if you have read any of his work ; and is not ignored here . Against the rules of writing he uses the Spanish tongue ; although irritating , he gets away with it . Set in the mid 1930 's , and centered around an American munitions expert fighting to help the cause of removing the Germans , Italians , and the rest of the fascist armies from out of Spain . He links up with a group of cave dwelling partisans outside of town . Much of the book is spent on his relationship with this group and him falling in love with a young girl , whom he can never have . Some may object to the ending , but I found it fitting ; " I man 's gota ' do , what I man 's gota ' do " Wish you well Scott
5 #### Ernest Hemingway wrote another great adventure story with FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS . His style is very vivid , and reading the book is like being on the scene of the Spanish Civil War itself . Prior to reading FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS , I had read all his short stories while taking a short story course in college , then THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA . The short stories vary in style , except that they are also written in short sentences , just as Hemingway preferred . THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA tends to be boring , but FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is fascinating throughout . I just wish I had the time to read more of Hemingway 's novels , just to see what they are like .
5 #### For whom The Bell Tolls For whom The Bell Tolls is probably my favorite novel by Hemingway . It is a story told during the Spanish Civil War of an American , Robert Jordan , who fights as a guerilla who knows how to blow up things , especially trains . It helps if you speak a little Spanish Hemingway uses it scattered through out the story . Gunner September , 2007
5 #### I first read this about 40 years ago . I just re - purchased it . This is a classic novel .
5 #### must be where Metallica got the song name from . Anyways this is one of but many authors that , like Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain decided to take the easy way out . In the meantime he penned this great literature that is a great book . I do n't care what anybody says , the old man and the sea is boring and short and so with that I bid you good day and happy reading !
5 #### Hemingway deftly walks us into the heart of war and a man caught between his loyalty to his position in the military and his love for Pilar , a woman like no other . Some highly memorable scenes and conflicts prove this novel 's place as a classic . -- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens
5 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls ( FWTBT ) , is a masterpiece especially combined with Campbell Scott 's superb reading . It exceeds any fiction I have ever heard or read and I have heard and read a lot . There are few books I have encountered that merited a second read , or in this case a second listen , the Bible being an obvious one . But after listening to FWTBT , I became interested in the little known Spanish Civil War and purchased a book about it , read it and then listened to FWTBT again . The pleasure of the experience was heightened by the contextual knowledge I now possessed . I am not suggesting you must know something about that war to enjoy this book . Quite the contrary . The book spurred the interest in the war ! If you like words and dialogue you will find that listening to this book is like enjoying an exquisite wine or fine cigar . I highly recommend it . Do n't let the fact it was written long ago about a long ago war have anything to do with your decision to buy listen to it . It is timeless . An awesome work , such as I have never experienced . The Master ( Hemingway ) read by a master in his own right ( Scott ) .
5 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls is quite simply one of the best novels ever written . Honestly , I had relatively low expectations before reading it . I read A Farewell to Arms and found the terse , repetitive prose and stilted dialogue underwhelming . For Whom the Bell Tolls is superior to A Farewell to Arms in every way . This is a complex novel with some of the most memorable characters in modern literature . This mesmerizing novel neither glorifies war , not does it vilify it . Hemmingway 's detached prose is world weary , exposing both sides of the conflict , allowing us to see that war , inevitable and futile , is never simple . Characters on both sides of the conflict struggle with their own fears and regrets . Both sides commit , and are subjected to , the atrocities and horrors of war . As different as each side may think they are from the other , in the end , they are all human and are not as different as they think . For Whom the Bell Tolls is riveting and powerful , easily one of the ten best novels of the 20th century . I ca n't recommend this book highly enough .
5 #### I revisited this book in my early 40 's and came away resold on Hemingway as one of America 's greatest writers and an artist who stands the test of time . It 's a shame , in fact , that Hemingway 's caricature - friendly persona , life and writing style have sometimes obsured his work . Forget the macho image and the stories of drinking and hunting . He is an artist of the first order . For Whom ... is a novel about the important things -- life , love , death , fear , the attraction and horror of war . What struck me throughout was how innocent the characters are and how genuinely Hemingway depicts the most difficult subjects , be it war ( in this case the Spanish Civil War ) or the love between Maria and Robert Jordan . Hemingway is a writer we need in our times . He focuses on the big , important issues without cynicism , and never shies from exposing what is in our hearts and minds . A classic .
4 #### This is one of several Hemingway books I have come to read , actually in this case , listen to . I loathe idling about so I decided while I wait , wherever that maybe , I would listen to an audiobook . I prefer the unabridged versions which in this case was quite long . I found the subject matter mysteriously complex ( who does n't find love complex ) yet simplistic in it 's exposition true to Hemingway 's style . Each character is carefully developed and his / her relationships meticulously crafted and consistent with their dispositions . Hemingway explores humanity and allows us a glimpse of it in the most trying circumstances .... love and war . It really is very hard to discuss the book without ruining details and the outcome so I will stop here . I would suggest getting the audicopy on ipod and listening to it on your next long journey overseas .
5 #### It is a fascinating tale of Robert ( Roberto ) Jordon and his paisonos , caught up in the Spanish Civil War . The story covers only three days of the war , yet it takes us on Robert Jordon 's life voyage . It is conveyed by the brilliant soliloquy , a tug of war of conscience , duty , honor and death itself . Who among us has not had such dialogue ? It has everything , romance , camaraderie , bravery , cowardice , and above all sacrifice . Jordon , an American , who is addressed as " Ingles " by his comrades , is the band 's leader , who is commissioned by the rebellion general to blow up a bridge . His team includes some unforgettable characters ever penned , the ruthless yet pragmatic Pablo , his incredibly humane wife , Pilar , Augustine , brave soldier , like a brother to Robert , and lovely , innocent Maria . Roberto ( Jordon ) and Maria fall in love the moment they meet and once Pilar reads his palm , the denouement is never in doubt . The scene where Pablo is in charge with a gun hustling out town 's fascists who are holed up in the church , to be " taken care " of by the avenging mob outside is reminiscent of " krystalnacht " enactment superbly portrayed by Gnter Grass in his classic Nazi drama " Tin Drum " . An all time classic
3 #### I learned a very important lesson here ; take a good peak at the book before you get it . The Scribner publication ( paperback ) of this Hemingway Novel was n't the one I believe most people read . This was spattered everywhere with " Thee " and " Thou . " That really detracted from the story . Unfortunately I do n't think even with out that distraction the story would n't have been much better . It also would have helped me had I known more about the bigger picture . I 'm not that familiar with Spanish history and was n't sure who represented what . Also a strange personal quirk ; I keep thinking of the protagonist Robert Jordan , and transposing him in my mind with Di Vinci Code protagonist Robert Langdon . I guess it 's the common name Robert .
1 #### I normally do n't put a book down without finishing it , especially one in the genre of classic American literature . However , Hemingway 's English translations were so irritating , trite , and immature that I could not get past them . The use of " thy " and " thou " to indicate the ud . form is ridiculous in 20th century English . Quoting the characters as asking , " How do you call yourself ? " instead of " What is your name ? " is downright silly . If Hemingway really wanted to convey what the characters were saying literally , he should have simply quoted them in Spanish and provided a translation in parentheses or in an index . Regardless , who needs a literal translation ? How is " How do you call yourself " better than " What is your name " ? And is it really important to know who uses ud . to whom when this form does n't even exist in modern English ? I found these " translations " so distracting from what was going on that I could n't continue past chapter 2 . I get the impression that the hundreds of reviewers who have raved about this book over the past 65 years do n't speak Spanish .
5 #### Someone should rush into George W Bush 's office with a copy of this book . It 's not anti - war , but it is about what Wilfird Owen called ' the pity of war ' , the terrible ironic waste of camaraderie and love and stories and landscapes , and the value of the life of just one man . So many reviews summarise the plot , so I 'll refrain . It 's almost like Hamlet , though ; Robert Jordan has to blow a bridge , but four acts go by before he acts . In that space , he and we learn what the act will really mean - nothing , in terms fo the war , but everything to him . he 's like a matador , int eh pause between the bull 's turn and his impact . The whole book is lit up with Robert 's mortality . And it sounds amazing , lyrical , not entirely spare , but with half - heard rhythms as steady as pulses . I liked Maria . I know I 'm swimming against the feminist stream , but why not goodness in a heroine instead of the tiresome feistiness we 've all seen so much of lately ? Pilar , however , is not tiresome , and to meet her is alone enough to put this book at the top of any list of tO read books you may be making . She shines because it is SHE whoo is Hemingway - yes , folks , he was fat and a bit food - obssessed . And she is the storyteller . Hemingway was interested in that kind of transgression - read Garden of Eden . But read this first .
5 #### A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan , with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid , and some reflections on his father and grandfather . Jordon 's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway 's skill with language and character development . Jordan , at one point comments to himself , that he is his own best companion . Because of his wartime responsibilities , he can not allow himself to be overcome by emotion , which he considers a luxury . Whenever he feels anger , deep love , disappointment , foreboding , fear , anything that will distract him from his purpose , he talks himself down and refocuses . In such a relatively brief period , he begins to love life as never before , because of his feelings for Maria . Even here , however , he accepts that if anything happens to him , he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days .
5 #### " For Whom the Bell Tolls " is a perfect example of what makes Ernest Hemmingway one of , if not the , preeminent writers of the first half of the 20th Century . Although his machismo style does not appeal to everyone , ( especially the feminists who find his portrayals of women to be degrading and unrealistic ) this is a perfect example of his style and of the cruel realities of the world of his time . Hemingway 's signature terse writing style lends itself perfectly to the telling of the story of the loyalist guerillas during the Spanish Civil War . His writing style perfectly captures the way of thinking one would have while in such a situation . Although undoubtedly the love story between Robert Jordan and Maria is weak , yet it does n't detract from the overall beauty and poignancy of the story , for first and foremost this is a war story . Hemingway does what he does best in " For Whom The Bell Tolls " , which is to capture a slice of life from a bygone era . Although set 70 years ago , Hemingway 's story has as much meaning in a modern setting as they did when they were written . It is a true classic in every sense of the word .
5 #### This book has everything . War , Romance , and the little known history of the Spanish Civil War . Hemingway is at his best in this book . His keen journalistic eye does n't miss a detail . Although the era he is writting about has long since gone by the reader can not help but be pushed back in time . There is one scene that always sticks in my mind . I think Pablo 's mujer is telling Robert Jordan about a village they " cleaned " of fascist . The details of the brutality in that section of the book will give any reader a glipse of what war is .
5 #### Hemmingway transcribes his expat experiences in the Spanish American war into a gripping story of the futility of combat . The main characters hide in the hills struggling between loyalty to their anti - fascist cause , and the scars caused by the attrocities they 've experienced . For whom the bell tolls , as we all know , " It tolls for thee ! " This summarizes the story . To Hemmingway , war is futile . We all lose . Agree or disagree with the morality , the story captures Hemmingway 's ability to lay emotions bare with strong minimalist prose and dialogure .
5 #### This book is definitely a " desert - island " book for me . I love all of Hemingway 's extensive body of works , but this novel is by far my favourite . The story is about a young American man who is fighting voluntarily against Franco 's Fascist forces in Spain . This man ends up leading a band of guerillas in what turns out to be a totally useless military foray . The novel itself only encompasses seventy - two hours , but in that time Robert Jordan , our American hero , loses his comrades in battle , falls in love , and is badly wounded . Hemingway 's writing is masterful in this classic ! This book , even more than " A Farewell to Arms " outlines Hemingway 's thoughts on the futility of war , and the effect that war has on one single man . Even though the novel encompasses such a short time , Hemingway makes use of flashbacks to bring the reader into the series of events that led to this particular point in Jordan 's life . Again , Hemingway makes use of personal experiences for this novel . He was actually involved himself in this Spanish civil war . His writing style is spare , although incredibly vivid . This is a truly wonderful book , that I feel encompasses all the best of Ernest Hemingway .
4 #### Author Ernest Hemingway spared little in this searing look at the Spanish Civil War . Readers see that hatred , loyalty , doubt , atrocity , ideals , and emotional wear were all part of this tragic conflict . The story centers on American volunteer Robert Jordan and his anti - fascist comrades , a band of Spanish Loyalist guerillas operating in the hills behind enemy lines in 1937 . Jordan is planning to blow up a Fascist - held bridge as part of an upcoming Loyalist / Republican offensive . His comrades include Pablo , a once - dependable leader now unstable and sick of war , Pilar , a woman of remarkable fiber , and Maria , a victim of fascist atrocities with whom Jordan falls in love . These guerillas hide in the hills while Hitler 's bombers fly overhead helping the fascists . Readers learn of atrocities committed by both sides , and see that ideals can die along with those that fall in battle . This 1940 novel makes a powerful statement , despite losing some effect from Hemingway 's wordiness and too - lengthy descriptions . Despite this flaw , readers see the cruelties of war , and sense the author 's heartsickness at this dreadful conflict .
5 #### I had to write this review because of the review someone else wrote ... This person said it was about Hemingway 's support for anti - communists and young americans going over to Spain during the civil war to fight the communists ... He must not have read the book . The main character of the book went to fight against the FASCISTS , not the communists . He hated fascism and wanted to stop the fascist regime from taking Spain . Fighting on his side were many communists , or Spanish backed by communist nations , such as the spanish generals trained by the communist Russian nation , so how on earth this reviewer could think it was against communism if he read the book is beyond me . Also , this book is about much more , it explores moral issues and covers themes from love to the truth of war . Hemingway really makes you see the tragedy and pointlessness of war .
5 #### I read this book when I was in middle school and really enjoyed it . I think it is a great pick for anyone , but especially young boys and Hemingway fans . I plan to reread it soon .
5 #### EXCERPTED FROM " GOD 'S COUNTRY " BY STEVEN TRAVERS " For Whom the Bell Tolls " is based upon Hemingway?s support for the anti - Communists fighting in the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s . He and many other Americans went over to fight in the war , which some say was a " dress rehearsal " for World War II . It did not materialize into the kind of idealized Spanish government that many had sacrificed for . The fascistic Francisco Franco ended up ruling an isolationist Spain until the 1970s . While the nation is now Democratic , the Franco regime was the final event that took Spain from greatness to mediocrity . Hemingway also wrote a stageplay about the Spanish Civil War called " The Fifth Column " . STEVEN TRAVERS AUTHOR OF " BARRY BONDS : BASEBALL 'S SUPERMAN"<B > ...
5 #### Having read two Hemmingway novels , I was not impressed . Frankly , I was surprised that I did not enjoy them . After growing up and hearing about the great Hemmingway , the man 's man , I found his characters weak and whinny . Ready to give up , I gave him one more try and I am glad he did . This is a magnificent novel . Set in the Spanish Civil War during the 1930s it tells the story of Robert Jordan , an American volunteer fighting against Franco and his fascist allies . This is first - rate story telling , it grabs the reader from the offset and pulls him into the story . Unlike other Hemmingway novels ( i.e. , The Son Also Rises ) , these are heroic characters that we deeply care about . The imagery is magnificent . I can still see in my minds eye , the retreating Republicans , the panicked soldiers , the horses out of control and the cartridge casings spilled in the road way . If you are unfamiliar with Hemmingway , read this book first . All the others will pale in comparison .
4 #### in for whom the bell tolls hemingway looks at war from the individuals perspective . his army is a rag tag group of guerrilla fighters , not the army . the time and setting is the spanish civil war . a general understanding of that war is helpful . the characters include mostly local insurgents and one american mercenary . the horrors of war are portrayed on both sides with neither having the higher moral ground . it is also a study of courage in the face of potential death . this is developed not only through the underlying theme of war , but the stories of some of the characters earlier lives which include bull fighting and the running of the bulls . the one drawback to the book is the stilted language used in the dialog of the novel ( including the refusal to use obscenities ) . a book well worth the read
4 #### It cracks me up how Hemingway refuses to write swear words and the word " obscenity " becomes a verb , ie . We are obscenitied ! The obvious Spanish syntax is interesting as well and I imagine that those not fluent in Spanish would find the English both twisted and awkward at times.(example , Hemingway writes , " For a favor , do this ! , which seems a direct translation of " Por favor " . Another example is " How many years to you have ? " ( Cuntos aos tienes ) instead of the proper English " How old are you ? " . It 's as if Hemingway wrote the dialogue in Spanish and then translated it word for word into English . I 'm not sure if this is genious or annoying . Regardless of this goofy English , the novel is a good read and I recommend reading it .
5 #### Hemingway spans quite range . If you have just finished reading The Great Gatsby and are interested in the jaded , bored - with - life , spoiled and rich who drink and drink , read The Sun Also Rises . If you 've just finished Dr. Blade # 57 , you like senseless action , and just want to say you 've read Hemingway , try To Have and Have Not . But if , like me , you come from a background of JRR Tolkien , RL Stevenson , HG Wells and Jack London , and perhaps you have already read a few Nick Adams tales or The Old Man and the Sea , then do n't be daunted by this story 's length - this is your book . While it 's true this book slowed down a few times , that rang true . It mirrored the reality of my military experience . Then again , there are some chapters of this book burn into the memory : how the Communists first dealt with people after taking their hometown , the stand they took on the hilltop , the final scene , and others . There characters were clear , the action realistic , the inaction tense . Read it .
4 #### ... this book aims to please those readers of Spanish novels with American themes . Give this a read .
3 #### I love almost all of Hemingway 's novels , but this one was a daunting effort . Line by line , or a paragraph at a time , the writing is Hemingway at his best . Yet , inexplicably , I found that as one chapter segued interminably to the next , the story and style became muddled and could not sustain my interest . There is much , however , that is worth the time ... themes of monogamous love , war / conscience , life / death . The heart wrenching finale illustrates the notorious he - man 's mastery to convey softer , " feminine " sensitivity . Definitely not the one to kick off a reader 's Hemingway exposure .
5 #### My third Hemingway book . I had been intimidated by it for a while ( mostly by reputation ) , tackling his smaller , less dense works instead . Finally I picked it up and never regretted it . It took me a while to get through the middle section , but once I got through that I could n't put it down . While on vacation in Chicago , I even took it with me and read while at a bar with friends . Every book I 've read since pales in comparison .
4 #### If you 're a Hemingway fan , then you should not miss this book . There 's a reason why many people feel this is his best novel . The scenery , character development , plot and overall picture in words make this a masterpiece . With the Spanish civil war as his launching point he makes great strides in making the reader feel the grip of ANY war past or present . What you get here is a lot of his philosophy on war , life , love and death . A theme with which he was more than passively familiar having had several near - death experiences until he finally took his own life . Compared to many of his other works , the ending is also somewhat of a fresh surprise . The John Donne quote cited in the fly leaf speaks volumes about the current troubles in the world today . Like all great literature , despite being written more than sixty years ago , this book still feels fresh and new .
5 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls is a fantastic book . Hemingway writes heroes with fears , doubts , and faults so well that I feel a deep connection with them . Not every man is a John Wayne ; passing through life clear of purpose and without second thoughts . ( But watch a little tv and you 'd think it were so . ) Hemingway creates characters I can understand , appreciate , and connect with . Also , Robert Jordan 's love interest reflected my own with my fiancee . The book was fantastic for its story , its plot , the characters and the way it made me feel reading it and afterwards .
5 #### FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS is a great book if you are interested in the history of the Spanish Civil War . It is also useful if you are seeking insights into Hemingway . So much of the novel is taken directly from the author 's experiences as a foreign correspondent in Spain for the North American Newspaper Alliance . There are many facets of the book which contribute to its outstanding reputation . Hemingway 's treatment of Robert Jordan , the protagonist , is exceptional . Jordan is a very complicated man who is radically transformed by the events described in the book . He is also the first Hemingway hero to contemplate suicide . El Sordo is a leader of another guerilla band which is operating in the same territory as the band in which Jordan serves as an aide . The description of El Sordo 's last stand on a hill against the Nationalists is an example of Hemingway 's best writing .
5 #### An interesting historical novel set in the context of Revolutionary Spain , but classic Hemmingway , it carries with it the important lesson of activism over apathy , especially pertinent to today 's world . It teaches that ideals transcend political boundaries and that if you believe in something strongly , then you owe it to yourself to protect that ideal in any part of the world and at any cost , even that of your life . Intwined is a beautiful love story . One of my top 5 greatest books of all time . That s a rave , baby . The poem by John Donne at the beginning makes the book worth buying . A 5 because it is a great story with an invaluable lesson . If you gain nothing , you still read beautiful prose by one of the greatest authors ever .
4 #### This novel is considered by most to be one of the great novels of the 20th Century , and its author to be one of the greatest authors of all time ; there are undoubtedly reasons for this . Yet , Hemmingway is also considered to be a " love him " or " hate him " type . I tend toward the former , though he is n't one of my personal favorites . The plot of this novel is relatively straightforward . American Robert Jordan , a member of the International Brigades fighting with the Republicans against the Fascists during the Spanish Civil War , is given the task of blowing up a bridge to prevent the Fascists from bringing up reinforcements to repel a Republican offensive . But while the plot is uncomplicated , the depth and breadth of Hemmingway 's story telling are not . There are layers and layers of emotion , passion , and personal pain . You are transported to the mountains of Spain with Jordan and a band of Spanish guerilla fighters . The characters are so incredibly real , that you feel as though you could find their names in a history book . For those who have never read Hemmingway , I 'd say give it a try .
3 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls , is equally very engaging and very dull . Occasionally this novel cracks with energy , the tension among the characters is quite potent , and then at other times it bores you near sleep . The rambling monolgues can be great(like when Pilar is detailing Pablo 's once fervent commitment to the cause ) and then at other times the words seem to be an annoying roadblock that you have to wade through to get to the meaty parts . All in all I respect this novel and do think it is a good work , but I ca n't give it more than 3 stars , because of the chores it sometimes put me through .
5 #### Hemingway 's style was so fashionable amongst writers of the post WWII era , that Italian authors actually attempted to invent their own slang just to sound like him . I have n't kept up with modern Italian literature , but I am noting that American writing is slowly regressing into that pre - Hemingway over - wordiness . The focus now seems to be on sounding " poetic , " rather than writing " one true sentence . " This is truly sad because Hemingway brought American writing to a new level . You can almost feel his straining to come up with the perfect words for his descriptions . I read For Whom the Bell Tolls for the first time thirty years ago , when I was fifteen . It convinced me then that Ernest Hemingway was the greatest American writer of all time . Re - reading it now , in middle age , I still feel the same .
2 #### I want to offer a little dissent here . I thought the book to be a bit dull and slow . I really labored to get through it and becuase of it completely turned me off to the rest of his work . It could be that I spend too much time reading action fiction so I need a fast paced book to keep me interested .
2 #### This novel bored me . And I like Hemingway 's work . Pilar 's tragic stories go on and on , as do pointless conversations in caves with desperate people swearing at each other and hitting each other in the mouth ( which , alas , only encourages more conversation instead of silencing it ) . The constant use of " obscenity , " " muck , " etc . instead of the real swear words is truly wearying , and the translation of Spanish terms into " thee , " " thou , " and " less bad " mean nothing at all to the casual English reader . Nor is Robert Jordan ( why does Hemingway keep using his full name throughout the novel ? That 's irritating too ) much help , being a typical Hemingway strong - and - silent - type who drinks too much , enjoys bullfights , and lives to sleep with pretty 19 - year - olds . " The earth moved " is the best he can do in the supposedly passionate and brief love scenes with Maria , who enjoys pouring him more wine while washing his feet . His doubts about doing his duty are neither profound nor convincing . Until well into the novel he 's a too - typical freedom fighter who justifies duty over Eros in dreary inner conversations . Like another reviewer put it , I wished a quarter into the novel that he 'd spare me his musings , blow the damned bridge and go home .
5 #### This book is about an American , Robert Jordan , who joins the Republican Army ( communists ) to fight the nationalists during the civil war in Spain in the 1930 's . He joins a guerilla - group which is given the mission to blow up a bridge to obstruct the fascists ' offensive . Although he has a bad feeling about the whole situation he persists . I found the character pilar the most interesting , fulfilling a key role of telling the background story ( her experience in the war sofar ) as well as being the one who keeps the whole group together ( her insights give the American , Robert Jordan , some information about Pablo , the member of the group who ca n't be trusted ) . Although it has bothered a lot of people ( read the other reviews ) , for me the translated Spanish words and little sentences really added something to the atmosphere of the book as well as to a better depiction of the characters .
5 #### To me Hemingway epitomizes the hard drinking , hard living , hard loving , worldy writer . In this book , the main character Robert Jordan is a soldier send on a mission to the hills of Spain to blow up a bridge . There , Jordan meets up with a rogue band of warriors who believe in war but not in military . Once united with the militia , Jordan becomes involved with a woman named Maria . The fight scenes are incredible . The ending is even more incredible . I 'm not going give away the book , but the ending brought tears to my eyes- I guess it 's true , underneath every man of steel is a heart of gold .
5 #### Hemingway is a stickler for details , and it really shows in this book . The story takes place over only 4 days time . It starts with Robert Jordan an American dynamiter who has joined with guerllos to fight the fascists . He is led to a cave by Anselmo an old man , early sixties , where there is a camp . Pablo is the drunken leader and Pilar is his wife . Robert Jordan is very inner sociable , he talks to himself a lot , only when he is alone usually , it clears his mind . This book was truly amazing from the first word to the very last word . Truly amazing , Hemingway is one of the best authors there ever was . It would seem that he was actually there to get the details he put into this book , and you can actually see where he is and what he is talking about , and that is what the best authors do . Reading reviews on Amazon could not make this book any better or worse , so just buy this book and read it , I gurantee is will be hard to put down . Mark_Sigel
5 #### The greatest book by one of the world 's greatest authors . Anyone who considers themselves remotely interested in reading or literature should read this novel immediately . Hemingway reached the peak of his craft here , from the storyline to the characters to the prose itself . It 's part war novel , part love story , and part historical documentary of the Spanish Civil War . All three blend together seamlessly to create a book without any recognizable flaws .
5 #### The complexity , depth and beauty of this book are immeasurable . I have never read a more moving book .
3 #### Please do n't dismiss me as one of those idiots who ca n't spell and says a book is " boring " because it 's long and they 'd rather be listening to heavy metal music . I read " Moby Dick " and did not find it boring . I read " Bleak House " and did not find it boring . I read " Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire " and did not find it boring . But " For Whom the Bell Tolls " is , well , boring . Here 's why : I never gave a damn for this Hemingway hero Robert Jordan . He seems like a pretty aimless tough guy , making love every fifth chapter and cussing around trying to be cool . The ending was entirely unsatisfactory - we end up having gone just about nowhere . Fortunately , Pilar is an interesting character who adds some spice to the proceedings . The only real point to this novel seems to be conveyed by its fine title , a reference to a John Donne poem . Loosely , the poem conveyed the idea that whatever happens to any human being ought perhaps to be the business of all of us . In the case of the novel , Hemingway draws attention to the largely overlooked Spanish Civil War and its suffering . But he does so with the title page alone ; the rest of these 400 pages add little to this noble premise . Hemingway needs a better plot to devote his fine style to .
5 #### He can write effectively and knowledgeably about war , bullfighting , and hunting , but not women . This has been a common criticism against Hemingway over the years . Many critics have found his depiction of women hollow and superficial . His women seem to exist only in the context of the male hero . They are given no distinctive voice of their own and are almost always dealt a tragic fate . This can not be said of Pilar from " For Whom The Bell Tolls . " She is one of Hemingway 's strongest female characters and has often been characterized as " the real leader of the guerrilla band . " Pablo may hold that title at the beginning of the novel , but as the novel progresses , Pilar 's authoritative stature becomes more and more evident . Pilar is a rather contradicting figure and this is a testament to Hemingway 's ability to fictionally construct her well . On the one hand , existing in male - dominated culture , she is fully domesticated , expert in her knowledge on how to perform traditional womanly duties . On the other hand , she is not entirely complaisant or silent willed . She will not hesitate to speak her mind nor will she hesitate to take up arms and fight with the men . She also has enough military sense to lead a group of male soldiers .
5 #### After having read the first half of this book , I was bored . Nothing happened . We heard about a future attack , but it never happened . But then suddenly , at the last few chapters , it finally took place . And then the book got so exciting that I sat there gasping for air . I also understood why the boring first half was included , because that part was the one that made the last half in to such an incredible experience . And after I read the whole book , the first half became exciting too . So buy this book , it is the best I have ever read . But keep in mind , that the first half is boring . So do not give up . Keep reading it to the end , and I promise you the best reading experience you have ever had . It is the first book by Hemmingway I have read , but it will not be the last .
2 #### I 've read two other previous books by Hemingway . Feel free to read those reviews as well . In his best piece , Old Man and the Sea , Hemingway describes a man 's courage and conviction in a mini - epic struggle between and elderly man and the greatest catch of his life ( a giant marlin ) . In another book , The Sun also Rises , Hemingway paints a very rich and colorful portraitt of Spain and Pamplona that I could not sum up in a few sentences . Both books create a vivid picture almost unequaled in literature . This book , however , does nothing of the sort . Excluding a side story that concerns the massacre of a town of locals , it is repetitive , boring , and provides little insight . The majority of this 450 page book takes place in one cave and provides very little substance . Personally , no picture was painted for me , no human character was exposed , and no real lasting meaning came from this book . I grew tired of the cave , tired of the speculation about killing the Guerilla leader Pablo , and bored of the lightweight , unreal romance . An editor could have spliced away pages 200 - 400 , and the book would have not missed a beat . If you 're a casual reader like myself , stick with other Hemingway works .
5 #### I loved Farewell to Arms , so I picked this up at the bookstore near work and could n't put it down . It really grabbed me . While the first chapter in any Hemingway book is difficult due to his lack of immediate characterization , it soon becomes easy to understand . I loved the dialogues between Pilar , Jordan , and Maria . They were so funny . I even learned some Spanish . I love Hemingway 's prose and for a while I tried to model my own writings after his . Unfortunately , I 'm not as good as he is at it . Anyway , this book has inspired me to go to Spain for my semester abroad and to research the Spanish Civil War more deeply . Great novel that happens to be educational .
5 #### Having recently come back from Paris , I went through a Hemingway phase , starting with his memoirs of his Paris days , then I stumbled on this book . The stumbling was a fortunate accident , for this book is amazing . Hemingway 's short but powerful prose is in perfect form . I actually find Hemingway and Gabriel Garcia Marquez similar in their ability to capture a thought completely in one sentence- even though their actual sentences are different . Hemingway perfectly captures poignant emotions , and the sentence sparsity adds to the strength and description beautifully . I also agree with one of the other reviewers above , in that my appreciation is probably helped by age . A lot of the emotions of loss , doubt , disillusion and love I only felt in my post high school years . It 's a good adventure story nonetheless , but might lose its power for a youger audience .
5 #### This novel brings one into close contact with the forces in dreadful conflict during civil war -- Solidarity versus Brutality ; Hemingway portrays both thoroughly . The story told by Pilar in this book seemed to haunt me for a few days , the images were so clear , and as one will find by reading it , it is a story which has a very grave lucidity , as if you wished Hemingway would drown the scene in a sea of lifeless and complex words . The descriptions of the love story and Jordan 's internal motivations immediately soothe the unsettling images of war , and the novel as a whole works paradoxically to the point where both sets of images collide , and leave the reader both unsettled and fulfilled simultaneously .
5 #### I 'll be short and sweet . This is an excellent book that many different kinds of people will enjoy . The more intelligent the reader is , the more he or she will get out of the book . At the base , it is a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat . From there , there are many little symbolic happenings and hidden meanings waiting to be seen . For Whom the Bell Tolls is a must read book !
4 #### Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel . His descriptions of the settings are superb . The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil War , a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar . Hemingway used characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war . The story is powerful . His main character , Robert Jordan , begins to question whether anything good will come of all the fighting . Despite its many wonderful attributes , this novel has some problems . The dialogue is stilted . The romance ( as in all Hemingway novels ) is unbelievable . Finally , Hemingway should have stuck to English . His use of Spanish in this book is embarassing . Nonetheless , in my opinion , For Whom the Bell Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students . It 's truly a classic .
5 #### This is by far my favorite book ever . I am sure many other people will lay out the plot for you in their reviews , so I will tell you what I loved about it . I love the bravery and leadership of the main character Robert Jordan , I loved how Hemingway used people such as the strong willed Pilar and other characters to only make it seem more realistic , and I mostly love how Hemingway painted a picture with Robert Jordan that is the example for all people who want to see what bravery is . No author could top this book .
5 #### This is book is " the one " to read if you really enjoy reading . Hemingway 's work is just superb , the bold symbolism and metaphors make this a must have in your bookshelf . His style is simple writing yet under its surface lies a much deeper aspect and meaning . This is Hemingway at its best . If you like literature you will apreciate it , and once you finish , you feel enticed by his way of writing . As I said , Simply Hemingway !
5 #### Then check out the passage when he falls to nothing . This is the best war book ( along with Tim Obriens The Things They Carried which is way different , and about a different war , but equally powerful ) that I have read . It exhibits everything and gets to the point of life and its lack of purpose if you can not find something worth dying for , and that that purpose is not the real purpose at all when it comes down to dying . This is not a dark book , nor is it self - pitying as I imagine a less able writer would make it so soon . It is not even depressing , it is exciting and touching and well - written . And there 's winesacks as well . " the bell tolls for thou , " he quotes . This book gets to the connectedness and loneliness of people .
5 #### If you like Old Man and the Sea , you 'll love this . It is similar in feeling and has a Spanish flair . I seldom remember lines from books , but I 've memorized many from this novel . The opening quote from John Donne is as deep as they come . It sets the tone for the book , but is better understood if you immediately re - read the quote right after finishing the book . You really truly understand then what is meant when he says , " Do not send to know for whom the bell tolls .... it tolls for thee . "
5 #### For Whom the Bell Tolls is a story that will be with you forever after you have finished the last riveting page . All other books will be judged by standards set by Hemmmingway in this one . The Tragic story of Robert Jordan and his love Maria is more amazing than any other I have read , seen or heard . El Sordo 's final stand reads the way the greatest symphony is heard . Tension and crescendo that builds and builds until you become one with the characters and their struggle . I have never read a book that ends like this one , and chances are a first time reader has not either . Get this book . Read it . This IS writting .
5 #### This is one of Hemmingway 's best . It is about war , love , and the endless fight for the opportunity to be human . It has a heartwarming love story that is beautiful without degenerating into a sappy Danielle Steele novel . Perhaps the main thrust of the book can be summed up in one of is most famous lines : " The world is a fine place and worth fighting for and I hate very much to leave it . " For those who grow weary of 20th century novels that are driven by stream - of - consciousness and herky - jerky narrative , they will find Hemmingway 's straightforward , lucid yet eloquent prose quite refreshing . This is a very well done book for the ages .
5 #### As I look over the reviews of the classic works of literature , I am appalled by how often I see the word boring being used . I guess it 's because great books do n't come with big screens , speakers and a joy stick . Welcome to the Millenium .
5 #### I got the book because of a recommandation and because of the cool quote . I 've read The Old Man and The Sea in High School and hated it . But Form Whom The Bell Tolls is brilliant . What impreses me about the book is how Hemingway manages to come up with a tightly written action tale , with deep philosophycal ideas and a great romance . I 've read alot , and For Whom The Bel Tolls is my second favorite book ... you ca n't afford missing it
2 #### I love Hemingway , but this book bored me to tears . I 'll concede that I watched the movie first and knowing the ending took some of the fun out of it . Go read A Moveable Feast . You can always come back to this one later .
5 #### This book is as meaningful as it is enjoyable . It presents life in no terms other than reality . The dichotomies that Hemingway explores , the anecdotes he tells , the characters he creates , and the experiences he describe all combine to create a spellbinding work .
4 #### The photography in this coffee table book is just wonderful . It 's a result of a project conducted on April 15 , 1989 , the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic of China ( ironically , just before the protests of Tiananmen Square ) . Ninety of the world 's leading photojournalists fanned out across country and took photos , leaving a record of a varied country . We see Buddhist monks clad in scarlet , people practicing ballroom dance in public squares , hundreds of bicyclists pedaling to the rain plastic ponchos , a bare - bottomed toddler pedaling a bicycle , Muslim men at prayer , a psychiatric patient , and Deng Xiaoping spending a quiet night at home babysitting his friends . The photos are huge and breathtaking and a volume well worth having as a record of life in this vast and varied nation .
5 #### This " coffee table " book literally sits on my coffee table . Every member of my family looks at it just about every day -- we are constantly showing each other the pictures . It shows an amazing variety of moments from an amazing country . It draws you in , and every time you look at it , you see and learn something new . I highly recommend this book . I am thrilled with it .
5 #### A good solid book to have about China . I 'm very glad that I got this .
5 #### I suggest everyone should read the author Robin Sharma . - by this I mean all his motivational books . A person who is a motivational speaker all over the world suggested them to me and I am gifting everyone I know . Do what he says and you will have a rewarding fabulous life . ! ! .
4 #### Good for people who are looking for / trying to find their paths in life
3 #### This book is great for the reader who those readers new to these ideas & philosophies . For myself I had read all this before in one form or another & so it was nothing new & just a distillation of what I had already read & hence I personally never found it to be a great read .
5 #### I got this book because it was the book chosen for a book club I belong to . I was n't sure what to expect but I wound up loving this story ! For anyone wanting to change their life and live a more positive life and get away from the negative so prevalent in today 's society this is a great story with great wisdom and practices to implement in your own life .
5 #### As a long time student of self - improvement , I found this book to bring the recipe for meaningful life into a compact story that clearly explains not only the ingredients for that life , but also exactly how to combine them to create the happiness for which you have been searching . The symbolism in the story is well explained and the steps are easily grasped . If you take these lessons to heart and employ them , your life can only change to be more fulfilling .
3 #### A very nice story with lots of great advice explained in long winded way , but with very little real application instruction . It explains nicely the why and what , but is lacking the how . Still a very nice read .
5 #### This book put a lot of things in perspective for me , makes you realize what 's most important in life
5 #### I love this book and the following one . I have read this book multiple times since I got it . I learned so much the first i read I decides to do things different . When I picked it up a second time I saw things I did n't see the first time . I m sure is because I was at a different stage in my life . Since , I have read it multiple times
4 #### I am not amazed that this book is a national best seller . The concepts instilled in this book , if properly implemented can without a doubt bring desired change . Robin Sharma provides 7 virtues to radiant living and reaching your destiny as well as including various rituals to set you on your way . He also incorporates countless lessons . The lesson that stood out to me most was on living in the present moment .
5 #### I loved this book , very motivational and I still look the places over the book where I have highlighted while I was reading it couple of years back . Everybody should read this book . Robin Sharma Rocks !
4 #### Intersting . Offers some good advise in an entertaining way .
5 #### Robin Sharma is a master storyteller and a insightful mind that uses extraordinary ideas to touch the heart . I am challenged and moved .
5 #### Easy to read . A fun conversation between a " reformed attorney " and his protege . It is a story that brings to bear " 7 Timeless Virtues of Enlightened Living . " Overall I enjoyed it very much . The virtues caused me to think about my own life and where I 'm trying to go . The ideas really are n't new if you follow Tony Robbins , Jim Rohn ; however , Robin Sharma has done an excellent job presenting these ideas and virtues in a new way . Personally , I think it is a worthwhile read for anyone who is trying to improve their lives and those around them .
5 #### Deep but also easy to read . Conflicting right ? The story itself is easy to follow how ever the thoughts it inspires are amazing . A strong recommend .
5 #### It was an easy and enjoyable read that reinforces goal setting and positive actions bringing results .
4 #### I have heard a lot about this book through several colleagues of mine . My expectations were very high . I found the book to be good overall , but not as outstanding as I hoped it would be . I must admit though , I 'm not a fan of general fiction which is why I might have not enjoyed it as much as others . In his book , Robin tries to communicate 7 different virtues that can help elevate a person 's way of living . He does this via a monk who was a successful lawyer in his previoua life who got burnt out . The main story is based on a creative visual of a beauttiful garden that Robin put in place to help the reader parse the 7 virtues . I did find the narrative a bit ' backwards ' , in the sense that Robin seems to have worked backwards from the idea of this garden and forced the narrative . I also found it a little funny that the junior mawyer , who the monk was talking to throughout the story , seemed a lot more naive about life than you 'd expect :-) . Overall , Robin does present some provocative thoughts that are worth considering and great one liner quites that stuck with me . As a result I am rating this book as a 4 star !
5 #### One of the books that changed my life ... I first listened to it as an audio book , and loved it ... It is truly transformational . I wish I would read it before my 20s .... but better late than never . Thanks Robin !
5 #### It is a book worth reading . It kept me interested from start to finish .
3 #### Interesting , but a bit extreme for me as a lawyer to read
5 #### This was an excellent book . The way that sharma weaves this fable with actual methods thay are invaluable is astounding . I did n't want to put it down !
2 #### Decent story , but it was nothing more than a fable . If I would have read more into the description I would have bought something else .
5 #### In a lot of ways this book is what Thoreau was trying to communicate to us about life . Circle round and round your life as a dog does his masters chase , your life looks poorest when it 's the richest , humility like darkness reveals the Heavenly Lights " Thoreau " Walden " Robin Sharma does a great Job in diagnosing a remedy for some of the problems of today . My takeaway is also Ancient : Awake , Reflect , Watch --- The Dhammapadda He does a nice job of embedding the often overlooked simple remedies of everyday life into a fascinating tale . " We live meanly like ants , to be awake is to be alive " Thoreau I must say his book helped revitalize my quest for service and inner peace It also reminded me of what was said about the Great Saint Mahatma Gandhi : " Gandhi experimented with his life as few humans have ever done before him ; he sought to erase every trace of selfishness and violence from his Soul in a relentless pursuit of Service and Truth that lasted until his last breath " " Let a man not be corrupted by anything external , let him be unconquerable and courageous in Spirit , let him be ready for any fate " Seneca
2 #### I had such high hopes for this book , but I was definitely disappointed . It reads like The Celestine Prophecy , with hints of The Peaceful Warrior . It 's a good book , but the material could have been presented much better . Maybe all of the " enlightened " authors write the same way , but I was n't thrilled with this book .
2 #### The idea of an individual making a 180 - degree change in his life caught my attention . I did not realize that this book is just a fable and a long - winded one at that . In the story , it is a high - powered lawyer struck down by a heart attack that sells the Ferrari and goes in search of enlightenment . He becomes a monk when he finds the people who can help him , and at that point , he no longer owns a car . The story is OK , I am just the wrong audience for it .
5 #### It is more than I expected . Love this so much .
5 #### Wow . I have recommended this book to everyone . I have read many books in this category , but for some reason this one just stood out . I highlighted almost the whole book . A fable very well told and very easily adaptable to every day life .
5 #### Sharma had me at the title , and the rest of the book did not disappoint . He conveys that a successful life has nothing to do with the car you drive , and that money is not the answer to happiness . I agree with everything he says , except I still do n't like to get up early in the morning !
5 #### the best book ever . Recommended over and over . This is a book you can read once , twice , even a third time and keep it as reference .
5 #### for everyone this is a great book I bought additional copies for friends
5 #### Great book , came highly recommended and did n't disappoint . Let 's you , at the very least , take stock of your life and greatly motivates you to be selfless
5 #### The book was very thoughtful and helpful in putting life in perspective . I gained a lot from this book . I tend to be high strung , so I could relate to the characters in the book . I would highly recommend to folks with chaotic and stressful lives .
5 #### A beautiful tale having the message of living life to fullest . Instead of making a book with just self improvement ideas which could be boring to some , the story fashion of presenting really helped .
5 #### This is one amazing book . Must read for everyone
3 #### The last time I read this book was in 2006 and for some reason the Taj Mahal story mentioned in the last chapter of the book stayed with me for all these years . And that was the reason why I chose to read it again this time . I found the book to be inspirational and engaging and written in a very simple style which makes the book more readable . Though the book raises really good points ( there are few gems in the book that I have n't seen anywhere ) , I found it to be unoriginal . I must say that I was surprised by how freely the author takes other peoples ideas without giving credit to them ( Victor Frankl , Stephen Covey , Napoleon Hill to name a few ) . Clearly this shows that the author does n't live the life of integrity he preaches . I would have given the book a four - star had it not been for this reason . But having said that I enjoyed reading the book and recommend to anyone who is looking for a quick and short inspirational read .
5 #### This is an amazing book ! It shows how sometimes what we see on the outside may not always be true . This book is about the development of character and discipline in life . Robin Sharma , through this fable , is able to show us some very important things to keep in mind as we journey through life .
4 #### Compilation of ideas from a variety of disciplines told in a story format .
5 #### A very special book . Sharma shares his wisdom in a wonderfully simple book . Great lessons that can immediately be implemented into daily life .
1 #### this is the most boring , dry read ever . I 'm mad that Paul Coelho , author of " the alchemist " says this book is " captivating " that it teaches as it " delights " . I love " the alchemist " , did someone pay him to write the praise for this book ? ? because it 's a total lie . If the alchemist was made of heart , this book is made of mind , and it 's boringggg . just read the first few pages and you 'll know what I mean . basically it 's full of things like this : the sages did this , so you should too . the sages did n't do this , so you should n't either . follow this , follow that and you 'll be just like the sages . this book is not a fable , like it says on the front cover . I had to lol on that one .
5 #### I could n't put this down . It had a lot of lessons that I have heard before , but I think because it was told in a story I was able to absorb more of it .
5 #### This book is about ownership of ones life in all aspects . It teaches positivity and most importantly ownership of ones life . It kills victim mentality mindset as everyone of us has a choice to make under every circumstance . It 's teacher the basics of life and the world would definitely be a far better place if we live these principles .
5 #### A recommendation from a friend I had not seen or heard from in 36 years . This book uses a great story to convey the message that extremes , on either end , are not good and that achieving and maintaining balance in one 's life is the right course . Great message and great book .
5 #### A life changing book for me ! It hit me hard ! This is my new bible . I might not be able to do all of the radical changes but I 'm willing to try ! Waoooo I 'm ordering this on hardcover to always keep with me as a reminder
5 #### This book has some excellent life lessons that can anyone in any field in life ! I highly recommend this book !
2 #### The whole phylosofy is told as " true " . But bit by bit you start thinking how real is this and it turns out to be fantacy . For me , this " lie " really " killed " the whole value of the book . How much of this can possibly be really applied and helpful in my life if it is all based on a fairytale ? Reality value ? ? ?
5 #### Simply one of the best books you can read . I ca n't believe I did n't read this before . I was scared when I was about to start a job at a startup ( Crowdbabble ) because I could n't commit to anything in the past . This book has changed my life . It let me believe that failure is important but also not to compare myself to others even though I knew that , the book really makes that clear as a concept and a way of life . Be happy in the moment and learn to love the journey not the destination :)
5 #### This book is the first book that I 've ever read that I thought would be a good book to read twice . It was filled with so much useful information that I thought really would be useful in my day to day , sometimes stressful life . The author did a great job on this masterpiece . It is a pretty spiritual book , but I would highly recommend it to everyone I know !
5 #### This book is full of simple mantras to live life fully . And they work miraculously .
5 #### Robin Sharma - YOU are my motivational guru AND a great writer - I really really enjoyed this book . I forward your blogs to my friends ALL the time . I look forward to attending one of your events in the future .
5 #### It is hard to come away from this book not feeling overwhelmed by the evil , injustice , pain , and yet the indomitability of the human spirit . I came away transformed and re - read passages often . I wish this book were better know . I urge its purchase .
5 #### Robin Sharma has conveyed an important message thru this book . Everyone should read and keep reading this book .
5 #### Amazing - this should be school reading for everyone .
2 #### This book is full of good guidance , but the structure seems forced and the life suggestions are no longer fresh . Lots has been published since this was first printed .
5 #### This is a great book . It tells a great story about finding your way in life . About being aware the important things . You will not be disappointed . The characters also play an important roles in a couple of books written after this one . You will want to read them also .
5 #### This is a story that reads like a mystery . Ca n't wait to get to the next page . Very easy to read . Deep concepts presented story form . Want to read other books by this author
5 #### I very much enjoyed this read . It reiterated to me golden truths my soul has always known but somehow my mind had forgotten . Thank you for a light in the darkness . Linda Burandt
5 #### This wonderful book was recommended by my friends in Hyderabad , India . It is a story about living . It is a story about purpose . Most of all , it is a story about realizing you control your own destiny and the stories to be told on the day of your demise . I heartily recommend it for all who question the purpose of a hamster wheel life .
1 #### This by far was one of the most pathetic books I have read in quite some time . The writing was immature , there was practically no plot , and it was preachy beyond belief . The author would have been better served to simply make it a self help book and spare us the effort he made to try to turn it into a novel .
5 #### Thank you , perfect ! I am so grateful for your kind help in getting me this book . Sincerely
5 #### Powerful book that I will continue to read over and over . This book will propel you to live your life on purpose .
5 #### Great book , just as described for condition , fast shipping , very pleased with my purchase .
5 #### Best book ever . Instantly can change your life and offers principles to help guide you . The principles come with an amazing story , one you wo n't soon forget .
5 #### I recommend this to everyone to improve the way we live our lives . Enjoy and re read it often with an open heart .
5 #### This book is a must read .... simply fantabulous Amazing wisdom shared in simple and lucid language It will change your paradigm
2 #### This book could 've been a lot better . The back story for the main character is so contrived it is not believable , the cliches were so bad I felt insulted . Think after - school - special . The lessons are great but I could barely get past the first 20 pages !
5 #### Arrived on time and with exactly the status of the book .
3 #### It was an enjoyable read . Useful information to be shared by the author .
5 #### Wonderful book ! Very inspiring ! Full of nice lessons , explained in a great way ! Definitely worth reading ! Suggested for all ages but especially for workacholic parents !
4 #### The book is not only interesting but it is also practical in its approach to get you started towards leading a more fulfilling life . While the story line is a bit far fetched , it carries a powerful and enlightening message . I took many many notes and would surely recommend this it my friends ... it 's a must read to those caught on life 's hamster wheel ....
1 #### I started out thinking I was going to like it . However , it did n't take long to change my mind . Finally bailed and threw it out . Includes some excellent quotes , but the characters are so patently shallow , the story so patently fictional , and the advice so old school and way more effortful than need be . Go with Parallel Universes of Self by Frederick Dodson if you want a presentation with teeth .
4 #### Nice inspirational book . But at some places feels boring .
5 #### AMAZING ! I listen to this often when driving . Except I just realized I gave it to a friend so need to order another one . the CD versions of books makes my driving trips MUCH easier .
4 #### the premise is a little too Dr. Phil for me .. easy read .. needs a leap of faith in the story line and the dialogue is offered as if it had been contemporaneously transcribed ; I doubt that .. it would have impacted the conversational style
5 #### Jill Barklem writes great stories and the illustrations are exquisite . I read many of her stories to my son 20 years ago and just had to have my own copy .
5 #### The stories are simple and sweet and the illustrations are wonderful . One can spend hours looking at the detailed cut - aways of the underground homes with their kitchens , bedrooms , storage rooms , etc . Young children will love hearing the stories and exploring the illustrations .
5 #### This beautiful little book rounds out our collection of Brambly Hedge books . This is a stand out with the heightened sense of adventure and mystery with the discovery of the secret staircase that leads Wilfred and Primrose into the chambers of the Woodmouce ancestors . The underlying theme in this story is Midwinter which I think is a great alternative to Christmas and opens questions for kids about this holiday which is an ancient celebration . I love the detailed maps and drawings that accompany the story and the little descriptions which fill in the corners of your mind while reading . I read this and other Brambly Hedge books to my kids who are 6 and 4 and they adore them , sitting quietly , listening intently through the book . My 6 year old reads this book as well with some help from me . Vocabulary is hard in this story but the fact that it introduces new words not ordinarily seen in modern books is a bonus . This is a wonderful book I highly recommend for parents to share with their kids .
5 #### This is a practical and memorable guide to making changes to improve your life . The lessons here are clear and logical . It is a very quick read but feels like one of those books that you could read over and over again and still find new gems .
5 #### Excelent book . Easy to read and very usefull . Love it .
5 #### The book is very useful for everyone who wants to live a better life .
5 #### this book is so good , i have n't finished yet but its an amazing book
4 #### I think that sometimes we have to stop and think about who we are and what we have .....
5 #### Buy it this book will change your life ... the book has a written plan on how to make all of your dreams come true ... if you implement 1/10 of what he gives you , you will live a wonderful life .
3 #### A friend thought I was depressed and thought I should read this book . I was n't depressed and sorry he talked me into this book . I think it would be good for someone who need motivational speaking or in a slump from depression . My fiend loved the book and said it was very useful on his journey in life .
5 #### Great book . Would recommend to anyone who combats the hustle and bustle of a fast paced daily life . Helps you think about what 's important and how to being to step from the " hamster wheel " of life .
5 #### This is a great book and a life changing I will highly recommended for people that is in the search of true meaning of life
2 #### Most of this book is written as a dialogue between the author and his friend , an attorney turned spiritual guru and this dialogue is so , so bad . The author wants us to believe it 's a real conversation , but no two people have ever talked to each other the way this is written . It 's so stilted , so fake , so chocked full of needless attributions that even novice fiction writers know to avoid , not to mention two supposed friends who repeatedly refer to each other by first name in the course of a single , that it 's really difficult to get through . The ideas , however , packaged as revolutionary and known only to a group of mysterious monks that the author 's friend just managed to find in the mountains of India are really just repackaged Buddhist teachings . The story framework , about a sumo wrestler in a garden , is nice memory device , but that 's about as much as one can take away .
5 #### The book takes you on a Journey and has full of surprises . You do n't have to do the methods in the book to enjoy it . Test the methods yourself .
5 #### This is an amazing book . I would recommend to everyone who want to live their live wonderfully . Worth to re - read it from time to time
3 #### I found this to be a good read and quite a fun story . I could relate to someone changing careers ( or life - path in this case ) , and it was nicely told in a kind of conversational manner . It is in many ways a mindfulness guide but within the story of a lawyer turned monk . Worth a read , but the lesson could be read elsewhere more quickly .
5 #### AMAZING ! ! ! Do n't miss out on the most incredible book in many years ! So much to learn . Will read it again .
5 #### This book covers the buddhism lessons in a unique way that is both entertaining and practical . I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will no doubt read it again in the near future .
3 #### Cute story and managed to hold my interest , but only needed to read it once . For me , a great book can be read several times . This one is another take on the " finding peace within " theme .
4 #### Very nice story and the tips and truths portrayed in the story are real , if put into practice you can really benefit from it !
5 #### It 's amazing story . I love it . Highly recommended ! Wonderful thoughts and insights about how to live your life more fulfilling .
5 #### It is a personal trip through the most important thing in your life , yourself . I did not expected to like it , but when I saturated I could not stop . Heard the same tongs in many other places , but the way he explains them is very nice and helping .
5 #### Robin Sharma 's book literally changed the course of my life . I left a job I hated and began my own business . I am fulfilled in my work life and my personal life has seen significant growth as well through application of the lessons learned in this book .
3 #### It 's a great reminder of purpose and searching for what is going to enrich your life . You can get caught up in the day to day hectic life and forget the important stuff
4 #### A delightful , easy - to - read book , packed with life - giving wisdom . As it was published in 1997 , and because I am in the second half of my life , I feel I am already living much of the wisdom shared . But , as wisdom is timeless , it still worth the read , and the reminder .
4 #### I really enjoyed reading this book . For some of us it probably can not be applied literally ; but it certainly is an eye opener and breaks us from our daily " routine " we 're all glued to .
4 #### This was a really nice read . Written in very simple and easy language , it gave the essence of what is now called work life balance . Many tips & philosophies are in the book that really can make a huge positive impat in life .
4 #### Robin hits it on the head . I will always carry the messages of this book with me . I will also be reading all of his books now . His videos are also very powerful ! ! !
2 #### " The Monk Who Sold his Ferrari " has an interesting paragraph that could apply to itself : " Do not read just anything . You must be very selective what you put into the lush garden of your mind . It must be immensely nourishing " . I just reached the half reading of this book and I am considering giving up . Before starting the book , I was expecting something more surprising , sharp and imaginative . But no . It 's another self - help book , with a too obvious content that made me feel really bored . I understand people love hearing and reading what they need and want to hear and read . But , I expected Robin Sharma could be a little more complex and deep . At the end , nothing from this book is new and it 's just the result of a clear intention to sell books as much as possible .
5 #### I have bought two more of these books to give to my family . I 've kept mine as I know I 'll re - read it at least a couple of more times to get more out of it . I also have listen to the tape in my car , going on the 3rd time .
5 #### This was one of my son 's favorite books . Our entire family had it memorized and would recite it together when the book was n't handy . It is a great book for adding some dramatic flair . I recently bought several copies as he wants to keep a copy in the children 's corner set up in his place of business . Hopefully I purchased enough so this old favorite can be shared with many more generations of kids . It is a keeper !
4 #### I had this book as a child with a cassette tape . one of my all time favorite books . Thanks for giving it new meaning while i read to my granddaughter ....
4 #### Robin Shama presents processes and tips in easily understandable terms demystifying what is still a difficult personal journey . Thankfully , without the necessity of learning the Sanskrit names for the concepts and procedures . The dialogue is amateurish but the purpose of the book , to transfer knowledge from the author to the reader , is achieved .
5 #### This is a fabulous book and very inspiring . It talks about the real things that are important in every human being 's life . Love and forgiveness for one 's self , finding our purpose in life , loving and helping our fellow man and many other important aspects of human existence . The author does all of this while relating a wonderful fable that helps the reader remember the main precepts of the book . It is told in a very interesting style that keeps the reader turning the pages to get to the conclusion . Read this book , it is very positive and uplifting for the human spirit .
5 #### I loved this book . It is so inspirational and it has helped me in so many different ways . I ca n't wait to start my new life , two seconds from now .
5 #### I 've been enjoying their stories for 25 + years . This one is great . It 's a good , fun scare ! I love how we " act " out the story as we read and it 's especially great reading in the dark with just a flash light . It 's great for the youngest for children .
5 #### Same text as the original , but in a nice compact board book size . My family absolutely loves Spooky Old Tree ! Not too long , lots of fun , nice illustrations .
5 #### This book is so much fun to read to your toddler . When the line I the book " and one with the shivers " comes up I hold the child close and pretend to shiver . It gets a giggle every time .
5 #### Three little bears , one with a light one with the stick and one with a rope , go on the adventure through the spooky Old tree . This has been one of my favorite books to read , and always requested by the littles I have watched throughout the years . Simple story , not too scary , beautiful artwork and a story you can really put drama into . I purchased a few copies , originally I was going to just purchase them for my nieces who grew up with me reading this book to them , as baby shower gifts ( It 's hard to believe " my babies " are grown up . ) but my husband added more for me to give to the kids moving out of my class . ( They LOVED the gift , I had a few moms tell me how excited their children were to own the book and how excited they were to have a copy to read at home . ) this is one of those books that can create a love for reading , wonderful bonding opportunity for parents and children . I ca n't wait to see my nieces reaction when she opens her present and sees a set of the books she loved as a child to read to her own little ones with this one on top .
5 #### We love Berenstain Bear books ! We the lessons in such a great presentation ! The illustrations are always so bright and beautiful . This book helped my 4 year old see why we should always use caution in our adventures !
4 #### I thoroughly enjoyed this book . It is a quick read and one that I will likely read again . I have continued to ponder many aspects of this story and realize that I need to apply them in my own life . Looking forward to the discussion of this book at my reading group next week .
2 #### I found the book very tedious repetitious and boring . Expected to learn something and gain some in depth knowledge about meditation and self discipline , but did not . May be I expected too much .
3 #### I 'm not the kind of person that reads this kind of thing , a member of my bookclub chose it . But I actually liked some things in it . For example the listening to calm music in the morning when you wake up to start your day right . Plus , all the monk practices have a practical use that 's described in the book for you , so that 's cool .
5 #### My all time favorite children 's book . When I get to the part where they have the shivers , I shake like crazy and my daughter loves it . One flaw ( spoiler alert ) ; when they get to the staircase , they call it a stair , not a staircase . " Do they dare go up that spooky old stair ? " At least make it plural " the stairs " . Whatever though ; it 's still the best kids book ever .
5 #### This is a classic ! I got a first copy 30 years ago with a cassette . I 've used it every year with my 2nd grade class and they love it ! I just wish I could get it on CD . The cassette tape is wearing out .
5 #### My kids ask me to read this book over and over again ! ! ! !
4 #### monk who sold his ferrari - decent read . well written , good flow , interesting . monk who sold his ferrari - decent read . well written , good flow , interesting .
3 #### This book is high on thoughts , motivating , but did n't like the way book progressed , I felt like two peoples conversation , frequent Q&A , finally i say its very good book to boosts oneself .
5 #### This book is a for sure and yearly read .... what a wonderful read and application book .... I love Robin style of writing and is now reading " The leader who had no title " . I am excited I have crossed paths with Robin Sharma ..... Many blessings
5 #### I really loved the way this book is written . The ideas are crystal clear , at the end of each chapter there is a very precise summary , and the whole story its interwoven with a beautiful small story that it stuck on my head . I would definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to improve his / her life .
5 #### My wife loves this book and recommends it to everyone she knows . If you have a chance , give it a try .
4 #### This book tells a simple story and leaves you with a deep and profound message . This book will get you thinking . You will find a ton of practical tools and tips to make your life more peaceful , meaningful and satisfying . It will help you achieve peak performance and find true purpose and mission in your life . Highly recommended !
5 #### This classic Berenstein Bears story was a favorite of my two daughters , who are now 36 and 32 years old . I hope my young great nephew likes it as well as they did .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books to read with preschoolers ! They love completing the sentences when you read each page as they become familiar with the text . I have been a teacher for 30 + years and will always love this book !
3 #### What ? This is n't even-- there 's a plot but no point . It 's got very few words and it 's very repetitive . There are three bears . I ca n't tell if they 're supposed to be Brother , Sister , and Honey or different bears . Well , given the 1978 copyright date , it 's clearly pre - Honey , so it 's just another bear who 's wearing Honey 's overalls . They go investigate a spooky old tree . It keeps saying , " Do they dare X ? Yes , they dare . " And they keep going through weird things in this creepy house that 's kind of like a haunted house and they get more and more scared . At the end there 's a giant bear and they crawl over him and he gets mad and chases him , and then they run back home , and that 's the end . There 's no real point . Pretty much everything is interchangeable . The characters are interchangeable . The plot points could have happened in any order . It 's really not very interesting and the author did n't try very hard in writing a story . There 's not even any reason for them to be in this Spooky Old Tree to begin with . The best part : when they climb over a giant , sleeping , naked bear . That would be equivalent to climbing over a large , sleeping naked man in their world . It 's just a weird thing to do . And it reveals the whole exercise as home invasion . For more children 's book reviews , see my website at drttmk dot com .
5 #### This book is great ! Loved it when I was a kid and now I love reading it to my 5 year old . It has great drawings and i love that it is predictable text so my son can help read it .
5 #### This was a cute children 's book that I received in good condition .
5 #### My kids all loved this book , so I got it for my niece and nephew !
4 #### The Spooky Old Tree is a great suspense story for little ones . Three little bears go out one night to explore a creepy old , abandoned tree and each brought something to help with the investigation . I think this one might be scary for certain kids , but I think most would really enjoy it . Especially a great read for on Halloween !
5 #### A family favorite now buying it for my granddaughter . A great story the kids never could get enough of !
5 #### Glad that there are Berenstain Bear board books so I can start my son on the series early . It is an abridged version , so do n't expect tons of pages . Great quality and size .
5 #### Robin Sharma spins a good story . At first I thought the story was true , except the way the two friends were talking to each other sounded like b movie actors . Then I looked at other reviews and saw the whole title which includes the word " fable " . I have it on kindle and never saw that . Still a great story , despite the corniness of the delivery . The messages delivered really help with daily life today .
4 #### the art of personal effectiveness narrated through a simple easy to understand fable . it is effective and profound . Thanks Robin !
4 #### This is truly inspiring but I am a bit disappointed to find several business ads of the author at the end .
5 #### A successful friend died , shocking a lot of us . In his obituary , a friend said his favorite book was The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari . Curious , I bought and read it . Be curious . Buy and read itif you are n't afraid to change your value system and get more out of life .
5 #### this is a book I will read over and over . I am buying copies for the special people in my life .
5 #### great ideas without all the crap that usually comes along with books on how to get your stuff together , recommend to anyone who is trying to pull it together
5 #### A classic that my children loved and we are excited to read it to our granddaughter .
5 #### I worked in daycare for 15 + years . We had this book and the toddlers just loved it . They 'd ask me to read it again & again .
5 #### An easy reading book . It will give you the guidance you are looking for to achieve success . Before you star your journey in life you need to have a predetermined goal . Once you choose your goal you need a road map , that map is inside this book . Remember , same as in the business world , you can hire advisors that will advice you how to succeed making money , but they wo n't do it for you . Is for the business owner to choose the best advice , put it to work and make it happen . This book is like those business advisors , the book will guide you but is up to you to implement and execute your plan .
5 #### I loved this book . I would never have read it had it not been on my book club list . It is full of really practical advice on living a full and happy life and in these tough times we could all do with taking stock of our lives .
5 #### Robin Sharma tells his story in the style of Og Mandino . He writes a fictional story as if it had really happened to him . This one is so good , I wish it were really a true story . But fiction or not , the story told herein demonstrates a remarkable way to live your life . I bought this book a few weeks ago and following the suggestions is already changing my life . Thanks , Robin !
5 #### I bought this as a Halloween book but it sticks around year - round and is requested often at bedtime . Something about this story is very intriguing and I enjoy reading it every time just as much as my son enjoys listening , and answering " Yes , They dare ! "
5 #### I Ioved this book as a child ... now reading it to grandchildren ! It is a favorite of theirs ! The Spooky Old Tree .
5 #### This is a family favorite bought for my granddaughter .
5 #### A huge favorite with our sons when they were young . We borrowed it from our local library constantly and read it over and over . We bought this one for our Grandson .
5 #### Another favorite in our house ! All my kids have loved this book .
5 #### At first I was n't sure about that book . Yeah ! another book which tell me that poverty is a gift and that looking to be more comfortable in my life is nearly a capital sin . But no ! I do found an inspiring philosophy in this book and I believe that it is a very good book to read no matter your expecting are . MarKo
3 #### Interesting with some good shared wisdom but a far cry from Paulo Coelho 's Alchemist which it was supposed to be like .
5 #### This parable offers a map to leading a more effective and productive life filled with gratitude and service . It is a lighthouse for proactive change !
5 #### I purchased this book for my grandchildren . It is a book that my children loved when they were young . It is a solid , spooky and fun book !
5 #### I bought the board book for my 18 month old daughter . Okay I bought it for me too because this is one of my favorites from my childhood . I remember my dad reading this book and exclaiming " Yes they dare ! " Love this book ! Such a fun book and my daughter loves it when I read to her . A must have for any children 's book collection . ( My family thought I already had the book or my daughter would have had this book long before 18 months . Everyone love it ! )
5 #### Read this to my own children and not to my grand child . Love this book .
5 #### Speaking as a retired elementary school librarian , I will have to say that Halloween stories such as this one , The Spooky Old Tree are some of the very best - and easiest ways to get students hooked on reading . They love Halloween stories and whenever I read this one to a group , everybody wanted to check it out of the library or have me read it again . I have seen so many reluctant readers grab up a Halloween book and have such a good time . Berenstain Bears were always great favorites but having them celebrate Halloween was like icing on the cake for most students . I love these books and especially the Halloween Spooky Old Tree .
5 #### Nothing else to say , other than you must read this . It will change your life . Stop reading this review , and get the book . Now .
5 #### My grandson loves the Berenstain Bear books and it was in extremely good condition
4 #### The story is fine , but the pages and cover are much thinner than the same books I had bought years ago for my own children
5 #### Must read . Best night time books ever . Why do I need twelve more words . Not sure . It 's just good . Yup .
5 #### This a must have book for children . It was one of my kids favorite and I have now bought it for all of my grandchildren . The questions on the page demand audience participation ; I can still hear my kids scream , " Yes , they dare ! "
1 #### This book was remarkably missing the main points of Buddhism . I was disappointed . It was a self improvment book with no real wisdom to share about how to accomplish all the tasks that were set out .
5 #### This fictional account is very interesting and insightful . I really enjoyed it and I would highly recommend it if you like philosophy and self - help books .
5 #### This is a great book . It 's been awhile since I 've read it and need to read it again . I 've shared it with friends too .
5 #### Power of positive thinking given in detail is wonderful . This book is capable of beng a text book . You ca n't afford to miss this book .
5 #### Dare they go up that spooky old tree ? Yes they dare ! My grandchildren love the repetition and suspense in this classic . A must have for preschoolers and early elememtary children !
5 #### Fun for the little ones as they will repeat as you read until they have it memorized !
5 #### When my five - year - old granddaughter comes to spend the night , this is her most requested bedtime story . Great rhythm and illustrations for children . Thank you , Berensteins !
5 #### Through an interesting story , Sharma gives us a basic guide to human and spiritual values . It 's understandable if some people do not accept it . When you are guided by materialism and hedonism you will not like this book that makes you see the greatest things in life which are not necessarily money , pleasure and power .
4 #### This book is about more than living your dreams - its about living your life in the best possible way . Its an easy read with heaps of wisdom . A great book for those starting out on personal journeys .
1 #### This book takes many , many pages to say in a remarkably roundabout and flowery way something that can be expressed in a sentence : take good care of yourself , both physically and spiritually , and your life will improve . At first I was intrigued ( the author did a good job with the title ) , then bored , then embarrassed by the fact that I am continuing to read all this artificial New Age babble waiting for a revelation around the corner . If you are looking at this book and considering purchasing it , save yourself from disappointment : buy a good book on yoga , read it and follow the advice . At least it will be written in an adult - level language and based on solid foundation , not on an imaginary tale where beautiful sages wearing white robes and flower garlands play heavenly music and meditate with expression of utter peace and contentment on their wrinkle - free faces - and did I mention they all were old but ageless ?
5 #### Great book , my kids favorite when they were little , fast shipping , great seller !
5 #### Best book ever for all ages little kids . If you can put some imagination and liveliness into reading this to kids , it will become their favorite book of all time .
5 #### This used to be my favorite as a child , and now it is my childrens favorite .
5 #### The copy I used to read to my children was worn out , so I purchased another copy to read to my grandchildren . One of my favorite Bear books , especially around Halloween !
3 #### This is an " ok " self - help type of book . You learn the same lessons about " slowing down and smelling the flowers " which is the typical recommendation of a high - powered business type or lawyer who has a scare ( heart attack etc ) . A decent read with a tale that all of us should hear from time to time- then we go right back to normal after a frustrating drive home !
5 #### I first met this book in the early 1980 's when I was working at a daycare center . The 2 's & 3 's loved this book . My daughter loved it in the late ' 80 's , and my grandchildren love it now !
5 #### This was my son 's favorite book when he was little . I love to buy it as a gift for other little boys .
5 #### My 4 year old boy made me reread this book more than 4 times the first day ! He loves the story and the illustrations . He 's not reading yet but has everything memorized so he loves to tell me the story !
5 #### At a time when I was re - evaluating my career , this book was one of the keys to making my next move . It 's a parable that will strike a chord with all the people who have , in the words of Zig Ziglar , " climbed to the top of the ladder to find it 's leaning against the wrong wall . " Seriously , get this thing and read it . It 's that good .
4 #### I bought this book after reading the charming ' Serendipity 's Secret ' which also uses the fable format to good effect . I thought ' The Monk ... ' had some great ideas and I enjoyed reading it . Just like Serendipity 's Secret , I loved the idea of a ' coach ' and a ' coachee ' as the central characters and the useful summaries at the end of each chapter were effective . Yes , some of it is a little cheesy and the dialogue a bit stilted at times , but this made it no less of a compulsive read which I looked forward to getting stuck into each day . I loved the use of Yogi Rahman 's fable to summarise the ideas in the book , which I now refer to daily to remind me to put the book 's teaching into practice . Overall , an enjoyable and practical read .
4 #### Ok , the plot and the characters are cheesy - let 's get that out of the way - but the underlying ideas are interesting and useful . The author provides , in a form of a parable , a collection of timeless principles to guide your personal growth : master your mind , follow your purpose , practice kaizen , live with discipline , respect your time , selflessly serve others , embrace the present . It 's an easy read and one suitable for all ages - I think everyone will pick up something different from it .
5 #### I 'm a negative person and this book is helping me a lot . It is the story of big shot lawyer who discovers a much better , calm , fulfilling life and then tells an ex - coworker ( and us ) about it . It tells a fable that makes no sense originally but it 's used as a reminder of the things that will help you live a better life . Each of the main things on the fable represent an idea and the fable helps you remember all of them . To me the books is already worth it just with the first chapter . It is helping me avoid , or at least kick the negative thoughts out of my mind . The book explains , how our mind is like a garden and depending on your thoughts you can have a beautiful garden or one full of weed . I have started with a pretty ugly garden but I 'm already working on improving it . That 's just the beginning , then it goes from there , giving more wisdom with every chapter . Please , if you are a negative person , you need to read this book .
5 #### I love this book . I read it to my children , and now I 'm reading it to my Grand - kids .
5 #### My Grandson has read this book with me so many times at my home that he could correct you if you misread something . He loves having a copy at his own house .
5 #### This was my favorite book as a child and I was so thrilled to be able to find it and buy it for my own kids !
5 #### This book was purchased so I could enjoy it with my grandson . I read this book to my own children when they were little and they just loved it ! Ca n't wait to share it with another generation !
5 #### Our kids love hearing this story ! They re read it with great drama and love noticing the details in the picture s ! !
5 #### A favorite with our children . Bought this to share with our grandchildren so they may experience the fun their parent 's had in story time when they were younger .
2 #### The basic ideas in this book are worthy , but it is so awkwardly written it is painful . I finally just had to put it down . Maybe it just boils down to the fact that books of this type either " speak to you " or they do n't . This one spoke to me , but what it said was " you wasted your money on contrived tripe . "
5 #### Just started it but love the concept . Not everyone needs to be this extreme but the story gets the point across well .
4 #### What a great read ! We need more people writing about how they have left their traditional life behind and pursued their destiny . Nothing wrong with a traditional life as long as that is the life you really want to live , but most people live lives of quiet desperation feeling that there is no way out . Here is a man who shows us that it is possible , albeit a challenge . It takes courage and conviction and a vision to seek the possibilities of life that will lead us to and allow us to live our destiny . Dr Gunta Krumins - Caldwell author of On Silver Wings
5 #### An easy read but one you should take notes on as you read . I got some new ideas but it was mostly things I knew , but this book put them together in a meaningful way . It is one of very few books that I will read again .
5 #### My daughter loves these books , and the style is so simple and un - confusing , she 's worn out my old books to the point we have to get new ones due to the binding wearing out . This is one of her " go - to " books and loves me reading it to her time and time again . The story has n't gotten old even as I 've grown up .
5 #### I liked that the bears were so silly . it was not spooky . I liked the part when 1 had shivers , then 2 had shivers , then all had shivers . I am 5 years old .
5 #### This was my daughters favorite book . We have read this many many times . Love it . U will love this book
5 #### My brother , sister & I always loved The Berenstain Bears when we were younger . The Spooky Old Tree was my brothers favorite so I bought this one for his daughter so she could enjoy the same stories we enjoyed at her age .
5 #### This was my youngest son 's favorite book when he was a child . He is 36 .... Our grand daughter came to visit , his niece . She had me read it to her 3 times in one night . The book belongs to my son , who lives in Vegas ..... I mailed it to him when his own son was born . I ordered another one so I would have one to read to her when she is here ...... It is now her favorite book ! ! ! She loves reading it to Nana ...... Brings back a lot of memories
1 #### Started off very intruiging , kept wanting to know more ... got nothing . Very poor writing ability . I thought I was reading an elementry school kid 's essay . Great ideas , should have pitched them to an actual writer who could have developed a story . Here 's what you 're in for : ( quoted from page 90 ) " I still have much wisdom to share with you . Are you tired ? " " Not in the least . I actually feel pretty pumped up . You are quite the motivator , Julian . Have you ever thought about an infomercial ? " I asked mischeviosly . " I do n't understand , " he replied gently . Was the book written by a 10 year old , I pondered sincerely ...
5 #### I really enjoyed the book . its an easy read with a great message and outlook on life .
5 #### I love this book . It in some ways changed my life . Sounds cheesy , but it 's true . The messages in it are so true and Robin Sharma makes it so simple to make small changes in your daily life to help relieve stress , look towards a better future , and reach your potential in any area of life . I think it will make me a better wife , mother , and help me with my career . I bought it so I can reread it over and over . Just amazing ! Jean Moms Helping Moms Work From Home [ ... ]
5 #### The Monk who Sold His Ferrari is one of the best books I 've read in 30 years . I 've read Think and Grow Rich , The power of Positive Thinking , and dozens of other great books about living life to the fullest , and this was right up there with the best ! The book was a gift from a dear friend and I was stunned to realize it was published 10 years ago . I 've bought 5 more copies to give to my closest friends ! Great book !
5 #### I found this book to be one of the most profound books I 've read . It offers such simple yet stirring words of wisdom . This book has inspired not only myself but my friends who I 've lent it to , to make the changes in our lives to become better people . To quote one of my favorite passages in the book , " We are all here for some special reason . Stop being a prisoner of your past . Become the architect of your future . " It 's words like that coupled with simple exercises and advice that truly gets you motivated to go out and achieve the best that life has to offer . I highly recommend this book .
5 #### Exellent book . I read a lot , but rarely find this good books . There are some typical self - help content , but it 's very accurate and well put . As a story it 's poor , but the content rocks .
5 #### I got 1/2 way through the book and loved it . However , my puppy decided to take it from my nightstand and eat it as an appetizer . So I never got to finish it .
5 #### This book was my children 's favorite when they were between 4 and 7 . I read it to them almost every night . This time I ordered for a baby gift instead of of a card . Great idea .
5 #### This was one of our kids ' favorites as they grew up and has been popular with other children as well . We have some special friends & their daughter wanted it read every time she came to our house , so we ordered it for her birthday ! She loves it ! You ca n't go wrong with this book . . . it 's a classic !
5 #### Will they ever get out of there ? ? ? My boys had me read this over and over and over to them . I just had to buy it to pass on to the next generation . This series goes hand in hand with Dr. Seuss .
5 #### Purchase many of these stories by Stan and Jan. they have timeless messages in a fun format that keeps everyone smiling .
3 #### I enjoyed this book , with reservations . It 's an odd blend of ( mostly ) Buddhist philosophy with the sort of self - help pep talk preferred by corporate go - getters . At times it reminded me of reading the Dalai Lama , at others , a Franklin - Covey leadership session . The parable is a little facile , and the dialog naive-- but the overall thrust benign and even helpful . It may well be a doorway to a better path for many who read it . If you 've never encountered Eastern philosophy before but are already a fan of corporate pep talks , you may find this a real treat .
2 #### I appreciate the underlying wisdom ' The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari ' tries to articulate - develop joyful thoughts , follow our life 's mission & calling , cultivate self - discipline , nourish relationship etc . On the other hand , I am disappointed by Sharma 's inferior writing ; the dialogue between a high profile trial lawyer & his protoge seems unrealistic & superficial , & the characters are difficult for readers to relate to . For readers who are interested in learning more about the wisdom that ' The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari ' fails to articulate , I would recommend Alan Wallace 's ' Genuine Happiness ' , and Matthieu Ricard 's ' The Quantum & The Lotus ' .
4 #### This was one book I judged by its title . I found it gimmicky so resisted reading it for a long time . In retrospect , I should have read it much earlier . The book lays out its 7 principles using a silly but effective fable that is easily remembered . The principles are : 1 . A magnificent garden that signifies our mind . 2 . The lighthouse is a representation of the purpose of our life . 3 . The Sumo wrestler stands for Kaizen , the continuous and never ending improvement that we must bring into our lives . 4 . Pink wire cable denotes the discipline that 's required to be successful . 5 . The stopwatch represents time and how it is the most important commodity . 6 . Fragrance of fresh yellow roses signifies the service we must do unto others . 7 . A bright diamond studded path represents enlightened living . Read the book to see how these 7 principles fit in a mythical funny fable . [ ... ] has the summary of the book .
5 #### One of my children 's favorite books . I give this for birthday presents . It 's fun to act out the " shivers " with the kids .
5 #### This is a classic , and our kids love it . It has been requested many nights in a row ! Its fun for them and for me .
5 #### Beautiful art and story . Not quite the best format in a kindle , but it 'll do ! Glad to be able to take it with me !
5 #### I like the item and it was in perfect shape and shipped swiftly . It was my children;s favorite book and now they each have a copy .
5 #### When my girls were little ( they are married now ) and I asked if they wanted me to read them a book , they went to the bookshelf for this book more than any other . They eventually could " read " it to me - before they were five and had learned to read . They actually had it memorized ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I love the original Berenstain Bears books and so do my kids . They are wonderfully illustrated and the rhyme and meter are second to none . I was born and raised on these stories and I bought them for my children when they were born . " Inside , Outside , Upside Down " was the first book by daughter learned to read on her own . She is seven years old now and still loves them . These are timeless classics that you can pass on to your children and grandchildren . Buy them all now !
3 #### This novel is a light and easy read , with a writing style at about a 6th grade level . There is not much in the way of a plot , and the story is the interaction between a high profile trial lawyer and his protoge . You would expect this pair to not only be highly intelligent , but highly articulate as well . The simple and trite dialog between the two just did not seem realistic to me . The story and it 's characters seemed shallow . In terms of enlightenment the book presents 7 steps to live a wonderful life . I found the parable given to be silly , but the 7 steps are good stuff . They came off as lacking depth to me though , probably because the story was not good enough to draw me in . Entertainment : 2 stars Enlightenment : 4 stars
2 #### This is terrible writing , at its best , marketed to the masses . The dialogue is so unreal . The characters , you ca n't even relate to them . It 's so hokey , and nothing original . Unrealistic practices , rose meditation , c'm on , I 'm to do this for two weeks . There are many , many other better books out there . Trying Being Peace by TNH . Good luck , and if this book worked for you , great . I reviewed this in a positive mood too .........
5 #### Like many similar books such as The Way of the Peaceful Warrier , do n't miss this one . Fun , entertaining and it will make you contemplate your relationship to life is a fun , storytelling format ! Do n't miss this one ....
5 #### The author of Leadership Wisdom , Robin Sharma , provides the reader with insights into how to become a visionary leader . The objective is to help leaders transform businesses into thriving organisations , in this era of rapid changes . He has a down - to - earth way of expressing his powerful solutions for today 's most pressing leadership issues . The book is devoid of jargon , which makes it easy to follow for anyone wishing to improve his or her leadership skills . Leadership Wisdom is a simple but captivating story on leadership . It teaches personal development , effectiveness and individual happiness . It teaches individuals to fulfil themselves in this hectic age . The book incorporates the tools of transformation into a simple philosophy of living . As a top executive in my organisation , I have often failed in my duty to provide leadership . The book enabled me to identify my shortcomings as a leader . I am now equipped with the knowledge and expertise that has made me a better leader , and changed my life . I am now able to inspire my subordinates to be more creative and productive . I now know how to develop a compelling future focus . I believe that my subordinates now trust me as they view me as being more compassionate and caring . I learnt how to build motivated teams , and how to adapt to change . I have improved my personal effectiveness by having the ability to concentrate on purposeful activities . The book is very informative , easy to read and extremely helpful in equipping individuals with leadership skills .
5 #### Love it . I remember it from my childhood and bought for my kids . My three year old loves it . Joe .
5 #### Another great book , this entertaining tale was finally destroyed after dozens of children laughed and shared over the years . I not only replaced the original one , but bought some copies as gifts , too . Snuggled with the children on the couch and reading this book is a treat , an experience I am not willing to give up yet , despite my age . All the children of the family have grown up with this book and my daughter now reads it to her little 2 year olds in child care . It is their favorite book . It came in excellent shape and in a timely manner .
5 #### I have three children and this book was read so many times that I could almost read it with my eyes closed . It is fun and you can dramatize it or not , depending on how you are feeling at the time .
5 #### My son is 3 1/2 years old and he pretty much " reads " this to me every night . Love the older version because it makes the whole book even " spookier " . Ca n't go wrong with any of the bear books .
5 #### I can understand the negative reviews of this book ... but ... I knew nothing of eastern philosophy before I read this book and now this book has made me aware of an area of knowledge that will probably become central in my life . It 's a very simple book but at this stage in my life it is exactly what I needed . I do n't think the book is profound but it is a stepping stone onto things that are . Give the book a try and you may find that it is the wake - up call that you need too . If you even think about buying this book , then you should , it means that you 're at a point in your life where you 're looking for answers or meaning . This book will point you in a good and meaningful direction .
4 #### Sharma 's book is definitely well written and a very easy and enjoyable read . It highlights wisdom from the EAST and WEST in a succint manner . Its certainly worthwhile and will help you to transform your life if applied with persistence and determination . It discusses principles such as mastering the garden of your mind , positive thinking , following your purpose , inner development , building and applying discipline , making good use of your time , helping humanity , and above all living in the moment . I m sure you will enjoy the book and I definitely recommend it . I believe there is wisdom to be found in all works of written art , however you must apply the knowledge to your life . Highly recommended .
5 #### One of the best books I have read ... ever ! Other books can be too clinical in their aqpproach meaning you forget what the book is trying to tell you far too quickly . This book is NOT one of those . It 's story - like approach is innovative and the lessons you learn about life sink in readily and are not forgotten by the next page . Definitely a recommended title . I am going to buy every other Robin Sharma book as a result !
5 #### This book makes you examine your own life , if you see similarities with the main character , and reprioritize . We get caught up in the hustle and bustle of everyday life and forget what is important . The main character gives up all material things in his life and discovers what lives within himself . I have given this book to a couple of people and am now rereading it . Easy read .
4 #### My initial reaction to this book was that the story seemed a bit weak . Like a previous reviewer , I also expected a story as fulfilling as Paulo Coelho 's " The Alchemist " and was disappointed to find that the story is only used as a method to present the monk 's advice , however , I decided to give the book a chance ... and I 'm glad I did . The ideas and suggestions presented in the book can be life - changing if taken seriously . It gave me ideas on things to improve in my life . I recommend reading this book at least once and if one of the ideas presented makes a difference in your life , it will be well worth the investment .
5 #### This is an interesting story . It is a story of a lawyer who appears to have it all - the corner office , the life style , the cars , women , ... Then he gives it all up and tours the East . While there he comes across this strange monk and monastery . He comes to live life in a much different way . Yet he is challenged by the monk who has trained him to go back home and share the message he has learnt , with the West . Julian , our main character , returns to his old law firm and to his prot?g ? John . He tells him a parable ; then the rest of the book explains the parable and how it relates to different aspects of our lives . The parable is rather simple and a little strange but as it is explained you will never forget it . Read it to find out how a garden , lighthouse , sumo wrestler , pink wire cable , stopwatch , roses and a winding path of diamonds are symbols of timeless principles and virtues by which to live your life . This book could help raise the quality of your life to a new level .
1 #### The norwegian translation of this book states on the sleeve : The eternal wisdom presented in a completely new way . Nothing could be further from the truth : Mr. Sharma seems to have made a porridge of the most easily digestible versions of eternal wisdom and the most glib and superficial versions of self - help books on the market , and put whatever rose to the surface in a " fable " strangely lacking in any form of drama or power to transform or inspire . I admire those who can find upliftment in this flat copy of others ` ideas , but rereading " Autobiography of a yogi " and reading Malcolm Gladwell`s " Blink " around the same time as I had the misfortune to encounter this book , the difference in quality is staggering . Puzzled , I looked up Mr. Sharmas home page , and found the most blatant piece of commercialism and grandiose self - advertisement in the self - help field - no mean feat in a field of strong and heavy competition . It`s obvious who bought the monk`s Ferrari .
1 #### Utter childish nonsense . The author dosen't seem to know the first thing about the search for spiritualilty or meaning . He just rehashes often repeated sayings and makes a fantastic story about some foolish lawyer who goes off to the himalayas in search of meaning . He meets himalayan sages who live in huts built of roses ! . The women gurus wear pink sarees and white flowers in their heads ! What is this if not a childish construct of paradise ? Its one of those instant things . Like instant coffee . It might perk up someone after a reading for a day or two . But it is no profound pool of wisdom . It dosen't come from an internal awakening that happened to an author . The kind of stories and " fast food " kind of spiritual wisdom presented here have been around for years . I fail to see what is new or original about it . I am amazed there is still a market for this kind of pop spirituality .
5 #### A beautiful book very well narrated and written . A great inspiring book for all those people who needs a change in life . Sometimes our insecurities and fear of future curtails us from taking certain decisions in life . But at the same time , certain circumstances forces you to make the change and this is a fable of a man who had a chance to make the change . I think some of the jokes fall flat with a great topic in discussion .
5 #### This book was a favorite of my children , and now is the same for my grandchildren . I am expecting a new grandbaby in August , and at the shower , rather than a " to - from " card is to be a favorite book . This is going to be the one ! Bought extras for baby gifts to others who are expecting , too . Great shipping -- extremely fast ! Perfect new condition . Nothing negative at all about this transaction .
5 #### I remember reading this book when I was a child and have so enjoyed reading it with my 4 year old son . He is reading it to me now . The illustrations are fun and get kids interested in the story . There are also just a few words on each page so it makes it a great choice for beginning readers . I highly recommend !
3 #### Not enough to it , a few pages ; a few words . I read it to my grandson once and that was enough for him .
5 #### Looks brand new ! Great buy ! word word word word word and 9 more words required ... why i do n't know ok thanks
5 #### For those who have read other books on this area , it is a gentle reminder of what is really important in life and why it is . Those who have never delved into the meaning of life will find it eye opening . Either way I found it to be helpful and enlightening . The theme , although not a new one , remains relevant and timely .
5 #### This book is a good story that teaches the fundamentals of how to be successful Spiritually and Career wise ! I 've read of 40 self - help books in the last three years , and this book is by far my favorite . Enjoy . Warmly , JP Richards
5 #### Nothing less than brilliant and inspiring . I especially recommend this book for LAWYERS ( such as myself ) . Some random quotes ... /// Act as if failure is impossible , and your success will be assured . Wipe out every thought of not achieving your objectives , whether they are material or spiritual . Be brave , and set no limits on the workings of your imagination . Never be a prisoner of your past . Become the architect of your future . You will never be the same . /// We are not human beings having a spiritual experience . We are spiritual beings having a human experience . /// The quality of your life will come down to the quality of your contribution . /// The best time to plant a tree was forty years ago . The second best time is today . /// I am an artist at living - my work of art is my life . --- Suzuki /// The average four year old laughs 300 hundred times a day . The average adult - fifteen times . /// If youth only knew , if age only could . /// The universe favors the brave . When you resolve , once and for all , to live your life to its highest level , the strength of your soul will guide you . /// Nourish your spirit . Do the things you fear . ///
5 #### this was the most requested " read it to me " book of my kids . i love the berenstain bears books so we had a lot . now we are giving them to our grandkids to pass it down . this one is perfect for reading out loud ! it is fun to read over and over .
5 #### I bought this book for my son who is now 29 , I searched and found it for his daughter she loves the story and knows the story just as he did when he was her age , she just turned 4 . I recommend this delightful story .
5 #### Every child I read this book to loves it . It is a favorite . Especially fun to read around Halloween . Scary enough for a kid , without being really scary and just fun .
5 #### This was such a favorite of mine that at 32 I still could remember many of the lines . So I bought it this Christmas for my two year old niece , it part just so I could reread it . When I mentioned that I was getting it , both of my parents could remember the book . It is as fabulous as I remember and more so . This is much simpler than most of the Berenstain Bears books -- definitely a beginner book . Because it rhymes , it has a great read outloud quality . The pictures tell half the story and they are wonderful . It is spooky without being scary and very exciting . It does not exactly fit into the Berenstain Bears cannon ( there are several earlier ones , all beginner books , which do n't exactly ) . There are the characters who will be Brother , Sister and Cousin Fred plus the mom , but they are n't necessarily those characters . Which means if ( for some reason ) you did n't like the regular series , that should n't prevent you from checking out this book .
5 #### This is truly a favorite book for our children & now for the grand children . My one grand son borrowed it . I did n't have the heart to take back his favorite book . Thus , I ordered this one so my other grand son would not miss out on the fun story !
5 #### Read this book to all three of our children thirty years ago to help them understand their fears , how to cope with them , and even laugh at them ! Their copy disintegrated from use . Now with grandchildren , I delight in reading it to them to encourage them through their fears .
4 #### This is book is about Indian philosophy applied in a new light . It appeals to a Western audience in a way that is remarkable in its own way . The author teaches us how to stay motivated in a often depressing world . It will help you through very difficult obstacles . The author will give you a certain strength of mind to finish your goals without hesitation . It allows you to practice very effective techniques for acheiving you full potential .
2 #### As many books of this kind , the writer thinks that because he made something and he has some advantage of what he did , everybody has to do the same to have a better life . I think that only a very few people would change everything they have to find the spiritual peace . Albeit what is written in the book could be written with some wisdom I do n't think that anybody will do exactly as the book says .
2 #### Julian works himself to a heart attack , goes to Himalayas , comes back in robes with a " supple skin " , and starts lecturing on how to improve life . I could not relate to the fable . The author 's writing style is too synthetic . I 'd any day recommend The Alchemist .
5 #### An enchanting fable , that teaches life lessons which are priceless . Enormously entertaining as well . Arlene Millman , author of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY .
4 #### I ca n't really remember what this book tought after 6 - 7 months . I remember some of the important stuffs like embracing the precense , having purpose , meditations .... etc . However , it does n't help too much ... You can find these kind of teachings on any self - help books . I would recommend books by famous authors such as Napoleon Hill , Dale Carnegie , Lao Tzu , Clement , Og mandino , Dr. Joseph murphy and David Schwartz .... etc and many more . If you really feel like reading this book , it 's best to borrow it from the library and read it in few days . it 's not long at all .. and story telling format helps readers to read it in less than 7 - 8 hours . I do n't have any favorite books right now but I really liked Lao Tzu 's " Tao Te Ching " translated by Brian walker or Gia - fu Feng . Good luck with further readings .
4 #### This is a great book if you are feeling " stuck " in life , and want some pointers on how fulfill your dreams . Its advice is very basic , but told in the form of a story which makes the points brought out easy to remember . Also helping to make the points easier to remember are great one - liners like " The purpose of life is to have a lifes purpose " or " We are spiritual people having an earthly experience " . The simplicity with which the story is told , will help keep the lessons fresh in your mind . I listened to the audiocassette . I took off one star from my rating , because I did not think the production was perfect . I noticed some background noise here and there . Maybe this was taped during a live talk , I do n't know . The noise was noticeable but not distracting . Also , I did not feel the reading was very professionaly done . However , it is still a worthwhile tape to listen to and learn from .
5 #### I recently purchased this book for my 2 1/2 year old grandchild . He loved it just as much as his dad and uncle had over 30 years ago . In the past I have also purchased it has a gift for my niece . It was a hit . This book has just the right amount of " spooky " for a young child , with a reassuring ending .
5 #### My children are now 32 and 24 years old . This was the favourite book of both of them , and they had it memorized by about age 3 . Even today , if I said to either of them " Do they dare go over Great Sleeping Bear ? " , they would answer " Yes , they dare ! " .... and laugh . Just buying it again for a young friend who is expecting her first child .
5 #### I could not have been any older then four when this book was first read to me . I remember it made an impression on me I did find the tree to be Spooky and indeed woke up screaming for more then a month . It was n't of course until I was in High School that I finally understood it . The book is about the power of imagination more specifically the power that imagination has to make a mundane object i.e the Spooking Old Tree a source of fear . Those are the children 's books that stick with you even more then two decades later .
5 #### A great Berenstain Bears easy read . My little three year old was reciting it in no time and she loves the fun illustrations . When we get to the part where it says , " One with the shivers ! " we wiggle around and pretend to shiver . Both my kids ( 3 and 1 ) love this book . I like it because it 's fun for Halloween , but not overly scary for these little toddlers .
5 #### My mother saved all my childhood books , and I 'm so grateful that she did . I 'm sure that I would have forgotten books such as this one , despite requesting to have it read to me hundreds of times as a child . Sure enough , now my 3 year old son adores it as much as I did , and requests to have it read to him again and again . It is a nice length ( not too long ) , not too many words on the pages , and the illustrations are great .
5 #### I have four children and our book got so worn out , so I bought a new one . The pictures are exciting and there are n't a lot of words . My kids usually have it memorized when they are two years old . It has great repetition , but varies enough to keep attention . It is a must have for kids !
5 #### I first bought this book almost 30 years ago for my 6 year old son . Now that I have a grandson , Alex , who is five , I remembered how much my son and I enjoyed reading this book together , so I got it for Alex . He loves it ! The book 's vocabulary is perfect for a beginning reader and the adventures of the Berenstain Bears are thrilling and entertaining . Alex loved the detailed pictures inside the old tree : the alligators , the hall full of " knights " in armor , and the wild ride down the escape hatch at the end . Great fun , especially around Halloween time !
5 #### This is a simple story that is great for read - aloud to toddlers and pre - schoolers . Kids are drawn into the adventure and danger as the three bears go exploring where they 're not supposed to . The illustrations are excellent . The simple language also makes this a good book for a beginning reader .
5 #### " The Berenstain Bears and the Spooky Old Tree " written and illustrated by Stan and Jan Berenstain ( Random House , 1978 ) , an exciting story of three young bears who decied to explore a scary tree with a stick , a light and a rope . During their adventure they come across a giant key , narrowly escape a falling ax and run across a great sleeping bear . This easy reader has illustratiions that a child can relate to and a sing song rhyme that is not too silly and is catchy to the young ear . This story is an enjoyable read that will grab and hold the reader 's attention from the very beginning ; because the bears , though a little old fashioned , are life like and experience life like situations that children would love to disappear in and experience with them .
5 #### My three year old daughter loves this book , and we love reading it to her ! It is such an exciting adventure !
4 #### This is one of the earlier Berenstain Bear books , and it shows . The bears are less stylized and cutesy than the bears in the newer books , and the story is halfway between an early reader and the newer , longer read - alouds they do now . It 's a cute little story about three cubs going out with a light , a stick , and a rope to explore . Of course , they lose all three items and run screaming home to mom - and with good reason , that spooky old tree is * really * spooky . There are only a few words per page , with a basic vocabulary , so it 's great for early readers .
5 #### We 've always read this book with our kids- the whole extended family does . It is a wonderful book . And because of the repetition in it , kids can read it themselves from young age . The illustrations are fantastic , and just scary enough .
5 #### I had this book when I was little but over the years it " disappeared " . When I saw it available on Amazon , I had to get it ! I 'm creating a collection of books I read as a child so I can pass them on to my children . I 've always enjoyed books by the Berenstains ! Their illustrations are very vivid and charming . The storylines in the books are very easy for a child to follow . You should also check out Richard Scarry 's children 's books .
5 #### This is a wonderful book which has all the elements children love ... suspense , spooky things , independence and at the end , delivery to safety . How my students love to read or be read this book ! I use this with children who have speech and language delays . It subliminally , in the form of delightful spookiness , teaches prediction , simple sentence forms , and vocabulary . We make comparisons between monsters and the spooky old tree , which looks a lot like a monster , with beady " eyes " , hands to grab little children and an opening that looks like a mouth . When my own children were little , they delighted in this book and played a game where they tried to climb over their own Great Sleeping Bear ( Daddy ) , who would roar and chase them . Shrieks of laughter ! !
4 #### I bought this for Halloween for my son . Well , it is now mid - November and his other Halloween books have been put away , but my son still loves this . This is the first book he can " read " . ( Actually he has memorized the text , which is quite simple . ) So it is a big milestone for him . The story is about three bears who explore a scary - looking tree . They encounter obstacles and escape to their mom at home in the end . My son LOVES looking at the scary pictures . It is like he is trying to frighten himself , yet knows that everything turns out all right . He is constantly asking over and over " What is that ? " pointing at the spiders and bats and various other parts of the pictures . ( He knows that they are spiders and bats -- he just enjoys asking me ! ;-) I am only giving this four stars , rather than five , because the binding in our hard - bound copy is coming loose and unglued . It is only two months old and we take care of it . So I do n't think the publishers put it together very well .
4 #### Great book for young readers . Easy to read and understand .
5 #### Excellent children 's book ! One of my all - time favorites when growing up . I STILL have the copy and I am old enough to wipe my own hiney and drive it around . ;) Anyhow , Jan and Stan Berenstain did a marvelous job writing this book . The pictures are what you would expect from these creative writers . Basically , 3 bears go out on an adventure carrying 3 items to which they eventually use and lose on their journey through the dark , spoooooky old tree . Will they dare go into that spooooky old tree ? Yes ! They dare ! And read it to find out what happens ! What will they find ? What will they lose ? Will they survive ? Fate shall choose ! ;)
1 #### If you 're tired of books about the cool , hip or romantic multimedia / computer industry this one will serve as the straw that breaks the camels back . Typical in the pretentia of anything trying to make GenX crap seem smart . I 'd suggest avoiding anything in this genre , its all bull .
5 #### Very heavy stuff , but if you want to see optimism at its best this is a must see work . Not for the faint hearted , however , as its thesis is at a spiritual plane -albeit founded in scientific studies in this world . ( Theilard de Chardin was an eminent palaeontologist as well as a Jesuit priest- but he most certainly was not merely pushing Vatican traditionalism ) . ,
5 #### If you are unfamiliar with Teilhard de Chardin 's work , as I was , then you will be in for a treat . A French Jesuit priest and anthropologist , Father Teilhard spent the bulk of his life attempting to reconcile his faith with the burgeoning science of the 20th Century - a science he believed in and practiced . The Future of Man is a series of Fr . Teilhard 's essays from the 20 's through the late 40 's of the 20th Century . Looking at the implications of population growth , atomic energy , scientific discovery and his own Christian faith , Fr . Teilhard espoused that humanity was on a continuous evolutionary process to reintegration with the Christ - or the Omega Point . The ultimate fulfillment of this reintegration is the Parouisa of Revelation , and the unification of the spirit of all living things in the Noosphere . The incarnation of Jesus showed the way to unification and reintegration of the perfected spirit of humanity . Writing as he did during a period of rapid change in the world , Fr . Teilhard predicted things like global communications , ecumenism and common welfare before their time as the natural evolutionary process from atoms to complex creatures to eventual divine perfection . His writing is a tough read , and certainly is n't for everyone . I found myself reading and rereading segments to just try and get the message . The message itself , however , is a profound one and one of hope . A good read if you have the patience for it .
5 #### That exactly this kind the book people need to read for 21 century . This book put us in another level very close to God and the future . That really a phenomenon book . I hoping people will given this book an high value in they life . This book it 's not for man only , but for woman also . I sincerely recommend this book .
4 #### The Future of Man is an inspiring , dynamic forward thinking collection of essays given at different times to different groups of scientist or other types of groups . This was a mind expanding experience .
5 #### Although this book is good , it was not as brilliant ( for me ) as his other book , the Phenomenon of Man . That book should be read by pretty much everyone . This man may have been a Jesuit priest , but he was a scientist above all . His way of exploring and discovering to my mind makes him one of the finest human beings who ever lived . I urge you to read his books , which were all published posthumously by the way as the Church forbid him from publishing them . He left them in the care of a friend with instructions to have them published after his death . This man essentially predicted the Internet in the 1940 - 50s . And a lot more besides . His ability to do this was not random either , it stemmed from his understanding of what humanity was and is . It really is a pivotal work .
5 #### My favorite novel . Superficially like JPOD , but much warmer .
2 #### I wanted to like Microserfs , but frankly , there 's a lot of nothing in here . The plot leaves Microsoft pretty quickly and I kept waiting for something , anything to happen . In the end it felt like a pile of spaghetti code that ultimately leads to nowhere .
4 #### This book 's major strength , in my opinion , is its prophetic view of what " The Net " will become , from the predecessor to Twitter ( at Apple ) to word clouds . It is told from the viewpoint of a programmer ( it 's basically his diary ) so that gave the author a little leeway in terms of style and vocabulary , which I sort of viewed as a cop out at first . The character is very likeable though , so the problems I had with the style actually became endearing as I flipped the pages . The ending is sort of anti - climactic , but I do respect the lack of blatant drama which is prevalent in generic fiction . Also I really love the references to " Bill . " All in all , a fun read with some incredibly interesting insights into what the internet has become .
2 #### Started good , with some insightful and interesting observations but later it lost all substance , the action almost disappeared and it felt like going through an archive containing someone 's shopping lists . I had to use a lot of will power to reach the end and it was not worth it because the stories are too contrived , the characters are only briefly outlined and there 's nothing to fuel curiosity .
5 #### Excellent book for any Gen X'er who ever had the pleasure of being a coder and wondering if there was a life outside your cubical . It all rings so true .
5 #### Copelands Microserfs is a fun novel that explores both the quirkiness of techies , makes a mocking of the microsoft culture , and explores a young man 's love .
5 #### This book became part of my top preferred books list ! It was amusing and interesting at same time . A wonderful insight in nerds and startups world .
5 #### Coupland 's novel will appeal to the 21st Century geeks as much as it was written about the geeks of the ' 90s . Anyone who is educated in science and engineering and has had his or her hard - won talents twisted by corporations into slavish poorly compensated labor and the bottom line of company profit will immediately recognize the plight of Coupland 's characters . However , Coupland 's obvious love of LEGO and belief in the ingenuity and creativity of young geeks give hope for family relationships and the power of friendship in an otherwise digitally meaningless world .
4 #### Great writing , but the story goes nowhere . There is no ending . The book starts great ( questions why we work , lots of insight into the social aspects of people in the software industry ) but towards the end it just starts seeming like a pointless read , and focuses more on some love stories . I recommend it , or at least the first third of it .
5 #### This was the first audiobook I bought and it 's still my favorite . I had read the book and was intrigued when I saw that Matthew Perry was reading the audio version . I bought it and listened to the cassette tapes on my drive up to Whistler and finished it on the drive down . Loved it ! It is witty , charming and made me and everyone else in the car laugh out loud . I wish they would release a CD version . Until then , I am hanging on to my original cassette tapes !
2 #### In the second half of the book , the characters relocate to Silicon Valley . They make many comments about it . Sadly , I was unable to listen to this because Matthew Perry consistently says " Silicone Valley " instead , which is something else entirely . As a consequence , I abandoned the book .
5 #### In Microserfs , Douglas Coupland presents an eerily accurate snapshot of modern software development culture . A culture where quirkiness , nerf gun attacks , release parties , access to unlimited amounts of sugar laden beverages , all nighters , hard work , and spontaneous fun are all the norm . This is a great book for those seeking an entertaining read , or those who are interested in what the life of a developer entails . As a software developer myself , this book is a great reminder that developing software is really about the people , team work , fun , and not usually the technology .
4 #### A great way to spend an afternoon . As a past resident of Silicon Valley is brought back fond memories . Read and Enjoy
4 #### I first read this novel in 1996 just after it was published . Twelve years later and in a new century , it is disturbing to read how much of this is still relatively realistic . It is almost as though the organisational arrangements and lifestyles described have been adopted both as a management and lifestyle model and transplanted , at least in part , around the world . This book was funny in 1996 when it seemed in part a satirical comment on the new world of geeks and technology . Now it seems more ironic . Many of those for whom this was an accurate depiction of life in the 1990s are still caught in this time warp . The tragedy is that so many others have joined them . If you have not already read this novel and wondered about the design of a working world in which human interaction through technology has largely replaced direct human interaction : the time is right . After all , in reading this review you are relying on the technology developed by geeks and nerds . Jennifer Cameron - Smith
4 #### If Microserfs were a Jeopardy contestant , its dream board would be : * Nerd vs. Geek * Literary Encryption Techniques * Esoteric Double Entendres * Silicon Valley : Then & Now * Material and/or Mental * The Body Sucks ? NOTE TO SELF : Do not read this book again as long as I 'm still working in software .
3 #### I thought that the first half of this book was brilliant - it was funny , insightful and fast paced . However , the second half was much less fun as the focus moved away from the work the characters obsess over and focused on the relationships they do n't put enough time into . Overall , I enjoyed the book but wished that the last 100 pages had been compressed into about 50 .
3 #### Starts off entertainingly . But got old fast . It was a struggle to keep on going after finishing the first half .
4 #### Douglas Coupland writes an interesting book . He has a knack for insights on our modern culture and what it says about us as people . He also has a knack for the perfect turn of phrase and is very quotable . This book is about a bunch of programmers who work at Microsoft and is written in the form of a journal by one of them , Dan . I have also read Generation X and Life after God by Douglas Coupland and feel that in many ways this book is quite similar in structure and concept , particularly to Generation X. In many ways this is a longer , more rounded , less raw version of Generation X. Although character development is not his forte , Coupland is the master of counterpoint , and in each of his books I have gotten goosebumps on reading the ending . If you lived through the period and have an interest in the tech boom through the 90s , you 'll probably like this . Otherwise , consider Generation X.
4 #### The trend for books that are either about or geared toward ' geeks ' , but not in the fantasy genre , is one that I would like to see emerge . As a software developer myself , but one that likes to get philosophical , this book was a welcome addition to the normal ' social commentary'-type of novels that I read . Coupland introduces a group of developers who work for the largest software company in the world , and decide to relinquish their benefits and stock options in order to work for a start - up whose philosophies they actually believe in . He conveys the satisfaction experienced for working for the startup versus the drudgery and monotony and eventual breakdown of working in corporate America . Its not often that we read about someone whose passion for technology matches their passion for life , but that is what exists in Microserfs .
4 #### This book is required reading at the office , so it 's been high on my list for a while . I wish I 'd gotten to it sooner , as it 's one of the funnier books I 've read in recent times . Although written in 1995 , it ironically reads like a blog due to the diary - like chapter structure in which the main character pours out his thoughts in a stunted , almost anecdotal fashion . The characters found throughout are truly hilarious , probably because they hearken so close to the environment we face in the technology industry . Recommended reading , particularly if you regularly interact with an IT staff .
5 #### Coupland is one of the greatest literary voices of Generation X , and I do n't know if the boomers or their offspring will be able to appreciate the impact of coming of age in the spiritual wasteland of the ~80s . I have enjoyed all of Couplands works that I have read , and this is one of my favorites . It is certainly the most entertaining on a surface level . As a professor in the information systems field , I have often considered requiring this book for students to prepare them for the realities of the business !
5 #### I read this book as a college class requirement in the early 1980s and was significantly influenced by it at the time , so when an old friend and I were discussing religion and evolution , I ordered this book to be delivered to him . He has found a great interest in it as well . I highly recommend this reading as part of one 's personal religious growth .
4 #### This book is not going to be for everyone . I know that seems like a no brainer with someone like de Chardin , but this is a well written and dense book . I highly enjoyed his well thought out focused argument about where we are heading using evolution and creation together . It tied science and faith up in a nice little bow , rather than pitting one against the other . Some may have difficulty with the language , since it is " man " type language , but recognize that it was written before a time when one would write " humankind . " I write that because I posted some quotes on my social media sites and some criticized that I used " mankind " rather than being inclusive . I understand the need , but do n't let the language be a stumbling block for a well thought out analysis of where we are heading . One should also recognize that some of the science is a bit dated with some being out of date . Some of the evolutionary studies have changed since the writing of the book , so it has a few strikes against the conclusions .
5 #### Brilliant thinker who was ahead of his times and we are now catching up !
5 #### An incredible serie of essays , that touch on the Technological Singularity . Very much ahead of its time . Fascinating , especially the Noosphere description of the interaction between humans and IT .
5 #### A fantastic and inspirational story . Coupland 's book is formatted more or less like a journal . The character development was great and I was immediately drawn into each charaters life , relationships and even quirky habbits . For those of you skeptical of this book , pick it up , give it a chance and you will be brought into the hightech world of the 90 's tech company boom days and the perspective of those who lived it . The book cast the feeling of the life of an entrepreneur , fast - pace low - budget and striving to make it in this world .
4 #### Coupland does a wonderful job of illuminating world of the oft - derided Geek . The style and presentation is so close to depicting some of the coders I know in real life . This book is an adventure of some poor ' Microsofties ' who realise that outside of work for Bill , they have no life ..... and set out to create one of their own . Coupland shows that Geeks are people too , with hopes , dreams and aspirations . If you 're patient enought to get to know most of these people you 'll find them to be surprisingly interesting . This book does a great job of encapsulating their world ...... and rekindled my love of LEGO !
5 #### Consists of a journal by of a fictitious employee at Microsoft who moved on to greener pastures in Silicon Valley when the boom was at its highest . At the latter part of the book the reader finds himself / herself sharing their worries and aspirations . 5 stars for making me feel that I am not alone in having these reflections .
5 #### On the surface this book is about a buncg of " geeks " and the early - mid 90s computer culture . Bellow the surface is a stroy about true friendship . The book is funny , laugh out loud funny , but also very gentle , and touching . The relatinships between the charecters are very true and strong . As a member of generation X I appreciate Coupland 's portryal of what us 20 and 30 something are about , frindship and our interdependence on one another . The money and sucess of the company in the story start to fade , and it the commitment to each other that is left in the end . And , its funny as hell .
5 #### I have to say that I first came across this while browsing my college 's class - required books [ I attend Georgia Tech ] . The title caught my eye and reading the back , I thought it was a cute idea , so I bought it . I never expected what I got : A witty , silly , sometimes depressed but always hopeful , heartwarming story . Centered around a group of friends who decide to leave the security of Microsoft to follow another friend to Silicon Valley , the book follows them not only as they progress to their new home , but to their new lives . It 's the story of computer nerds who decide , quite out of the blue [ as nerds tend to do ] that they want to try something new and end up reinventing themselves in the process . As a female computer nerd , I found this book charming and eerily on - the - nose . It 's a must for anyone at a Technical college or who 's really a geek at heart . The writing style is amazing and the characters are people you probably know in your life .
4 #### I tried to read this novel while living in NY and having to deal with tough economy and job market for computer science positions at the time . Long story short , I did n't like Microserfs back then , the plot seemed underdeveloped the characters shallow and the writing too perky . It was not until I have moved to Seattle , the home of The Beast where I have started to like Microserfs . It is important to be able to identify with the characters in this novel and therefore I recommend it for most computer professionals , especially those who had the chance to participate in the dotcom era . It is an enjoyable read , suitable even for those with shortest attention spans as it is written in a form of a diary with entries ranging from 1 sentence to about 10 pages at most . It 's a light - hearted novel and yet it addresses some important points everyone should pay attention to while growing up , mainly existential angst , love , and the " right " priorities . It is a fun book to read . It 's no Shakespeare , but it 'll do .
5 #### I ca n't understand why some reviewers did n't like this book . I thought it was very clever , a great homage to young adulthood and the late twenties of our lives that are filled with endless questions about life , death and individuality . The characters were these witty , hyper intelligent geeks , who spent the duration of the book searching for self definition within the constructs of machinery and artificial intelligence and oftentimes , coming up with great revelations about the human species and world around them . Throughout the book , the characters question the possibility of man 's melding with machine . In the end , a very human , emotional quality emerges through endless hours of coding . Overall , I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates the dynamic evolution of the computer industry . This is a very fun book .
5 #### This is a veritable time capsule for those people who lived in software development environments in the 1990s . There are points in this book , after rereading it in 2003 , that just make me think " Yeah , I remember that sort of stuff " . I was n't a Microsoft employee , but ... things happened then that affected everyone in the industry . In one of the chapters , Coupland even refers to Microsoft as an ' office supply company ' . This book is about being a techie in the 90s , and having dreams and aspirations of being more . It 's about layoffs at IBM , it 's about life as a developer / debugger ... It 's a lot like ' Pirates of Silicon Valley ' , only personalized to a real human being who lived in that era - a person who lived , who loved , who had a family , and who dealt with life as a techie . The 90s were good years to be in the software industry . I give the book 5 stars based on my perspective . Your mileage may vary , but it 's a classic on my shelf that makes me remember how things were .
3 #### I was given this book because I am a programmer . Unfortunately , that is keeping me from totally enjoying it . Coupland gets many of the details of programmers lives correct , the crucial exception being when he actually attempts to write about programming . The fictional product the characters are working on simply could not exist , especially during the era in which the story is set . A small detail maybe , but enough of an annoyance to ruin the suspension of disbelief necessary for stories to work . As a result , if you 're thinking of buying this book for a programmer , I suggest you look at some O'Reilly titles instead .
5 #### " Microserfs " is a great novel as well as an invaluable snapshot of the Silicon Valley tech culture of the early 1990s . Most of the people who weighed in on this book are computer techies themselves but I 'd like to recommend this book to the casual reader . Douglas Coupland 's characters ( based , it seems , on actual people ) are fully human " geeks . " I do not share in others ' complaints about the plotting of the novel . " Microserfs " is wickedly funny social satire and its tongue - in - cheek view of Microsoft 's corporate culture is unparalleled . A warning . If you buy this book , do n't be surprised to suddenly find yourself reading a great novel instead of the cleverly - formatted ramblings of a computer programmer . It sneaks up on you !
4 #### This is a good book . Perhaps it is not as strong as Gen X or Shampoo Planet -- or those Harolding moments in Portraits -- but still a quite decent read . Although at times , the plot is a bit slow . Coupland accurately portrays characters whose cyber - world consists of computer games , coding , and geeky emails . This is a must for those of us who deeply empathize with thematic elements in films such as Office Space or Trees Lounge . I actually was acquainted with a real housemates couple in Berkeley who could be characters in this novel , who in their " free time " romantically played computer games with each other and otherwise spent vast amounts of time behind a computer screen . I remember the world before Atari and the internet . I recall anxious nuclear holocaust days prior to when " cyberspace " was a regular constituent in our mental vocabulary . Perhaps technology does in fact ennoble our human values and aspirations , or perhaps it is a means of convenient evasion from self - knowledge . Coupland explores some of these concerns in this novel with real - life characters who could mirror those folks in tech cultures ( Irvine , Silicon Valley , Seattle , and/or Portland)--a culture that is both oddly familiar yet cubicled in silence -- nameless shadows who input code and ship products for our servile consumption .
4 #### I first read Coupland 's Generation X in the late 90 's . After moving to the PAcific Northwest and working for a handful of dot.coms before and after the bust , I picked up this book in hopes of finding other stories of tech geeks with no life so I did n't feel so abnormal . Whity , funny , yet emotionally honest and soul piercing at times , this book reveals the true nature of IT workers during the climb of the IT field . Written in 94 ( i think ) , many of the lifestyles that Coupland wrote about then still hold true today . It showed me just how much of an IT slave I really am , but that freedom must first come from within , and that I am still a human being even though I work 60 - 70 hour work weeks . Is there a life outside of IT ? I think so ! This book shows me the way and allows me to laugh at myself and the stupididty of my way of life . Thanks Doug ... thanks for showing me there is more to life than computers . kevin
5 #### Do machines feel ? In creating them , what are we doing to ourselves ? If and when an artificially intelligent being comes into existence , what will it be like ? And if processed cheese is 80 % milk , what 's the other 20 % ? Coupland 's novel deals , in a speedy but probing style , with an array of fascinating questions like these . The major characters are incredibly smart and rather zany computer programmers , so they offer interesting thoughts on these questions . Though they never conclusively settle these questions-- except the one about cheese [ " non - milk additives , of course"]-- their hypotheses alone make the book worth reading . Additionally , they strive to make lives for themselves beyond the sea - foam green walls of Microsoft . These attempts are especially pertinent to Coupland 's Gen X readership as it begins to settle down . Of Coupland 's works , this one easily rates among his best . If Generation X had n't been so groundbreaking and scored such a major cultural impact , I would probably argue that Microserfs is Coupland 's best . However , Microserfs is probably destined to be Coupland 's most brilliant little - known work . A must - read for : Gen Xers who think they need to get a life , people in the high - tech industries of any age , Coupland fans , parents of computer programmers .
4 #### For all the secret admirers of Bill this is a must read book . The story of a Microsoft programmer on the Microsoft campus is great stuff and really funny too . It tells about the culture within the company at the beginning of the nineties . Those were the days a lot of the older employees vested their stocks and became miljonair over night . Unfortunately the main character in Microserfs is not one of those . But he does n't really care , I guess he just likes his work . This changes when he gets a girlfriend . Then he likes his work and also something else . What binds the characters on the campus is not their work but the unconditional worship of their hero Bill . All in all Microserfs is a true product of the nineties and computer people really should try it .
5 #### If I were going to write a book , it would come out sounding like this . This book bursts with the life of its characters and their thoughts , feelings , and actions . It is aimed very specifically at white middle - class people who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s and are computer literate , which means that if you do n't fall into that category , you might not enjoy it as much . Still , anyone can enjoy the casual , lifelike style of the narrator , who purportedly wrote this book down in his PowerBook as a way to help him sleep . It wo n't put you to sleep because it 's too funny and compelling .
4 #### Microserfs is about geek culture , but more than that , it 's about love , love that changes people 's lives ( or even * gives * them lives ) . It follows a group of programmers as they leave Microsoft and start their own company , commenting on their love lives , their relationships with their families ( real and assumed ) , and , of course , the thousands of pop culture references they spout off daily . I initially thought I was going to give the book a much lower rating than I did , as the " big change " that I thought the book was about occurs fairly early , and it 's hard to see any huge themes for much of the book . However , the last chapter is heartbreakingly beautiful , and it even made me cry . Microserfs is a lovely book , and of interest to anyone who believes love can change the world , or , of course , geeks .
4 #### While hiding under the guise of being about geek life in the 90s , Microserfs is at its heart a book about friendships . There are lots of geeky , computer tecky passages some which seem quite outdated only a few years after its publication , but the actual story is not about life at Microsoft at all . Instead it tells the story of Dan , a computer programmer who in the beginning of the novel has no life outside that of Microsoft . Through Dan 's journal entries we see his life unfold into one rich with friends and family . Aside from all the kitchy pop culture references and nerd speak this is a very touching and sweet book .
2 #### This book 's amusing , especially at first . After about fifty pages , I found the sophomoric metaphysics and self - important view of programming to be more than a bit self - indulgent . It 's totally Gen - X centered , but I guess that figures , given that Coupland introduced the term in another book . Written as a diary , it follows a programmer for Microsoft who uproots with his group house gang and moves to the Bay Area . You 'll get a lot of musing about cars favored in Seattle vs. the Bay Area as well as the Gap . Costco is prominent , as are legos , the Mac , etc . The book should be loads of fun . Even lots of Star Trek references . But it just does n't ring true , either technically or in terms of the VC - driven world of startups . If you want a good book of fiction on programmers , check out Neal Stephenson 's Cryptonomicon . If you want pop references , read anything by Stephen King . If you want silicon valley hype and stories about venture capitalists , read Michael Lewis 's non - fiction New New Thing . If you want to read about marketing high tech , read Gordon Moore 's non - fiction Crossing the Chasm . Spoiler Warning : This book has the worst ending of any book I 've read in recent memory .
4 #### My standard method of gauging a new read is to open the book at random in the middle , read a page or two , and if I feel like going on from this spot or going back a few pages , then the book is promising enough to consider buying it . I bought Microserfs , and I did n't regret it . Obviously I am not after " messages " ( who gives a hoot on opinions ? Everybody has opinions , like a dog has fleas . ) And of course I do n't share this obsession with " plot " plot is a crutch for authors with inferior talent . Besides , in a novel , a good plot is the outcome of a good character development . ( For very short stories , this rule may not apply . ) I read Microserfs from cover to cover in one sitting , which does n't happen too often these days . Everything in the book is likable except for the soapy and over sentimental ending . Perhaps this was meant to be satirical , but that 's not how it hit me . The author does n't give the impression of making fun of his characters . But it is fun to read . The sequence on menstrual bleeding has an almost Rabelaisian quality . Pity that there was n't more of this . But then this is exactly the point : these people have no life . An author has to have real talent to create a captivating read from such material .
5 #### He has tapped into a niche of society--- the computer slave . This is a must read for anyone who has felt that they are in a job that does n't quite do it for them , Or FOR ANYONE IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY . It 's a very funny , sarcastic and clever ( as usual for Coupland ) read . I enjoyed every word . Be sure to read his others as well ! They are all terrific . If you like Vonnegut , sarcasm , wit , and a view of mundane life from alternate angles ... Coupland 's writing is right up your alley .
4 #### This is a book for people who like fiction , randomly talk about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs , work for a high - tech start - up , and ever been to Silicon Valley . This is an amazing book -- the best I 've ever read from Coupland and one of my favorite all - time fiction books . The dialog is really amazing . This would make a great movie too .
4 #### I was expecting " Microserfs " to be the witty send - up of Microsoft culture and start - up angst that it is . What caught me off guard was the surprisingly tender moments of love , life and death that Coupland manages to squeeze in amongst the humorous descriptions and dead - on depictions of life in Redmond and the Silicon Valley . It 's not perfect : The plot takes a little while to get going , and there are some gimicky moments ( 2 whole pages of binary code , pages without vowels ) . The story sometimes seems to barely scratch the surface of the characters ' lives and emotions , glossing over the missing depth with relentless pop culture references and relying on Big Moments - birth , cancer , coming out - to let us know we should be feeling for the characters . But those very flaws are a part of the book 's post - MTV - generation style , full of quick cuts , potent images and Pop - Up Video factoids . Once you get past all that , " Microserfs " rewards you with a creative , insightful look at geek life and a fondly - crafted time capsule of the early 90s . If you 're under 35 and/or work in high tech , definitely give it a spin .
4 #### What 's so remarkable about this book is that in 93/94 , Coupland managed to write , with such accuracy and detail , about a subculture which the mainstream caught onto only about a year and a half ago . Coupland manages to capture the culture and mood of techgeeks so painfully accurately , that I ended up disliking the characters in the exact way and for the exact reasons I dislike most of linux - shirt wearing , annoying , all - i - know - are - computers , techgeeks I know " in real life " . While I disliked the characters , it was dislike stemming from the fact that they were so well done . And just like the characters , the rest of the story is extremely well written . Completely unpretentious , extremely readable , Coupland writes like a friend relaying an anecdote to you , rather than an author trying to show off his new thesaurus .
4 #### I was still a relative newcomer in the field of software development , when I bought this book . I had always wanted to learn more about the experience of other programmers , and the author did wonderful job of sharing their stories with us . The book really dives in the human side of being a part of a company on the edge of technology . It 's really about the * lifestyle * of being a programmer in the nineties , by letting us peer through the eyes of his characters in their day - to - day lives .
5 #### The previous reviews have pretty much said it all , so this review is going to be a little more subjective . At first I thought this book was going to to be a sour - mouthed put - down of Microsoft . Wrong ! Coupland has his main character keep a diary of what is going on with a small group that has left Microsoft to start their own small software company . The heart of the diary , though , is the little details Coupland includes that : say so much about relationships ( between both friends and lovers ) , make the reader feel as if he or she personally knows each character down to the ground , and provide rich , interesting , entertaining descriptions of plot and character development . Coupland uses the diary technique extraordinarily well , focusing on mood , relationships , how Silicon Valley works , and a range of interesting observations as he sees fit . The diary technique also allows Coupland to manipulate time . If he wants to skip ahead in time , he simply dates the next diary entry months ahead . This book is an extraordinary read in that Coupland packs a lot of complexity into a highly entertaining , sometimes laugh - out - loud book that is also most readable . Buy it , and marvel and laugh . By the end of the book , you 'll wish the trip had lasted longer .
5 #### After reading Tracy Kidder 's acclaimed ( by the New Yorker crowd ) Soul of a New Machine , I thought to myself " here 's a guy who spent 12 hours / day with engineers for an entire year and learned nothing about engineering , nothing about what matters to engineers , and nothing about the hearts and minds of engineers . After reading Microserfs , I thought " here 's a guy who seems to have spent a week with engineers and effortlessly absorbed everything that is important about engineering culture , everything that matters about working at a big company , and everything that matters about working at a startup . " Coupland 's writing is better crafted here than in his earlier books , e.g. , Generation X.
5 #### A lot of reviewers seem to love or hate this book based on its references to The Bill , Star Trek , politically aware grrlies , and such forth . But unless your experiences on the high school football team have left you with a visceral hatred of all things ' nerdy ' , you should be able to enjoy this book without a Comp Sci degree . Disadvantaged , oppressed , sometimes confused characters set out towards the distant horizon of opportunity , at great risk to their personal and financial security . In the course of their journey they bond , learn about life , and discover strengths and weaknesses in themselves and each other that they never even suspected . Do n't let the lack of covered wagons fool you . This is the Great American Pioneer Story , which every generation needs a version of for its own . Stylistically , this is quirky enough to be engaging , but by no means difficult . All in all , highly recommended
5 #### I 'm currently reading this book for the second time . I just love it . Coupland describes the life of Dan and his fellow nerdy friends , in a way that like being there with them . And the idea with writing the whole book like Dan 's dairy makes this book a masterpiece and one of my all time favvourits .
5 #### is dilbert really what office life is like ? some say that its an exxageration of a cubicle existence , but it is scary how true it may be . the same if true for this book . who knows what valley life is really like , but one ca n't help but feel that this book is a little too close to reality . it is a zippy read , which may interest only those who are geeks at heart .
2 #### " You know what ? This is a * really * nerdy book ! ! If this book was a man , he 'd be wearing a checkered shirt , taped glasses , and unkempt hair . If this book was a woman , she 'd be wearing a messy bun on her head and complaining about sinuses while downing a bottle of orange Triaminic . Oh man ... Lots of computer jargon and " inside " jokes . " Unless you 're a computer whiz who gets his / her hee - haws from laughing at people who do n't know all the cool acronyms and neat - o chat signs :p , pass on this one . IMHO . I wish I had . Could have spent my $ on a nifty pocket protector instead . LOL . ;)
4 #### This was my first Doug Coupland novel and the only reason I chanced upon it was because of an article in Wired Magazine back in 1996 ( I think ) . Back then , Coupland wrote it as a short story ( I think ) and then later expanded on it as a book . Interesting that back then , what he described as ' 386 droneware ' was , in the book itself , to become ' 486 droneware ' . I guess writing needs to be upgraded too ! Anyway , I liked Microserfs a LOT . However , my favourite part is still the first chapter , that first original story . The book , on a whole , is whimsical and funny . Coupland 's mastery of imagery seems to have developed from his earlier novels and here it 's excellent . I do n't consider this to be his best book ( unlike many ) although it 's certainly the most attractively accessible . This is standard Doug Coupland - mid 20s people searching for identity and their place in the world . Here , they just happen to be computer programmers . Ultimately , a fine book , ' classic Coupland ' and a good introduction to his ( our ) world .
5 #### Douglas Coupland ( who coined the cursed term ' Generation X ' ) suffers from pigeonholing . His writing goes so far beyond inside jokes that appeal to techies ( although he 's good at those ) and characters fond of all - night coding runs and Skittles . He writes about people , and Microserfs made me laugh and made me cry . And it was wonderful !
2 #### Douglas Coupland is a very intelligent guy , but his writing seems to focus solely on the hardships and difficulties of the younger generation he has crossed with an X. Microserfs is no different . While it includes many apt insights about our current technologised society , it is a one - sided account which igonores any kind of resolution or positive direction of that society . In other words , the novel is stuck in the - life 's not fair supplication which , inevitably has no reward except to lead to a redundant and circular chase of our own tails . Quite frankly , it wears thin after a while , which is not to say that Coupland will not produce something of better quality in the future , its just saying that his present , while appropriate to his creative development , is a repetitive whine .
5 #### I have read quite a few books by this author lately and I am impressed by the way he tells a story . The plots are intricate and involved , with many unexpected twists and turns , yet at the end everything is explained in a way that leaves you satisfied as a reader . His books usually touch upon a deeper meaning and his characters are both flawed and likeable . I also enjoyed Into the Blue , Borrowed Time and In Pale Batallions .
3 #### Hand in Glove begins with fine writing and deft character development but the book is diminished by its plot structure . The initial tight and effective family plot falls away and the reader is left with a forced , unconvincing historical thriller with fading characters .
4 #### Duplicity and intrigue run rampant through the once quiet life of Charlotte Landram . The murder of her Aunt Beatrix is only the beginning of a series of events that confronts Charlotte and places her in the " eye of a storm " that has been brewing for over 50 years . Mr. Goddard is an expert at integrating history into this clever thriller and has produced an absorbing , plausible story that captures the imagination . He has developed a situation populated by a cast of realistic , well - defined characters so convincing they seem familiar to the reader . Compelling from page 1 , you will find this journey rewarding .
3 #### There 's enough plotting in this book to fill three books and that is its ultimate weakness . It 's a long , sometimes tedious , read but one has to give author Goddard a silver star for being able to weave all the myriad of plotting into a cohesive resolution . The plot is way too labyrinthine to go into detail here , but suffice to say it involves the murder of an elderly spinster , a dead heroic poet , a young niece trying to find out who killed her aunt ; a somewhat sleazy antiques dealer and the brother accused of the murder ; the young girl 's brother and his promiscuous wife ; an American cad ; and the Spanish Civil War . There 's lots of twists and turns , and although I did n't find it one of my favorite reads , it 's a well developed if somewhat lengthy read .
5 #### One of the pleasures of reading Ngaio Marsh ' Alleyn mysteries , is that not only are the mysteries puzzling , but that she has a way of bringing her characters to vivid life . While her skill at writing is largely responsible , so too is the time she takes to develop the characters before the " mystery " takes over . This novel is a good illustration of that . Inspector alleyn does n't enter the picture until halfway through the story . By then , we are as immersed in the personal lives , feelings , and thoughts of the characters , as if we were actually on scene . This is all the more amazing for the economy of words that Ms. Marsh employs . Here there are none of the tediously long descriptive passages that plague many an author who strive to be critically acclaimed . The story takes place in a small village . The cast of characters are largely inter - related and of the " upper class " . Into the mix are introduced the charming young secretary come to help write a book on proper manners , as well as a disreputable troublemaker who you would just love to see convicted of the murder . The mystery moves along at a good pace and the ending wraps up the multiple threads of the story very satisfactorily . A pleasure to read , and one of her better efforts .
5 #### While I loved reading Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie , there was always something a bit unreal about Sherlock Holmes and Hercules Poirot . Neither of them seemed to have any kind of personal life ( except of course , Watson and brother Mycroft for Holmes and Hastings for Poirot ) . No family , friends , love interests ( though people have speculated on the Holmes / Watson connection)or any kind of emotional life . Inspector Alleyn is of a different breed . Yes , he 's a professional , but he also has a personality outside of being " the Handsome Super , " as the newspapers like to call him . As does his faithful sidekick , Inspector Fox , who , though not as clever as Alleyn shows a level of intelligence well above that of Hastings or Watson . In _ Hand in Glove _ Marsh sets a murder against the backdrop of a village primarily occupied by the nobility . Indeed , no one would even dream of murder tainting the house where Messrs. Pyke Period and Henry Cartell live . But when one of them ends up having his skull crushed and multiple motives come to light , it is up to Inspector Alleyn to point the finger at the guilty party . This is probably the most skillfully woven Marsh mystery I have read to date .
4 #### This is a funny Berenstain Bears adventure book , in which the kids go camping and follow their Bear Scout Guidebook while Papa Bear tries to do everything his way and ends up making a big mess . My 3 y.o . likes this story very much , and asks for it frequently . Like with many other Berenstain Bears books , I like that it teaches the importance of reading to learn stuff , but I find the dad 's kluziness a bit annoying as I believe it undermines the respect for parents , cause it 's not that it shows that parents can make mistakes too , but that they 're totally incapable of doing something right . However , it 's a funny story , the adventure has a nice pace to it , and my kid enjoys reading it .
5 #### This was one of my favorite books when I was a child . My copy was getting a little ragged , to say the least , and I had to pick up a new copy for my own child to enjoy . I ca n't recommend this book enough ! It has beautiful illustrations and a fun story for those of us who enjoy the outdoors , scouting , spending time with Dad , or just a good Berenstain Bears book !
4 #### Like other Berenstein books , Dad 's a doofus , while the kids are wise in this camping - out adventure . This is a fun story with nice artwork that I 've ready many times to my kids ( now 3 1/2 and 2 ) . Frankly , I 've gotten kind of tired of it -- the dad - bashing routine gets repetitive after a few dozen readings . But the kids like it , and I think it will be a good one when they start reading on their own , too . There 's even some good camping tips ( " Put up your tents before it 's late " ) .
5 #### Your child will love Papa Bear 's misadventures as he attempts to teach the Bear Scouts the " correct " way to conquer the out - of - doors . Luckily , the Bear Scouts also have their bear scout manual along . The illustrations ( especially of Papa Bear " experiencing " the outdoors ) and rhyming words will pull in your preschool or early school age child , and they will request this book again and again . This is a Berenstain Bear classic !
3 #### This is one of those books that has been languishing on my TBR shelf for far too long , so I thought I 'd take a break from all the newer books and read an oldie . This has taken me an absolute age to read , something that 's never a good sign . Unfortunately , for me it was n't an oldie but goodie and I was really disappointed with it as it seemed to promise much more . The characters are , on the whole , interesting and well formed , the story an interesting and intriguing one and there were a couple of twists . It just seemed far too lengthy . By the time the conclusion was nearing completion , I no longer cared about it and felt I should 've quit a long while back .
4 #### All her books are great . Good plots and entertaining characters . Nice when Agatha Troy is in the story as well .
3 #### Good old fashion detective story . Must like it as its the third time i have read it .
4 #### This novel is really mysterious to start , but once the murder is solved , the novel continues , with twist after twist -- even a new one as the novel ends . That one is one too many . Goddard is always good , but he sometimes gets carried away .
4 #### This is a very thrilling story - kept me in suspense wondering where will it go next . I love Mr. Goddard 's style of writing . Will read more of his stories .
3 #### I pretty much found this book " hard going " . Not a very interesting main subject , at least not to me . And , I do get tired of the temperament of actors . I like books with more Rodrick Allyn and Ins . Fox in it and less of the other characters . To me , it just never " jelled " as a story .
5 #### My favorite BBears book , dating from childhood . My two young boys love it too , and enjoy laughing at the father in his misadventures . As a pastor , I find it an excellent book about the importance of reading and heeding the Bible as well , but this is simply an added bonus to what is a sly , funny and wise children 's book suitable for anyone .
5 #### My son loves this book and makes us read t over and over again :)
5 #### This is just one of a series of old Berenstain Bear books which are sequential in nature and highly predictable . The stories are terrific , the characterizations clear , and they encourage problem solving from the child if the adult asks the right questions . Adult and kids alike will enjoy all of these which , in my opinion , are more compelling than the newer Berenstain Bear books . I am a language therapist and all of my younger students love these - they 're disappointed when the final one is read ! Run , do n't walk to buy them !
5 #### This book is a part of our family experience -- our history . Each of our sons loved it -- and still do !
5 #### Love The bear books I bought this one for a camping curriculum .
2 #### I like Robert Goddard and find his novels whimsical and engaging . So I bought this one with enthusiasm . Plot sounded good and intriging . What a let - down . The main character Charlotte has no back - bone and I really could n't believe how pliable she was , made inane comments about important events and did not challenge some bizarre behaviour from the main characters . I persevered when I really wnated to give up in the hope the writing and plot would improve . Neither did . Do not waste your time on this book , there are many other Goddard books that are far better - well written with complex plots that keep you guessing to the end . This was dreadful .
5 #### Robert Goddard is an author who always keeps you guessing . Where is the story going , what on earth is going to happen next . He also develops a terrific sense of identity for the characters .
5 #### Mr Pyke Period is obsessed with his family history and with social etiquette , on which he is writing a book . Currently he has Henry Cartell living with him and relations are strained on both sides . A lunch party ends acrimoniously after Connie Cartell - Henry 's sister - brings her guests , her adopted niece and her niece 's dubious boyfriend who seem not to know how to behave in polite company . When Henry Cartell ends up dead in a ditch after a party at his ex - wife , Lady Desiree Bantling 's house , suspicions fall on just about everyone in the neighbourhood . Roderick Alleyn is sent to investigate and finds a friend , Nicola , doing Mr Pyke Period 's typing for him . I enjoyed this well plotted mystery with its collection of eccentric and unpleasant characters though there are some pleasant characters too . It was nice to see an appearance by Agatha Troy - Roderick Alley 's artist wife . I thought the complex family relationships were well done and there were plenty of red herrings and genuine clues to keep even the keenest reader guessing . If you enjoy classic crime stories then you ca n't beat Ngaio Marsh .
4 #### This was the second Goddard book I 've read and I enjoyed it much better than his first novel . What I like : all of his books are present day , but centered around a mystery from a recognizable event from the past . In the case of Hand in Glove , a mystery from the Spanish Civil War reaches out from the past to embroil modern day characters in a mystery that threatens their lives . So we end up with a story that in order to save people 's lives , the characters have to try to sort out events from the past with little clues to go off of . The mystery serves up the standard lot of suspects and while the endings are never too much of a surprise , the process of getting there is satisfying for history buffs . As seems to be the case for most Goddard books , Hand in Glove starts off strong and then weakens in the final third of the story .... I'm not sure if that is because he tries to string the story out too long ( his books average 600 pages or so ) or if he just loses interest as the goes , but it seems to be a pattern for his books . The strength of the first portions of the stories , however , make them worthwhile reads . I 'll certainly read more of his novels , but suggest them as a library read .
2 #### Robert Goddard is an author I expect more of . In Hand in Glove an entire family seems to have never taken the time to get to know each other while disdaining to develop friends , interests or relationships other than those predetermined by biology . This in itself would be an interesting tale told by another sort of author -- along the lines of William Trevor . However , when an entire book is based on a premise that the expiring royalties from two very slender volumes of poetry are enough to incite murder and kidnapping in this same clan -- whose daily expenditures seem more in the realm of Rupert Murdoch / Richard Branson -- the plot wheezes improbably along until at long last resorting to a rapid , highly improbable and sensational tabloid - style conclusion . I liked Goddard 's " Found Wanting " very much , written c. 2008 , so perhaps " Hand in Glove " c. 1992 is just an early and less accomplished effort and I simply expected more by reading chronologically out of order .
4 #### Robert Goddard is a master of the quintessential British upper class mystery . His stiff upper lip , high brow characters are flawlessly drawn on his pages . The beauty of their environment , their high class accents , the glamour of it all . And then under the paper thin veneer , we see that they are just depressingly human like the rest of us . " Hand in Glove " is a marvelous excercise in this specific genre . Tight , sharp and without mercy , like life itself . Praise to this great master of his craft .
5 #### Once I read one of Goddard 's mysteries , I knew I had to find all of the rest . Normally with most writers there will be one or two novels by the same writer you do not think is up to par but this is not the case with this writer . He has you on an emotional roller coaster until the very last page . Beatrice Abberley is robbed and murdered . the suspect is believed to be an antiques dealer who had been interested in some antiques she had and it does nt help he has a shady past . He , from prison pleads with his conservative brother to help him as he says he is not guilty . Beatrice , s family naturally believe he is . It turns out that Beatrice had a brother in the spanish civil war who was a poet revered everywhere . He has written letters to her that she is determined will not see the light of day which is very strange and suspicious . Goddard keeps you guessing(until you are about to lose your wits ) why did Beatrice do this . Her neice decides she is the one to figure out the mystery no matter how many do not want it to see the light of day . I come from a day when mysteries were really well written ; 1800's - early 1900 's and I had almost despaired of ever seeing any really fine writing again . I am glad I found Robert Goddard before I left this mortal coil !
5 #### I first became familar with the author 's work after reading a blurb by Steven King on what he was reading . Goddard is not macabre but his characters are sometimes sinister and dark . King also remarked that he devoured the first few and slowed his pace down to enjoy the books . There is one left for me to read and I am saving it for a Holiday gift for myself .
4 #### This is a beautifully written mystery that keeps you guessing till the very end . Lots of motives , lots of opportunity ... One of her better efforts ( I 've now read 25 of the 32 novels ) IMHO -- despite the dated mores & class - importance of the characters . I esp . liked two quotes , one appropriate to the novel & one not : " it had distinction without personality " & " he would dodge about among innumerable parentheses . " Very enjoyable read IMHO .
5 #### I love the original Berenstain Bears books and so do my kids . They are wonderfully illustrated and the rhyme and meter are second to none . I was born and raised on these stories and I bought them for my children when they were born . " Inside , Outside , Upside Down " was the first book by daughter learned to read on her own . She is seven years old now and still loves them . These are timeless classics that you can pass on to your children and grandchildren . Buy them all now !
5 #### kids loved it , wacky and engaging . kids can not wait to spend some summer camp time with their cousins . would purchase again
5 #### It is so awesome to be able to share these wonderfully written , funny books with a third generation . We bought the Berenstain Bear books for our daughters in the 60 's , they read them to their children , & now , we have the opportunity to share them with their grandchildren ( our great grandchildren ! ) One of our daughters sent a note telling us after she had read the 3 books we sent to her 4 yr . old grandson , he kept saying , " Again , again ! " My very favorite one is The Bike Lesson ! I have always loved rhymning books & these are so cute . Worth every penny ! ! !
5 #### Sometimes , short cuts look better from the front than from behind . In this story , Papa Bear is n't one to be slowed down by checking for advice or directions from the Bear Scouts guidebook - Like the tip from page 88 , Put up your tent before it 's late . Instead , Papa Bear thinks he knows what to do - Toodeloo , you can have your slow canoe . It 's a good thing the Bear Scouts have their guidebook and bandages !
5 #### My younger brother had this book when we were growing up in the 1970 's and as a child , I absolutely loved this book ! Now that I was fortunate enough to get a copy for my own two boys , I not only get the opportunity to relive some fond memories of my own childhood , but I get the opportunity to have my children form some of their own . This book outshines most modern children 's books and is proof that literacy of the past was superior to anything we have today .
5 #### What wonderful news to see a classsic book make a reappearance . Who can we thank for such insight ? LADY OF HAY is classic past lives / reincarnation , certainly a step up from current time travel . This is where it all started influencing authors such as Jeanette Baker and Jude Deveraux . LADY OF HAY was a wonderful read when it first came out and is now a classic in its own right , sure to help a whole new generation of readers discover this exceptional author . The concept of writing two storylines in two seperate time periods with each effortlessly interwoven with the other is only possible because of the exceptional writing talent of Ms Erskine . If you are reader who devours all sorts of the paranormal historicals and historical romances this one should be an automatic buy , because this is where is all began . This is not time travel this is reincarnation and no one does it better than Barbara Erskine . Jody Allen , Charter member - RIO Reviewers International Organization
5 #### I have read every book Barbara Erskine has published . I love her style and characters . If you like her books you will also enjoy Elizabeth Harris 's books ( e.g. Herb Gatherers ) . They are the type of books you do n't put down until you have finished ! Keep it for a rainy day that you have all to yourself . Waiting anxiously for more from Barbara Erskine .
2 #### The book is made up of about 10 pages of the history of the screw / screwdriver , 15 pages of the author 's frustrating research ( his frustration , not the reader 's ) , and 120 pages of filler . Much of the filler is interesting but Rybczynski struggled hard , and wandered far , to find enough words to fill this very slim book ( probably only 20,000 words ) . Since less than 10 % is about the subject , the substance is n't quite enough for a solid magazine article . I wanted , and expected , more . I 'm sure Rybczynski 's editor did , too . Given the author 's academic profession , I would think the book was the product of the " Publish or perish " syndrome were it not for his considerable resume of published books . I suspect that Professor Rybczynski , were he to read this review , might acknowledge that he was caught .
5 #### I enjoyed this book very much . I love microhistories . It did n't have to be the length of War and Peace for me to enjoy the content . I work in a big box home center in the hardware section and this was a fun read for me to have a little history on tools and fasteners .
4 #### A good book on an overlooked subject , but incomplete . It goes into the history of the screw , and screwdrivers , but leaves out it 's relatives , the bolts and nuts , taps , and a good deal else . The definitive history of screws and hardware , together with the history of the machinery to make them , has yet to be written . Nevertheless , to give credit where due , anything that helps to make the real movers of progress in the human condition recognized is valuable . Why is Henry Maudslay less well known than Napoleon ? They were contemporaries . Maudslay was arguably a greater influence than Napoleon . Without his work , our machine age would not exist . Napoleon was merely another man willing to take power by shedding the blood of other men . Maudslay made possible the relief from drudgery and helped launch machines that made machinery , making reproducibly accurate parts . Mr. Rybczynski does a valuable service in bringing to life these too unknown geniuses and benefactors of mankind . His is an easy evening 's read , and worth the time .
5 #### A well written quick reading book , One Good Turn is as much a detective story as a history . The author describes his search for the origins of the common screwdriver and the screw itself as well as giving us the evidence . This intellectual journey documents a surprising amount of invention and antiquity for these seemingly simple and everyday inventions . A great ramble .
5 #### I bought this as a gift and have not read it myself . Dad said it explained far more about the history of tools than he 'd expected , and he was enthusiastic about the book .
5 #### If you are an engineer or simply someone who is fascinated by the stories behind the everyday things in life , then you will enjoy this book .
5 #### This is simply a wonderful book , very well researched and entertaining to read . If you know anyone interested in technical things , science , and/or social history get them this book .
5 #### I first discovered this book in 1988 , and the unique plot and impeccable historical research made me an instant fan of Ms Erskine . It 's a story that will stay with the reader long after the final page , and I 've reread it several times . I bought this one for a family member , in hopes she enjoys it as much as I have . She loved the Outlander series , and I told her this is a precursor similar in some plot points and just as exciting if not moreso . Kingdom of Shadows by Ms Erskine is also a keeper . A talented author and highly recommended !
3 #### It 's an interesting premise , but I 'm halfway through and finding the main characters annoying . It 's dated , both in technology and the behavior of the main characters . Ca n't help feeling that this author ' almost ' gets there .
5 #### This was a great read . Once you started you did not want to put it down
5 #### If you are curious and are of a hardware bent , then this book will assuage your curiosity about something without which it would be hard to imagine the modern world . Archimedes figured out the inclined plane . Then came this book .
2 #### It 's a book about the history of the screwdriver . Really it 's an extra long feature article in book form . The author , a guy with a truly unpronounceable name , takes us on an exploratory journey to unearth the most important tool invented in the last thousand years . As he makes his case for the screw and screwdriver , he introduces a lot of great tool history and trivia . My favorite part was his discussion of the button hole , one of those very - useful but not - so - intuitive inventions .
4 #### One might think the history of the development of threaded fasteners -- a.k.a . screws -- might not be a riveting read . But that would be wrong ; the description actually hits the nail on the head . When I first saw this book I knew I had to drill into it and plumb its depths . You can brace yourself for a bit of history , a bit of politics , a bit of art and the author 's long measured thread into the files of his university library . He traces back earlier and earlier depictions of screws and screwdrivers , casting about for circumstantial evidence until he finally hones in on an Ancient Greek origin . Measured against any yardstick this book is illuminating , full of fine details of history and surprising discoveries like a good James Burke " Connections . " The scribe makes all this well - crafted erudition educating and fun , hammering it home with personal anecdotes , a delicately humorous touch and burnished to a fine finish .
4 #### The screw and screwdrivers are items we regard as everyday , ho - hum items , if we even consider them at all . Yet , without the screw and screwdriver we would certainly have a very different world . The screw is responsible for holding our doors up , keeping our planes flying , making computers work and a host of other jobs too numerous to mention . Of course , the screw would be of little use to us without the ordinary screw driver . This book is a fascinating look back at the history of the screw , which traces itself back to Archimedes ' time and the screw driver , which allowed the screw to be used for so much more than the relatively simple jobs once delegated to it . I found it amazing that the screwdriver was n't invented until hundreds of years following the screw . The book is well written , with an eye for detail and will fascinate anyone with a curiosity about the history of " things " .
4 #### Too many people consider history as the story of individuals and groups of individuals . This is unfortunate as some of the best history are those of objects . This book is a good example ; it traces the history of the screwdriver . Told in reverse chronological order , the author starts with modern technical literature , and progressively finds older and older documents that refer to tools used for similar purposes as a screwdriver . At last , in the final chapter , the author arrives at Archimedes as the inventor of a tool similar to today 's screwdrivers . Throughout the book , the author lays bare the technological advance of Western society in terms of hand tools . The book includes numerous drawings of various hand tools throughout the centuries . Overall , a great book .
5 #### This is an impressive little volume . Not only a quick , interesting and highly enjoyable read , it serves as a fine example of scholarship . The student who bemoans having to write a term paper needs to read this book and discover the joy of learning something new ; of uncovering lost knowledge and thereby casting light on an indispensable tool of our modern world . The author begins by answering a question : What is the most important tool of the millenium ? That 's a tall order and requires a good amount of thought by itself , but the answer to that question -- the screw and screwdriver -- provides a wonderful journey through various arcane references . Indeed , Rybczynski finds an error in no less a reference standard than the Oxford English Dictionary . Though the origin of commonplace objects can seem somewhat arcane , the sheer enjoyment of scholarship is evident in his book -- Rybczynski does not take shortcuts and is as fine a craftsman with his words as he is with a builder 's tools . He takes pleasure in his discoveries and the pleasure is shared with and experienced by the reader . I 'm reading more Rybczynski as soon as I can . Highly Recommended .
4 #### This little volume takes about two hours or so to get through and is well worth the time if you 've any interest in mechanical history . It starts with the story of how its author set about deciding what is the " best " tool developed during the millennium just ended . His object was to write an essay on the topic for the New York Times . On his wife 's suggestion he settled on the screwdriver and then scoured museums and libraries for its provenance . The book , however , is not primarily about screwdrivers , but about this research and ultimately about the screw itself , which after all gave rise to the screwdriver , and about some of the machinery such helical devices enable . It is the author 's feeling that the screw represented a leap of inspiration rather than a logical development based on previous devices . It may be that using screws to fasten objects together was a genius move , but in fact shafts with helical threads were earlier used in various machines where considerable pressure needed to be generated , such as oil and wine presses and their offspring .
4 #### If anyone has wondered what a short trip to the past would be like this is a perfect book for you . It leaves you wondering I what if ..
3 #### I 'm an avid history lover and the history kept me interested ... what did n't work for me was the present day storyline ... and why would the main character continue to stay around with the " Abusers " . I wo n't give spoilers , but it was annoying ... I was glad when the weak conclusion resulted ... If not for the history lesson I would have stopped reading it .
5 #### I loved everything about this book ! I had a really hard time putting it down ! I highly recommend reading it .
3 #### Although I really enjoyed the premise of this book , the modern - day story did n't captivate me nearly as much as the 12th century portion . Matilda was strong , resourceful , independent , and brave . And the men in her life were interesting , if not necessarily likeable . Jo , on the other hand , seemed to be a masochist , who surrounded herself with men who mistreated her and betrayed her trust . She continued to rely on them and trust them long after they 'd proven themselves unworthy . The ending , although not unexpected , just did n't ring true , especially in the case of one major character who seemed to go through such an unbelievable transformation throughout the book as to almost be baffling .
5 #### This story , with all its power , emotion and history compels me to read it over and over . Matilda de Braose was a real person in history and her story helped cause the Magna Carta to be forced upon King John at Runnymede . I love English history and this book , though romanticized , is full of it . Reading this book is a great way to spend one 's time . I ca n't recommend it too strongly !
5 #### I love this story of remembering a pat lifetime , it 's got everything !
5 #### One of the best books I have read . Ms. Erskine tends to be a bit " wordy " but her tales are wonderful . This is a terrific story .
5 #### Just read the professional reviews ; this is an absolutely pleasant little book . It is small , and only 145 pages of main text ; the rest is illustrations , notes & sources , and is not an in - depth treatise on any specific person , place or instrument . However , I believe it is well researched and if you seek further information there are plenty of sources to follow up on . The writing is excellent , conversational and engaging , scholarly , clear , direct and not intimidating or off - putting . The author starts out with a conversation on why and how he started looking into the history of the screwdriver . Through the chapters he branches into the screw , the auger , and predecessors through history . The talks quickly about who invented what , what we know from original publications , the scientific or engineering implications of the inventors and their inventions . All very quick , but with lots of sources of you desire further reading .
4 #### A history of the screw and screwdriver has the potential for being really boring ; fortunately , this brief book is not . Instead , it is an interesting look at this commonplace tool . In general working backwards from modern to ancient times , Rybczynski not only explores the origins of the screw and screwdriver , he also describes what he had to go through to discover these origins . It shows how when something is such an everyday item , its very commonality may obscure its history . The main flaw with this book is that he tends to ramble about quite a bit , so instead of moving straight back in time , he often darts in other chronological directions . This can be a bit distracting . Nonetheless , this is overall a good book which shows that in the hands of a decent writer , even minor objects can become important .
3 #### This little book illustrates one way to turn a magazine article into a book : write about the writing as much as about the subject . And so the author tells us how he came to the idea of an article about screws and screwdrivers ; he tells us about the libraries he went to to research it , the books he read , and their authors lives ; he describes the museums he visited and the displays he saw there ; and he describes the stream of consciousness that led him along the way . The result is a non - chronological treatment that can be a bit confusing ; and although structured as a detective story , using hints from obscure books and museums to trace a path steadily farther back into history , the materials in the last chapter -- on the use of screw devices in the ancient world -- are actually the most commonly known and available . But the story is pleasantly told and along the way we do learn what there apparently is to know about the history of the screw and screwdriver .
4 #### Very good story , full of history ..... my kind of book !
4 #### This book was fast paced and thought provoking . The characters carried me through the story but at times I had to put the book down to think about what had happened . Could this really happen ? Could one bounce from one time to another ? How interesting and fun that would be .
3 #### Entertaining but I found it depressing it was well written but I found for me not enough variation it was too much of the same thing
4 #### The story line was fairly implausible and the modern day characters were hard to relate to , but I really enjoyed this novel anyway . I bought the book because Matilda de Braose is one of my ancestors , and I was interested to read about what her life may have been like . I really liked the different take on the historical novel , weaving a modern day suspense novel with historical fiction . The modern day heroine , Jo Clifford , could be quite exasperating , and it was hard to understand why she continued her relationships with the men in her life , who all mistreated her . But the suspense aspect of the modern day story mixed with the unfolding of the historical story really kept me turning the pages . I recommend this for historical fiction fans looking for something a bit different .
5 #### Compelling from start to finish ; difficult to put down
5 #### A gripping story with characters you ll want to visit again . I love this book . I ve been reading it every couple of years since 1997 ( In fact , I read it until the pages fell out of my paperback . I have a Kindle edition now ) . Publishers Weekly says What slows the narrative is the bevy of minor characters , Jo 's acquaintances . They talk to her and about her , they try to help her and they conspire against her , all at the expense of the central plotline . I think the minor characters serve to make this a rich story with more depth than you often find . They form the world around the main characters . I fall in love with Tim every time . I also enjoy the trips Jo and Matilda take with the very different points of view they lend to the descriptions . Overall , this novel has a bit of everything in a well - paced story .
5 #### I did n't have particularly high expectations for this book and have been very disappointed by many Kindle books . However , this book not only got me through a very long transAtlantic plane ride but kept me enthralled until the last page which I read at home . The historical detail was wonderful and seemed accurate . The contemporary characters were interesting although some seemed more realistic than others . The regressions were fascinating and it was a painless way to absorb some history . I have recommended the book to friends and intend to read more by the author . The book was written in the 80 's and it is interesting reading about the " contemporary " characters using typewriters and not having cell phones . Also today , the characters would have instant access to most of the historical information they needed . This does not detract from the book but it took me back ( not the full 800 years )
4 #### It took me a little bit to actually get into the book . I started it at least three times until I forced myself to keep going . Once I started to actually read on a regular basis I was hooked . I would stay up late because I had to know what was going to happen . The relationship between the two main characters was a little unbelievable , but it 's fiction so that did n't stop me . I thought the story was very well put together and the history involved was interesting . If you like historical romance with a little mystery then this book is for you .
5 #### Riviting read , could not put it down . As usual Ms Esrkine outdid herself . Can not wait for her new book to be published .
5 #### I loved the descriptions of the characters and their surroundings ! It felt like I was right there with them . I loved following Jo 's story . I was really rooting for her !
3 #### This book was ok ..... it just seemed to keep going and going and going . It was hard to finish this book .
5 #### I absolutely loved this novel . The time travel thru hypnosis concept was great . I did n't put this book down until I had finished , and wished there was more . Barbara Erskine is a terrific author , one of my all time favorites ..
4 #### This is one of those books that you either embrace wholeheartedly or dislike intensely I think . I read this many years ago and found myself quite disatisfied with how the story unfolded . However this is my second reading of Jo Clifford / Matilda de Broase the Lady of Hay and I really enjoyed it the second time around . Matilda was a woman of her time with very few options open to her but how she defied a Prince , gave all for her family and was betrayed by her husband is compelling reading . That is where the strength of the story lies , the medieval aspect , the political intrigue and the love / hate relationship between Prince John and Matilda . But this book did have it 's detractions . I would have liked more explanation for William 's course of action , there were major repercussions for Matilda and her family . The characters depicted in the present were n't as strongly depicted as their alter egos and it was difficult to feel any empathy or sympathy towards them . Still I very much enjoyed the medieval setting and the story of Matilda de Braose .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books . I love the history of England and can find a number of the characters in my family tree .
3 #### i think this book is similar to the timetravellers wife as it jumps back and forward not a real favourite of that type storyline
5 #### For years Lady of Hay has been my favorite book . It is captivating , takes the reader from the present to the 15 th century . I can imagine myself having lived a previous life because the author , Barbara Erskine , presents the image so well , I can visualize it like I was actually living it . Even though it is a huge book I have read it twice and will likely read it at least once more . Barbara Erskine , Ken Follett and Diana Gabaldon capture the spirit of the past and transport the reader back as if they actually lived the life . Kudos to them
5 #### beautifully written and could not put it down.l Loved the present to the past concept and the suspense . I will definitely read more from this author . Not wanting to spoil the plot i will not explain but it has sparked an interest in past life regression . It is well worth reading .
3 #### I have mixed feelings about this book . It 's a modern day woman who has visions and goes off in search of herself . Her visions are of another woman who lived hundreds of years previously and the two stories are intertwined as she has these visions and questions her sanity , and as she discovers the story of the woman from a previous era . I liked the story , generally speaking . It was well thought out and fairly well portrayed . But honestly , I would rather have just had the story about the woman in the past . I found the modern day parts to be frankly boring and the whole " voyage of self - discovery via hallucinations " thing did n't really do it for me .
5 #### this was a re - purchase and re - read .... the original literally fell apart ......... read it many hears ago and just wanted to read it again ......... if you like history and novesl based partly on truth ...... this would be a book for you ............ the historical facts are correct
1 #### I love to read , and read a book a week . The story idea was interesting but I did n't like the characters , and it just fizzled out .
5 #### JoeDanDonigi I got the kindle version of this book and cover is different so do n't be surprised if kindle editions looks different from this . A caveat . Now on to the book . The main protagonist , Jo lives in the current time as Jo and in the past as Welsh Lady named Matilda . She jumps in the past and the future pretty seamlessly and the author , Barbara Erskine , seems to be adept at carrying on two love triangles , or squares would be more precise but not as phonetically pleasing . Though I 've never been to Wales the writing is good enough to evoke me effortlessly to believe I have been there even though I have n't . I can imagine it just as I can imagine living 800 years ago in Wales . This surprised me couple of times and that 's what I like , I want to try to guess before the author makes it obvious . This kept me on my figurative toes . Photoman35 mm
4 #### I confess that I have a love of books that explore past lives of the characters . I 'm not sure I believe in reincarnation but I wouold like to . In the Lady of Hay , the possible past life / possible possesion of journalist Jo Clifford as the Lady of Hay is explored . Jo begins her exploration of past life regression as research for an article she plans on writing . Soon she is totally immersed in her past life : being drawn back to her past at inconvenient times , in inconvenient ways . A smattering of darkness , evil and insanity invades ' both'of her lives as she struggles to make sense of what is real and what is n't . I have to say that , while I loved the story and the author 's style , I really did not like Jo . She struck me as wimpy and weak in both lives . That said , my feelings for the main character did not take away my total enjoyment of the book . Definitely recommended reading .
4 #### I read this book years ago and I loved it . I thought that the lives and story lines that were interwoven were really interesting . I have often felt the pull to the past myself and when I read this book I started to think the author may have not just created an imagined story . I really got involved in the twists and turns of the plot . Again , I loved it . Ca n't wait to read it again .
4 #### I had a hard time getting into the story in the beginning but once I started to be more familiar With names and places , I could n't put the book down ! I was so caught up in the story , now that I Have finished the book I find myself with many , Many unanswered questions and loose ends .
4 #### I really enjoyed this book . However , it is a very long book . It is well written , with a captivating story based on real people . Jo , a journalist , involved with Nick , her lover , is hypnotised and regresses 800 years into the English and Welsh past . She is then Matilda , who lived in the time of Henry the 2nd of England . She is married to William DeBraose , a cruel lord , but is in love with Richard deClare , another noble . She travels back and forth through time , eventually recognizing her modern companions from her life in the past . Sometimes she travels through hypnosis , sometimes she regresses spontaneously . The book takes you through some actual events , some imagined . But it keeps you interested . I was compelled to look up the characters online , and found them very interesting also . I do think Barbara Erskine could have condensed the book when she wrote it in 1986 . Her research is very good , but like some other authors , she tends to digress .
4 #### Book was enjoyable ; people who are into paranormal , incarnation , new age would most likely enjoy this book . I have not read other books by this author but would consider doing so .
5 #### I enjoyed the history and pschological turns in this book . It was very suspenseful up to the last , and easy to read .
3 #### It was pretty good , but the story was too drawn out . Much repetition of the same theme . The story itself was o.k .
5 #### Well - written and enjoyable . Lady of Hay is a book I 'll reread and recommend to my reading book club . It 's difficult to find such a good book these days ..
4 #### Love stories that go back in time . Author does a great job of blending the past with the present stories .
4 #### I could n't put it down . I 'm not usually a fan of this particular genre ---- but I literally could not put it down . When my Kindle ran low on power I plugged it up and kept on reading !
4 #### This book held my interest for the most part but the author ruined the story for me by having the past become a physical part of the subject 's past life . Except for that . I did enjoy the book .
4 #### This book kept me up late at night . The story unfolds at a great pace , intermingling present and past . I was so involved in Lady Matilda 's and Jo 's characters and their intertwined destinies , that I could literally feel their emotions , pain and fear , the book is so well written it plunges you right in the middle of it all . A great story . I would highly recommend it . This book will make you want to discuss with others who have read it - it stays with you long after you have finished it .
4 #### Barbara Erskine tells an intriguing tale of life with kings and nobles . I especially like the way she tied it to the present .
5 #### Wow ! This book is so great it was hard to put down . The history and current time stories were both fascinating . A must read .
3 #### I enjoy fictional novels of centuries past , and have some training in hypnosis , so at the beginning of the book , I was intrigued with Joanne ( main character ) who finds herself fipping back and forth from 12th century to present . The story began to unravel for me as more and more people in Joanna 's life became also a part of her past life , and somehow , all seemed to get regressed to the same time slot . At times there was more than a credibility gap ; and even though I enjoyed the theme of the story , I found the ending to be very weak ..
2 #### The content of this story left no impression in my memory . All I can remember is , that I did not enjoy it and can not recall even the theme , let alone the detail , six weeks after reading it .
4 #### If you are into historical fiction this book will not disappoint . Engaging and entertaining for a quiet rainy day read .
4 #### Although I do n't believe in reincarnation ; I do wonder about imprinted genetic memories . This story starts kind of slow ; I did n't really get into the story until after page 100 . I m glad I stuck with it because it really is a good story . The author makes the transitions from present day to early Wales in an easy way . Some of the descriptions were a bit long and the book could have been edited to a slightly shorter version . With all that I still recommend it as a good read if you like reincarnation and flash backs . Certainly a twist as to the who done it portion .
4 #### I had looked forward to reading this book after listening to the audio book version of Daughters if Fire which I found fascinating . This was unfortunate because by comparison , Lady of Hay felt repetitive albeit written many years before , and therefore if read in chronological order maybe Daughters of Fire would have been slightly less enthralling . I was impressed by the depth of historical research in the books , the attention to detail and insight into the characters both ancient and modern . I felt I was observing joy and despair ; feasts in the great Hall and the loneliness of cold dark castles ; the change of seasons and fortunes . Lady of Hay is a good holiday read for those who enjoy ' big fat ' novels and have a Kindle .
5 #### Read this years ago but lost my copy . A good historical romance . Lots of detail and good characters . Does not disappoint .
2 #### This book could be about half it 's published length . It goes on and on and on ... Perhaps so the author can insert yet another rape scene ? The writing itself is n't awful . But the characters ' constant fowl language and the rape author 's insatiable longing to write yet another rape scene ruin it .
5 #### I loved this book . I had a very strong emotional response to it . Do n't let the title fool you . Barbara Erskine made this one sooo believable for me that I googled some of the names of the characters and places . Some of them really did exist . They way it 's woven together is amazing .
5 #### I could n't put it dowm . When at work I kept thinking about it and couldn"t wait to get home to read ! !
3 #### I found the concept of past life regression interesting in this book . It was enjoyable to read . It did drag on in a few spots .
3 #### The good ? - I loved the premise of remembering of past lives and the intertwining with the present . The historical elements were well done , and the scenery was vivid . The idea that there are these three men who were in love with Matilda who are still in love with her present incarnation of Jo is handled fairly well . There is an interesting unexpected twist in the romance , and you 're not entirely sure who is going to win out in the end or why . The not - so - good ? - The characters were too inconsistent and unrealistic . If the characters are actually the same people from the past why did they change so much as soon as they began to remember ? Also , the present dilemma was nothing more than dealing with the stress of remembering the past . It would have been nice to see a parallel story in the present ( aside from the romance ) that had more to do with modern reality but somehow reflected the past . I agree with other reviewers that this was waaaaay too long , and Jo 's reaction to the abuse is weird .
5 #### I could n't put this down and have reccomended it to several friends . I think it 's well written and extremely entertaining . I was drawn into the hypnosis scenes and facinated how all the counterparts came together in the present day . Definetly a good read !
5 #### I read this a few years ago and loved it then . It was great having a modern part added after 25 years . I could n't put the book down again and enjoyed it even more the second time around . Barbara Erskine is an excellent writer and I have read all her books .
4 #### I enjoyed this book . Its themes of fictionalised but fact - based English history and of past - life recall are both enticing to me . And what others say about the author 's ability to evoke the sensory experience of time and place is true ; it 's all quite vivid . But I did not find the characters well - drawn ; and I agree with the reviewer who pointed out the multiple rapes , etc . , after which the main character seems to go back for more ; that was annoyingly off - putting . I have the impression that the author did a fair amount of research , but sometimes I doubted the accuracy of historical details ( I do n't like that feeling , and I do n't want to go look everything up . ) Another thing I found annoying was the vocabulary in the Kindle edition I read : the author and the heroine and the setting are English / Welsh , so why the references to " sidewalks , " " gasoline " and " taking the subway ? " Was this some sort of misconceived editorial policy for American readers ? A light and pleasant read ; and its several final chapters got me through a very long plane journey .
1 #### I was sure I would love this book after reading the other reviews and the fact that I love historical English fiction , but this book is truly awful . The premise is wonderful and the book starts off great , but it soon becomes repetitive and disjointed . Also , I volunteer for a domestic abuse support center , and the scenes of a young woman allowing herself to be physically abused over and over were very disturbing . I wish the book had lived up to my expectations .
1 #### I read this book years ago , must have been not long after it first came out . I remembered really liking it and looked forward to re - reading it . What a difference on the second reading ! The male / female relationships are so dated . The violence and abuse against Jo are horrible , and her taking it and going back to her rapist over and over are appalling . The characterizatons are two dimensional , and the writing is melodramatic and ridiculous . I 'm quite frankly ashamed of my younger self for liking it so much . There are much better " past life " novels out there ; " The Winter Sea " by Susanna Kearsley is one that I recently read and thought quite good . I would stay away from this one .
4 #### Lady of Hay was my ' first ' Barbara E novel - and as a consequence I have a soft spot for it and have to admit to having read it several times . It is not a novel that requires a great deal of thinking on the part of the reader , but that takes nothing away from the story itself , which I enjoyed . The characters did not grab me in the way that I like ( writers such as Elizabeth Chadwick ' The Champion ' or or Catherine A and Catherine T Wilson ' The Lily and the Lion ' do it better ) but I liked it none the less . For an international flight or a long car trip .
3 #### The book description and plot appealed to me as I am interested in both reincarnation and historical fiction . I started reading the book and found it interesting but the further I got , the less engaging it seemed . About a third of the way through I realized that I was starting to skim read . About half way through I started skipping entire chapters . In the end , I never finished the book or even read the end . It had potential but ...
5 #### I have read this book a number of years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it again . I love Barbara 's style of writing and the history in her stories .
5 #### This book had everything , history , romance , thriller . The characters were great . It was very exciting . The book was hard to put down .
5 #### One of my favourite books , and so glad to have it on my Kindle . Great , interesting , delves into a time of history that is fascinating , and written in such an easy to read , enjoyable , un - put - downable way ! ! ! Can thoroughly recommend this book , and any of Barbara Erskine 's books ! ! ! FANTASTIC READ ! ! !
5 #### There 's no reason to give a synopsis of LADY OF HAY ; others have done that . So I 'll just tell why I liked it . First , I liked the movement between past and present . It occurred smoothly , and it gave me my Medieval fix as well as a foot in the here and now . Next I liked the various explanations of the phenomenon that Jo and the others were experiencing : Dr. Bennett 's , Annie 's , Ceecliff 's , etc . I also liked how the characters were drawn , Jo , Nick , Tim , Sam , as well as their Medieval counterparts . Finally I liked the theme of reincarnation . I highly recommend this book . Incidentally , I have a recommendation for anyone who likes novels with a reincarnation theme : GREEN DARKNESS by Anya Seton .
5 #### Barbara Erskine has a PhD in Scottish history . You can look up all the historical details that she weaves into her stories and find them as being true . if you do n't like the genre of books - a bit of fantasy is mixed with proven historical facts - then this book is not for you . If you like to learn about history by ways of a fantasy novel - you ca n't find anything better ! One of my favorite books ! And by the way : I read all of Barbara Erskine 's books .
2 #### I did n't hate it but I am not sure it was worth reading . The " past lives " overstory was fine until it went totally hokey ( the rape scene ) .
1 #### I 'll pretty much read anything but this book goes on a very short list of " books so awful I could n't finish . " The story is an interesting idea but the characters are unrealistic and the plot chaotic . To compare this to Diana Gabaldon is unfair to Diana .
1 #### I read constantly and I agree with other reviewers about the excessive and un - necessary violence in this book . There are less than 5 books in my entire life I did not finish but I finally threw this book out - it was not fair to inflict it on my local library . The time period is definitely violent but it seemed that whenever the author did not know what to do she threw in a rape scene . I will never purchase another book by this author .
4 #### Jo , an investigative journalist , is working on a series about hypnosis , past - life regression and reincarnation . Initially skeptical , she allows herself to become hypnotized as part of her research . Immediately she begins reliving the life of Matilda , the Scottish Lady of Hay who lived eight - hundred years earlier . As she becomes more and more involved in Matilda 's life , the men around her also appear to be reincarnations of the men in Matilda 's life . I was immediately drawn into the story through Erskine 's writing style and dynamic characters . The historical nature of the book was carefully entwined with the present , creating an interesting and dynamic plot . At times the book did seem to drag on and the people Jo encountered seemed a bit too serendipitous . Despite these flaws I highly enjoyed this book .
5 #### This book was so hard to take breaks from reading and now that I am done I wish it was longer . Really well written I love a story where I can not guess the end just a few chapters in .
5 #### I was going to write up a nice review of this book , and I see that someone named Western Reader has pretty much jotted down my thoughts perfectly !
3 #### I really liked this book , however there were parts that moved a little slow . I loved going back and forth between centuries and the constant who is the good character and who is the bad . If it moved just a little faster I would have given it a 4 star review , but I gave it 3 . I would recommend that you read it perhaps you would have a different perspective .
5 #### I loved this book . It 's not perfect but it 's well worth my time and money . There were parts that dragged on but I could n't put the book down . Read this book ! If you like historical novels , it is worth your time .
5 #### Lady of Hay is one of the most interesting books I 've read this year . The attention to detail of events from the 12th and 13th centuries , counterposed against modern times , grabbed my attention right from the start . The thought of being able to travel to the past has always intrigued me , and this book did n't disappoint . It is well plotted and the characters are well developed . While those characters are certainly all too human , Sam is probably one of the snarkiest villians I 've read about in recent months . Of course , there 's the argument -- was it all planned by Sam in his evil , twisted mind , or was he really William ? Was Nick really King John , or did Sam really do a number on Nick via hypnotic suggestion ? Was Jo just an impressionable woman , hoisted on her own petard of vivid imagination and a love of history , or was she really a reincarnation of Matilda ? Each reader must make his / her own decision . Me ? I just went along for the ride and enjoyed every moment . Along the way , I learned a bit more about English history ... and that 's a good thing , too . I highly recommend this book for a jolly good read .
2 #### I though I would never get to the end of this book . I felt like I was nearing the end and I was only a third of the way through . There were way too many characters that were completely unnecessary . Way to much talking and back and forth about the same things over and over and over . ( get hypnotized ; no its dangerous ; no I have to ; stay with me ; go away blah blah blah ) . All these people did was go back and forth between each others houses , argue , and drive to old castles . After the first third of the book I skimmed and skipped so much but did n't really miss anythign . I enjoyed the past life part at first , but then even that got a bit depressing . Nothing good happens in this book . Oh except for epilogue 2 which seemed tacked on at the last minute and does n't really fit the rest of the book . The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because I did actually want to find out how the story ended so apparently there was something in it that pulled me in in spite of myself . But I 'm certainly not keeping this one around .
5 #### When I first saw the description of the book , i was not convinced it was something i wanted to read , it took me days to decide and i am glad i took the chance . The book takes you back into the time of kings , barons and earls but at the same time makes you grip on to the modern world . The author does not waste the readers time by using run on sentences or place unnecessary information into the book . The writer takes you on a roller coaster ride of emmotions from the view of three main chracters but also introducing the roles of other persons in the book to help bring about the story . You know it is a good book when you want to start and figure out for your self what is happeneing and you know it is awesome when even in your dreams you want to know what the end results going to be . I was really happy i got this book even though i usually stick to paranoumal book . High praises to the writer , fantastically written . I recommended it to all my friends .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books . I bought it on a Ferry between Victoria and Seattle . I loved it so much that I bought as many of her books as I could find , so neat that she has been revived . Great writer , great plot .
4 #### The premise of the book is regression of past lives that affect present lives . Other historical fiction authors portray Maud de Braose as an mean spirited shrew . This version cleans her up and makes her much more sympathetic . I do n't think that is historically valid but these problems really did n't impair my ability to totally enjoy the book .
5 #### I read this book based on the recommendation by a friend and was surprised by how much I loved it . For some reason , the back cover summary left me skeptical and unconvinced . I finished the book tonight and loved it ! The mix of a modern day story versus the period time story of the " past life " kept me interested and turning the pages ( or pushing my Kindle button forward is more like it ) . I think people who are fans of the Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon will relate well to and enjoy this book as well . Do n't let the " past life " part scare you off . Highly recommend it !
5 #### I think this was a great book . It is almost like getting two books for the price of one . The current day cast has a past that ties them together 800 years ago . It was very well written and slid from present to past and back smoothly . I think the whole story was good . I read it day after day and carried my kindle around with me like I used to carry a book to the table at dinner when I was a kid . If you enjoy stories of the past and a good love story then this is a good choice .
1 #### I read a lot of English historical fiction . I was really surprised to see all the good reviews for this book . I thought much of it was boring , hard to read , very contrived and unrealistic . Also there is a disturbing amount of abuse of the heroine , including multiple rapes - and the heroine keeps going back for more . SPIOLERS ALERT : At least four characters ( Sam / William and Nick / John)are violently abusive to the main character . The only interesting thing about it for me was the look at the life of Moll Wallbe . I could barely get through this book and was glad when it was over .
5 #### This was a well thought out , detailed story with so many twists and turns it gave the plot a new dimension . There was a definite line between past and present for the reader but confusion for the characters themselves . I began reading this book expecting one thing and it surprised me with something else . All the characters were well defined and completely believable . I actually found myself with tears in my eyes a few times . The historical aspect was well written and as the plot became more intense , I was rooting for multiple characters . This book kept me up reading late at night . - Theresa B.
3 #### The plot has been described by other reviewers . The one point I want to add is that the behavior of the medieval characters is extremely brutal . Although in that way , the story is much more true to the past than most historical novels , if you are sensitive ( as I am ) you may find the descriptions disturbing . In any event , not something to read while you are feeling blue .
4 #### I enjoyed this , but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it had all been in Matilda 's past and skipped the stuff in the present time . The idea of regression was interesting , but it got to be a bit much after a while . I mean , how many people do you know that are experienced hypnotists ? And Jo was hypnotized by was it four or five different people ? That did become a bit of a stretch towards the end of the book . * * * Spoiler * * * Also , unless I missed something , I do n't think Sam 's obsession with the whole Jo / Matilda thing was explained to my satisfaction . How did he become so evil -- to the point of harming his brother . You should be advised that this is not your " true " historical fiction . Matilda , William De Braose , Richard , etc . were real people , but as the author notes at the end not all that happened in the book to Jo / Matilda actually happened to the real Matilda . I almost did n't read this book because of what really happened to Matilda -- yes she was held prisoner with her son and they starved to death but the story ended a bit more gruesome than that , if what I read in SKP 's Welsh trilogy is true . I was relieved that Erskine left that part out . Otherwise an interesting read , I blew through it quickly . Four stars instead of five for the inconsistencies .
3 #### I bought and read this book when I was 13 and visited London . At 13 I adored it passionately . At much older than 13 , I find it a bit laughable . First , I agree with several reviewers who object to the " strong , independent " heroine being raped and abused , and finding her " happily ever after " with one ( ! ! ! ) of her rapists . His excuse was that he was hypnotically regressed to King John at the time . Oh , well , of course . The historical parts of the book are outstanding , detailed and well - researched , and they win 100 % of the three stars that I give this book . Readers of Sharon Kay Penman 's _ Here Be Dragons _ will find this an excellent companion piece . In fact , if you love medieval Welsh history , I highly recommend getting this book and just flipping the pages whenever the modern characters appear . The original cover art I have from my British edition reads , " Fascinating , absorbing , and original . " The first two are subjective , but as many reviewers have pointed out , it is hardly original ; Anya Seton 's _ Green Darkness _ and Mary Luke 's _ Nonesuch Lure _ played the same themes at least 20 years before _ Lady of Hay _ was published . But it became even less original when Barbara Erksine began searching out abused women in British history and did the same thing over and over again , injecting historically inaccurate feminism along the way . _ Lady of Hay _ is definitely the best of her efforts in the past - life regression genre .
4 #### I bought Lady of Hay used a few years ago and did n't pick it up again for a few months . I 've always been fascinated with past lives but usually the way it is portrayed is unbelievable . This book , on the other hand , is fantastic . Imagine been put under hypnosis and having a past life emerge ? For the author to actually use a real person from history is great ... it made me think and I even looked her up . I read this book again every few months just for pure enjoyment .
4 #### Hardened journalist , Jo Clifford is working on an investigative piece to debunk reincarnation and regression hypnosis . There 's only one problem , the fact that once she agrees to be hypnotised in order to try and be fair , she has very realistic images of a woman from the Middle Ages , Matilda , Lady of Hay . Is Jo really the reincarnation of someone who lived hundreds of years ago ? Or is she just remembering some facts that she had forgotten from long ago history lessons ? Flitting between Jo 's modern life and Matilda 's past life , the book is a real page turner , keeping you guessing until the very end . The regression is handled quite well and as you finish the book , you do begin to wonder if reincarnation is such a far fetched idea after all . Barbara Erskine has the talent to weave a spell with words , you just have to finish the books once started . Reviewed by Annette Gisby , author of Silent Screams .
5 #### Great story .. Suprise ending ... exciting and fast paced ! Everything Barbara Erskine writes is awesome !
1 #### This book is a horrid combination of writing that is good enough to keep you reading and bad enough that you wish you were n't . The book is 700 + pages . The heroine is repeatedly raped ( forceably and not ) or otherwise abused by men who supposedly love her . She repeatedly makes stupid choices , leaving the reader to wonder how " smart " she really is . There are too many irrelevant characters . The ending is completely unsatisfying , given how long I spent to slog through the book . The author is not bad in terms of description , but the only real element of " suspense " will be figured out by a thinking reader by page 100 or so of the book and is not nearly enough to carry a reader happily through to page 700 . Avoid this book .
5 #### If you love historical and contemporary fiction as I do , this is the book for you . This particular novel is two stories in one . One , is the story of Lady Mathilda of 12th century Wales . While the other story , parallel to that of Mathilda is about Jo Clifford , reporter . Note the definitive word : " parallel " ; because Jo and Mathilda are one and the same person in different incarnations , along with the people with whom they interact in their respective lifetimes . This book has all the elements of a good story ... beautiful visuals of the 12 century Welsh landscape and castles , not to mention murder , suspense , mystery and romance . Another page - turner to be sure .
4 #### For me the book started off pretty slowly , I really did n't get into it till the 3th or 4th chapter . From then on though , I could n't put it down , I liked the characters better in the past though . I was far more anxious to read about them then Jo and the rest from the 20th century . It was a refreshing read , I recommend this book 100 % and also Kingdom of Shadows which I absolutely loved .
4 #### Although I think George Sayer 's JACK the best of the C.S. Lewis biographies available , Green and Hooper 's book is also good , with the added advantage that both men knew their subject personally . Their book complements Sayer 's and is worth obtaining for Lewis fans . It is certainly better than Wilson 's biography of Lewis , though without quite the achievement of Sayer 's book .
5 #### We had watched the series on TV which was based on this book Gold Diggers and so I bought this for my husband . He is thrilled with the book , which arrived in excellent used condition . He is telling me every day different information he is finding as he reads it . Very historical and thourough history .
4 #### I always had a vague idea as to what the Klondike gold rush was all about . Ms Gray provides a comprehensive overview of what it was like to be there in the late 19th century .
5 #### I wish I had been here to live this era . I read everything I can about Alaska , the Klondike and all subsequent ' s. Very well done and very glad I purchase it .
4 #### I was in Alaska and just had to get this and read about where I was at the time . It was very detailed and gave you a pretty good idea of what it was like . It also fired up my thirst for gold . It sounds so easy to go somewhere and just " pick up " the gold from a river , but the truth is so far from that . Towards the end of the book , it just seemed that everything had been covered already . I was ready for it to end , but I did n't stop the process , I finished the book .
5 #### This book is such a great chronicle of the various Klondike gold rushes that it definitely stands together with some of the great books that have been written about the Klondike / Yukon experience . The information abut Jack London and his role in making the myths of the Yukon is just indispensable . If you think you know something about Jack London and how he did in the Klondike , I think you will be surprised by what Ms Gray digs up about London and his time in the Klondike . The other characters , and their adventures , fairly jump off the page , with their bravado and spirit as real as a chilly Klondike breeze . The idea of a place so free and wild captures the imagination , and Ms. Gray manages to paint these word pictures with a freshness and vividness that you can really feel . The feeling of adventure and " gold fever " leaps from Ms Gray 's pages . It is truly a funny and fun read , which is difficult to accomplish in what is essentially a history book . So read this one if you want to know why people went there and what they found . I guarantee you will go away with an admiration and respect for these brave souls that you will remember long after you have finished this incredible book ! ! !
5 #### Excellent presentation of six true stories of persons who experienced the Gold Rush of 1896 - 9 in the Klondyke river region near Dawson .
5 #### Just a fantastic read ! ! My wife and I were able to visit the Klondike area this summer and I was given the true perspective of what it must have been like , by Charlotte Gray . I loved this book ! ! The real participants , were brought to life through Ms. Gray 's writing !
5 #### I watched " Klondike " on television and got hooked ... so I bought the book . This was an in - depth story . You got to know the characters and really got a feel for the gritty life of the people in the gold rush , the good , the bad and the ugly . Read this book if you really want to know what the northern frontier was like at the turn of the 20th century .
5 #### The book went deeper into the characters and what it was truly like to go to the end of the world in 1896 to try to find the gold that everyone was lead to believe was so easy to find . I find it very interesting and fun to read .
5 #### I could not turn the pages faster on my Kindle Fire ... what a read covering the 1898 Alaskan Gold Rush and especially the people and characters involved . Highly recommended ! JHP
5 #### After viewing the TV special I had to get this book . It is excellently written & well worth a read . Lived in Alaska for 20 + years & taken the train to Whitehorse from Skagway a number of times which allows you to view part of original trail .
5 #### The six people the author has chosen to highlight are all interesting in different ways , and illustrate the stresses and strains of this time place very well . If you read only only one book on Klondike gold rush , this should be the one . If you want more , the author recommends several other sources that are longer ' standard ' accounts .
5 #### Isaw the movie on tv and wanted a more in depth story . I really enjoyed the comments that the author put in the book to add to the story . If the gold diggers has listened to the natives it would have been a lot easier for them no scurvy , for one.thing . the local cures that she added were interesting .
5 #### Very informative . I read it after watching the movie it was based on . The movie was far from accurate but that is to be expected . What it did leave out was the criminal element that I am positive was going on at the time .
4 #### TV show intrigued me so I was curious to learn what was fact and what was fiction . Particularly enjoyed the " what happened to them afterwards " part .
4 #### Historical . Makes me realize how fortunate we are today . We eat well , avoid scurvy and can make decent money and have a life style that would have made those old prospectors envious . Hope we do n't blow it with all the government debt .
5 #### I watched the mini series on TV recently and decided to read the book . It was very good . I did n't know very much about this period in history and it was hard to imagine what these people went through to prospect gold , the weather and their living conditions .
5 #### I hated history in school because it was always just a jumble of dates and places . Books like this are always a pleasure to read as you get to see what happened through the eyes of someone who was either there or did the research so you could see what happened through their eyes . Mine were definitely opened . Thank you to the author .
5 #### I really enjoyed the book and the way it was written . The history of the Klondike region has intrigued me since I was a kid . Thing were so tough back in those times it is amazing that any of the " Rushers " lived through the hardships of first the trek there , and then the terrible conditions once they finally ( if at all ) got to a claim and searching for gold . Strong people in a very harsh land !
5 #### Ordered the book after watching the tv mini series and found the book much better than the series . A greatly overlooked period of North American history " Gold Diggers " answered a lot of questions . And sent me on a search for other books on the same topic , Suddenly my library has gone from zero Yukon gold rush books to 5 , all covering different but also overlapping topics of the gold rush . Very happy with it !
4 #### I watched the television miniseries and was interested to know more . I found the detail I wanted here . Fascinating story . Incredible adventures and a real insight into men who and their compulsions . Arguably these bizarre behaviors conquered the world .
5 #### I watched the TV special " KLONDIKE " , which is also excellent , and became interested to read the book behind the TV movie . I am fascinated by the tales and history of the 1700s and 1800s and the people who physically took part in building this great country . I recommend this book .
5 #### Absolutely fascinating . The book was well researched , and many eyewitness accounts . Author also followed up the principal characters after the Klondike experience .
5 #### This really tells the hardships these adventurers endured . I ca n't imagine living in conditions where my eyelids freeze shut and the fresh food is so scarce most of the year . I love reading about this era of discovery .
5 #### I loved this book . While it has history it is not a dull history book and the history is indeed interesting . The book details the lives of different people enveloped in the gold rush from a wonderful clergy man , a young Irish woman with a keen sense for business , successful and not so successful miners plus those who went there with no knowledge of mining or life in the very rugged north . The book is very well written and weaves the history , the town of Dawson , and the individual characters together seamlessly .
3 #### A wonderful story of courage written from diaries and stories of survivors passed down through families . At times the story was hard to follow , and due to the large cast of characters it was easy for one to lose track of who was who . However , it is a little known true story of a group of people who survived because of the courage of others to risk their life for them .
5 #### I saw a very depressing movie based on these books . For some reason I bought thr book on Kindle . After reading it , I cried .
5 #### Having recently seen the movie " In Darkness " and noting that it was based on 2 books , I purchased both , namely " The Girl in the Green Sweater " and this book . Reading these books makes one realise how fortunate one was to be born at the end of 1945 and never to have experienced the horror and fear that these people experienced . These are stories that everyone needs to hear / read about as they not only tell of the people in the sewers spirit of survival and endurance but also the courage and risk that others took to help and save them .
5 #### An amazing account of what mankind can endure both physically and emotionally . Unfortunately this is a true retelling of the ordeal that Jews went through during WWII . Another example of man 's inhumanity to his fellow man !
5 #### This book takes your breath away . The strength of the human spirit when faced with sheer torture and death . I was unable to put this book down . An eye opener reassuring us that the ability to survive when forced to run and hide from the evilness of others can be achieved . Bless these people ... and the courage with which they dealt with hell .
5 #### Astonishing story of the lengths to which people were forced to go in order to survive the holocaust . A hopeful story of the unexpected kindness of one man who by society 's estimation was a criminal . This story of the sewers is a rather obscure piece but it is a vital addition to any Holocaust library .
5 #### An incredible , true story of Jews who lived for over a year in the sewers of Lvov in order to survive from the Nazis . The story tells how they all escaped the Nazis and deals with their fears , hardships , philosophies while in hiding . Socha , the hero sewer worker who risked his life to save them was genuinely a righteous gentile . A great book , well - writen , a must for all interested in Holocaust survivor stories .
5 #### I would definitely recommend this book to my friends .
4 #### i liked the book , it showed the worst and best of humanity , ,
5 #### This is an account of life that we do not hear about as much as the concentration camps . It shows that there are good people helping those who would be killed if found . It shows what people did to survive and live throught the war . It is fascinating and uplifting .
5 #### An amazing book that is exciting , tense , fearsome , and dramatic . What courage and humanity these people showed under such horrific circumstances - it defies the imagination . For me , the most powerful ( and tragically negative ) moment in the book was the very last line of the book - but sorry , no spoilers here . Highly recommended .
5 #### My daughter read extensively about the Holocaust . I purchased this book at a GARAGE SALE because of her interest . She read it and it became the book that undoubtedly moved her in a way that no other holocaust had done before . She asked me to read it . It is the one and only book that I will NEVER forget . A story of courage , victims , and some survivors , that to this day , is the truest testimony of the power of determination . I read this book 15 years ago , and I have been so moved by it , coming across it while cleaning out some stuff , that I am still moved to right a review . It is a book that WILL NOT disappoint .
4 #### This a fascinating story of the ends that ordinary people will go to in order to survive their the Nazi 's aim of there destruction . I do n't think it is possible to understand how human beings can survive under the circumstances that the subjects of this true - life story . It also shows that there were indeed righteous people among the non - Jewish Poles who willingly risked their lives to save Jewish strangers . The book is suspenseful and fast paced .
5 #### I do n't even LIKE history or economics ... but I love this book . In the course of researching some historical background for an English Lit paper , I ran across two of Braudel 's books -- this was one of them . It was so fascinating that I read the entire book ( even though what I needed for the paper was a few pages ) ; and then I went ahead and bought my own copy , plus others by this author .
5 #### I do n't care for ( or much understand ) economics . And I often find history to be very dry . This book , however , was a VERY enjoyable read . I originally checked it out of the library because I needed some information for a paper I was writing ... and I was hooked enough to buy this books and others by this author . Braudel sees the big picture AND the details -- and not only that , he writes in such an interesting manner that I was able to assimilate a vast amount of information before I knew it .
5 #### This was the most interesting , to me , of Braudel 's classic three - volume history of the age when vernacular culture first faced off against the predecessors of industrial culture . I dive into these books periodically and surface several hours later , having gone back in time .
5 #### Massive work , full of details , by the master of economic history . A word of caution : You have to dig very hard , in order to collect the priceless and intriguing meanings of this work . In the end you will be rewarded ! ! !
5 #### If you enjoy detailed aspects about life from the 15th-18th century then this is a great reference book . It is written for the layman but takes a long time to get through the material . It also covers a wide range of topics . Great source of historical information .
5 #### I read this volume and its two companions several years ago , and they changed my view of the world . Although I am a long time amateur student of history and economics , this series really brings the period to life and tackles one of the most contentious subjects in historiography : the rise of capitalism . It 's easy to read and , although full of detail , calls our attention to the great currents flowing beneath daily events . I also recommend Braudel 's " The Mediterranean in the Time of Phillip II " for a really detailed look at the Mediterranean economy in the late 16th Century .
5 #### This book is not in the genre I generally read but the number of 5 star reviews caught my eye . The nuances of character were such that I was completely taken aback when I discovered that the author was male - after I finished reading the book ! Although an avid e - book purchaser and reader , I rarely take the time to rate a book - this book was exceptional and worth a few minutes of my time to comment publicly .
2 #### This book was depressing . I felt sorry for Clara at first , then could n't take her repeated bad choices . I finally just saw it going from bad to worse and stopped reading it . Maybe I would have been pleasantly surprised at the end , but from where I saw it leading , I doubt it .
4 #### This was a different read for me but I really enjoyed it . I read it sometime ago so I do n't remember all the specific details .
4 #### The story concerns two sisters from a small town in Canada , who travel different paths . One leaves for NYC and becomes a successful radio actress , while the other , a school teacher , remains behind . I enjoyed the author 's use of correspondence as a vehicle for telling the story . I thought the writing was fluid , the time period well researched and the story enjoyable .
4 #### The story of two sisters is told completely through their letters and Clara 's diary entries . Nora leaves the small Canadian town to live in New York and lands a job as a radio soap opera actress in the 1930 's . Clara remains in the small town teaching at the school where her father was principal before his death . Clara finds a radio , phone and car unnecessary . After an incident on the back roads of the small town , Clara seeks out the help of Nora in New York . After returning to Canada , Clara occasionally treats herself to a movie in a larger city . It is there that she meets a man that changes her future . At first I felt sorry for Clara and was sure that ditzy Nora was headed for big trouble . Although Nora had her share of man troubles , it was nothing compared to the troubles of her spinster sister , Clara . I kept hoping Clara would soften or wizen but the afterward leads the reader to believe that did not happen .
5 #### What a delight to read this subtle , beautifully and deceptively simply written book . Nothing happens and then everything happens , back and forth . Clara is a marvelous character , well - drawn and well - liked , despite her strange and quirky personality . She is a gift to the reader , so DO read the book .
1 #### My wife and I read this new book to our 3 yr old twins separately and both came away fuming . The first 80 % of the book is examples of absolutely horrible things to do ( cut up all the newspapers / books in the house , etc . ) and in the end it gets wrapped up in a neat little bow . But 3 yr olds do n't remember all the way back to the beginning and then connect those bad things with the conclusion . They spent all that time focused on these horrible things and then guess what they take away from the book ? Hint : it 's not the " moral " . Yep , the next day my kids suggested we do all the stuff the Very Bad Bunny did . I said " But remember how those things were bad " and it did n't seem to register with them -- it sounded like great fun . This book made my job as a parent that much harder , made me tell them " no " even more times than I otherwise would have to , and made my child 's life that much more confusing . Why would we purposely do this ? A Very Bad Book .
3 #### Paperback issue with plastic cover . Came from England so some of the words were different . Pages were yellowed and book smelled musty .
3 #### This book had a dirty cover and large crayon name printed on the inside cover . I really wanted the book , however , so I cleaned it up as best I could . This book was requested by my 24 year old son for his own 2 1/2 year old son . It was his favorite book - and his son loved it to . It tells how sometimes kids are n't as naughty as everyone seems to think - esp . when compared with a naughtier cousin .
4 #### Easy to read , set in the depression in small town in Canada and also in New York City . Interesting .
5 #### I got this book as a bargain kindle . I thoroughly enjoyed it . Wonderful characterizations . Location is mainly Canada & NYC . I found the Canadian descriptions especially interesting . If you give it a try , you will be so glad that you did .
4 #### I thoroughly enjoyed this novel . It is an easy and entertaining read about the lives of two sisters , set in the 1930 's , in Canada and New York City . Mr. Wright choose journal entries and letters to and from the characters to formulate the story , which worked very well , in my opinion . I am now interested in other books by this author !
5 #### I loved reading this book . His way of keeping a story so strong by useing written letters was great . I would recommend this book to all and especially Book Club members
4 #### Very good story with a bit of violence that threw me for a loop . A very plain school teacher that has a charming sister .The charmed sister becomes successful . The school teacher has a mundane life and is struck by a violent act . Later the teacher falls for a DonJuan that has a horrible effect on her life ... Great book ... great story ... holds your interest till the very end .
5 #### This story will not appeal to just anyone , for me it has been a journey of retrospection . I plan to read it again once I have recovered from reading it now .
5 #### Wonderful book for little kids ! ! Great story & illustrations ! Not a lot of words so the book moves along fast , which is great for my 3 year old grandson . He loves it and we 've read it about 100 times already . I read to my kids and now my grandchildren .
5 #### I read this book to my children when they were growing up and now , I read it to my grandchildren . It has been out of print and was difficult to find but Amazon found it for me !
5 #### I really enjoyed this story of two sisters from a small town in Ontario , told through a combination of their correspondence and Clara 's diary . The story takes place mainly in the 1930s and is a good reflection of the challenges faced by single women during that time . One sister goes to New York and becomes a popular radio soap opera star , while the other remains a schoolteacher in her small town in Canada . The story reads as though it was written by a woman , but surprisingly , the author is a man , who did a commendable job of conveying the lives of these two very different women .
2 #### This was a dark and dreary story . I had to stop reading now and then , and in fact I skipped a lot of it . Just depressing
5 #### Well written account of a life experienced by a unmarried Canadian woman in the 1930 's . The diary format and internal insights gave a reader a clear picture of the main character and her struggles .
2 #### I found this book to be well written but depressing . There were too many negative themes that overwhelmed the story . I kept waiting for some kind of redemption , but , in the end , it was tiring and frustrating .
5 #### Engrossing and well done novel about the dreams and foibles of women .
5 #### What a wonderful story , I was engrossed in the lives of Clara and Nora from the start . So well written .
4 #### The book traces the lives of two sisters during the 1930 's through the vehicle of letters and diaries . The depression is on . War is brewing in Europe and we learn how the history of the era is impacting their lives . Clara leads a rather pathetic life compared to her sister , Nora , who left their small Canadian town for New York City and life as a radio soap opera star . Though I was uncertain I would like a book comprised totally of diary entries and letters , this was beautifully written and held my interest .
4 #### Very interesting and a page turner . It ended so quickly and wish that there had been more substance to the daughters life growing up . Devoting only one chapter to her life was disappointing .
5 #### Very good book held my attention throughout ! ! I
5 #### I like the way the author used diary entries and letters to tell the story of Clara ' life from 1934 - 1938 . A fun look into the past .
4 #### Two sisters travel different ways in the 1930 's ; story told in letters and diary entries . Winner of several awards in Canada and deservedly so . Recommended .
5 #### This book won numerous prizes when it was published in 2001 , and it is a deserving winner . The book is centered around four years - 1934 to 1938 . It is a book that is relayed through letters and journal entries which makes it a very intimate book . The story is mostly about two sisters who were born in a small Ontario town . One sister remains in Canada and the other pursues a career in radio in New York City . In those days the radio was a very important entertainment medium , and many stories and serials were broadcast . In some ways it was a magical time . Radio is so much more intimate than television . This book is so well - written that these characters come to life in the pages . The book is very engrossing as we follow the lives of Clara and Nora Callan . It totally captivated me and I came to identify with Clara who was the girl that remained at home in the house that she was born in . Somehow it seems that things just seemed to happen to poor Clara through no effort of her own . I did n't want to put the book down and was sorry when it was over . Life seemed to be deceptively simpler then it is now for sure .
2 #### Light and fluffy with no real content except discontent and the exercise of bad judgement . The first half of the book hints at the possibility of some deepness in the second half , but disappoints in that respect . The " Afterward " gives the appearance of the story being non - fiction , but unless the author is using a male pseudonym , that would be impossible . If you want to follow the meaningless lives of two sisters and wallow in the elder 's loneliness , peccadilloes , and bad judgements then this is a book for you . The older sister of the first half of the book has so much potential which is fully destroyed by the author in the second half .
3 #### Clara Callan provided its readers with a nostalgic return to the days of yesteryear when housewives escaped their humdrum existence by fulfilling their romantic dreams and fantasies via serialized radio programs and having a child out of wedlock was akin to wearing a scarlet letter . Richard B. Wright has managed to capture the emotions and morals of the late 1930 's and early 1940 's in this epistolary morality tale of two sisters , Clara and Nora , one a teacher residing in small , clannish Canadian town and the other a " soap opera " actress pursuing a career in New York City . Wright 's look at the plight of females of this era , attempting to maneuver through the social expectations of society while pursuing their own goals , is startling in its insight and accuracy and almost makes one feel as if this novel were written by a woman . ( High praise indeed ) . When all is said and done , Clara Callan shows us freedom to pursue ones dreams comes with a price , and that perhaps things were not really so good in the " good old days " .
5 #### I became curious about this book after finding out it won both the GG Award and the Giller . I had read The Weekend Man and Final Things by the same author , and both of those were excellent , but this book showcased Wright 's incredible talent at his craft . This book is written in diary and letter format from the perspective of Clara Callan , a thirtysomething school teacher in the 1930s . It begins with her father 's death , and her sister 's move to New York City . Clara is alone in the small town that she grew up , and she chronicles a 4 - year period in great detail . I 'm sometimes hesitant to read books by men with female protagonists because sometimes the unintentional maleness of the character 's thoughts permeates their characterization . Wright does a great job writing from a female point of view , however and Clara and Nora are easy to relate to and seem like they could be the same women that live next door or that you interact with day to day . The research behind the book is very noteable , as the history of the times is effortlessly entertwined with the diary entries and serves as both editorial comment and historical re - telling . This is a wonderful book and an incredible accomplishment . It is definitely the type of book you should buy and then pass around to your friends to enjoy as well .
5 #### A wonderful book . I 've been reading it for the past 15 months . I read it through once within a few days and since then I 've been dipping every few days -- possible and enriching because it 's told in journal entries and letters . I 've read several others of Mr Wright . I would urge anyone ( especially fifty - something males ) to get a copy of his ' Weekend Man , ' his first novel written in the early 70s . One of my most favorite works of fiction ever . As for ' Clara Callan , ' it is easily one of the most satisfying novels I 've read in recent years .
4 #### I loved how easily this story flowed . It is set during the Depression era and centres on two sisters , Clara and Nora Callan . Clara is the wall - flower who stays in the hometown she grew up in and leads what she feels is a fairly conservative lifestyle . Her life is revealed to us in journal entries and letters to her sister Nora . A horrible event shakes up her life in ways she never knew possible and eventually leads her down roads she felt she would never trod upon . Her sister Nora is leading the glamorous life and becomes very much a socialite in her circles . Her correspondence with her sister shows us that all is not how it appears in her life either . This book was a pure pleasure to read . The ability to find extraordinary in the ordinary and often mundane things in life shows the true talent of this author . I felt a connection to Clara Callan and was sad to see the story end .
4 #### Clara is the good daughter who , after her father 's death , stays in the family home , keeps plugging at her job as schoolteacher , plays her piano , composes a little poetry , and writes long letters to her sister Nora ( the bad daughter ) and long entries in her journal . The book is composed of those writings , as well as some from her sister and a friend , who are in New York living the high life . Clara 's quiet life in a small Canadian town ( read : everyone knows your business and makes it theirs ) is shattered when she takes a walk at dusk : she is raped by a drifter , gets pregnant , goes to her sister Nora in NY , and has an abortion . Returning to Canada , she picks up her life as tho nothing happened . Then she meets a married man in a movie theater and becomes his lover . The story of their affair and its aftermath occupies the last part of the book and is the framework for Clara examining her past , her options , and her future . An elegant and quiet book , and a very , very deep one with a heartbreaking Prologue . Definitely worth a read , and do n't hurry thru it ; it demands some pondering .
5 #### I usually do n't like books in diary / journal and letter form , but this book is the great exception . These characters who live in the 1930 's deal with many issues that are still hot topics today : rape , homosexuality , extra - marital relationships , abortion , and more . The more things change , the more they stay the same ...
5 #### Truly well written . Good character development , good surrounding scenery descriptions . Could visualise the scenes that were being laid out really enjoyed it
5 #### Secret Garden holds memories of my being read to as a child , of sharing the story with my children with great delight , and now my grandchildren . It is a beautiful , ageless story of hope enduring , beauty in relationships , and love of nature .
5 #### A must read for every child . This is a book every parent needs to read to their child . Do n't rely on the movie . Never substitute a movie for a well - written book .
5 #### One of my favorites . I also have in hard copy .
5 #### This is an awesome book ! I 'm so glad I took the time to read it . I would recommend this to pretty much anyone .
5 #### An outstanding book that draws the reader into the garden where mystery and magic engulf and enhance the reader 's desire to learn why the garden is a secret !
5 #### This is a true classic . Love this book . Read it as a youth , and it has n't lost any of it 's charm or appeal . We read it in Book Club and everyone loved it and was touched by it . There were some who 'd never read it and they loved it as much as those of us who had read it . What a poignant story of a lonely little girl and a lonely little boy , brought together by a beautiful garden and their friendship with a nature - loving , kind and sincere other child . Just beautiful .
5 #### I have always loved this story and loved the musical as well so there is n't much to say -- It 's an inspiring classic and one I can now share with my kids in an audiobook ! The narrator does a wonderful job with the story and was fun to listen to . I was given this free review copy audiobook at my request and have voluntarily left this review .
5 #### If you 're going to Paris anytime soon , read this biography . Besides getting to know Renoir , you can see what Paris looked like before Hausmann re - built it , the neighborhoods it displaced , etc . It is a joy to get to know the man behind the brush . Very worthwhile .
5 #### I was eager to read this story of Renoir 's life from his son 's perspective . I am a big fan of the Impressionist Painters and Renoir is without a doubt the very best . I loved learning about the type man he was .
4 #### An excellent portrayal of both the artist and the world he lived in done by his son who was both loving and objective .
5 #### If you buy this for a friend , get two , you 'll probably wish to read it again . His writing is so visual , & evokes those times as no other book I 've read . It shows , too , why his movies became classics , perhaps Renoir 's greatest masterpiece was his son .
4 #### I am barely into this book and look forward to setting aside the time to pick it up again soon to finish it .
5 #### One of the most beautiful memoirs ever , not only about Renoir the painter , but about the world long gone of 19th century France . In fact , if you wanted to recreate that world , this is the blueprint -- not the world of the rich and the powerful ( Proust is the blueprint for that ) , but the world of the rustics , the rural / urban poor , the artisans . Jean Renoir 's own memoirs of his life in cinema are also fine , but much more fragmented . He did write like an angel .
2 #### I was required to read this for a book club . I finally gave up . I am an avid reader ( 2 - 3 books per week ) and after almost 2 weeks , I gave up . Thank goodness , I was n't the only one at book club who could n't get through it . VERY tedious ....
5 #### Jean Renoir 's memoir of his father 's life is a tender hearted hagiography more than it is a linear biography . it is a book that could only have been written by a loving son . It is intimate as one would expect from a book written by a family member and at times Jean Renoir strays off to explain some relationship or episode in language that suggested to me that he was being flooded with memories as he wrote . This gives the book in certain respects the aspect of a long and rambling recollection of the great artist that incorporates the France that he lived and worked in beautifully and results in a highly atmospheric read . Near the end Jean Renoir wrote in describing Renoir 's final years in Cagne " like all stories about Renoir , it is devoid of anything sensational " . For me that captures the spirit of this book . It is as intimate a portrait of a famous artist as I am ever likely to read and for anyone who is interested in Renoir and his work it is pure joy from beginning to end . A fabulous book .
5 #### Written by Renoir 's son , this book gives you a wonderful incite into Renoir 's character and thoughts . Renoir 's respect and admiration for the true beauty of women is expressed in the book . It explains why he painted women so magnificently with soft rosey tones . Fascinating .
5 #### I 've seen the movie but until now have never read the book , and thoroughly enjoyed it . There is definitely something magical about the wonder and imagination of children , something that has the power to heal .
4 #### I really enjoyed this book . I reviewed it on my channel Pink Fluffy Sylveon . It is a good piece of children 's literature .
5 #### I loved this book ! It grabbed me and took me into the lives of two children with different sorts of disadvantages . But hope and love and a strong spirit saw them through ( together , but with help from others too ) to complete health . They shocked those around them who had them pegged for ill , dying and unwanted ... but ... saw the immense change that comes with love , HOPE and what they called " magic . " The story was woven with skill and was AWESOME . I totally recommend this book .
5 #### This book is wonderful for both children and adults . Its full of wisdom and is a great adventure from beginning to end !
5 #### Enjoyed this revisit of a beloved childhood book . Nice surprise to read the new added touches !
5 #### An affectionate remembrance of Renoir by his son , concentrating the years up to the turn of the century . Renoir considered himself an artisan rather than an artist , disliked anything artificial , from margarine to ready - to - wear clothes , had among his friends artists , and musicians who are household names today . " It is when you have lost your teeth that you can buy the best beefsteak " he would say , and considering that he became more infirm with age , this truism affected him no less than the rest of us .
5 #### Renoir was far more than one of the world 's greatest artists . He was an adventurer , a family man , a man who held interesting views on just about every subject under the sun , and finally , in his later years , a martyr to life . Although this book was written by Renoir 's middle son , Jean , it is as vibrant and alive as if Renoir , himself , had just written the words in his own hand . Through this book we learn how the Renoir family left its roots in Limoges and moved to Paris . We read of Renoir 's early years as a painter of porcelain and how and why he became an artist , more specifically , an Impressionist . We learn of Renoir 's marriage to Aline Charigot of Essoyes , the birth of his three sons and his move to the south of France . Some of the most interesting sections of the book deal with Renoir 's feelings about the effect of light on a painting and why he needed to paint in a " natural " setting . Also , most interesting are the chapters on the birth of Impressionism and Renoir 's relationships with the other artists of the time , such as Monet , Manet , Sisley and Cezanne , just to name a few . Lovingly and charmingly written , this book truly brings Renoir to life and makes him accessible to all . Absolutely a must for anyone with even a passing interest in art or artists !
5 #### Not only is this a book about Renoir , whose tableaux peer out of every other art store on every mall in North America ( what a curious fate ! ) , it is also a book about Paris . Born in 1841 , Renoir was older than most of the other Impressionists with whom he grew friendly later . He also had the chance to see Paris as it was before the Commune and the war of 1870 . He lived a good part of his life on the Butte in Montmartre and it is hard now to recapture the atmosphere up there among the hordes of tourists . Yet early on Sunday mornings with a light rain playing on the umbrellas of the artist 's stands in the Place du Tertre , you can wander freely among the memories of the rue Lepic and elsewhere , and catch glimpses of Renoir ( and others ) as you pass through the old streets . Reading this book first will help . Jean Renoir is a very famous artist in his own right , having made numerous films and become one of the most acclaimed directors in French cinema history . Here he has taken great pains to paint a fine portrait of his renowned father , this time with a pen . He has succeeded admirably .
5 #### This book presents a very touching portrait of Auguste Renoir . The recollections of his son , Jean , are wonderful to read and bring the artist alive , both as a man and as an aritst . And if you read the book , you will see why " The Cork " preferred never to be referred to as an " artist , " a title he certainly deserves !
5 #### Renoir is n't dead . He lives in this book , and in the minds of everyone who reads it . Every artist , independent of medium , needs to read this .
5 #### This is a highly informative and nostalgic look at Pierre - Auguste Renoir . It is full of personal information about Renoir the man as well as Renoir the artist . I found the author , Jean Renoir , to be at all times accurate in his descriptions and portrayals . This book is a fascinating portrait of a man who became on of the world 's most loved artists .
5 #### This has been one of my favourite books since forever . I liked it when I was a kid because it had two quite revoltingly rude children as the heroes . The background of the garden and of how they both change as they come to understand what true affection and love is .
5 #### It is a story of a girl Mary who loses her family , a boy Colin who 's family has ignored him and an a commoner boy Dickon who is knows so much about nature . They come together and discover a secret garden . The book is good for kids and young adults too .
5 #### sweet classic about a young girl discovering the joys of friendship and nature .
5 #### I assume I should have read the book in my tween years . Did not know of the book.found it in ny library shop . I read on the plane in 3 hrs . It 's sweet , it 's fun , it 's full of hope . A positive experience- although the participants were crossed , spoiled and cranky , with tempers . The message is : positive attitude , friends who cheer you up and support your goals have to be treasured in this secret garden which I believe is an allegory of friendship and desire of improvement . In skills , in attitude , in empathy , in perceiving the world though a clear glass . Gave me joy .
5 #### I loved it ! I would recommend to all ! The author brilliantly demonstrates the magic of friendship , rebirth and positive thinking !
5 #### Love this book . Read this when I was 12 years old . Enjoyed it than as well as now .
5 #### When I first began A Little Princess , I put it aside , but when I picked it back up , I could not stop reading until the end . The story held so many meaningful passages that I left it a better person ! Delightful story with you love and others you despised !
5 #### This book is a classic beauty . I d read it years ago as a youngster and decided to buy it for myself after telling my sister all about the characters . Now , I find it even more beautiful than I was able to appreciate then . A Little Princess is about the power of imagination , friendship , hope . Believing in yourself and who you are , looking at the person inside and ignoring external trappings . Considering it was written during imperialism and at a time when social classes were still quite rigid , especially in England where the story is based , its impressive that this book manages to exude such humanism while portraying the authenticity of the society and the times . Readers will fall in love with Sara , Becky , Ram Dass , the Large Family , and all the other folks ( human and animal companions ! ) as they learn lessons about people and themselves . Its an entertaining , empowering , and inspiring read for all ages .
5 #### This unusual tale kept me glued to the read . Spoiled ( out of neglect ) children find one another folliwing the deaths of their parents . Together they discover a kind of " magic " , that transforms them . So sad that the author has long since passed on . I would have loved to have told her how thoroughly I enjoyed this book .
5 #### A delight for all ages . In a world where wholesome literature is hard to find , this book is a joy and not just for children .
5 #### Beautiful story . Wonderfully written . Uplifting . Classic . Suspenseful without being scary . Pure delight . Visually stimulating and imaginative . Redemptive without being preachy .
5 #### Excellent read ! Could put it down . The allegorical theme is magnificent and totally absorbing . Characters are lovable as well as acutely defined .
4 #### Cute story and I really liked it . It might be a childrens book , but I thought it was pretty good !
5 #### A wonderful example of the power and strength that comes from positive thinking , and the healing properties of Mother nature
4 #### Nice small book , it 's a gift for my niece and she can carry it in her purse
5 #### I loved it when I was forced to read it in 6th grade and I still love it 52 years later !
5 #### I enjoyed very much reading about all the children and the creatures . Mary , Dickinson , and Colin were quite unforgettable . Let the magic continue for all of us .
5 #### I was shocked at how much I liked this book / cd . The narrator is very good . What really stands out though is that every character in this book transforms into a better version of themselves . Its positive , uplifting and delightful . If you have children , this is a must . It was clearly written to teach kids ( and adults ) about the power of beliefs - positive beliefs , religious , self - improvement , believing in yourself , magic - the book encompasses all belief systems - to say - just believe in something positive and watch how it influences your life for the better .
5 #### I was hesitant to admit that me , as a boy , was in love with this book . It is a moving story of a girl trapped in the attic in the time period of Victorian England , a time period I was fascinated about as a child . It is all about imagination and its power to inspire and move you to overcome adversity with the power of Belief . Sentimentally but beautifully written nonetheless .
5 #### God has given me this Word for more than a year . It does nt cost to be kind - as Sara showed . I must have read this in my childhood - some parts I vividly remember and others not at all . It is about happiness and sadness through a childs eyes .
5 #### Sara Crewe is delightful in this novel . It is so difficult not to fall in love with her as she makes her journey through the ups and downs of being a little princess . This is a must - read for any age .
5 #### This book has a way of making one believe that perhaps all can be right with the world . One of my favorites that I originally read as a child and I revisit its pages every few years .
5 #### One of my favorite stories as a kid now grown up its still one of my favorites ! ! Recommend everyone to read this lovely story .
5 #### I 've read this several times , and am currently reading it aloud to my son . I love this book . It makes me wish for spring every time . The Magic of love , friendship , and God waking up the earth and hearts is beautiful .
5 #### A lovely story about a young girl and boy who both had a sad childhood . Then through their friendship with others sees the world as a beautiful place . Which lets them blossom with happiness and heals their troubles . The garden represents the importance of how loving and nurturing something will help one grow .
5 #### A wonderful story and even better since it was downloaded for free ! In this classic tale read about a group of children as they go through life adjustments , learn about themselves , and become better and smarter as they band together to restore what was once a secret garden . A wholesome and enjoyable read .
5 #### I read this book as a child and loved it . I read of again at 53 and cried with joy and the beauty of God 's magic . It is a beautiful timeless story that I love .
5 #### One hundred years ( plus ) later and this book holds up extremely well . I have never read it before and I 'm so glad I put it on my list to read this year . I love gardening and the joy and magic that is discussed about being outdoors and communing with nature resonated with me . It is a simple adventure but holds a greater and wider meaning on how to live a happy life . I would definitely recommend reading , especially in spring when one can watch the Earth bloom along side the secret garden .
5 #### Lovely story of unloved children finding their way to God 's love and happiness . Look for joy , expect joy , find joy .
5 #### I did n't read this book , when I was a child . Now that I 'm an adult , I am slowing reading the books that are considered Children 's Classics , that I did n't get around to reading when I was young . Quite a few of the books I 've read , are books that apparently need to be read , when you are young , to be able to enjoy them . This book , however , was a very enjoyable read , even now . I 'm glad I took the time to read this one .
5 #### This is a sweet and simple book to read . I would reccomend it for any girl . I read it over 2 days .
5 #### This is a really good book . PS . In the minecraft PE 1.3 , better known as the aquatic update , they are gon na add fish , a kind of fish called tropical fish , and dolphins(Yipee ! ) . Coral reefs and kelp forests are going to be new underwater biomes . A new weapon , the trident , is going to be added . The trident can be only used underwater or when it is raining . The sad thing is that their gon na remove CREEPERS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This is vey sad . But the worst thing about this is that I ca n't have ANY TNT to blow up the the nether or the end ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Word Cloud Classics and hope to keep adding to my collection . They are all the same height making them look wonderful on your bookshelf and the different colors are nice also . The Flexbinding is soft and pliant . Easier to hold than hardback . And not as heavy either . Everyone should try to read or re = read the classics . I am so enjoying them !
5 #### The Secret Garden is one of my favorite books of all time . It 's a quick read and a magical and heartwarming journey . I think that all children , girls and boys , should be encouraged to read it .
5 #### I loved that the child Sara was the soul of the writer . Her brilliant observations are timeless . Kindness is eternal .
5 #### Of course it 's perfectly wonderful , everyone knows that ! I just did n't learn it for myself until I was nearly 40 . My own loss . It 's easy to see why this is one of those books people read over and over . Such a sweet story . Good book to be enjoyed at any age .
5 #### If you are the parent of an elementary or preteen daughter , you 're probably wondering what to get her for the holidays . Perhaps , like I did and still do , she loves to read . Perhaps you want to introduce her to a book you loved as a kid , or perhaps you just want to give a unique and meaningful gift . For these or any other reasons , may I recommend The Secret Garden ? There are innumerable reasons it 's an enduring classic , and I think it should be on every family 's , teacher 's , and librarian 's shelf . You 're probably familiar with the story of Mary Lennox , a neglected , lonely , and horribly spoiled nineteenth century English girl sent to live in her uncle 's mysterious mansion . You know about the garden she brings back to life , and the way she changes the quality of life for her equally spoiled and imperious cousin Colin . These and other plot points provide great discussion fodder , especially for older readers . Younger readers can delve more into the mechanics of the story itself , what makes it different from the " easier " books they might be used to , etc . I definitely suggest reading this as a family and afterward , finding a great film version to compare and contrast . My personal recommendation is the 1975 BBC version , as it is extremely faithful to the book , but the most recent 1993 version is fabulous also . Happy reading !
5 #### The Secret garden is a good story that anybody will love and I love how Word Cloud designed the book with the color green , its simply beautiful
5 #### I loved the way the book was written . Lots of great descriptions of wonderful plants , gardens , and many other things . An easy read and a fun read . Awesome book . There is a wonderful story about hidden things and finding out their meanings . Great story !
5 #### A Must Read ! I read it about once a year it Is Outstanding ! !
1 #### I 'm trying to purchase " A Little Princess " with the illustrations by Tasha Tudor . However in the description for the listing , in the first paragraph it states the illustrator is Tasha Tudor , but the next paragraph says this is the abridged version illustrated by Barbara Mcclintock ! ! ! ( Side note , we 've borrowed that version from the library , and it 's lovely ) . Then I examined the reviews to find photos of various editions and of entirely different books ! Seems like many of the reviews are for " The Secret Garden " ! What gives Amazon ? ? ? I 'd love nothing more than to give you my money but I at least want the listing to be clear as to what on earth I 'm purchasing ! ! !
5 #### I am sorry Darlings ( mass send out for several authors ) . I got into a reading OCD mode , so I fell behind in writting reviews . I am in the process of correcting that & hope I get to all of the books soon .
1 #### Pretty bad quality paper . My wife was really disappointed .
5 #### I ordered this for my granddaughter and she loves the book !
5 #### I loved the whole story . I had seen the movie that was based on this book - The Little Princess starring Shirley Temple - but had never read the book . It is a must- read !
5 #### A lovely , heartwarming tale about children , optimism , love and forgiveness . I wanted it to continue , to watch the children grow up and see how they disseminate their love of life .
5 #### I enjoyed it as an adult male but I believe the elementary / junior high females love this book the most .
5 #### This one goes to the 12 - year - old when he finishes BIG RED ! ! ! !
4 #### This novel gives a wonderful , insider 's view of deafness and war . Once Jim goes off to WWI , some of the chapters are told from his perspective . At first , I was disappointed by this shift , but as the war ( and ultimately , the novel ) drags on , I wanted to know what was happening to Jim and the boys he was working with . Itani writes wonderful , three - dimensional portraits of Grania 's family , especially Mamo and Tress , Kenan , Fry , the various characters in Deserando , Jim ( Grania pronounces his name as Chim ) , Irish ( the name is ironic , considering that Grania is Irish ) and even the teachers at Grania 's deaf school . Though the novel drag on at moments , you will want to read it until the end .
5 #### This is my surprise book of the year . It was a gift , and I did n't quite know what to expect , but it 's turned into a real winner . Spanning the years from 1902 till the end of WWI , we follow the life of Grania , a child / woman who became deaf following scarlet fever . From a loving middle - class family , she went to a boarding school for hundreds and hundreds of deaf children , grew into a self - sufficient young woman , became a nurse , and married a hearing man , Jim . He went off to war , as did her childhood friend and brother - in - law , Kenan . Improbably for that Great War , both men returned - but in very different conditions . Divided into several parts , the early chapters are Grania 's education , learning to live as a deaf person in the world of the hearing . The next part is Jim 's story of his war experience . Then comes Grania 's ultimately successful efforts to return the power of speech to her mute and traumatized childhood friend . And finally the resolution of all the stories . This book grows on you . One of the boldest risks author Itani took was to try ( successfully ) to convey Grania 's silent world to readers , and to imitate the understanding of sign language as well as lip reading for those of us unfamiliar with the Deaf World . It 's a stunning and powerful book , showing the power of Story to convey love , union , and understanding - and ultimately , joy .
5 #### An amazing story told very well . Easy to understand , great for young readers .
4 #### I love the book . I think even more than the movie . Very different than the movie . A must read .
5 #### I am not really sure how I missed out on this book as a child so I decided to read it with my daughter . We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and zipped through it in just a few days . Frances Hodgson Burnett shares some amazing insights into human nature with the reader . My daughter exclaimed at one point , How can Mary see that Colin is spoiled but not see that she was the same at first too ? Led to some great discussions for sure ! I also thought it was amazing that Burnett at times switches between different third person limited perspectives and we even have some of the events in the garden narrated from the point of view of the robin ! Such clever writing ! Some reviewers complained about the fact that many of the characters speak with a Yorkshire accent and Frances Hodgson Burnett wrote it phonetically the way the characters pronounced the words . I thought it added to the fun ! I tried to speak with the broad Yorkshire accent as I read it out loud and changed my voice for the different characters . My daughter and I both loved it . The Yorkshire dialect was interesting and we have been trying to throw some of the words we learned into conversation such as wick meaning alive or lively . From my point of view , that beats trying to throw something modern like on fleek into conversation !
5 #### I read to my 8 years old daughter . She liked it . The book kept her attention . Well written . Then we watched the movie ...
5 #### Loved this book ! It is now one of my favorite books of all time and I read a lot ! Such depth ; of character , of plot , of place , of descriptions , of thoughts , of the era , of relationships , such depth of writing and storytelling !
4 #### Insight into a non hearing world . I liked the book . !
5 #### Excellent ! ! ! Wonderful story . Great historical fiction . Highly recommended ! ! ! I learned a lot about being deaf during the early 1900s as well as information about WW One ! Characters were fully developed and interesting . I really cared about what was happening to them during this trying time . I have just purchased another book by this author ! Another well - written historical fiction is The Partisan by William Jarvis . This outstanding book just won an Indie Medalian Award . Both books deserve an A+++++++
5 #### I am partially deaf and have taught deaf children , and I was impressed with the accuracy .
4 #### Itani writes a beautiful story of love , fear , guilt , and hope . Set during WW I , Deafening explores the world of the deaf , and the horrors of war . It also delves into the human heart with all of the complications of grief , guilt , fear .
4 #### I really enjoyed " The Deafening . " I read it after reading another book by Itani which I really enjoyed . Like most Americans I do n't know as much about Canada as I should . The novel grabbed my attention at the beginning and held it to the end . It also made me feel so lucky that I have my hearing . The scenes of the hardships of the men fighting WW1 were difficult to read , but that is war and I think it is something we all should think about .
5 #### Set in the early decades of the 20th century through World War I in Onatrio , Canada and France , Deafening is two stories - the coming of age of young Grania struck totally deaf by scarlet fever at the age of 5 , and what 's like living with deafness - the second story the experience of her husband Jim in World War II France where most do n't survive the battlefield , and what it 's like for Grania and the other families back home . A multilayered story filled with the harsh realities of the world of the deaf and the world of the battlefield , and the compassion , love and strength of the human spirit to overcome . Itani is a wonderful writer who gets inside each of these worlds and let the reader have his and her own experience . We become involved in the lives of her characters and we feel their joys and sorrows .
3 #### It is a wonderful story to tell , and I am sure it is loosely written on fact vs. fiction . But I found it dragged on and on and just lost interest until I finally I had to put it down , unfinished . I do n't do that very often .
5 #### It was fun to read the classic The Secret Garden .
5 #### Bought this book for my sister and she loved it ! ! Beautiful story it an amazing book , perfect quality !
5 #### There 's so much good stuff in this book that it has something different for each age , and yet the same simple themes . Gardening heals . Good thoughts heal . Truthful companions heal .
5 #### I read this when I was young and knew I thoroughly enjoyed it but forgot a lot of the details . It always stuck in my mind so 50 plus years later I decided to read it again . Totally enjoyed it once more ! It does n't read like it would be for small children ( although my granddaughters are fully engrossed in it at the moment as their father is reading it to them ) . The descriptions are so complete that you really can picture every detail . A great escape and lovely story for ALL ages !
3 #### I wanted to like this book , but I expected a lot , and found it a disappointment . The first half about Grania 's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective , even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling . As far as the second half , I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI , and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions . I did n't see how it added to the story at all , and at this point in the book I really wished I was n't reading it , but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened , and I felt that the ending was a let down . Mostly , I feel that this topic could have been really , really engrossing , new , and compelling , but the book 's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat . I wo n't recommend this book .
3 #### The title may be Deafening , but the book is anything but . It 's very quiet -- too quiet . As we try to inhabit the life and mind of Grania , deaf since the age of five from scarlet fever , we imagine what it would be like not to know when someone is approaching from behind , or to know when the speaker has changed in a conversation . This book was just too slow - paced for me and the characters too one - dimensional . Grania and her hearing husband Jim seem to be without fault . More complex is Grania 's sister Tress , who struggles with her emotions when her husband comes back from WWI disfigured and dysfunctional . Another interesting character is their mother , who postpones sending Grania to a school for the deaf as long as possible , while she battles her guilt over Grania 's hearing loss and seeks a cure via specialists and spiritual quests . However , the author does n't fully explore the inner conflicts of Tress or her mother , and we are left with a love story between two very nice people . Jim 's story is more disturbing than Grania 's , actually , as he becomes a stretcher bearer during the war and sees both friends and patients blown up inches away from him on a regular basis . His sections of the book are very moving reminders that the lives lost in wars are not just statistics . The most moving and ironic incident is Jim 's wordless interaction with a German counterpart as they both struggle to rescue their wounded on the battlefield .
4 #### good book club . lots of similar experiences between blind wife and soldier husband .
5 #### It is only March and I have already voted this book for my Book of the Year Award , which I normally select toward the end of the year . This book was beautifully written . You could see the human emotions coming through the characters and it made me want to keep turning the pages to see what was going to happen . You feel both sorrow and joy in the characters . Frances Itani knows the human heart and displays it so well on paper . Great job ! I am going to make this book a part of my permanent library .
5 #### A beautiful book . So wonderfully written that savoring the words was a joy , never mind the sensitive yet powerful story . Though the topics -- deafness , World War One -- suggest a very grim work , it ends up being a powerful affirmation of life . This book deserves to be much more widely known than it is ; it 's an excellent example of how even good books deserve ample promotion , as I think that it 's a lot better than some major recent best - sellers . I was pleased to see in a bookstore recently that it 's won an award .
4 #### Deafening is one of the best books I 've read in a while , but sometimes it falls into ambiguosity . The changing verb tenses and constant reminders that the main character is deaf are wonderfully placed to put you in Grania 's mindset , but I would n't recommend this book to someone who has never read a book from this genre before .
5 #### Have heard of this for so long , the movie showed up on Netflix about the same time as the book was offered . Both were very good . Showed the movie to my 6yr old Granddaughter , and she loved it . This is a keeper , for sure .
5 #### What a treasure lives in this book ! It is the total power of positive thinking that an individual will be exactly what they think themselves to be . A young orphaned girl , sour on the world and a young boy forgotten by his father ( who believes him to be disabled and slow ) experience an awakening of life and spirit .
5 #### nice cheery , light hearted easy read . serious readers need to read this kind of books after a stretch of long long novels . Loved it .
5 #### Frances Hodgson Burnett 's stories draw the reader in . They are well written , insightful , entertaining , and mesmerizing . In " The Little Princess " , Sara has had her life turned upside down , but wo n't let the circumstances take control . She remains the " Little Princess . " She is a strong willed child that wo n't crumble under the thumbs of certain hardhearted , dominearing , unpleasant people . She is loving , caring , and supportive to her fellow students , as well as other characters . I truly love both " THE LITTLE PRINCESS " and " THE SECRET GARDEN " . If you have not read them do yourself a favor and take the time to do so . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### I have loved this story for a very long time . I have only ever seen it in movie form though because I did not , until recently have the opportunity to read it . Now that I have read it I am so sorry it took this long to get my hands on it . This book is entertaining , well written , and you ca n't help but fall in love with it 's characters . I am sorry I am at the end of it . I recommend this book to all who have a love for a heartwarming tale of two children overcoming their wretched lives with the help of the neighbor boy and his family and an abandoned and secret garden
4 #### Still entertains me , maybe just not as much as when I was a little girl . The book teaches about opening up your mind to good thoughts and how they can transform you , as well as to not be so self - involved . It also lures a young reader into spending more time out of doors , instead of cooped up inside . Should be on a must - read list for upper grade - school aged children .
5 #### One of the beloved classics . Bought it as a gift for my granddaughter . Hope she enjoys it as much as her grandmother and mother did at her age .
5 #### This classic is a clear statement about the power of determination and the power of positive thinking . With a little help from those around you and the banishment of the dark thoughts that may plague you , you can grow and learn and become stronger in character and body .
5 #### The Story was fastinatig , from India to a huve manor in England . It spanned a magical tale of an young orphan girl whose whole household died with the plague . She was a spoiled child , but resilient . She changes lives around . Great magical tale which will keep you reading on and on . Well written book . A MUST READ .
4 #### Well - done reprint of the original novel , which I read as a little girl many years ago . It 's a great story !
5 #### I was so thrilled to read Secret Garden again . This was a little different version at the end but still loved it . This was my favorite book as a kid . When I taught Second Grade I ordered multi copies and we read the book together . What fun ! ! !
5 #### I ca n't believe I 've lived so long without reading this delightful story ! I 'm going to buy the book for my goddaughter at once !
5 #### The story was put together nicely and could n't put it down until I finished reading . I was glued to it and would recommend to others . Great Book
5 #### I was searching for a " feel good " book and I am so glad I found this ; The Secret Garden will lead you to a beautiful place . As I was reading , I was amazed that this book was intended for children , as there are so many healthy life lessons for Grown Ups . I definitely recommend reading this precious book , you will find yourself smiling .
5 #### A delightful story do n't know how I missed this in my younger years . Should be required reading for aspiring writers .
5 #### I have looked at title and discounted this story dozens of times as just a children 's story . I am so glad I finally decided to have a look What a joy . It is indeed a story of children but not just for children . It carries a message every child and every adult should learn .
5 #### I have n't read this in years and forgot what a wonderful story it is !
4 #### A magical , mesmerizing allegory of a book , though one with overlong sentences . A story of human transformation , a story of unbridled reverie for nature , a book that shows love makes one happier than money .
5 #### This was a touching story , wonderful book and hard to put down . From start to end the story will make you want to read more by this author . Five stars was n't enough !
4 #### I read this as the leader for a group of Middle / High School students who wanted to read classics during the spring / summer . I enjoyed the strong female characters and the entire story . We were able to have a great discussion about comparing lifestyles and classes . This was a fun read and I was glad this was on our classics list .
5 #### Really enjoyed reading this old time favorite ! Highly recommend everyone read it just to relieve the time and writing style of that time .
5 #### Lovely story ! I am listening to the audio book with my six year old daughter . Although there is some vocabulary beyond her understanding , she is following and enjoying the story as well . The content , I feel , is appropriate for elementary age and up . The main character shows virtue and self control in the face of adversity . The narration is well done .
5 #### Wonderful story for preteen girls and maybe boys . As an adult , I could still appreciate it and really liked it . A truly enjoyable classic .
5 #### This book is very well written and suspenseful . The characters are delightful and The story moves at a very quick pace
5 #### Loved it . There 's a reason it 's considered a classic
5 #### A delightful story of youth and earth magic . Amazing how human perception can be so misfired . Good read and entertaining .
5 #### It is amazing and hooks you with its special Yorkshire parts ! If you like god books , then this is for you
2 #### The first third of this book is a bit of a bore , as the heroine 's only real character trait is that she is nicer and smarter and with a better relationship to her father than all the other girls at her boarding school . And since she 's also the richest of them , it 's hard not to see this characterization as a defense of classism and the inherent superiority of the wealthy . Sara becomes a little more compelling once she loses her family fortune and the narrative shifts into a Cinderella story , but she is still perpetually cast as a better person than those who are poor by birth ( and who are regularly described in patronizing and animalistic terms by both Sara and the text ) . In the end she becomes rich again , her fellow maid gets the reward of being Sara 's servant now , and there 's not really any evidence that the child has learned or gained anything from the experience .
5 #### This book holds timeless truths cloaked in a story of three children , each from different backgrounds . These children grow and change as they experience the peace of nature and love of one another . Descriptions of the Secret Garden are written so that I can imagine myself in the peace and beauty of the garden .
5 #### Fast shipping and good condition of the book , means happy customer is here ! Thank you !
4 #### Lovely and sweet story about children conquering adverse circumstances . A little too - good - to - be - true . But lovely story . Delightful characters and happy ending .
5 #### Out of tragedy can come bitterness and desolation , but herein lies a sweeter , softer tale of magic . All is dark and gray , but nothing lasts forever .
5 #### Book arrived safely before predicted time and in excellent condition . Author is very concise , and this book contains much data to make a forthcoming Bible study for my Sunday school class interesting and informative .
5 #### This is another wonderful book by Clarence Larkin . It was a gift for my husband since this is one of his favorite authors . He said it was an interesting and informative book .
5 #### This was the 1st book by Larkin that I read and I am glad I did .. To anyone trying to understand Revelations or anyone wanting to further their knowledge , read this book . Its an easy read for the beginner and deep enough for the scholar .. I chose this book according to the reviews and would like to thank those that did a review .. Your help was the help I needed .
5 #### Great book . One of the classics by Clarence Larkin . In my studies over ther years - I felt that Revelation is a very difficult book to understand . This book helps- excellent material .
5 #### Grand daughter read it well . Good story . Good price .
5 #### It took decades for me to finally read this but what a sweet book about the power of the mind , and nature , in overcoming loss and depression .
5 #### I loved this book . I chose the five star review because this book was the kind of book that I would want to read over and over . I hope that there a second book in the series . it would be a really good idea to consider . Hope that many other readers will be able to enjoy this book as much as I did . Five star rating is a very hard rating to get an I feel this book deserve it .
5 #### It 's a classic for a reason - Slice of life , Different cultures , Family relationships ...
5 #### Great book . Enjoyed it very much . No sex , dirty words , smut . Good for any age . And you learn something from reading it .
5 #### Even though my childhood was entirely different than that of Sara Crew , i was with her all the way as the author took me into her life in such a detailed account that I was cold when she was freezing in that attic room and my feet felt wet as she trudged along London 's wet streets and although I ca nt ' imagine having a rat for a friend she almost made me believe it possible and what joy I felt when she was finally liberated from her awful caretaker . For a while immersed in the story I was also a child again and what more can you ask from a book ?
5 #### It 's a sweet classic that deserves a read every so often . It would be a good book to read with elementary age children and to discuss how brats are made , how entertainment for children has changed , how parents make mistakes .
5 #### After watching the movie countless times with my mom and daughters , my youngest daughter gave me the book for Christmas and I love it so ! I can only hope to persevere through hardships as Sarah does . She deals with grief and loss , poverty and starvation , mistreatment and more with hope , dignity and grace . By using her imagination , weaving her fantastical stories that leave her friends craving more , and always behaving and responding to people as though she is royalty , she overcomes tragedy and abuse by others . Her faith and kindness are rewarded in miraculous ways ! I will re - read this many times .
5 #### I sent this for a birthday gift and the little girl loved it . Her mother said it was absolutely beautiful and that it was read in about three days .
5 #### You can never be sure what you will think when you go back and read childhood favorites . This book did n't disappoint . I loved the overall message that positive thinking and kindness contain magic .
5 #### Well written classic story ! Should lead to a fun discussion at our book club ! Think it would be an excellent early novel for youth !
5 #### Excellent book . I read as a child and now I purchased for my granddaughter to read . She is in middle of book and ca n't put it down . I 'm so happy she loves it . Paperback book is good size for holding with average size print -- not so small it 's too difficult to read .
5 #### GREAT READING FOR PRETEEN AND TEEN GIRLS . A TRUECLASSIC
5 #### a clear and consice understanding of the second coming of Christ and a simple guide to seeing the events in order of their happing .
5 #### Written in the early 20th century ( 1915 ) , this book is very relevant today . Dr. Larkin was able , through the leadership of the Holy Spirit , to interpret very complicated prophecy and explain it for simple minds to understand .
5 #### In my opinion , this is one of the best books ever written and every girl should read it . Boys should read it , too , but I do n't think it would hold the interest of many young boys . And as far as I am concerned , this is the best version of the book available . I have been searching for years for a new ( or seemingly new , anyway ) copy of this version to give to a young girl in my life and I am thrilled to have finally found it . I wish this could be given to every little girl !
5 #### Great book to read that keeps your interest . Highly recommend for a great classic .
5 #### The audio book read by Virginia Leashman is superb !
4 #### A little dated but a must read for every child . Book teaches that live is not all about you and that people are just people .
5 #### One of my favorite childhood stories . So nice to revisit .
5 #### Be prepared to think . I am looking at some things differently now . I am not a person who changes opinions based on the most recent book I have read . I do challenge myself to grow and to take a fresh look at how others interpret Revelation . I will definitely be searching the scriptures with my eyes open to what Clarence Larkin has said . Even if I disagree , he has made me take another look , and I have still learned .
4 #### I appreciate the insight and explanation . This book is a companion to my Bible and two other Revelation teachings from other authors . I 'm gaining a more in depth understanding of a sometimes difficult to grasp book . So glad I purchased Larkin 's book .
5 #### Dr. Larkin has been very thorough in his treatment of this subject ( as always ) . Even where we disagree , I learn from his insights . Some of his foresights testify to his thoroughness and his spiritual insight . For a book originally published in 1929 , his statements of what will transpire at the end time are amazingly accurate descriptions of current events in the Middle East . I originally read this book about 50 years ago , and decided it was worth another reading . I was right .
5 #### This book by Clarence Larkin was given as a gift , and I understand that the person who received it is very pleased with the teaching as it is presented clearly and precisely . It arrived when promised , and I am very pleased with the condition and the packaging .
5 #### This is a charming old style story that I enjoyed reading .
5 #### I am glad I read this wonderful book even if I 'm old ( 70 ) and it 's been around und so long . Better late as they say and I truly like bed each step of the way . How wonderful a writer she ..... very !
5 #### A Wonderful story , and a must read for any young reader ! This has been one of my favorite stories since I was young .
5 #### Grear book . A must for all . And get the dvd or video too . A long time favorite of mine Great service delivery
4 #### The first time I encountered this book was in fourth grade , I was reading an illustrated version and after a few pages I stopped and did not pick it back up . But as it has been quite a few years I decided to give it a second try , this time I was in love with it . The magic of the garden and childhood are created through the simple language and beautiful flowers . The story starts off with Mary , a spoiled brat , who after her parents die is sent to Yorkshire to live with her mysterious uncle . Mary never knew what it was to be a child until she came to her uncle 's manor . Once at the manor she is able to rediscover herself and the beauty of nature . As someone going to college next year , I found it refreshing to watch the rebirth of childhood and find that it is not just limited to children .
5 #### My second time reading The Secret Garden . Love that these children find life coming back into their hopeless lives ! I 'll read it again and again !
4 #### This book is the real , deal ! The hardback is well worth the difference in price . Not for casual reading , study involved . Understandable with alittle effort , and the believer is rewarded with a Crown . Just do it and the Lord will richly bless You .
5 #### Have n't really got to the content of it yet . However , I love this big size book , cover , and the wide margins . Highlighter ready !
4 #### A must read . One book of the bible that 's a mastery is Revelation and this book my be of great help . Pick it up and see what I mean .
5 #### Clarence Larkin has a great way of communicating " hard " to understand passages . I have a friend who recommended him this spring .
5 #### This was favorite of mine since I was a child . Whoever converted it to digital should be ashamed of themselves . Simple spell check would have caught most of the errors . There are run together words on virtually every page ! Please correct !
3 #### Interesting as a historical artifact . Really preachy children 's novel that beats the same points endlessly . Entertaining for its historical significance more than anything . I came to understand why adults , back in the " 60s , were always pushing kids to play outside and " get some fresh air . "
5 #### Sweet , innocent and a delightful escape back to a different world .
4 #### I just recently started studing this book . I have enjoyed what I have read so far , but I have too many other books going to really get the full benefit out of it .
5 #### All of Clarence Larkin 's books are enlightening and can be related to in this century . Every Christian should have this book .
5 #### THANK YOU FOR BEING SO PROMPT IN SENDING MY BOOK . MY PASTOR IS ALWAYS GIVING US SOMETHING TO LOOK UP AND WITH MY BOOKS I AM ALWAYS READY TO SEARCH OUT THE ANSWERS . THANK YOU FOR MY BOOKS ALWAYS BEING IN GREAT SHAPE AND NICE AND CLEAN AND NO TORN PAGES OR THE BOOKS ALL MARKED UP .
5 #### I now know who the Anti Christ is . He perfectly fits what the scriptures have to say about him . It is to complicated to explain there , but he stands ready right now to assume his role , which tells me the rapture is imminent . When I saw that my heart skipped a beat . GET READY ! ! ! !
5 #### great book . clarence larkin does a great job with this book in explaining revelations and makes it easy to understand
5 #### This is a wonderful book to study with The Greatest Book on Dispensational Truth in the World by Clarence Larkin .
5 #### I referred to this book a lot when I was teaching on the Book of Revelation . I would highly recommend this book if you want to study the end times . Very interesting and helpful .
1 #### How people can make these types of mistakes is beyond me . There appears to have been no editor or proofreading before putting this up for sale and apparently no quailty control measures on Amazon 's part . The problems : 1 . 4,500 locations or 450 pages are missing . This ebook is 500 locations or 50 pages . 2 . The reviews posted on the " Kindle Store " were clearly for the hard copy version 3 . This " book " give a page or two " outline " of a topic . Example- there is no information detailing the seven churches like in the hard copy version just a 2 page turn " outline " saying the Book of Revelations speaks about seven churches . 4 . Complete information is just missing . The table of content looks consistent with the hard copy version yet once you spend $ 3.99 to buy it and click on a TOC link subtiles are not there . 5 . This ebook is just a very brief overview of what is in the Book of Revelations and what is in Larkin 's actual book . I will be getting a refund from Amazon .
5 #### A Magical story about the beauty of nature and the human spirit . Let your mind imagine the grandeur of the setting , and the characters will lead you to the garden .
5 #### What a great book ! I read it as a child , read it to my daughter , and then we re - read it together every few years until she grew up and moved away ! Orphaned , cranky Mary Lennox is sent to live in a dreary English estate and is basically left on her own except for interaction with a few servants . Boredom leads to jump rope outside which causes Mary to eat better , feel better and look better . Boredom also leads her to investigate the old mansion and the mystery of a locked garden . Such great characters throughout this wonderful story of friendship , kindness , and renewal of body and spirit . Highly , highly recommended as a read aloud with 2nd-4th graders due to dialect and higher level vocabulary throughout . Readers 5th and up should be able to read it on their own , but it 's so much better when read with someone . ( Investigate which version you buy as some do not have any illustrations at all ; others have a few full page illustrations and some little sketches at the start of each chapter . )
5 #### Great book ! Good character development . I could see and smell the garden myself . Like this author a lot . Easy read .
4 #### So I wanted to read my 6 year old some classics . I had never read this one myself so let me warn you : The little girl is a victim of some seriously horrific parenting . The racism is atrocious . ( Obviously written in a different era ) Both parents and most of the household die in the first chapter . This may be difficult for some children . My son has first hand experience with death in our family , so he probably understood the horror of what happened better than another child might . There is a bit of a language barrier so we had to modify a bit because not all of the words have the same meaning as today . ( Queer ) In the end , I read more of this than my son listened to , but neither of us finished it . I think we will eventually , and it is fascinating , just know it will need some serious side discussions you may or may not be ready to have if you are reading it to a young child . Personally , I d leave this until a bit older .
5 #### Brought back so many good memories - and got another for my granddaughter !
4 #### You do n't have to be born to nobility to act nobly . The story of a little girl with a very " grown up " approach to life has lessons for everyone about the importance of treating everyone with respect and acting with humility .
5 #### Not this past weekend , but the previous weekend , I watched the move The Secret Garden and thought it was OK , then read that book , which was much better . I had always love ALP , but had the ending mixed up with the original , which , why bother to change it ? I listened to the Librivox version and fell in love again . Sara Crewe is awesome . Yes , it helps that she a lot of money , but even when things are BAD , she can pretend and still be a friend to Becky and a few of her nicer friends . And she is a good person when it is definitely easier not to be . The ending warms your heart - if it does n't , you do n't have one .
5 #### No excess Mumbo jumbo . Adhered to her original publication . Nice sized and font and spacing . And f course . Wonderful story . It 's my favorite of all time . Glad I chose this copy .
5 #### Beautifully illustrated and was a treasure for my fifth grade students !
5 #### The book was given to my son and his wife for my granddaughter to be , the book its self was beautiful . i already know the story and love it , one of my favorites . I ca nt wait to share with my granddaughter
5 #### I love this book so much . I read it as a child but could not remember how it ended . I still love it .
5 #### My favorite feel wonderful book of all time . I love the story . I can smell the damp spring earth in the garden and I delight in the love of growing things . It is a story of hope . It is a story of how the human spirit searches for something to help it thrive and when it is found how it drinks it up and devours it fully , richly and completely . Everyone should read this book , children and adults alike . It will make your soul smile . You will want to read it over again many times throughout your life .
5 #### Love it . Would have loved to be in the Garden with the kids and share this joy with them .... great read
5 #### I fell in love with this book when I first read it as a girl , and it still speaks to me now that I 'm middle - aged . The characters are vividly drawn , and the descriptions of gardens and gardening are delightful . Highly recommended .
5 #### I made a commitment to myself to read the classics and I am ever so glad this was the first . I feel I received some of the magic the children did and learned the lessons they absorbed .
5 #### I enjoyed the book and then watched the movie which was pretty good also .
5 #### This is an enchanting story , with vibrant characters and beautiful imagery . Highly recommended for its wisdom and positivity . Consider it as a gift for the young at heart or for anyone who needs healing of body and spirit . Loved it !
1 #### This is a badly abridged version of the classic The Secret Garden , completely lacking the charm and eloquence of the original by Frances Hodgson Burnett . Instead it is a retelling of the story by someone named Malvina Vogel . The cover of the book is misleading as it does not mention Vogel 's name nor does it mention that it is abridged . That information is on the back cover , which I did n't see since I ordered it online ( from another retailer ) . I thought it was an illustrated version of the original story . Skip this .
5 #### An amazingly profound and insightful book . Great characters , enjoyable atmosphere . The philosophy and psychology are quite impressive . Loved the attitude toward Nature . Beneficial read !
5 #### A feel good book for adults as well as children .
5 #### At first when I started reading it I felt as if author is attacking poor little girl who is not at fault for how she was raised , and I felt sorry and sad for her . But the book turned tables on me very soon , and I did n't have to be sorry any more . :-) I thoroughly enjoyed this classics , and I 'm 31 and usually into sci fi . I highly recommend it for kids and for adults !
5 #### My 8 year old granddaughter and I read it together . She absolutely loved it !
5 #### This book is lovely . Sara Crewe is a young heroine that will steal your heart . Even if you have seen the Shirley Temple movie , read the book . It is so much better !
2 #### While this is a good book , it was n't good for my son . It was required reading for a class my 13 y / o son was taking . The girls loved it . The boys hated it .
5 #### A wonderful book for young and old to read . A classic in fact I read it for the first time and bought one for a little girl in the neighborhood .
5 #### I loved it . Recommended for all ages . I read it after seeing the play . Keeps you wanting to read . It is hard to put down .
5 #### It 's a classic for a reason . It 's a life affirming book for all ages and worth pulling off the shelf again and again , especially when life gets cranky .
4 #### I opened the book thinking oh well . I expected nothing . Could not put is down . Even an adult can enjoy .
5 #### I read this when I was 12 over and over . I am 67 now and had to read it again . I enjoyed it just as much as I did back then . Wish I could tell this to the author . I would love to write her a fan letter .
5 #### Loved it ! This story was absolutely riveting . All the elements of a great story between the two covers of this book . The ending could not have been better . The narrator was delightful to listen to . It was so heartwarming to see the characters in the story grow and mature , develop character of their own while they shape the hearts and spirits of those around them .
5 #### Brilliant and magical . Really enjoyed this lovely story . A great insight into human nature and the mind of a child .
5 #### Great book , my daughter read it in one night .
5 #### This copy is beautiful ! It came still in plastic so perfect condition .
4 #### A classic book , I read this the first time in school , and then read it again as an adult . Solid writing , if reasonably simple , and a good story .
4 #### I never read this as a child , and I think I 'm glad . Reading it now , as an over-60 , garden - loving mom with lots of life experience , I think I appreciate it a lot more , although I would have loved the mystery as a kid . Now I can appreciate the serious racism , the sad child(ren ) neglect , the rather pagan awakening to nature ( clothed as " Magic " ) , and the joyous , if obvious , ending . I believe the writing was very good for its time , and had no problem with the Yorkshire dialect . Mary and Colin and Dickon all struck me as very believable characters , and the changes wrought in Mary and Colin were overall pretty credible , although they happened a bit too quickly . I had more of a problem with Archibald 's rejection of his son for ten whole years . Dwelt just a bit much on the beauty and changeableness of the moors . Well worth reading .
5 #### Enjoyed it just as much as when I was a chikd . A true classic
1 #### The format of this book is very odd for the demographic -- very tiny print . Not worth the hassle to return but I wo n't be buying anymore childrens books from Amazon .
4 #### I enjoyed the book , somewhat predictable but a nice story .
5 #### Stunning edition of a wonderful classic . I was a little turned off by the price initially , but it 's well worth it for the quality . The illustrations inside our lovely and the paper is high - quality .
5 #### Funny , interesting , and amazing in many ways . I was moved on the tragedy and noglastia that this ebook gave me . Bye Bye Cinderella , Hello the little princess . R U ready ?
5 #### I just finished listening to A Little Princess on Audible , and it was a fantastic story , far better than The Secret Garden , in my opinion . I 'm only sorry I did n't discover it when I was a young girl , but it 's one of those well - written , timeless pieces that appeals no matter the age of the reader . There 's just the right balance of warm fuzziness and conflict , and the characters were well - developed . I also liked that Ms. Burnett provided closure and a nicely done ending ( I hate the abrupt ones that leave you disappointed and wondering ) . I must add that Virginia Leishman did a superb job narrating the story .
1 #### The Secret Garden is a classic . Great story ultimately about redemption . Burnett writes beautifully . Unfortunately the book referred was poor technically being miniature ( 3"x5 ' approx . ) with print size consistent with the book dimension . Very disappointing presentation . This is a book that my children read and a movie they watched . This time it was my grandson ( 14 ) and a school reading project . I purchased a full sized copy at a local bookstore with normal print . As he got into it he agreed that it was worthwhile story about the need for love and caring in our lives . IN SUMMARY , I highly recommend the story and the lessons to be learned from it BUT this particular small print version was a waste of money . Do n't buy . Go to a bookstore and treat yourself to a classic .
5 #### This book was very suspenseful , had a cheerful ending , and was well written . It kept you guessing until the end .
5 #### This is not for just children ... I'm in my late 60s and I loved it !
1 #### Very disappointed . The description emphasized the quality illustrations , but the only one is the cover . I bought this because it is one of my favorite stories , and I wanted to share it with my five year old daughter .
5 #### I enjoy reading stories about children and stories about the past and this book put them both together . Very well written with no grammatical errors and quite entertaining .
5 #### I love this classic book ! and love the movie too ! My daughter is now 10yrs old and has the read the book and loves it now too , I am so happy that I 'm able to share this magical story with her . I think its a book for girls and boys of all ages and would be interesting to kids and adults alike . I love that it has a good ending too !
5 #### Love this book . I read it years ago and then listened to the recording . I just bought it for my daughter and she loved it also . I ca n't recommend it highly enough . What an adventure .
5 #### The story of these researchers in the Kalahari is amazing and true ! Incredible , the things they endure , all for their love of the animals , and their research into them is very valuable . Interestingly written ; even though this is essentially a scientific work , it is not dry , but a wonderful story of how Man interacts with the Wild Side . I loved the hornbills in Camp , and , when I was just in Botswana , experienced for myself their mischievousness and wit . I learned a lot from this book , which I was constantly telling people about !
4 #### I 'm really enjoying this book but the scanning came up with errors that nobody fixed . " Mark " becomes " Marie " and there are " scent maries " ; they told " yarn after yam " , " AH " instead of " all " and so forth . This slows down my enjoyment of the book .
4 #### It was exciting , but maybe a little more factual than a great story . I read it before and while I was traveling to Africa to a game reserve , so it was definitely timely .
5 #### Its easy to see why Cry of the Kalahari was a bestseller . It reads like an old - fashioned melodrama from the 1930s - as if Mark and Delia Owens were channeling Edgar Rice Burroughs . Delia is trapped in a flimsy little tent by two huge lions ! Jeepers ! Delia and Mark are deep in the Kalahari desert without any water ! Oh no ! A raging wildfire is headed straight for their research camp ! Good grief ! Will our intrepid duo survive these perils ? Not to mention black mambas , surly rebels , and a diet of mealie - meal ? Tune in next week , or in this case , keep turning the pages for another thrilling chapter ! Seriously though , as a retired scientist ( who worked in a nice climate - controlled laboratory ) , I have tremendous admiration for what the Owens did in Botswana . Their dedication , perseverance , and attention to detail epitomize what field work is about . COTK is not an account of their research findings , but a personal account of what it was like out there . There is good science here . Their discovery that brown hyenas breed communally was a fascinating achievement . As well , the Owens comparison of lion behavior in the Kalahari with that observed by Schaller in the Serengeti was very important . To have a comprehensive picture of a keystone predator like lions , we must know how they adapt to very different environments . Well done , Mark and Delia .
4 #### This book was published 32 years ago , and many of the observations , research , and conservation recommendations in this book still obtain today , albeit with some major caveats . Through the emphases in their misadventures in the Kalahari , the authors give rather short shrift to what many of us would have wished to know about predator species . But , through inspiring and sometimes poetic prose , they manage to thoroughly engage the reader from the beginning to end of their dangerous adventure .
5 #### Read this book for the first time , enjoyed it very much .
5 #### this was a gift to my daughter , so I have no idea how the book is .
5 #### This book has stuck with me my entire life . Reading it again now , as an adult felt like returning to old friends . A must read for every generation .
5 #### A fantastic tale for adults and children alike . A very enjoyable read which is both simple and profound all at the same time .
5 #### Such an uplifting story of life and hope . . It makes you look at every day things in a new way Even better the second time around
4 #### I have seen the movie many times and now know how much literally license the movie - makers can take !
5 #### I have always loved this story ! It brings such joy to me when I read it . I believe this is a book everyone could benefit from reading . Especially young ones . I particularly enjoy how the story shows you that just because you start out with one way of thinking does n't mean you never are allowed to change when you find a better way . Mary and Colin both start in circumstances that seem beyond their control . However , when they see a better way instead off doing as they have always done they choose to change . In the end not only are they better but all who know them are changed for the better as well . This story is always a good choice .
5 #### This is an easy to use version of the age old classic . More fun every time I teach the class !
5 #### Even though the Owens ' studies in the Kalahari ended in 1980 , this book remains a classic of African conservation . Beautifully written , it inspired us to go to Botswana to see and hear and smell for ourselves this truly incredible place . The book is eloquent testimony to the necessity to preserve wild places .
5 #### This is an extraordinary book . I could not abandon it just as Mark and Delia could not abandon their cause no matter the difficulties . I am accustomed to reading murder mysteries and historical novels but this book had everything with the added bonus that it really happened . I feel so much more attuned to desert animal behavior and have come to appreciate hyenas as much as lions . I am leaving for Botswana soon and hope to see what if any impact they had on the plight of these wild animals .
5 #### So exciting . I felt like I was there with the author , and learned a lot too . Well written .
1 #### I thought the book was poorly written . There were many typos that should have been edited .
5 #### Although the secret garden is a classic I had never read it until now . My favorite part was when Mary found the key to the garden . The garden becomes the centerpoint for all the children 's lives . The garden changes them for the better .
5 #### I was very pleased with the book My Secret Garden thank you
5 #### I have adored this book since I was a child and it holds a special place in my heart . It filled with hope and laughter and the bright , fun things in life . It makes you feel as if you were a child again yourself .
5 #### Loved it . Beautifully written on what is obviously one of the inhospitable places on the earth . Very interesting story on topics we would never see on the evening news . Buy it ! It 's good !
5 #### From laughter to shock to tears , this book will make you want to go on safari and then to contribute to the conservation of the remaining African wildernesses .
5 #### after living in Botswana as a Peace Corps volunteer , I loved the book and wish I was back there ... and that the book would never end
5 #### An incredible story of dedication and risk for the love of your dreams . Before GPS , cell phones and so much other high tech gadgetry , these two science and animal lovers roughed it to find their destination and task into the wild . Much information was derived from their efforts , as they monitored and recorded the behaviors of these majestic predators and the fragile habitat they reside . I was astonished to learn of many behaviors that were contrary to one had known at the time . These wildlife biologists are the ilk that had went out to save the wild lands , and hopefully their efforts have .
5 #### Wonderful book . Well written with lots of details . They worked awfully hard for their PhDs and I ca n't believe the risks they took ! The wildlife situation in Africa make you want to cry , but it is truly necessary to understand both the life cycle of the animals and man 's impact on it . Well worth reading .
3 #### Fascinated by the study of the social systems of brown hyenas and lions ? I am . The authors are brave and bold . They scorn financial risks as well as safety measures when they 're around lions . No sparing of the harshness and violence that goes with surviving in a sometimes terribly harsh environment . But this couple leave me cold . Over seven years they get to know and name the animals they 're studying . But when one of these creatures die , not so much as a shrug ? Any introspection is limited to money needs , food , camp matters . It practically cries out for comedy relief or reflection ; not just chronological narrative . A few points docked for lengthiness . Something that essentially looks at lions and hyenas living in a desert need not go over 500 pages . They could have skipped the uninteresting trips back to town .
4 #### Wonderful , informative story that raises awareness of the poaching problem and the dedicated people trying to solve it .
5 #### Enjoyed this wonderful classic as much at age 55 as I did at 12 ! I 'm sure I will enjoy it again in the years to come .
5 #### The Secret Garden is one of the only classics that I actually like reading , and I read it every year . And I 'm a teenager ! There is lot of beautiful description , but not so much that it ruins the book . Also , the Yorkshire dilect can be a bit confusing at first , but it will get easier . Would recommend for sure !
5 #### I thought this was an excellent audio rendering of a classic book . In my opinion , the narration was delightful !
5 #### This book is beautiful , emotional , inspiring . I want everyone I know to read this classic book . It has made me want to be a better person , and it 's enjoyable fiction , not the boring self - help category !
5 #### This was my favorite book when I was younger . A teacher , gave it to me as a gift . I was not big on reading when I was very small and my parents never thought I would actually get big into reading . This was one of the books that inspired me to read more . It 's a perfect book for little girls who are just beginning to read and find joy in it . Whether you 're reading it to them or they are reading on their own it is a great book and very inspirational . Remember all little girls are princesses .
1 #### This is the second time I 've tried to buy a suitable copy of this book for my niece . The first one was too tiny . This one is wholly unacceptable on an aesthetic level , if you want your young recipient to appreciate the experience of reading a quality book . Purchasing from Amazon can be confusing at times . There are many different versions of this booksellers crammed into one listing , the descriptions of which is which are extremely confusing , as they substitute covers , one for the other . As for this particular purchase , it is a very unsatisfactory edition , poorly laid out , cheap paper , the very few illustrations are nasty black and white photocopys that are extremely small and dark . On top of all that , in leafing through this supposedly illustrated and annotated book , I did n't see one single annotation ! A very cheap , very ugly book . At first I was just going to give up and accept it , but I 've now rallied an am going to try one more time . The story is a beautiful one , and I was so glad to see that my treasured niece was interested in it .
3 #### Love the book so I knew I had to get this cute version of it . Not happy with the actual book itself though . It appeared damaged in some places . Overall , I 'm keeping it , simply because I do n't want to pay for shipping to send it back .
5 #### Love , love , loved this book . I was reading it while on a tour of South Africa , Namibia , and Botswana , so was seeing the animals the spoke of which really added to my fun ! They had a great way of making it exciting throughout the book .
5 #### I loved this book . I used to live in South Africa and love the animal life . We used to hike through the park so we grew very fond of the wild life .
5 #### I first read this book when it first appeared and the authors were on the Johnny Carson show . He was right - they are amazing , the book is amazing , their adventures amazing . They write lyrically about living in an Eden like wilderness conducting their first wildlife research project as young post grad students . I read it then and every single time I pick it up to admire the spectacular pictures - I find myself drawn in again . I read deep and wide and give this book highest marks . One of my all time favorites .
5 #### These well known authors / researchers have given a beautiful account of their amazing life , studying African wildlife by living among the animals in the Kalahari . Their grit and determination are admirable to say the least , and their success in bringing about better protection for the animals and ecosystems is unmatched .
4 #### A young couple take what , to me , would be unbearable risks to study the creatures of the Kalahari . It 's astonishing that a relationship could survive the challenges .
5 #### I have reread this book in hardback form about once a year for the past decade or so . I was thrilled that it is finally available on kindle .
5 #### This is a truly wonderful book . You are there as they have the adventure and life style others only dream about . I too ( as other reviewers have mentioned ) read this years ago and , in fact , dropped the authors a note where it reached them in / on the Kalahari ... and they were kind enough to write back . Needless to say that handwritten note is a treasure that remains in my copy of their book which has become a prized possession . Their story is for the serious , the conservationist , the animal - lover , the free spirit and those who believe our purpose here is to give back to the world we live in . This many years later I am still in awe of these two people and their story . Controversies that have arisen in the years since are of interest of course but I do n't think they mar what this couple did with their studies and for the elephants . Cry of the Kalahari continues to stand on its own merit .
5 #### Exceeded my expectations on the condition for a used book . Thank you and keep up the good work . I would certainly order from you again .
5 #### I love it ! Would not loan it for fear of losing it . Did loan it to a very trusted friend who returned it after thoroughly enjoying reading it . This purchase was a second copy for me as I want a lending copy for those who I know will enjoy and appreciate it . Wonderful book ! Not about an adventure alone but a commitment and devotion . A " must read . "
5 #### Once you read the first page , you can not put this great book down till you read the last sentence . It is that good .
4 #### I read this in grade school . I remember liking it .
5 #### I read this aloud to my 9 year old and there was much laughter and tears of joy by the end , and she said , I want more . This is a book we did not want to end . It should be read aloud .
3 #### Buyer beware , I found a typo on page 84 in chapter seven where they misspell Lavinia 's name by leaving out the second " I " . Also it 's the same in other recent editions by Puffin classics .
4 #### I read this book long ago as a child , and decided to re - read it . It is a lovely story , especially to read as a young person .
5 #### This book is easy to understand for my third grader . She enjoys it so much !
5 #### I always loved the movie but this story was even more touching when things look the darkest the dawn ca n't be far behind .
4 #### A classic I had not read in my childhood ; liked it as an adult .
5 #### A wonderful story , and if you have n't read it , you are missing something . It 's a classic for that reason .
5 #### A perfect book to remind us that happy thoughts are a special Magic and growing a garden can cure most things .
5 #### This is as delightful a story as any by FHB . It 's a great bedtime story , but I just reread it as a grownup and loved it even more .
5 #### I am almost speechless to describe how wonderful this book is . I ca n't wait to read it to my grandchildren . A children 's classic , I had thought , I now know that it is a wonderful book for any age . I ca n't wait to discuss it with my friends who have read it and to recommend it to those who have not . A wonderful read .
2 #### this book was not exactly what I was looking for but if you 're into the scientific safari research kind of stuff get it for sure
5 #### I have read and re - read this book many times . It always draws me into an incredible place and the amazing lives and work of Mark and Delia Owens - in the Kalahari Desert - a true wilderness . Beautifully written , amazing wildlife experiences and discoveries . I can not recommend it enough .
5 #### I purchased because I wanted some insight about this area from another time period . Am going to Botswana later this year and this is one of the books I chose to read in preparation for my adventure .
5 #### Love this book , read it years ago and had to find it again to re - read it . Unbelievable story and is quite a page turner . A must read for the adventurous and those who love the wilderness and animals .
5 #### I was in high school and college with Delia . We spent many hours sitting in her room discussing her plans to go to Africa . It amazes me that she has accomplished exactly what she intended ! ! Hats off to her and Mark . They are a remarkable couple . This book is an easy read and lets the reader into a life that few would choose , let alone survive ! nature , botswana
5 #### This book made me want to travel to Africa ! I loved how raw and real it was . The struggle of humans and animals trying to survive together . There is so much respect between the two humans studying the lions in the Kalahari . I absolutely loved it .
5 #### Two grad students , having married shortly after their University of Georgia college education began their graduate studies in zoology in the Kalahari desert in Botswana . I 've heard grad students ' lives are poor and hard , but this couples ' 7 year field study takes the mealie - meal . They carefully rationed water and gasoline and lived on mealie - meal ( cornmeal ) , ostrich eggs , and antelope meat ; they 'd nearly run out of money and write grants to pay for their supplies only and with no money left to fly home . They survived on these paltry sums and did their research in temperatures that sometimes got as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit surrounded by lions , leopards , and cheetahs in the midst of one of Africa 's most inhospitable areas . This true story is truly amazing and I ca n't wait to read their other books about Africa . The book was published in 1984 and I wonder if their research had any influence in the IMAX film The Serengeti which is about the greatest wildebeest migration that happens in the Serengeti area in Tanzania and Kenya . In the back of the book is a brief recommendation for wildlife management in the Kalahari desert . In reading this , one ca n't but be reminded of Jane Gooddall 's and the Adamson 's work with wildlife in East Africa . It 's also a survivors ' tale , adventuresome and exciting , but most of all great research . Excellent all around !
5 #### I just finished re - reading The Secret Garden , one of my favorite books from my childhood . It was just as enjoyable to me as it was so many years ago . In fact , I think that this book must have had a huge impact on me when I was a child , because I found that I remembered large portions of it as I re - read it . Such an entertaining story ! !
5 #### Good version of a great classic for an beginning reader .
4 #### Downloaded this book because my 6th grader had to read it for school . So I was able to help her with her school assignments on the book , I decided to read it as well . Overall it 's a good book . Was a bit slow for me , but it 's also not something I would normally read . My daughter really did n't care for the storyline . She just could n't get into it . Not her normal reading either . In the end she listened to an audio reading of the book to finish it . Overall I thought it was a good book .
5 #### Beautiful , sweet little book . The illustrations are so sweet and pretty . Not only for children ! I 'm 56 and loved it . Takes you to a gentler world for a bit .
5 #### A favorite from childhood that I return to again and again .
5 #### A wonderful imaginative story about life , the obstacles we encounter and the results of having to deal with them . It is shown once more that we need something to entice us , to challenge us and to speak to our imigination . Then we can master our life and make it a most beautiful one inspiring others on the way . A must read for young and old
4 #### Excellent story for kid . Will help for the development of language
5 #### A delightful Tale about a girl who never gives up hope and instant classic you 'll love this classic book for your
1 #### NOT as described in terms of content . This is * not * the Burnett ( as original ) original . This is , as shown on the cover , " RETOLD " by Martha Hailey , a " Sterling 's Classic Children 's Book " " Classic Starts " . Additionally , the book I ordered listed the name of Mary Engelbreit ( as a cover illustrator , I thought ) This book I received has a completely different cover than shown . I was buying an used copy of the original , not a " retold " version . Disappointed , but should have suspected . Not worth the effort to return return , but will just donate and look for the real thing elsewhere . Good reminder to scour library sales , yard sales and brick & mortar stores . Some things one needs to see and touch . No more books from Amazon . This was a bad deal that was jus an unthoughtful merchandise swap . Lesson learned .
5 #### I love this story ! --A perfect little gem of fiction with a little bit of British / Indian history and psychology thrown in to boot .
5 #### Even better than any of the movie versions ! I am curious when this was originally published . In the first movie version I saw , the playwrights added a postscript about ten years after the last part of the story with a conversation between Mary and Colin as adults , apparently post - WW1 , speaking as if Dickon had died during the war .
5 #### What a great story and I just loved it ...
5 #### I recommend it to all ages , young or old , everyone should read it . Not minding their intellectual sense they should understand it ! It 's just simply a splendid book !
3 #### This is not a new book ; I read it years ago and enjoyed it . I would have given it 5 stars then . But when I re - read it last year , I realized it belongs alongside the Timothy Treadwell books / films and the Ian Hamilton ( elephants ) documentaries / books , about people endangering the very animals they love through relentlessly habituating them to people and pestering them to the point where Hamilton and the Owens ' , at least , are lucky to have escaped with a whole skin . This whole trend toward getting as close as possible to large dangerous animals is so detrimental to the animals themselves that it infuriates me . The Owens ' lions , used to people letting them roam around camp and sit down among them , and anthropomorphized with cute names like Muffin , were clearly going to get into trouble the first time they met other , less starry - eyed people in the Kalahari or in the villages and towns surrounding it . The Owens did them a real disservice . That being said , and if you can ignore that aspect of it , this remains an interesting read - the camplife and the desert landscape are fascinating , and I believe that , at the time the authors carried out their project , the dangers of habituation , etc . , were still not fully understood ...
5 #### I have been to Botswana and find the Cry of the Kalahari a testiment to the struggles between nature and preservation . This book is captivating , interesting , detailed and motivational .
5 #### This book was absolutely fantastic . I laughed , I cried , and I felt like I was living in the Kalahari along with the authors and their wild friends . When I finished the book , I logged onto Amazon to see if the Owens ' had written any more books on Africa . Could n't find any , but I promise if they write any more , I will buy the hardback ! Enjoy this wonderful book .
5 #### I ca n't say enough good things about this book . It is entertaining , exciting , educational and above all a testament to why we need to respect and preserve animals .
2 #### Mark and Delia Owens do an excellent job in telling a story but their work is not accepted by international conservation thinkers . They try to defend wildlife at all costs which eventually leads to resentment of villagers towards wildlife and thus no incentive to protect it . Thr Owenses are no longer allowed into the democratic country of Botswana . And I do n't blame Botswana . I was offended at how they portrayed the Tswana ( the dominant ethnic group of Botswana ) as nothing but a threat to wildlife . Cry of the Kalahari gives the impression that the Tswana and the bushmen of the Kalahari have no right to use the resources of their land and should be dislocated elsewhere . Their discription of the wildebeast fencing problem in inaccurate . They were not the first to report it as they claimed and in fact they never did a formal study of the fencing problem before they screamed out to the international community for help . Turns out fences help wildlife as well as hurt is by keeping cattle out of protected zones and thus free buffalo , wildebeasts and others from having to compete with them . The Owenses do an excellent job describing wildlife and tell a captivating story but they take a step backwards in trying to conserve the animals they love . By giving the impression that all cattle , all people and all development is evil they propogate the myths of Africa that many more enlightened Botswana park service officials have been trying to dispell .
5 #### Of the many books I 've read about wildlife , this one sticks in my mind as one of the best , even though it 's been several years since I first read it . Some books like George Schaller 's " The Serengeti Lion " have more sceintific bent and therefore keep a ' professional distance ' from the animals , while others such as those by Joy Adamson and Gareth Patterson become very personal with the animals and lose much of their objectivity . But Mark and Delia Owens find a happy medium between the two extremes , one where we learn a lot about the lions , brown hyenas and other animals they study in the Kalahari desert , but also come to know some of the individuals among these animals as friends . We also get a taste of life in the Kalahari desert in the middle of Botswana , some of the hardships and life - threatening situations encountered by the Owenses . And we share the issues and concerns they tried to raise in the governments and landowners of the territories where they spent seven years living and studying animals . At various times this book made me smile . It made me mad . It made me sad . It made me laugh . And it made me wish I could spend a few years of my life studying and living among wildlife as they did .
5 #### I have loved this book since the first time I read it as a child . I still enjoy the story .
5 #### I loved this book as a child and especially remember the beautiful illustrations by Tasha Tudor . I reread it after giving it to my ten - year - old bookworm goddaughter who adored it . The charm was still there for me , too , after fifty some years .
5 #### A classic story that will warm your heart . A friend and a bit of fresh air can cheer the darkest of souls
5 #### What a wonderful book . I am 75 and really enjoyed it . Every child should read this at some point . But later is good too !
3 #### I think this book was a very sweet story , but written more for a young adult or child .
5 #### I have read this little book so many times over the years I have lost count and I will reread it in the future . It one of those little books that just makes me want to work hard at being good and positive no matter what my circumstances are .
5 #### Still a great story , especially for a young girl child .
5 #### I have embarked on reading the classics . So glad I picked this to begin with . While it might seem simplistic to some , it 's an age long tale of how love ( not necessarily of a person ) can transform someone . The garden was the beginning of a renewal of a little girl , ignored and neglested , who blooms as the garden does .
4 #### I read this book as a child and it still sticks with me today . It 's a shame there has n't been a proper movie translation .
5 #### My favorite book of all time ! I love this little bantam classics pocket paperback . I also have Wuthering Heights , Jane Eyre , and Moby Dick in this edition .
5 #### One of my favorite stories . My mother read it to me when I was a girl . I 've read it many time since and just finished it with my daughter . A treasure for the ages .
5 #### Beautiful illustrations and a nice abridged version of the story . We got this from the library and my daughter(5 ) was so sad to take it back ! We got it for her birthday . She 's very happy !
5 #### From my childhood in the 1950 's , when hardly a soul had discovered this now - in work , it was my very favorite book . I love it in hardcover form , recently rereading and enjoying it on Kindle . I love the films that have been made ... all of them . I 've given the hardcover , leather - like spine of the Children 's classic version as a gift to a number of special - friend children . " The Secret Garden " continues to speak to me all these years later in a way few books do .
5 #### I recommend to anyone that wants a simple fun story but keeps you interested all the way ! ! She makes the character come alive
5 #### Must read for every young girl and boy . Filled with magic and wonder and goodness and hope ! Highly recommended for everyone .
5 #### I was very pensive about reading this book . I did n't like Mary at first .. she was hateful , selfish and rude . I made myself continue to read and ended up falling in love with the entire cast . Beautifully written .
4 #### Beautifully written tale of becoming healthy in mind and body , seen through the eyes of child . A wonderful story of finding joy in life , through love , nature , and a bit of magic !
5 #### The women in our family always gift a copy of The Secret Garden to their children and grandchildren . It 's a wonderful book and a must read for all children . I bought this for my grandchild .
1 #### I spent a lot of time looking through the different editions seeking something high quality with illustrations . The book I received is extremely poor quality , cheap paper and difficult to read , with only one black and white illustration in the whole book ! Not at all what was stated in the description , certainly not desireable as a " 100 year edition " . I will seek a superior edition and put this in the kindling pile !
4 #### Always have loved the movie but the book was a bit more detailed good read .
5 #### There are good reasons why this book is a classic . Any girl who loves reading will like this one .
4 #### One of my bucket list items for a classic read . Glad I read it . A book for younger readers but a refreshing reminder of when literature was thought provoking , well communicated and well done .
5 #### I'VE read tho before and seen the movie ... and it never ceases to inspire me . We could all learn to use " th magic " and here 's nothing fairy tale - ish about it .
5 #### A Little Princess is a literary classic . 5 stars for the story . When I found out my niece had n't read it yet , I wanted to give her a copy of her own in hope that she might enjoy it as much as I did as a young girl . Why did I chose this particular edition ? It 's PRETTY . The colorful cover and gold foil is a more modern and sophisticated version that the typical Victorian oil painting approach that other editions have . It 's something that could be displayed proudly on a bookshelf for many years to come .
5 #### The secret garden was a thrilling book filled with amazing adventures . This book had me in the edge of my seat at all times ! I recommend this book to any and every child !
5 #### Two wretched young cousins come together to find that life can be magical.as they work to restore an abandoned garden . As the garden comes back to life , so do the lives of the children . Loved it !
5 #### I grew up reading this book , now I can take it with me on the go . I have loved it since the first time I read it as a child and continue to read it from time to time even now I am an adult . Great message .
5 #### You will enjoy this book ! I loved it and could not wait to get back to it when I had to put it down . Matt Cruse was born in the air , he only feels truly himself when he is aloft in the airship Aurora . Matt knows every strut and dial of the ship . It is his home . He becomes friends with Kate , a wealthy young passenger who is retracing her grandfather 's balloon journey and is in search of the fantastic flying " beings " he wrote about in his journal . A pirate attack , a shipwreck , scary flying creatures that they dub , " cloud cats " keep this story moving and kept me turning the pages until the end . Matt is an interesting character who is still coming to terms with the death of his father and his new feelings for Kate . Oppel makes you feel the movement of the ship , smell the sweetish odor of the " hydrium " gas , and feel the heat of the island . The time period is seemingly in the past in the era of the great luxury liners but the idea of hydrium and the Academy where ships ' officers are trained have a futuristic feel . Great job . This is one of the best books I have read this year .
4 #### Oppel kept the pace of this Treasure Islandish tale moving quickly , especially the second half . There were a lot of action scenes that will appeal to 10 to 13 - year - olds . Unlike some of the other reviewers , I thought the strength of this novel was the first 50 to 100 pages as Oppel laid the groundwork and the history of the airships . The second half , though not predicatable , was so coincidental . So many dangerous situations for Matt seemed to resolve themselves so easily , too easily really for the author of the fantastic and unpredictable Silverwing series . Enjoy this read , but do n't expect a classic .
5 #### I 've loved this book since I was a child . Sorry that the author gives credit to other " spirits " rather than God .
4 #### Great story ! Love watching the progress that they made . They used to be so mean and just some fresh air and then they are great kids !
5 #### I love this book . It 's such a wonderful tale . This copy is pretty good . There are some quote marks out of place and some other minor errors , but free is good !
5 #### Classic story with beautiful cover and artwork throughout the book .
1 #### I found the book very hard to understand . I also saw a production of the book in a play . It is very odd and I would not recommend it to any one .
4 #### A classic good read even for adults . The characters are interesting . And show both good and bad personalities . Enjoy it
5 #### I gave this book to my grand children to read . They loved it !
3 #### I have read several different versions of this book and like it . The message in the book is that the most unpleasant people can improve if given a chance . This version lacked the details contained in a hard copy of the book . That is why I gave the book a 3 star rating .
4 #### Another hit from Kenneth Oppel , Airborn is a fantastic novel about a 15 year - old cabin boy named Matt Cruse . Matt serves aboard a passenger ship known as the Aurora . However , this ship is no boat . This is an airship , one that sets the tone for the slightly steampunk adventure . Early on , Matt meets Kate , a girl looking for mysterious creatures her uncle once sighted near where the Aurora flies . Matt and Kate develop a friendship , and throughout this their characters are developed well enough for the reader to care about them , their struggles , and their relationship . The story really speeds up about half - way through the book , and Matt , Kate and others will have to risk everything for their lives , and the lives of others . To go on past that would thoroughly spoil the narrative . This novel will captivate readers with a mix of action and mystery . Airborn is narrated by Matt , and that tremendously adds to the experience . Kenneth Oppel 's great writing is filled with playful figurative language and a few jokes that are very funny , but they do n't affect the mood of the plot . This book would get a perfect score , but it 's somewhat slow beginning is something of a pain , despite its valuable setup for the rest of the story . Though the beginning of a wonderful trilogy , Airborn is also a great read on it 's own . For those who like action , adventure , and a bit of fantasy , Airborn is very difficult to beat .
5 #### One of my favorite adventures , i adore this series
4 #### I picked this up for the steampunk aspect , but I did not expect a Treasure Island situation . But I thought it was done pretty well . But I have to say that Matt and Kate we damn near insufferable . Just so irritating . But I 'm torn because it also felt like they acted appropriately to their social status and past . I just really hated them .
5 #### I enjoy the mix of airships and its time period . Not a steampunk but more realistic in ways . Great character development and a good string of small adventures leading to its climax . I enjoyed it enough to get a copy for my daughter and the next book in the series .
5 #### Why is n't this book a movie , yet ? I had a 13 hour road trip this weekend and am so glad I had this audio book to listen to . It kept me riveted the entire time . I will definitely being reading to more of this series and author .
5 #### Wonderful story ! What a treasure ! I will let my daughter read i as well .
5 #### Mary , a spoiled young orphan girl , is sent into the care of her wealthy but absent uncle in a large estate on the moors of England , which also houses the lords reclusive and sickly young son . The discovery of a secret garden leads to the awakening of young spirits and the healing of young lives . This lovely novel radiates with joy and finds the drama in regeneration as Mary transforms into a happy , empathetic child while coaxing a garden back to life , then passes on the gift by helping another to do the same . The character of her friend and confidante Dickon may strain credibility at times with his Doctor Doolittle - like ability to charm animals , but this a small quibble of a narrative that eschews violent conflict or selfish antagonists for one in which everyone seems to be doing the best they can , and the drama arises from within as they try to do better . Frances Burnett Hodgsons keen psychological insights into wounded children with traumatic pasts prevents the story from ever becoming dull , and her descriptions of plants and wildlife are lovely . This is a truly enriching read , and it makes me wonder what Hodgson would make of the slew of depressive dystopian novels that characterize so much of childrens literature today .
5 #### A true classic ! This has been one of my favorite books ever since I was a little girl ! The courage and integrity along with the sweet innocence of this young but noble heroine will captivate the hearts of any who value such beautiful virtues . A heartwarming and delightful story , with a larger print than most books , making it easy to read and charming pictures !
4 #### The movie version is a favorite of mine and I thought it was time I read the book . The movie was pretty true to it , but the book is worth reading since it 's more descriptive and you learn more about the characters and their time in the garden . Sometimes it was a bit too descriptive , but I just skimmed those parts . I will admit that reading the Broad Yorkshire accent as an American was hard at times since I could n't always tell what things meant . Overall I liked the book and am happy to own it . It 's truly a lovely story . I also really enjoyed towards the end where the author talks about how ruminating over negative things can cause the person to become negative and how helpful it is to just try to stay positive and think about pleasant things . I think that was the magic of the garden . It was able to bring 3 people out of their slumps and bring joy into their lives .
5 #### This book is great , I purchased it for my boyfriend 's twelve year old son , and he absolutely loves it . I am very pleased with the turnout . This book also arrived in perfect condition , which is a huge bonus . It is a little advanced for an average twelve year old , but I have a friend who absolutely loves this book as an adult . I ca nt wait until he finishes reading this so I can read it for myself !
4 #### Good guys . Bad guys . An elusive creature . A plot that keeps you turning page after page and hoping for more . Please , let there be a sequel !
5 #### Great yarn- I read it after my 16 yr old daughter who is steampunk crazy ! Would make a good movie !
5 #### My 8 - year - old and 6 - year - old sons and I were first introduced to Mr. Oppel when my mother gave them " The Boundless " , which we read together ( and also highly recommend ) . The boys loved that book and wanted to read more from this author , so I purchased " Airborn " . To say that my boys were enthralled with this book would be an understatement ! They begged me each night to read " just one more chapter ! " . The plot is intriguing but not overly complicated for younger children , the characters are very well developed , and the descriptions make you feel like you 're there right along with the protagonists . I think that my 8 - year - old could probably have read this on his own , but I personally enjoyed the story so much myself that I was more than happy to make reading it part of our bedtime ritual . We just received " Skybreaker " , the sequel to " Airborn , in the mail this afternoon and the boys literally jumped up and down and said they ca n't wait to start reading it tonight . To see them so excited about a book absolutely thrills me . We look forward to reading all of Mr. Oppel 's books .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Secret - Garden / dp / B0083Z614S / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Secret Garden</a > An interesting read regarding a young orphan 's journey from a self - centered young girl to one who cares for others .
3 #### Disappointed in this , as it did n't contain any addition to the story . So what is the meaning of the title ? ?
5 #### One of my favorite childhood books . I read it as an adult and still loved it .
3 #### * Spoilers * * Spoilers * * Spoilers I can see why this story would appeal to a young audience . An orphan girl , Mary , is left to roam about on her uncle 's estate without having to go to school . She can run and play outdoors unchaperoned and , when she gets hungry , show up at meal times . Moreover , when it rains , she can explore the 100 - room mansion like it was her private playground . Who would n't love to have such a life especially as a child ? Yes , she 's lonesome , but she develops friendships . Her parents ' deaths from cholera do n't seem to have affected her at all since they neglected her . There 's a sweetness to the first half of the book . I especially enjoyed the growing friendship between Mary and Martha and Mary 's transformation from a sullen , spoiled child . I also enjoyed exploring with Mary , finding the key to the secret garden , and discovering the secret garden itself . It felt a little like a Nancy Drew mystery . The problem , unfortunately , was when Colin appeared about halfway through the story . The focus shifted away from Mary as the central character to Colin and his health problem and tantrums . Mary was subsequently pushed to the back burner . At this point , the story became tedious . I skimmed to the end where Mrs. Medlock sees Mr. Craven and his son walking side by side . We 're given a happy ending , but again , Mary is shunted aside and disappears at the end .
4 #### As one of the Old Evergreens that I well recall from my childhood , not to mention the more recent adaptation as a musical stage presentation , The Secret Garden will remain a faithful memory . New memories will be even more cherished now that I have shared this with my own grandchildren , who now feel it is their duty to find a stage production of it -- somewhere -- even though I have warned them that much will be different . So nice to have it handy on Kindle for easy reference or to ask a question posed by some new fans .
5 #### The illustrations in this edition are beautiful and the printing font is a bit larger and easier to read and looks old - fashioned . It is a delightful addition to your library .
5 #### A very different read from what I 'm used to , but exciting , none the less . I hope to read more by this author . Very clear and crisp writing . Amazing descriptions of scenes .
5 #### I read this book for Battle of the Books in high school and loved it so much I decided to read it again . It 's a great read for adolescent 's and a fun easy read for adults . I read it before I even knew what steampunk was , and will likely look for more books like it !
5 #### I do Not know , it was a present to my grand daugther
4 #### The Airship Aurora is n't the only thing here that 's lighter than air , but that 's O.K. This feels like a middle grade , early YA adventure . With the airship and the alternate technology it is steampunk , but that aspect is n't heavily featured and the tech frames and informs the story but does n't dominate it . In a similar vein , there 's swashbuckling adventure that makes this a direct descendant of high seas pirate adventures , but again that 's mostly for flavor and atmosphere . Our two primary characters , mild and modest but daring and stalwart Matt , and sassy , spirited Kate , carry the burden of the story effortlessly . Matt is an engaging narrator . Kate is a worthy and equal companion in adventure . Neither is loaded with quirks and while they are n't developed deeply they are fleshed out as completely as necessary for this type of adventure . This is a modest , well crafted , imaginative , good - hearted , good - humored adventure . It 's crisp , clear , fast paced and briskly plotted . It does n't always go for big effects , and its appeal to me was built up from a number of small observations , events , descriptions , bits of dialogue and characters . That 's what made it seem especially appealing for newer and younger readers testing the water for this type of fiction . As such , it struck me as a fine and entertaining introduction to the genre .
5 #### I loved this when I was a child and the movie . I 'm hoping Granddaughter will love also .
5 #### Good to remember the lessons whether 7or70 . Great classic .
5 #### I hardly remember buying this -- I must have got it through a goodreads sale or something -- but it 's super cute and neatly written . Definitely worth it .
5 #### Wonderful storyline and very entertaining . The novel moves at a good pace and leads to a creditable conclusions . I am ordering the 2nd one in this series .
4 #### Fun easy story . I read it as an adult and enjoyed the adventure and twists- unfortunately my 14 year old was less impressed .
3 #### A good , straight up YA novel . The characters are clearly young , but the setting and world building is imaginative and adventure is fun . Not particularly mind blowing , but I enjoyed the read enough to be interested in book 2 : Skybreaker .
5 #### It is deeply satisfying to not only read a well - crafted story with wonderfully engaging characters , an adventurous plot , and beautifully rendered setting ; but to read a story so well written that the English language is once again a tool of beauty-- now that is a pleasurable experience I 've sorely missed over the years . I highly recommend this book for all readers whose age is in the double digits ! I 'd give this book more than five stars if I could ! This is one to keep on the shelf with other great classic adventure stories .
5 #### Incredible . Fast paced . Exciting . Adventure , romance , flying cats , airships , death , and hope , this book has it all ! Airborn is a delightful read . The plot , sub - plots , the backgrounds of the characters , the tension , the stolen kiss , and Matt 's tenacity to hold on even when there 's nothing left are wonderfully crafted . Szpirglas is one of the baddest bad - guys of our day and age . Kuddos for not holding him back ! I have n't felt this excited about a central character ( i.e. Matt ) since D'Artagnan received his promotion . Kenneth Oppel has woven everything so tightly and brought his characters to life in such a fashion that you ca n't help but cheer them on . Highly recommended ! I could n't put this down and read it in a couple of days , a testimony to how engrossing is this tale . I just wish Hydrium was real -- it would be fun to travel as a passenger on a ship like the Aurora . Is it just for kids ? Nah , I 've got two of my own and I thoroughly enjoyed this yarn . I ca n't say the same about the sequel , but Airborn is a must read .
4 #### My 8 year old daughter read this for her first book club book . She is an avid reader and she did not want to read this book ! So I sat with her and I read it to her and I can see why she was apprehensive . The language is very old - fashioned and several characters speak with a heavy Yorkshire dialect that was difficult to decipher even for me . As we continued to read this classic , we both enjoyed the story and got used to the language . We are both very happy we stuck with it . I know this is a classic and these issues can be expected but I think I would save this for an older child to read on his / her own .
5 #### When I was about eight , I received this book and The Secret Garden from an aunt and uncle for Christmas . What a magical -- if unrealistic-- story . It 's like an old friend .
5 #### Everyone should read this book . I have read it a dozen times or more since I was a child .
5 #### I really enjoyed reading this book . Great story and a great story teller . If you enjoy Cussler , Dietrich or Turtledove , you 'll like mr . Oppel 's tales .
5 #### Loved the book . Gave it to my 9 year old grandson and he loved it . Fun to be 75 and still love fantasy adventure .
5 #### Fantastic ! ! Wonderful read , very interesting details about air ships . It grabs you and takes you on a thrilling journey ! ! I was sorry to have it end , although the ending was great ! ! SAK
4 #### The book was fun to read . Fast - paced and very enjoyable . I recommend it to anyone wanting a fun experience . S j
5 #### This book showed everyone how to be a real princess I love how she is nice to everyone even the mouse Sara is a really good role model I would suggest this book to people 10 + I ca n't wait to write my paper for school
5 #### This classic story tells the power of looking for the good in things and the power of nature on the human spirit .
5 #### This book has always had a special place in my heart . Rereading it as an adult does not make it lose it 's " magic " . It has an old - fashioned innocence that I still find charming !
4 #### This is a good book , but you have to be interested in plants to enjoy it . Altogether , its fun reading it . You MUST understand Yorkshire Atleast alittle
5 #### I read this as a child and now 50 years later it is a joy relived . A story every child should read .
5 #### The ending was a little abrupt , because it leaves one wanting to know what happened to those sassy children . A very enjoyable read .
5 #### It 's one of the greatest classic ! I enjoyed rereading the book and watching the movie . Will probably read it again some day .
5 #### This is the perfect classic book for any growing little girl ! I think that it teaches girls how to be strong and act like what a princess is truly supposed to act like . A perfect gift for any little girl who loves reading !
2 #### Is there anyone who does n't love this story ? I mean that for the story in the full novel , not this annotated book by Dover . I had n't realized till I looked inside that this Dover edition is annotated . So , I went and bought the full novel . The Dover edition pages are not very good quality . It 's a cheap book . Not even worth the few dollars I paid for it . I can donate it to a lending library for readers of English as a second language .
5 #### Coming of age novel . Victorian steam punk . Breakdown of economic and social boundaries under pressure . I loved this book . I read that it would be great for middle school boys . I am a 60 year old Latin teacher ! ! Ingenuity and faith allow our heroes to win . Good escapism for anyone .
5 #### First class tale . This book ranks with Treasure Island and Lost World as an exciting unforgeable story . Very likeable main characters and full of excitement . I love the airship setting . It has pirates , a rich beautiful girl and a likeable , brave teenage boy , a crash on an unknown island , flying panther like creatures , a memorable villain somewhat in the Long John Silver mode both charming and likeable and villainness at the same time . Funny characters like a crazy Hungarian cook , hair breth escapes . And if teenage boys or even older a great example of a brilliant youbg woman bound and determed to get her way and how she does it .
5 #### Great story in the like if Verne or Wells . In a world where heavier than air aircraft is only a minor mode of transportation our hero is s cabin boy on a large airship for passengers . Pirates , flying cat - like animals , stranded on a remote island , and a love interest all make for a good tale
4 #### While a little predictable , it was a good , fun read .
2 #### I was disappointed in the re - telling of this story . I have read and re - read " The Secret Garden " , and so much of what makes this story endearing , was taken out . Like the Yorkshire accent of Martha , and Mary learning how to talk like her . It really seemed half the book was missing . Still , for a young child to read , the language is simple . I was just disappointed that it was not the original .
5 #### Slightly different from the movies of this classic story but well worth the read .
4 #### Generally I like more in depth books . However , having seen the two most movie versions I wanted to see how close they were to the book . Glad I read the book . Both movies capture the main theme but depart from the story line at times . Glad I read the book . It was an enjoyable read .
5 #### I read when I was a child and to be honest forgot the title and author 's name ... but just finished reading it after 35 years and still feel enchanted and humbled beyond my age .
5 #### I have loved this book from my childhood . The description of long - ago England has always fascinated me , and the idea of a walled closed - in garden captured my imagination just as it did Mary 's and Colin 's . While I 've never been to Yorkshire this ( and other ) story makes me want to go .
5 #### Very good reading . Was captivating all the way through . First time that I have read anything from this author . Worth reading other books he has written .
4 #### A good read , more for teens , but can be OK for adults . The science is poor at best , so is must be read as fantasy . The reason this is mostly for teens is that some of the obvious answers take a little long in arriving and most of the adults are clueless . There are some inventive sequences and much of the action is terrific .
5 #### The main character 's love of the sky and passion for flying is infectious . I found myself smiling in shear enjoyment through much of this book . Behind it all is a great steampunk adventure with a cute yet not overpowering teen romance . I 've read the other 2 books in the series which are also good , the first is the best .
5 #### Good story kept my attention . Would like a sequil
3 #### Jules Verne would enjoy this story . A fun read - heroes- pirates - monsters and of course the young , brave , brash girl
5 #### Enjoyed this fun story , good book to read if your not interested in learning something new .
4 #### This is a young adult book , written for a British 12 year old level . The use of a Yorkshire accent is a bit overworked for an American reader . The musical based on this book never recovers from the chaos of the first chapter , and becomes all about the music and less about the plot .
5 #### I love the old children 's stories that actually read as well now as back when I was little . The edition I have is uncut and unabridged , so there are a few turns of phrase early in the book that stand out as racist , but since the character doing the talking in that moment was being described in really unflattering terms , and likely oblivious to the offensiveness of her word choices , I think leaving the scenes as - is lets them stand as moments of character revelation that might not be so effective if the language were watered down . She changes quite a lot across the book , so her sorry beginnings make the transformation somewhat poignant . Also , I 'm not a fan of rewriting old books just to sanitize them . The author intended to create a certain effect with her word choices , so they should stand . I like these little Collector 's Library books . They fit nicely in my hands and can fit in a bag for easy travel reading .
4 #### Enjoyable and if there is a sequel I would read it .
4 #### good fantasy . could n't put it down . Had a predictable ending but satisfining
4 #### An absolutely terrific read . The adventures of Matt and Kate on board the ' Aurora ' we 're hard to put down . Cloud cats , Sky pirates , and the majesty of air ship travel had me captivated from page 1 . Well done !
4 #### An old favorite ! A good read , a reminder of simpler times .
5 #### I love this book ! Unfortunately , this is the abridged version . It does say so in the description , so I ca n't fault the seller , but I did n't even bother reading this version as I enjoy the full one . The abridged version would be good for early readers though .
2 #### This is n't what I would call a classic . Most of the book is difficult because it 's written in Yorkshire accent , so it 's annoying . Both main characters are horribly spoiled children who happen upona magical world that is nothing magical . It 's a garden .. they've fallen under the spell of the natural wonders of nature .
5 #### Amazing story . My children loved it , and watching Mary and Colin grow was a good experience for them . Definitely a good read .
5 #### I loved the unfolding of events and the message of the story . I 'm sorry I waited so long to read it .
5 #### A great read on the power of positive thinking . Great for children of all ages . Spiritually uplifting without being preachy .
5 #### Great voice , unique world . Excellent adventure incorporating old technology in a way that feels fresh and new . Clean youth adventure . My sons and I loved the whole series .
4 #### Went through this quickly . Conventional storyline , but likeable characters and an interesting setting aboard the ' airships ' . My first Oppel book .
5 #### An adventure based on lighter than air transportation . Explosive situation with interesting outcomes . Ongoing saga of problems and solutions to the adventures
4 #### This is an enjoyable young adult read . The story follows a cabin boy on an airship and his adventures involving a trans - ocean voyage , air pirates , and mysterious new creatures that take to the sky . On the up side , being a young adult novel this is a fast read , and easy , without an overbearing of jargon outside of air nautical terms . The downside for me was the overly British feel of the language and the first person point of view . All of that aside , I feel that this is actually a fun read , and I could see this more as a Disney style movie than real life , because of the involvement of the mystical creature , though I know that they would do well with airships using CGI . This had a very Treasure Planet style vibe to it for me , and that is what made it fun . 4 out of 5 stars .
5 #### I loved this book so much ! I think that it is so cool that in this book most ships fly on air hundreds of feet up I 'm the sky ! ! !
5 #### I LOVED THIS BOOK ! ! ! It 's the best book I have read in a long time Kenneth Oppel is a great writer
5 #### Airborne was a wonderful novel about our world with out air planes but airships . Kenneth Oppel was amazingly vivid in his description of the entire story setting and events . A must read to anyone interested in alternate universes or sky travel for that matter .
5 #### My Son Liked the Book , kept him entertained . It was a chore to get him going at first . He would ready again .
5 #### I had only ever seen the movie growing up , and honestly I hated it . But I could n't put this book down . I loved it !
4 #### This is a pleasant read about the power of positive thinking and the healing that comes from being outdoors and enjoying simple pleasures .
5 #### I saw the movie from the 1940 's and that captured my interest , but to read the story was so gratifying and fulfilling that I myself feel like I was in the garden bursting with joy .
5 #### Beautiful heart - rending story of love , the human spirit , and overcoming tragedy . Well written , engages the reader . Loved the story , a book to read again and again . A classic .
1 #### I expected to receive a boxed set of used children 's classics as described which included Heidi to use when tutoring my literacy students .Instead ... I received a very used copy of The Secret Garden which I could have bought at a yard sale for fifty cents ... very deceptive advertising !
4 #### Nothing beats a classic specially when it teaches you a life lesson if one only wants to take the time and learn it .
4 #### Great reading for my 6 year old daughter . She is a little advanced for her age , its 38 pages .
5 #### Okay , I know that this story is completely unbelievable and cliche ... Seriously , if a guy next door to a girls school started climbing into attics nowadays he 'd be arrested . But the fact of the matter is , on a human , gut level , this will probably always be a classic of children 's literature . Bennett 's book is a simple morality tale that harkens back to the original Grimm Fairy Tales . Be good to people and karma will always pay off . Or conversely , if you are a horrible person , bad stuff is gon na happen to you . Or more truthfully , if you are nice , good things well eventually happen for you , after you have suffered for a while to prove to the universe that you are worthy ... even if you are a simple servant and not just a member of the privileged class . I first read this on a rainy weekend in middle school , and I just re read it again today . I still love it , and it still made me cry , though unsurprisingly , not at the same parts I did as a child . As I child I cried at the injustice of what was happening to Sarah , as an adult I cried at the harshness of the world and the terrible beauty of small acts of kindness . This is a book about never giving up hope . All in all , it was a good way to spend the day .
5 #### It is a wonderful story and , though the writer certainly did not know it at the time , it is a book about neuroplasticity ( changes in the brain made by life 's course and behavior changes ) . I 'd recommend this book to anyone of any age who needs to know they are able to change their way of thinking . Each time I read it I see new ideas and inspiration . I am trying to find something I did n't like , maybe to see the children as adults and see what they did with their lives . I especially liked the great descriptive writing and the surprise ending .
4 #### Fun and Fantastical Mr. Oppel provides an elegant adventure that brings out the imaginative adventurer in me ! Thank you , Airborn !
5 #### Captures the imagination from beginning to end . My 9 Year old granddaughter read it and wants to read more ! ! Ca n't ask for a better review than keeps them reading .
4 #### Airborn is a re - imagined high seas / pirate / adventure / survival story transformed into a part fantasy , part science fiction story . And it is wonderful . Matt Cruse has always dreamed of working on one of the luxury dirigible ( blimp ) cruise ships that travel the skies . Matt takes a grunt job on the same ship that employed his father . One day while he is on watch in the crow 's nest , he observes a hot air balloon crash . His ship goes to investigate and thus the fantasy adventure begins . Before he dies , the captain of the balloon tells Matt of " glorious winged creatures filling the sky " . Matt thinks the man was delusional . Of course , he was n't . Matt and his shipmates , and the passengers on the airship , contend with pirate attacks , deadly storms , being stranded on an uncharted island , cruel villains and of course the sky creatures . Matt 's ( obligatory ) sidekick is Kate , the granddaughter of the man who died in the crash . She is a wealthy passenger on Matt 's ship covertly taking up her grandfather 's search for the creatures . Although Airborn is a formulaic fantasy adventure , it also has well developed interesting characters , strong science elements and gripping descriptions of the settings and conflicts . Some readers may be put - off by the length of Airborn , and it does drag in parts , but the exciting events leading up to the nail - biting climax more than make up for the tedious sections .
5 #### Airborn is a delightful read in the spirit of the classic adventure tale . If you 'd like a mash up of Robert Louis Stevenson and Jules Verne , then you 'll love Kenneth Oppel 's Airborn trilogy . Like pirates , airships , mysterious islands , strange creatures , and lots of derring - do ? You 'll have a ball . While written for a young adult audience , it 's entertaining for adults as well . My ten year old daughter says they are her favorite books , and she 's begging for more Matt Cruse and Kate DeVries .
5 #### This book captivated my heart and imagination . It also showed the healing power of changing our negative thoughts into positive thoughts .
3 #### The first book I remember reading - and owning- as a child . I read it over and over until it fell into pieces
5 #### My grandmother introduced this book to me when I was 10 - 12 ... and it will always be one of my favorites ! Now I am 60 , a retired elementary school librarian , and ca n't wait to introduce it to my granddaughter who is only 3 . I always love Dickon and his animals~ he does n't have much but a smile and a sweet spirit but his family is instrumental of changing the lives of two rich kids who need love and hope .
2 #### Story is wonderful , but the texture of this cover is awful . I was expecting a normal , glossy finish . It 's almost suede - like and everything sticks to it . Very strange ! I ca n't even read it because I do n't like touching it ( I do have SPD , but still ) .
5 #### This was one of my favorite children 's books . I still reread it every year or so .
5 #### I would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to feel the wonder like that when they were children again .
5 #### a beautiful read for all ages . what a better world we would experience if everyone had a peaceful garden
4 #### Ggod Sci if read . I liked the airship stuff .. plot was a little predictable though . Characters were the type you would expect . Would make an interesting movie .
5 #### Excellent young adult book , though would I would recommend it to anyone of any age who loves steam - punk or airship fiction .
5 #### There is never a dull moment in Kenneth Oppel 's gripping " steam punk " novel about airship travel . The story is set in the nineteenth century in a world resembling our own in many ways . The world Oppel creates in this first installment of his trilogy ( though the book stands on its own and you do n't need to read the other two novels set in the same universe , I bought the second novel as soon as I 'd read Airborn 's last page ) . The main characters , sixteen year - old Matt Cruse ( a cabin boy on the luxury cruiser Aurora from a modest background who 's still coming to terms with the death of his father ) and wealthy and feisty Kate de Vries , are sympathetic , well - developed and easy to relate to . Together Matt ( at first somewhat reluctantly ) and Kate embark on finding out the truth about mysterious flying creatures that Kate 's grand - father wrote about in his diary before his death . Sophisticated world - building , adventure , pirates and a hint of romance make for a very entertaining read , with the potential to appeal to teens and adults alike .
4 #### This was written for about 12 - year - old boys , I think , not even quite young adult fiction . I guess I thought it a tad too young for any adult . But at its level , a terrific yarn and well - written , with some good life lessons to boot . Takes place in a fictional futuristic Victorian era , where air ships , a la the Hindenberg , take the place of our modern jets . There are even pirates . Kate is a good foil for Matt , and I did appreciate his sometimes sarcasm to her . They are both 15 . Those air ships sailed only hundreds of feet above the ocean , not , as now , 35,000 feet . The cloud cats are a truly imaginary invention . An undiscovered species . Plus the character of the head pirate , Szpirglas , was quite interesting - an absolute cold - blooded killer , but at the same time , a very loving and doting father .
5 #### Kenneth Opal has written probably the best action / adventure book ever . Lots of literary tools and techniques make this novel a winner .
5 #### This is my first reading of The Secret Garden . I had seen the movie years ago . The book is many time greater than the movie . The descriptions and dialogues give such vivid images that one find oneself in The Secret Garden .
4 #### I love the Secret Garden ; it is a classic . I gave this kindle version only 4 stars because it says it is an illustrated classic but the kindle version had not illustrations .
5 #### Read as a kid and always remembered it . 56 years ago .
3 #### I enjoyed the interplay of characters well defined . A sequel would not be unwelcome . This is my first acquaintance with Mr. Oppel 's work . It wo n't be the last !
4 #### Great story , great characters , very creative and it gives an incredible vibe . The vintage feel to the story is very interesting and the fast pace will keep you gripped .
5 #### I 'm not a fan of steampunk and its ilk . But my teenage daughter suggested I try Airborne , and it had me from the first page . Tremendous suspense , great characters , terrific villian . It 's the most fun I 've had reading in a long , long time !
4 #### Good fun in the steam - punk genre . Appealing characters . Fun action . Interesting alternative reality . First book in a series so an important intro to the series if you enjoy it .
5 #### I ordered this book for my 11 year old grandson and gave it to him as a gift . My husband read this book and thought it would be a good read for our grandson
3 #### Was a favorite when I was a child . Still loved it .
5 #### I enjoyed reading the book very much .interesting and the story moved a long nicely .no vulgar words or sexualized wording .
4 #### YA steampunk adventure involving pirates , airships , and a rare creature that may or may not exist ( I wo n't say as that would be a spoiler ! ) . I enjoyed Mr. Cruse ( Matt ) and his ship , the Aurora ( and the crew ) but I enjoyed Miss de Vries ( Kate ) quite a bit less ; and I ca n't really pinpoint why . Yes , she 's rich and young and a bit haughty - but she has moments of bravery , intelligence and fire that I love to see . And yet , I liked her less than Mr. Cruse . * shrug * Anyway , it 's a great action - adventure steampunk tale ; the pirates are definitely not sugarcoated , Kate 's search for the rare creature is intriguing and interesting , and Matt 's own struggles and issues are relatable and make you want to connect to him . So , yes , good book all around .
4 #### I 'm always on the lookout for exciting boy - books for my sons , and my eldest really loved this book . It 's definitely aimed at older teens though . Younger teens might find it a bit hard going in terms of reading level and complexity . My younger son needed a lot of explanation , so it would have been nice if the book had had some kind of explanation of the terms and ideas at the end . But I highly recommend this , it 's really exciting .
5 #### It was weird going back and reading the first book in this trilogy after reading the third novel , but it was well worth it . In this story , set in an alternative world where airplanes were never developed and airships still rule the skies , Kenneth Oppel has created an amazing world , full of adventure and wonder . The story focuses around a trip from Lions Gate to Australia aboard the ship Aurora . Young Matt Cruse and Miss Kate de Vries meet on this journey . In this story we have pirate attacks , ship wreck , an uncharted island , undiscovered species and much , much more . With amazing characters and plot twists I could not put the book down . It is a great read and another awesome book by Mr. Oppel .
5 #### Totally enjoyed the book Read it twice in a roll .
5 #### I 'm reviewing it as a children 's book . For myself , it was a pleasant read , but by no means five stars . I read it only because I recently saw a reference to it as a famous children 's book , and somehow I 'd never even heard of it .
5 #### You must read it . I will make you smile . Children 's wisdom is honest and far deeper than you might think .
4 #### I always loved this book and still do . The only thing that keeps me from giving a five star rating is that there were quite a few typos and I believe it was cut short ... I may be remembering incorrectly but I believe there was more to the ending .
5 #### Assigned text for Children 's LIT class , thoroughly enjoyed it .
5 #### Lots of surprises and different that is for sure but , love it regardless . Great story .
5 #### I love this book ! It was wonderful the first read , and still wonderful many times later . Everyone should read this book .
4 #### I never read this book as a child so decided to read now . I enjoyed it and think its a worthwhile read for teens and older children .
5 #### As the cabin boy of the airship Aurora , Matt Cruse is completely at home in the air . On lookout one night , he spies a balloon in trouble . The crew of the Aurora brings in the balloon and the pilot tells Matt of large flying winged mammals . Matt thinks that the old man might have lost his mind and puts the strange story out of his mind . One year later , the man 's granddaughter , Kate DeVries boards the ship , bringing her grandfather 's journal along in an effort to see the mysterious animals he wrote about . Matt and Kate become close friends but Matt still does n't quite believe the story . When pirates board the Aurora , Matt must do all he can to try and save his ship and his new friend Kate . This is a great read , imaginative and suspenseful . Kenneth Oppel brings to life the workings of the airship , Matt 's love of the air , and Kate 's attempts to prove her grandfather right . I could n't put it down and ca n't wait to read the next two in the series . Highly recommended , even for adults .
5 #### This review is specifically for the Full Cast Audio recording of Airborn ; I have not read the book . My husband bought this audiobook and suggested it as something I would enjoy , even though I rarely listen to audiobooks . I 'm so glad he brought this to my attention . I loved the story Oppel created , with the many adventures , interesting characters , and just enough fantasy to keep it interesting . The primary narrator was , in my opinion , an excellent choice to read Matt . His earnest tone befit this character . Highly recommended for young people and not - so - young people who want to escape into an interesting story well - read by good voice actors .
4 #### This is the first of a series . Book is slow at times but still a good book . The voice on the audio CD was not very appealing . Sometimes purchase or get from library both ( book & Audio ) to finish the book early . There is romance , adventure and a happy ending .... don't want to give too much away and ruin the storyline .
5 #### My daughter and I loved this series . The first two books were the best . The descriptive language is just right , not so much that a younger reader would be bored , and enough that any reader can have the right pictures in their heads . This is a good old fashioned adventure story with both a boy and girl adventurer . I appreciated the lack of stereotyping re . gender . I also appreciated that the story was ' clean ' without being too moralistic . My daughter loves a romance element in her books ( I do n't ) and this series does have that . I definitely do n't appreciate the reviewers who suggest that this is a good series specifically for boys . Just say no to gender stereotyping already ! I would highly recommend , could n't think of any reason to take away stars .
3 #### Anyone who longs for more adventures in the time period and vein of Robert Louis Stevenson and Jules Verne will love this book . It truly is a throw back to these authors , not only in the time period , but the style of writing and the strong characters taking part in the adventure . Matt Cruse rivals Stevenson 's Jim Hawkins in every way , and the rest of the supporting cast is just as strong . Even the main antagonist carries with him admirable qualities both in refinement and intellect that make him more than the one - dimensional bad guy many books in this genre portray . Overall , it starts out a little slow , building toward the action , but once Oppel brings the reader into it , there 's no turning back . It 's not life - altering literature , but it 's a great read , taking advantage of the unexplored world of airships in a captivating way . Oppel is an author who 's authentic to his fantasy , creating believable worlds with believable characters , even in anthropomorphizing animals , like in his Silverwing Trilogy , a task few take on and even fewer do successfully . As this series advances to explore through the various iterations of the merger between adventure and technology , Matt Cruse 's stories , I 'm sure , will continue to captivate readers . I recommend this book to both adults and kids , with its main audience falling within the range of 8 - 13 , geared more toward boys . -Lindsey Miller , [ ... ]
5 #### This was pure delight to read . From the opening when the narrator calls Mary Lennox as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived to the end , this story and the characters held me enthralled . I expected to find the narrative outdated and overly formal ; instead I found a pleasantly lilting narrative voice that readers of any age can enjoy . My favorite moment was when Mary takes the sickly spoiled boy to task . Talk about a battle of wills ! I laughed out loud several times . What a lovely book !

5 #### My sons favorite book as a child EVER ! ! ! He would make me read it over and over ... then when the movie came out we had to go see it ! I will admit the movie was good but the book is in much more detail .
2 #### The sentiment of this book is beautiful , but it is badly overwritten and way too sappy . I imagine there are better books that illustrate the process of grief and recovery .
5 #### Excellent , uplifting story . Although this is considered a young readers book , it is also a real joy for adults to read !
5 #### These characters all worked together to help each other better themselves . A beautiful garden was created through their efforts and therefore all grew happy and well . A very upbeat book .
3 #### This is a fun book for a 7th - 8th grader , but it takes a long time to get moving . The story of adventure and intrigue and fantasy is fun . The mix of fantasy and science - fiction is creative . The back story takes forever to come to light and the number and manner of coincidences is just overwhelming . The hero was always going to be a hero and everything was always going to be OK in the end . A little more tension would have been OK with me , and the various relationships could have been fleshed out more in order to create more compelling drama . To quote a certain television talent judge , " It was just OK for me . "
3 #### Too long . Seems like a lot of repeat and was glad to get to the end .
5 #### This book is an outstanding classic . I would recommend it for all fourth and fifth graders .
5 #### Good copy . Right price ! I have always have thought of this book as a classic in children 's literature and have enjoyed reading it again .
5 #### A classic for all to read and learn the lessons of life .
5 #### Reads easy and quick , sucks you right in . Immediately you are caught up in the story of the young , and poor , cabin boy who works among the rich and drawn into the story with Oppel 's skilled hand . A read page turner towards the end that you will not want to put it down . So good I made an extra trip to the library for the second novel . A great , quick , interesting read !
5 #### I picked this up after reading that the movie rights had recently been bought . Somehow I 'd never heard of the book even though I love the subject matter ( alternative history and flight ) . Well , I 'm glad I found it ! This is a really fun , exciting book . It 's not without its flaws but I highly recommend it , assuming the concept intrigues you . Note : Read it before the movie comes out because there will be a lot that wo n't fit into the movie even though it pretty much reads like one .
5 #### at first , it was kind of slow . i even considered , * gasp ! ! * returning it to the library , but MAN does it pick up near the middle ! i could n't put it down !
5 #### A boy named Matt Cruse has spent his life as a cabin boy on an airship . When pirates attack , the airship is stranded on a seemingly deserted island . When Matt travels farther inland , however , he discovers that the island is home to the pirates ! To add to the suspense , a mysterious animal has been spotted flying around the island ! This fast - paced , highly suspenseful novel is full of action and adventure . As a middle school student , I highly recommend it to middle school and high school readers . Also , it 's worth noting that this book was one of the Young Reader 's Choice nominees for the Senior Division ( 10th - 12th graders ) for 2007 .
5 #### Actually , I only bought this book because Tamora Pierce is in the cast of the audio version . ( I prefer books , so I bought it in book form , but I took that fact as a recommendation . ) I was so glad I 'd taken a chance on this book , too . I do n't particularly care about airships , but in my childhood , I crossed the Pacific several times on cruise ships , and this book has the flavor of those trips . The author writes with zest , and the book is rich for all the senses . The scent of mangoes , the taste of the chef 's specialties , the tactile sense throughout the book , in addition to the sights and sounds evoked by his writing made it extremely satisfying . The characters , the most important part of any book to me , were wonderful . There was depth to them , and there were even minor characters I really liked . The plot was clever , plausible , and full of adventure . I hope Oppel writes more like this !
5 #### Matt Cruse is a low ranking sailor on board the Aurora , with dreams to one day pilot the vessel himself . He is not the only person with such goals , for a band of pirates under the leadership of Szpirglas , seek its riches for themselves . Matt is rocketed into a grand quest when he meets up with the pirate crew , a rich tomboy named Kate , and a dying sailor on a hot air balloon . Airborn is a sonic speed adventure from the first page to the last . In the style of Stevenson 's Treasure Island , Oppel tells a story of pirates , mysterious creatures , and treasure with a unique twist . All of this is contained not in a tale of the seas , but in the skies above them . Bursting at the seams with action , romance , and mystery , Airborn is a book that shows one what happens when dreams take wing .
5 #### I never read this book in my childhood and only recently read it for the first time . The story and characters are beautiful and timeless . I will likely read and re - read The Secret Garden several times .
3 #### As noted in the product description , this is a shortened version of the classic story , written for new readers . There is nothing wrong with it , except that a lot of the magic of the original is in the details , which are rather left out here . A somewhat regretted purchase , because the classic version proved to be almost as easy to read , for a child who loves the discovery of reading , and much more interesting . Larger print is nice . There are no pictures in the paperback copy .
1 #### One of our family 's favorite books - but I do n't recommend this printing at all . The cover is the only illustration to a delightsome book rich with scenery , imagination , mystery and intrigue for the child in all of us . With no illustrations , this copy does not do the author justice .
5 #### Love this classic .... have the movie but never read the book so I thought it was about time to read it ... glad I did
5 #### A really inspiring young adult book . Perhaps inspiring for any age- timeless .
5 #### This is an excellent adventure story ! Matt Cruse has spent most of his life in the air ... on a luxury passenger airship . He rescues a dying balloonist , meets the balloonists granddaughter , sees mysterious flying creatures , and takes on pirates . This action story has it all !
5 #### As my friend said when she recommended this to me , " it 's the best book I 've read since book 6 of Harry Potter " and I have to agree . This story grabs you , and keeps ahold of you throughout the entire book . I 've never been on such a fantastic rollercoaster ride of emotions , adventure and fantasy . Oppell has a wonderful , ingenious imagination . He manages to bring to life things that are found under the sea ( with a dash of fantasy ) to life up in the air . I knew from the first chapter that this book should be made into a movie ; and if that ever happens I will be first in line to see it . His second book , SKYBREAKER , is just as good with even more character development . You ca n't help but fall in love with Matt and Kate and I hope there is a book 3 , soon , on the horizon . I HIGHLY recommend this book for adults , teens and even the elementary schooler . If you like Harry Potter , you 'll love Matt Cruse in AIRBORN . My only complaint : I could not find this book in the average bookstore . My local library had it , but only two copies . I have since ordered it as it 's a book I want to keep in my own personal library to enjoy time and time again .
4 #### I think adults may appreciate this just as much or more than kids , our book club could n't remember reading it as kids but we really enjoyed it now !
5 #### It is a great book . The characters are so innocent . I would read it again at some future date .
5 #### I loved this book ! Was a very good sweet story !
5 #### One of the very best children 's books I 've ever read . I read it at least once every 10 years ( that means I 've read it at least 7 times ) and it never fails to amaze me . This story of the transformation of a whiny orphan and of a whiny motherless child into happy healthy active children is charming , exciting , mysterious and thoroughly wonderful . Perhaps a bit unrealistic , but who cares -- it 's fiction after all . Some of the Yorkshire dialect may be a little puzzling for younger or less secure readers , but the effort to make sense of it will be amply rewarded .
5 #### If you got Robert Louis Stevenson , Robert A. Heinlein , and Lester ( DOC SAVAGE ) Dent together to write a juvie novel , this is what they might have come up with . It is a world very much like our own , but where airplanes have never flown , and huge airships rule the skies . We follow the adventures of an intrepid young cabin boy and a wealthy explorers grand - daughter through mystery , adventure , airshipwreck , and of ocurse , pirates ( there have to be pirates ) .
5 #### In Kenneth Oppel 's fascinating alternate history , the airplane was never developed . Instead , massive airships are the preferred mode of air travel . Mat is a cabin boy on the passenger ship Aurora , who dreams of becoming a crew member and eventually the captain . He is drawn into the orbit of a young , wealthy heiress , who comes aboard with the intent of substantiating her grandfather 's claims about the existence of a previously unknown type of flying creature . Before long , they both encounter not only the mysterious " cloud cats , " but also deadly storms , bloodthirsty pirates , and enough plot twists and narrow escapes to fill a blockbuster motion picture . Recommended for those who crave well - written , thrilling high adventure with engaging characters .
4 #### Airborne sort of reminds me of a mix between Treasure Island and Star Wars . It is a good old fashioned adventure yarn , with equally strong male and female heros . ( I like it when the girl gets to do some saving . ) The idea that flight is n't done with airplanes but instead with airships ( dirigibles ? ) makes for a great concept . Okay , so you 've got teenage heros , a secret island , pirates and weird creatures -what more could you want ? And when does the movie come out ?
4 #### A fun alternate history fantasy for Young Adults ( and older ) . Lots of action , a great plot , and plenty to keep you turning the pages though it takes a bit to get into the story . I look forward to the theatrical release in 2006 . Liam Aiken ( Klaus of " Lemony Snicket " ) will be playing Matt Cruse . Emma Watson ( Hermione of " Harry Potter " ) will be playing Kate De Vries . A couple of really good child actors . I look forward to reading the sequel to this story , " Skybreaker " .
5 #### Absolutely the best juvenile novel I 've read in years ! While AIRBORN is reminiscent of many classic adventure yarns , the characters are nicely fleshed out and much more three - dimensional than those of its predecessors . While this book at first appears to be a young man 's " coming of age " story , the young woman who is his supporting character is strong , funny , and independent -- an excellent foil who easily stands on her own . Even though AIRBORN is obviously an " alternate history " fantasy , the characters could easily be real people . An excellent read , especially for adults who need a break from real life for just a bit . ;-D I 'll be on the lookout for more of Kenneth Oppel 's well - written , substantial ( but fun ! ) books .
5 #### Airborn is a timeless tale of a young boy , Matt Cruise , and his time aboard one of the world 's largest airships . With adventure , peril , pirates , romance , and mysterious and dangerous creatures , this book keeps you guessing till the very last word on the very last page . I enjoyed this book so much that it has become my favorite book of all time . Furthermore , Airborn is being taken to the big screen with a movie adaptation being released sometime next year starring Lemony Snicket 's Liam Aiken . Great book , great story , great adventure .
5 #### Cabin boy Matt Cruse was born aboard an airship . He is as comfortable climbing the struts and catwalks in the airship Aurora as a monkey in a jungle . When a balloonist in distress is spotted in the vicinity of the Aurora , Captain Walken takes advantage of Matt 's light weight and agility to help reel the stranded balloon onto the Aurora . A critically ill old man , rescued from the balloon , is taken to the ship 's infirmary . When Matt visits him , the man asks him if he saw " them " and describes some heretofore unknown winged creatures . On the Aurora 's next voyage , Matt meets an adventurous young lady , Kate de Vries , who is on a mission to find these mysterious winged creatures . The old man in the balloon was her grandfather . He left a logbook behind that described the creatures and pinpointed their location . When pirates attack the airship , events are set into motion that put Matt and Kate into life altering experiences . Kenneth Oppel has created a high - spirited , swashbuckling adventure . As an alternative history with elements of fantasy , this young adult novel will appeal to both boys and girls . I read this book while on a weekend getaway and found it was perfect escapist fare . The sequel is due to come out in December . The author 's website is [ ... ] . Highly recommended .
4 #### A somewhat disappointing book ! I purchased this book because the cover stated that it was the winner of a major literary award ; in addition to that , were the multiple glowing reviews on the inside and back covers . While I have no problem with an adventure story about a dirigible and its crew with a somewhat improbable plot , but what I strongly object to in this book is the repeatedly , totally unbelievable events and escapes made possible by conveniently finding something or someone to save the day at the last moment ( Almost like a James Bond movie ) . Add to this the inane conversations between Matt and Kate and you have a book that could have been great but instead struggles to lift itself above mediocrity . Although a completely different story , it reminds me of the same disappointment , the same letdown , I felt about " Inkheart " , by Cornelia Funke . Now , having read this book , I find it difficult to understand how this book could win a Governor General 's Award ( Canada ) . And then there are the beaming tributes ; for example , " This book is a must read " says the Montreal Gazette ... Well , I guess it 's just a matter of personal taste and preferences : just not my tastes and preferences . All in all , a book that would probably entertain the older child age group ; other readers would be well advised to look elsewhere . However as a Young Adult work I would rate this is 4 Stars , despite my personal preferences . Ray Nicholson
5 #### When I bought this book I was expecting it to be kinda boring .... WOW was I wrong ! ! ! ! ! this is simply one of the best fiction books i ve ever read . The stary centers around Matt cruse , a cabin boy on board the airship the AURORA .... he soon meets a girl named kate who tells Matt of wonderful flying creatures that her grandfather saw ...... and I ca nt say anymore without spoiling the plot ... just read it p.s Kenneth oppel , are you reading this ? SEQUEL NOW ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### This is a sweet , intriguing novel that is beloved by young preteens . The artwork beautifully illustrates the story .
5 #### Somehow I missed reading this as a child . Even though it was written for children , adults will enjoy it . I sure did ! The book was just delightful and I 'm sure I will reread it again and again .
5 #### This a classic story that was writen many years ago . Characters were described very well Over the years I have read it several tims and enjoyed the story .
4 #### This is a lovely book . It was a bit of a skier read but is n't a bad thing . My 9 year old granddaughter had a bit a challenge staying engaged but I will suggest she read it again in a few years . The characters were well developed and delightful .
4 #### This is an imaginative and well constructed juvenile novel . It is set in a parallel world with somewhat different physics and history . Much of the action takes place on a giant airship , a standard mode of long distance travel in this world line , in a somewhat Victorian society . This world is developed well and its features shown unobtrusively through the action of the story . The well constructed plot is a coming of age story with 2 strong protagonists , one male and one female . Several aspects of the plot mirror the underlying themes of overcoming fear and limitations . The quality of writing is solid .
5 #### Having not read this since I was a child I forgot how good this book really is . It draws you in and keeps you capitavated till the very end !
5 #### A special book that clearly defines how important a feeling of wellbeing is , how important love and caring are to people in their formative years . Is it Magic or the Great Joy ? From a child 's viewpoint it may be described that way . Or simply sing the Doxology and all is well .
5 #### A beautiful tale , a heartwarming story . Enjoyed it very much . And the ending was absolutely perfect in every way possible .
5 #### Great book that I never get tired of reading . Takes me back to being a little girl each time I read it .
5 #### Wonderful read for all ages ! One of my favorite books ! Even my daughter and son love it as well ! Slightly magical plot and adventurous tale . Will read over and over again ! So glad I could find this book free ! Will have it for a long time ! :)
5 #### This book is considered a classic , and deservedly so .
5 #### Reading some of the children 's classics again -- totally enjoyed this story .
5 #### I love this , I read it to my hyper cat and it quieted him down .
5 #### What an amazing uplifting story . It makes you stop and think . I will never be a negative Nellie again . Loved it .
4 #### I 'd tried to read this book several times as a kid and , for whatever reason , I just could n't get into it . A friend of mine recently went to a garden center and was so enchanted by the encounter , she said , " It made me feel like I did when I was a kid and read The Secret Garden " . Immediately I felt like I 'd missed out on something , so I got my hands on a copy . She was right . It 's exactly the kind of story that takes you back to being a child . The description of the English moors , Dickon , the language , it was all so beautifully written that I was immediately filled with longing to go there . While the plot itself was simple , and ( certainly now , a hundred years later ) familiar , it was written elegantly and was a pleasure to sink into . It 's the perfect book to curl up with when it 's a rainy day , you 're feeling misty , and you just want to lock yourself away for a little while . Why deprive yourself of that ?
5 #### Very mysterious & enjoyed beginning & ending . Glad had a chance to read .
4 #### I got this book because I remembered the Wonder Works version , and now that I have read the original story , I appreciate how well the producers of the Wonder Works version converted the story for the screen . I would also like to point out that Sara is a very interesting character because many of her changes in the story were external , situational , not internal , yet she was still a great main character .
5 #### Great story about 3 kids who grow together in their secret garden which turns out to be magical for them . And the others they touch ! !
4 #### Read this when I was a girl . I remembered liking it , but had forgotten everything about it . Easy to read , flowing story and a terrific story . Power of mind over matter .
5 #### A classic that is always a great story to revisit . Like ' A Little Princess ' , it is the type of story you reread to escape the emails , the texts , the news and return to your childhood . Take a break , read " The Secret Garden " and feel nine again ...
5 #### The last time I read the Secret Garden was probably in grade school and I honestly do n't remember anything about the book . I 've gotten into classics lately so decided to read it again . I thoroughly enjoyed this book . As an adult , this book had a lot more depth and meaning that it would for an adolescent . The writer painted a beautiful picture where you can visualize the scene as it unfolded . The story of wonder and triumph was uplifting and engaging . I would definitely recommend this book to a reader of any age . It 's an uplifting story that will put you in a good mood and is a great story of growth and hope !
5 #### I gave the book 5 stars because it is an interesting book I was really inspired by it I would like to read more books similar to this one . I would tell any and everyone to read this book because it is not boring it is actually a pretty entertaining book . I mean like when I first saw the book and it 's tittle I thought it would be boring but I actually started to read it and got attached to it I did n't want to set the book down but the like people say , ( Never judge A Book By Its Cover ) so I encourage EVERYONE out there to read this awesome book .
5 #### This is a good children 's book that teaches the power of nature and believing in / loving yourself .
5 #### I loved this book . I loved the characters , the story and the descriptive language . I loved the growth of the characters . It is just plain charming .
5 #### I love this book I read it all the time I even own a paper back book its that good
1 #### terrible book no action .If your thinking about reading this book do n't . You will be bored to death . I ca nt believe someone actaully published this horrid thing .
4 #### I found this to be a sweet , clean story . There are servants but they 're treated with kindness and one is even turned to for advice . No bad language ( for some reason that was n't asked about in the detail ) and it 's truly a nice story . I only gave it 4 stars , however , because the author does tend to go on and on at times . Near the end , the story jumps somewhere else - to help bring the climax I understand that - but it felt like I was taken from the point at hand . And the ending , not quite as big as the build - up , but , overall , still a very good , relaxed , read .
5 #### I have read this at least 5 times and I love this book .
5 #### Everyone should revisit the classics from time to time . Their well written prose is good for the soul . They cleanse the mind and prepare us for something new .
5 #### Thank you for this free book for my Kindle . A wonderful read . Highly recommended !
5 #### It was a great book it was really written good and planned good it deserves 5 stars i would recomend to a friend
5 #### I have read this book many times over the years and it always gives me pleasure . It is well written with characters that grow on you . A timeless treasure to soothe the soul .
5 #### Wonderful and magical .... the human spirit at it 's best ! I really loved this story , and the writer told it with imagination and great depth .
3 #### It 's a good story , it made some good movies . I especially like the one from the 40s , where the garden scenes were in color . Some things went on too long though in the book , like the one character 's Yorkshire way of talking . That got old real fast . Ending slightly different also than movie(s ) .
5 #### A wonderful children 's book for any age . I first read this at nine years old and read it again at 39 . It still delights !
5 #### This book really got me to thinking about how different settings and surroundings can change a heart for the better ! Fabulous book ! I could read it over and over !
5 #### I like this book , I have always liked it when I read it as a child and I like it even more now . I recommend everyone to read it ! I chose five stars because it deserves that !
5 #### I recently bought this book because I remember it from my childhood , and want to read it again , and if I have grandchildren , read it to them .
5 #### This is a truly timeless novel that is well - written and much - loved by many . I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting this story from my youth . In fact , this was my first big , beautiful chapter book I ever owned as a child , a beautiful gift from my older sister that I cherished and was so sad when it got ruined and had to be thrown out . This is a story I will always hold dear to my heart . Love it .
5 #### This is the best book I 've read in awhile . Children are innocent and smart . Mary and Colin were quite the pair . It was actually funny and true to the facts of how something so grim can cause us to destroy our own lives , and through our own thinking we can come alive and not even know how it happened . Everyone should read this book and keep an open childish mind , laugh at the children and as Susan says their playing and believing things will be magic
4 #### Mary is a ten year old orphan sent to live with an uncle she has never met . As a child who is used to getting everything she wants but had no relationship with her parents , Misselthwaite is foreign to her . She is accustomed to having everything done for her , here , she is expected to dress herself and entertain herself . She soon learns this new house is amazing and full of mysteries . After hearing rumors of a secret garden that has been shut off for 10 years , she soon finds herself on a mission to find it . When she does , she quickly realizes this place is enchanted and ca n't seem to get enough of it . After stumbling into her cousin ( which she had no idea existed ) , they begin a new life together in the garden with their new best friend and animal charmer Dickon .
4 #### Read this book to my daughter over the summer we both loved it . Yes I had to make up a few of the words / names because it was hard for me to read at times ( I 'm a nurse not a Lit Major ) but that 's besides the point ! And the cover is gorgeous !
5 #### The book was so much fun to read . Even as a nine year old I enjoyed it It was so much fun .
5 #### I like the story and my granddaughter liked it also . I read the story a long time ago and was glad that she was able to read it also .
5 #### And absolutely wonderful book I downloaded it by mistake and I read it in just a few settings very uplifting
2 #### Personally I was hoping for a view illustrations since it is a children 's story but there is not a single one . It 's kind of useless for me as my eager 8 year old loves to have illustrations with her books .
5 #### I read this book many times as a child , but could n't remember why I loved it so much ! It 's an amazing and encouraging story that will teach you that anything is possible even when you ca n't even imagine anything good happening !
4 #### I like to use audiobooks while I exercise or walk each day . This book was interesting and very excellent for young readers for the hope , thought provoking and look at life from others perspective . I 'm in my 60 's and I enjoyed this book .
5 #### Wonderful ! When you are looking for an old fashioned novel in which the good guys win in the end : this is it !
5 #### This was a fantastic book . The author has such a colorful way of writing .
5 #### Not sure how to rate above but enjoyed the audio book . My mom read this story to all of my siblings many years ago and I saw the movie but wanted to read the book again and was very glad I did . It was very good . Thank you
5 #### It is a lovely story . First time I read it was when I was in elementary school . I just read it again at 63 and I loved it even more .
5 #### I am saving this book for when I have a daughter because it is the perfect book for little girls to read ( and also adults ! ! ) . Sara is brought over to London from India at a young age by her father to live in a boarding school for girls . She is rich and is revered for her money by Ms. Minchin , the headmistress of the boarding school . However , Sara 's father loses all his money and dies , and Sara is now a penniless orphan who must live in the boarding school attic and work tirelessly . But the best part of this book is Sara . She is such a wonderful , sweet child who never lets her money or lack of money get to her . She always acts like " a little princess . " I think we call could learn a lot from Sara- how to always be kind and share with those less fortunate , and shine no matter what your circumstances . I love this book so much !
5 #### The book has nothing to do with the movie , here the lives of the three children are secret , more realistic , no Hollywood glamour leading us to wrong assumptions . The Secret Garden is basically the story of two orphan preteens , obnoxious , feeling entitled , who meet and become friends . Once they meet a boy their age , belonging to the lower class family of 14 siblings , their view of the outside world and their place in it is changed forever . They transform into very like able characters . There is much more , there is the garden and the healing it brings , the animals met in the secret garden , nature in all her glory , playing alchemy in the lives of these three children . The concept of a mother 's love , faith in God , trust in someone , all these discoveries are so important in the lives of the children ... Boys and girls will like the story equally . Enter the world of imagination of children . Lose yourself in the story . Those moral concepts are not portrayed anymore in our century . This book is a real gem for serious readers ...
4 #### It 's just a real sweet story , and an enjoyable , easy read .
1 #### This is n't a publisher - published book . This is Amazon printing the ripped - off text of this book because it 's out of copyright , in a word - processed document , on the cheapest and flimsiest paper imaginable , putting a slap - dash cover on it , and printing it on - demand when you order it . They take every penny , paying nothing to a publisher or Burnett 's heirs . It looks and feels like junk , and it should n't be supported . They ca n't even be bothered to properly format the author 's name on the back cover . Buy another edition . & nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Secret - Garden - Illustrated / dp/1514879565 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Secret Garden : Illustrated</a >
3 #### Love this story . Bought this for my 8 year old , but I think it was more appropriate for a younger reader . My daughter finished reading this in less than an hour . We took another version out of the library so that she could really experience the whole story .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books . I read it for the first time as a child and rediscovered it a few years ago . It 's an old classic , so the language and ideas may be a little quaint for some readers . However , the author has some very profound things to say about the role of positivity in a person 's life . I read it every couple of years .
5 #### This is a classic and not necessarily timely with the discard of sick children . It 's a story of mostly privileged people . However , the mix with more working class characters and their intriguing personalities and gifts makes the story more realistic . It 's a great moral story .
5 #### One of my favorite books as a child . Ca n't wait to read again . Thank you !
5 #### Bought a copy for my dd at her school book fair . Decided I would read it again too . Beautiful story . Will read again and again . Thanks for carrying .
5 #### This book is a essential for the library of any young reader . And an old friend to bring any reader back the wonder and magic we all recognized as children and lost sight of as adults .
4 #### The book was a little long , but I had to finish .
5 #### Been a favorite for years ... now my grandchildren will be able to enjoy it , too .
5 #### 5 stars . Magical story on second chances and what friendship and kindness can do . I would read this to my kids .
5 #### All girls should read " The Secret Garden " by age 10 . And then , they should re - read it frequently . I have read " The Secret Garden " more than 20 times and am delighted every read . One of the best lessons is that when you help someone else , you also help yourself .
5 #### This book held my interest from the first page through the last page . I highly recommend it . I am 45 and loved it . This would be a wonderful read for a younger audience as well . It is clean and uplifting .
4 #### nice story . Enjoyed the easy listening and refreshing to read about kids with skills to help each other .
4 #### If you can stand an early 20th century look at privilege , gender - stereotype , and dismissive global politics , this is a fine story .
4 #### Loved this book as a child , did not read after installing
4 #### I liked it , but not as much as I had hoped I would . Perhaps because I loved the movie more .
5 #### Sara is a very determained person though a child . Even in spite of Ms. Minchin 's unkindness to her and Ms. Amelia being a weak hearted fool , she did not give up hope . Her princess dream came true through the Indian Gentleman . All in all , this was a good book on perseverance , kindness , hope , and determination . Sara was kind to Becky and she became not so timid . A princess always has a big heart and Sara had a big heart . A lovely story indeed . Oh ! One more thing . Sara pretending her doll was a human was funny . Her befriending the friendless was kind . Of course she had her moments of anger and sadness but all in all , she was truly a little princess !
5 #### I have all of Jill Barklem 's books and Winter , Spring , Summer and Fall are my utmost favorite . These books are outstandingly beautiful and knowing that I can at least have my favorite 4 with me on my Kindle on my ipad , made me very , very happy ! Her books just make you all warm and cuddly inside and really bring out the wonder of a child out from inside of you . I was also delighted to see that the color and print was the same as the original paper books which made the Kindle books just as great , and there were no middle seams to contend with . I am a woman , 65 years young , and am very grateful for Jill Barklem 's wonderful imagination and her lovely books , Amazon , and Kindle for allowing me to continue to forever enjoy the wonder of the lives , homes , families and adventures of these tiny mice creatures ! Forever Young and in Love and Light , JoAnna Y Ps . Oh , and one more thing , I would highly recommend these books and the Kindle edition ...
5 #### This is a joyful little story about a Winter storm arriving at Brambley Hedge . The mice make the best of it , with a huge Winter Ball . It is very festive , with the intense , detailed artwork and all the interesting characters . Although the publishers should have printed it larger to enable the viewers examination , it still keeps the interest of a 3 - 4 year old and older ... even adults :)
5 #### this is just too sweet ! two mice getting married ? the pictures are so lovely , so much going on in them and the story is so nice . it is a great book !
5 #### Poppy Eyebright and Dusty Dogwood are mice that live near a stream . One hot summer they begin to date , and then they announce their engagement . They marry and have a very pleasant wedding ceremony with all of their mousy relatives . The book is quite interesting with its reminders of the customs of times gone by , like engagements and trousseaus . Kids can also learn from it how people use to survive hot weather without air conditioners . The book has about 800 words .
5 #### The Brambly Hedge books remain one of the sweetest picture book series ever to be concocted for the kiddie set . Of these , my favorite has always been " Summer Story " . The plot is not particularly complex . In it , two little mice ( Dusty Dogwood and Poppy Eyebright ) have become engaged and they prepare for their summer wedding . Similar in many ways to Beatrix Potter 's books , the Brambly Hedge series is published small , for small readers . Kids will enjoy the pleasant story while taking particular interest in some of Barklem 's more impressive drawings . Her elaborate Rube Goldbergesque illustrations of the Dairy Stump and Mill are delightful . There is an attention to detail in these books that does not go unnoticed . For those kids who are , as of yet , too young to enjoy Brian Jacques " Redwall " books , the Brambly Hedge series may be right up their alley .
5 #### Cute story . Book was in great condition ! No issues with seller at all !
5 #### The books in this series are among our children 's favorites , as well as mine . We have several sets .
5 #### Jill Barklem is the ultimate in story telling and illustration . Winter Story follows the tiny inhabitants of Brambly Hedge through preparing for a snowing winter and culminating with merriment at a very festive and food filled snow celebration .
5 #### Our copy of Summer Story and Jill Barklem 's other Brambly Hedge books will never our home . I never tired of studying the detail of her illustrations and reading the stories to my grandchildren who are delighted with the mice characters . These books are the best of the best in children 's books .
5 #### Beautifully illustrated stories that are great reads for children . They still inspire my imagination as a mama who reads with her children .
5 #### Bought these for grandkids - my daughter has the whole collection from the 80's , and I wanted to have the other grandkids know this magical world .
5 #### Instead of focusing on their birthday month etc . , I have the cup and plate and we have tea parties , and talk about the ' season ' in which my grandchildren ( now great grandchildren ) are born .

5 #### The Brambly Hedge series is one of our family favorites . I would purchase this book again , and for my children and grandchildren .
5 #### The Brambly Hedge series is a lovely set of books . One of my children 's favorites . I would purchase this product again .
5 #### Needed this book to complete my series . It was in excellent condition . I look forward to sharing this book with our grandchildren .
5 #### This is the first book of Ms. Jones that I ever read , and it was so good that I have since searched out and read everything of hers that I could find ! A terrific tale with captivating characters ! ! Beautiful , spoiled , megalomaniacal young witch Gwendolyn believes she is destined to rule the world , and her timid , good - hearted little brother Cat is swept along with her plans and is left holding the bag when everything goes wrong ! Please read this book , you wo n't be disappointed ! If you like this one , I also highly recommend The Power of Three , Howl 's Moving Castle , and The Magicians of Caprona !
5 #### I read this first many years ago . It was my introduction to Diana Wynne Jones . I love Chrestomanci 's world where magic works and technology lags behind our world . I love the growth of Cat as a character . The ebook has a series of short notes about the universe that are well worth reading . If you like the Harry Potter series , the Narnia series , or Lloyd Alexander , I think you 'll like this series .
5 #### I 've been looking for this series for a long time . I enjoyed it as a child , and even more so as an adult . Great author , awesome series , wonderful book , fantastic adventures , and much more . One of my favorites .
5 #### Cat Chant and his sister Gwendolen are orphaned , and move to Chrestomanci Castle to stay with distant family . This is set in an alternative reality , where magic is controlled by the Chrestomanci and his team of world - hopping magicians . I first read this as a young teen , and still drop in on it , 30 years later , when I want a comforting , nostalgic read .
5 #### I ca n't believe I waited so long to read Diana Wynne Jones . She is amazing , and the Crestomanci series has been a joy to me so far . I started here , with Charmed Life , and I have shot through the sequels with increasing delight . Eric " Cat " Chant believes himself to be useless in the field of magic , unlike his brilliantly gifted older sister . When the children are orphaned , they are taken in by the mysterious figure of Chrestomanci , and taken to live in his strange castle , where odd dangers seem to lurk around every corner , and Cat finds it increasingly more difficult to understand what 's happening , especially when his sister disappears and is replaced by an exact duplicate ! Is the strange , lofty figure of Chrestomanci friend , or foe ?
4 #### A good book for older children with solid character development and and imaginative plots to keep the story moving . I thoroughly enjoyed the book , even though I am a much older child .
5 #### Just a complete joy to read every line a jewel . A must read for the child inside of us all .
4 #### Enjoyable . Fantasy just the way it should be . Funny and well written . Ms. Jones is in her element . Have fun reading it .
5 #### I have always loved Dianna Wynne Jones ' books . The whimsy and the humour always makes me feel better . Thank you for the lovely tales ms Jones !
5 #### CHARMED LIFE , the first of THE CHRONICLES OF CHRESTOMANCI , was possibly the best and definitely the most memorable . My daughter wore out our family 's copy -- hope the electronic lasts as long .
4 #### I read Charmed Life as a child and the book has stayed with me . As an adult I could n't remember the title or the author but I did remember the story . When I realized the book I had such fond memories of was written by Diana Wynne Jones , the author of Howl 's Moving Castle , I decided to read it again . Charmed Life did n't disappoint . A friend of mine bought this book for her 9 year old daughter who loved reading it . The book is set in a parallel universe were magic is commonplace . England in this parallel universe is slightly quaint and magic is an extension of every day life . The themes are common in children 's books that deals with magic : a young protagonist who learns about his past and his place in the world ; conflict within the family ; an antagonist who threatens to overthrow the natural order . In fact in the basic set up there are many similarities to Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone .
4 #### A ca n't put it down read , nicely done with descriptive sentences that take the reader deep into the realm of Chrestomanci
5 #### Read it when I was a child and then again 30 years later . I still love this book and was sad to hear about the authors passing .
5 #### The book was very good . I just got my kindle for Christmas this was my first book . Not much direction with it but managed well . Thank you
5 #### This is truly a great fantasy book . I was instantly hooked on the characters of Cat and Chrestomanci , and could n't put this book down . I went right out and picked up all the other books in the series that were available at the time , and have since picked up any new ones as soon as they came out . This is by far my favorite fantasy series !
3 #### Charmed Life is about some kids who go to study magic with one of the official guys in charge of magic . He has a couple of kids of his own , and they are the usual school age to have the school age disagreements and fights and not being nice to each other that goes along with that . The eldest also gets a bit peeved at being thrown in with the young brats , too .
3 #### A young boy , Cat , must deal with his crazy and selfish older sister Gwendolyn who is obsessed with her own magical powers . Certainly much slower and less exciting than Jones ' Howl books ( read : more for children ) , but still has her enchanting and seemingly effortless style that captures a world where " magic is like music " . Jones is always a good read . The characters are mysterious and thoroughly enjoyable . Gwendolyn is ambiguous and silly and selfish and delightful . Cat is an innocent ; Chestomanci is Jones ' typical ambiguous and passive wizard . The imagery of magic , particularly Cat 's matchstick nine lives , is absolutely delicious . Grade : B
4 #### In Charmed Life Eric -nicknamed Cat- is always being pushed aside by his much more magically able sister Gwendolen who is the only remaining member of his family . After their parents died Gwendolen and Cat go to live with a witch named Mrs. Sharp who takes a keen interest in Gwendolen 's magical abilities . Since Cat ca n't do magic to save his life she is far less interested in him . After a few years of Gwendolen taking magic lessons Chrestomanci , who is the most powerful enchanter in the world , takes an interest in the siblings and sends for them to come and live with him at his castle . But there is something strange about this castle and it inhabitants . Gwendolen claims that this castle is ruining her witchcraft abilities . Is it smart to take revenge on the most powerful enchanter in the world ? I thought this was a wonderful book and it was almost impossible to know what was going to happen next .
5 #### Charmed Life is the greatest book by the greatest of all children 's fantasy authors . Head and shoulders above Harry Potter . Eric ( also known as " Cat " ) is someone with whom you sympathize from the very first page . His sister Gwendolyn is also sympathetic , but .... well , you 'll find out . There 's a standard rule of drama that a new major character ca n't be introduced past the midpoint of a book . Whenever I hear that rule , I think of this book .... I do n't think the author of that rule had this in mind ! One word of warning : This book is marketed as " the first book of the Chrestomanci series . " But this is n't really a " series " at all -- these books really are independent of each other .
5 #### Long before Harry Potter there was Cat Chant . This book is enormously appealing and well written for people of all ages , though it is aimed towards children . I first read it when I was around 13 , and I 've continued to enjoy it since . It 's the the story of a pair of young orphans Cat and Gwen Chant who are sent to live with an old friend of their fathers after their parents death . They discover much about magic and themselves ( at least Cat does ) in this lively and well written book . This is not the only book by this author set in this magical universe , but in some ways it 's still my favourite after all these years . One more short story featuring Cat can be found in the author 's book " mixed magics " .
5 #### Diana Wynne Jones is one of my favorite writers , and I think I 've read her entire ouevre . I really admire and enjoy the skewed way she mixes references to contemporary British society with whacked - out fantasy , bad puns and truly numinous mythic resonances ... I've found her novels to be caught in the netherworld between Intermediate Fiction and YA Fiction , but I consider that a good place to be --- it 's like she writes the book that needs writing instead of worrying about its ultimate age - appropriate audience , and this may be why she 's not more widely - known in the US ... Too many folks insist on easy - to - categorize books for younger readers , and hers are anything but easily categorized . Charmed Life was one of the first Jones novels I read , and it remains one of my favorites . In a Britain very close to our world 's Britain , but with the rather important difference of magic - users being commonplace rather than legendary , a mild - mannered young boy named Cat is coping with his aggressively - talented sister , his orphan state , his left - handedness ... and his process of self - discovery is a wild ride and a wonderful read . Highly - recommended .
5 #### I love all the Chrestomanci books , but this one was the best ! ! ! ! The detail of the characters are amazing ! Cat 's personality is really funny , I even kinda like Gwendolyn . If you have n't read this series yet , you should probably start with The Lives Of Christopher Chant , to learn the history of Chrestomanci . If you have already read all the other books , then do me a favor and read this one ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Cat looks up to his sister Gwendolyn more than anyone else . It 's prefectly obvious why , she 's a very powerful witch . And ever since the two sibling 's parents died Cat has clung to her every day . And when he 's sent to llive with Mrs. Sharp , all she wants to do is nourish Gwendolyn 's gift . But when there sent to live with the fabled Chrestomanci Gwendolyn is more or less put in her place . SHe is not allowed to pratice witchcraft . SO she sets up into proving the Chrestomanci wrong and porving that she is the most powerful one of them all . But Cat know 's what his sister is capable of and when she dose something so powerful , he 's the one who has to fix it . Like many people I found the title of this book on a online list called " what to read after Harry Potter . " When I read this I was very entertained . Cat 's story is thrilling and suspenceful . I reccomend this book to fans of fantasy books such as Harry Potter and/or Tamora Pierce . Though it 's not as good as JK Rowling 's creations it 's definatly a novel any fantasy lover should put in their collection . I 'm planning on reading the other four novels in the series too . Read it you wo n't be dissapointed .
5 #### CHARMED LIFE is the first of Dianna Wynne Jones 's Chrestomanci Quartet , and is delightfully charming itself , especially because it 's such a magical and hilarious work that has an extremely involving plot . Cat and his sister , Gwendolyn , are now living in a vast and immense Castle , Chrestomanci Castle . Gwendolyn herself is a witch , and though she 's quite a good one , she gets angry quite easily -- a darkness brews inside her that she ca n't control , and her spells are powerfully dangerous . When she is angry over the rules she has to put up with in Chrestomanci 's Castle , she begins to conjure up many schemes to get rid of Chrestomanci himself once after all . Cat does n't know how to stop his devious , stronger sister -- already she 's gaining to much power , and goodness knows what she can do with her witchcraft ! Cat needs to somehow be brave , but he does n't have magic in his own blood . That 's why it would take more then human powers to stop Gwendolyn 's evil ! From magical schemes to destroy everything Gwendolyn despises to a talking upset Dragon who 's blood is wanted to a charmed pair of diamond earings that can never get lost by constantly screaming , ' I belong to Caroline Chant ! ' , Charmed Life is a hilarious and delightfully enjoyable novel that sparks an excellent written expression and humor , never failing to amuse but offer a good scare just as well . Dianna Wynne Jones has written a very charming novel .
5 #### This book is a wonderfully imaginative tale of an alternate England , mixing Victorian society with the practice of magic . I first read the book when it was marketed to adults , and loved it then . The characters of Cat , his sister Gwendolyn , Janet , and of course Chrestomanci , are all vividly drawn and come wonderfully to life . Do n't be put off by the YA cover , this book can be enjoyed by fantasy lovers of any age .
5 #### I nicked this book from a friend in 6th grade . I read it eight times that semester . Cathy was ever so cross when I finally gave it back , and refused to ever lend it to me again . Its an awesome book . I was mesmerised by the story . Eric and Gwen are just plain cool concepts . Oh yeah , and in THIS world , left - handed people are COOL . I LOVE this story . I like it MUCH better than Witch Week .
5 #### A favorite Berenstain book of my children I was happy to find it for my grandson .
5 #### So happy to have found a copy of this book ! my favorite as a child .
5 #### The book was in great shape and my Great Granddaughter loves it !
5 #### My Grandson is learning to read and just loves this book .
5 #### I have been looking for this book for years .
5 #### All the Berenstain 's books are good . Excellent book for really little ones . My daughter thought of her self as the beautiful ballerina . I did n't ask her who she thought of me as ...
5 #### This book is an absolute classic . I loved it when I was a kid and I love reading it to kids as an adult .
5 #### This book has been around for a long time and we are passing it along to the next generation . :) We bought it to read to our grandson because my husband enjoyed reading it to our children when they were growing up .
5 #### My Grand daughter 's favorite book as a young child . I am now buying them for Great Grand children !
5 #### Read it to my daughters , and now to my grandchildren . Great for early readers .
5 #### So sad this is currently out of print , but this copy was very nice , as described .
5 #### This is a fun book to read and my children loved it . It focuses in items whose name starts with B and gradually builds into a decrescendo of an ending but that 's part of the fun of the book .
5 #### My kids - especially my older daughter - loved , loved , loved this book . It 's fast , repetitive , and fun . I had to buy a replacement for my grandchildren , because my own kids wore the original out .
5 #### I bought this book for a " Send your favorite " baby shower . When my sons ( 38 and 40 ) heard what I had ordered , they immediately began reciting from the book ! I knew then that I had made the RIGHT choice .
5 #### For ages 3 and up ... and 70 plus ! I 've read the Berenstain Bears books to all three of our children . And then to our grandchildren . And now -- to myself as I sort and reminisce . What a worthwhile fun trip -- simplicity and yet the story builds up with every B object until we have -- -- Big brown bear , blue bull , beautiful baboon , blowing bubbles , biking backward , bump -- and so forth until -- And that ending is just plain rollicking ! What a creative and fun mess , with such storytelling illustrations , this book is !
1 #### The book was tattered and torn with pages that had been taped long ago . Not at all happy with it ! !
5 #### My Dad read this to my kids and now we can read it to the grand kids !
5 #### This was my son 's favorite book as a toddler and I read it so many times I still have it memorized all these years later . And when he opened it for Christmas to read to his son , he just laughed .... so yes , it is a great book and a great memory !
3 #### We bought this after our daughter loved the ' A ' book so much . It was a great title for a learning reader and it 's simple vocabulary and engaging illustrations made us regret that the series stopped with ' the C book ' .
5 #### If you do n't buy the B book for your child or grandchild then they are missing out on a wonderful childhood favorite !
5 #### I remember this beloved book from when I was a child and first learning to read . I loved it then , as I do now . I recently bought a replacement copy FOR MYSELF , as my children misplaced it somewhere along the way . My lady asked me for whom I was purchasing the book and I responded truthfully , " Me . " Got ta love the Berenstain Bears ! I do , and I 'm 47 ! I find myself often reciting the book whenever I 'm feeling the need for a little lift of my mood and a spontaneous smile . Indulge yourself and any little ones in your life . You wo n't regret owning this classic .
5 #### This is a favorite children 's book . It has everything a good story needs - tension and humor . All written for the easy reader . My two year old grandson loves it and I have it memorized .
5 #### for getting your kid introduced to his / her ABC 's . I also have the Berenstain Bear 's A Book and C Book . My kids love the funny pictures and topical sentences .
4 #### During the night , my little boy tipped over his toy bin and used it to scale his bookshelves . This morning there were a pile of about twenty books on the floor and he wanted me to read every one of them . For the most part , he would lose interest after a page or two , but a few he listened to right until the end . Those books deserve a write - up . That he listened all the way through The Berenstains ' B Book surprised me . I did lose interest after about the fourth page , but he was loving all those Bs , so I read it to the end . This is a silly little book , which , not shockingly emphasizes the letter B. It becomes quite a tricky tongue - twister long before you reach the end of the book . I could n't really tell you what specifically my three - year - old liked about the book , but he did really enjoy it . The illustrations feature the funnel - snouted animals of the Berenstains -- cute and colorful , but not easily recognizable , and , therefore not my favorite style . Again , my little boy liked all the silly images and colors , even if he did n't believe me that the bear was supposed to be a bear .
5 #### We ordered this book for our grnad daughter . We had this book for our two daughters and they delighted in memorizing the catchy words .
5 #### I read this book to my children 35 & 38 years ago and they loved it . My new 14 month old grandson loves it as well bringing it to read to him many times a day . Alliterative and repetitive , when read with expression , it is great fun for us all . I think it is out of print so I was delighted to find this .
5 #### I loved this book as a child and I bought it for my nephew to carry on the tradition . It is a silly book about words that start with the letter B and it 's so much fun to read .
5 #### I Bought this same book in 75 for my son . It was his favorite . Read it so often I memorized it and it became a family joke . Bought it 4 years ago for my grandsons and this one was for my sons daughter . Still a family favorite .
5 #### This was my husband 's favorite book as a child . We were sad to see it is no longer in print , but so overjoyed to still be able to find a copy in very good condition .
5 #### Great book for teaching toddlers to talk . Read it to my kids and now its great for the grands . Love these books
5 #### Teaching the next generation to love books ! My grandson is really enjoying this book . It was as funny this time as with my children .
5 #### I got just what I wanted when I recieved this product . Condition was as it was stated when I ordered it . I loved this book as a child and am greatful to own it now as an adult . Great way to teach young children the letter B.
5 #### My family discovered this book when my younger brother was the age for picture books , and we all loved it . In fact , we can still quote it by heart . The book is really just a list of things that start with the letter B , but the Berenstains have managed to create a story that 's a lot of fun with it . We follow the results when a bear , a bull , and a baboon blow bubbles and bike backwards . What happens ? Well , they bump into all kinds of things . And the more they bump , the more absurd the book gets and the more fun it truly is . As I said , we all loved this book . It was clever and charming and so out there you ca n't help but laugh at it . Each page pretty much repeats what came before while adding a new layer to the chaos . And the illustrations capture what is happening perfectly . This is a true classic picture book . If you can find a copy , you 're family will love it .
5 #### I buy this for everyone who has a baby as it helped me learn to read . I love this book .
5 #### I loved loved loved this book as a child ..... I use to see if I could read the whole book without making 1 mistake ( I do n't think I could ever do it ) these are the kinds of books that children should be reading !
5 #### I loved this book when I was a toddler and now my daughter loves it . This book is fun and easy to read even for young children . Much better than the similar A and C books .
5 #### This is one of the best first readers to start your little ones ' library with . I read this so many times to my kids that I knew it by heart . It is a FUN .. way to share time with your little loved ones .
5 #### The text consists of words beginning with B with a minimum of any other words . This is a great idea for teaching beginning readers , and I wish there were more books like this . The illustrations are cute and the the story is funny . In other words , it 's by the Berenstains . If you like the Berenstains , and if you like picture books with alliterative text , then you have two good reasons to try C is for Clown , 0001714422 .

3 #### This Book is funny and is full of B words , like " big brown bear , blue , bull , beautiful baboon .... " Another B phrase is added each time so by the end it 's a long phrase . There is a surprise at the end for a sad Baby Bird . ( my daughter dictated that paragraph ) This is n't Berenstain Bear family book , with Mama , Papa , Sister and Brother but is a celebration of an important letter . It 's fun to read out loud with a swingy feel to it .
5 #### It was my mother who first introduced me to the world of Narnia . I brought home a school book order in which she found a boxed set of the Chronicles of Narnia and ordered them for me , despite the fact that I had never heard of them . The day they came , I was fascinated by the elaborate case and covers , and I could n't wait to go home from school and begin reading . Opening " The Lion , the Witch , and The Wardrobe " , I began a marathon reading session that lasted until Mom called me for supper , and a love affair with Narnia that will last the rest of my life . What a wonderful gift Mr. Lewis gave the world with these books . I have tried several times to figure out which book I like best , but I have never arrived at a suitable answer . For me , all seven books seem to run together as one great , beautiful story . Every so often ( very often ) , it is wonderful to escape into a world of kings and queens , fauns and dwarves , dryads and dragons . To finish , I can only say , " Thanks , Mom . You have never steered me wrong ! "
5 #### Adolescent and adult readers alike enjoy these books . They are certainly a favorite of mine , the kind of work one continues to return to read throughout life .
5 #### Lovely books . The covers are brightly covered and there are illustrations all throughout the set ! This is great for my 2nd grade reader . She does nt LOVE chapter books yet , so its fun for her to still have some pictures throughout . Love the story and C.S. Lewis never disappoints !
3 #### This book was not in the condition I expected . It said " very good , " but it 's " good " at best . The book is whole and complete , but the paperback cover has tears and folds .
5 #### bought for grandson and he loves . i will be borrowing them from him to read
5 #### He was so surprised to see how many stories their were . So glad it 's all in one book and not too bulky .
5 #### These are my favorite books of all time , that i have read and reread over the last 50 years . Being able to have them on my Kindle so I can read them anytime or anywhere is great .
5 #### We really enjoy this set and have listened to these stories many times . Each book is read by a different actor and they are very well done . My personal favorite is Alex Jennings reading " The Horse and His Boy . "
5 #### What s to say , they are small compact and perfect to go be as a gift .
5 #### Great series for a great price . My kids have enjoyed it .
5 #### This was a great intro into a new world full of wonder , magic and the parallels of our own . C. S. Lewis is indeed a Master storteller leaving you eager to read more !
5 #### This is quite rightly a classic of children 's literature , I reread all the books at least once a year .
5 #### What can I say , it 's classic C.S. Lewis . The whole series is genius . I discovered I had not read them in proper sequence first time around . They are marked very clearly here .
5 #### I really enjoyed the narration on this audiobook . I think that the addition of some very animated animal characters in this book was much needed and really helped to make the world of Narnia come to life . There is so much hidden meaning in this book that I am sure I could read it again and again and discover new things each time . The visuals in this book are brilliant and really transport the reader to another world . The story itself is well told and keeps you interested . I look forward to the next book in the series .
5 #### Our daughter just turned 5 and she loves these books . We finished the first book within 2 weeks ( busy otherwise we 'd finish sooner),she looks forward to the second book and so do I !
5 #### I have always wanted to read the Chronicles of Narnia . I recommend this book to anyone looking for a smile !
5 #### So convenient for the kindle , and when all together a pretty fast read . This is a wonderful set of books to read for everyone who loves an imaginative and expansive realm of possibilities with an inquisitive mind .
5 #### Our favorite CSLewis book ! My 6th graders loved it too !
4 #### in my opinion , Not as good as The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe .
5 #### I read these when I was in my early teens , now , 20 years later they are still just as good as I remember .
5 #### Very interesting tale by C.S. Lewis . My third graders are reading this in school .
5 #### Even better than the movies ... I was quite pleased . Little wonder Narnia has become a love for all ages , any generation . I will most likely read again ... and again .
5 #### One of my favorite books . This particular version is quite compact , but the traditional illustrations are still in here , I think all of them .
5 #### This was a Christmas gift to my eight year old granddaughter . I definitely recommend The Chronicles of Narnia to all children . The artwork in this set is lovely .
5 #### This set of books is a classic . Everyone should own it .
5 #### Somehow these wonderful books have been " dumbed down " in versions since the original printing . Nice to find one written so adults will enjoy them .
5 #### An absolute read for anyone wanting to get away from the world for a while
4 #### While the cds are very well done and entertaining to listen to , you can not read the book while listening to the cd . I wish I would 've known that before purchasing . I would 've still purchased it , but my kids ' expectations would 've been different .
5 #### Good books nice packaging . Bought to use for sleep but I can not as they are dramatized and often have loud noises . I found the book a boy and his horse hard to get through . Good books for kids .
5 #### Great book for the grand kids . I recommended it !
5 #### Our Grandkids love this series and the readers were exceptional !
5 #### Even the third time reading ... I also have it as audiobook , so I can hear as well ... the whole series is fantastic and especially for pre to teen to adult ...
5 #### great stories I enjoyed them as fi my grezgesnckids
5 #### My 10 year old granddaughter was not dure she would like this series . She LOVED it .
5 #### It is a clever beginning to great adventures for us all to use our imaginations . I highly recommend it for all ages .
2 #### This was a huge book and would have been impossible to hold to read !
5 #### beautifully done - my granddaughter began reading it immediately
5 #### Love listening to the CDs while long driving trips .
1 #### I know that the whole series involves magic , but this one is just pure witchcraft . There is also the A word in this book . I am very disappointed . Also , i felt like there were some parts thay the author really did not need to put in here . BTW if you have read the warriors series and looked at the reviews then you should have saw a review with Mintstar in it and i am Mintstar .
5 #### Great book I loved it . Liked Harry Potter your gon na love this book . It gets a little boring sometimes but when it gets intense its very intresting .
5 #### Got this box set of the Narnia books for my grandniece last Christmas . She LOVES it !
5 #### Returning to Narnia is like seeing family you have n't seen in years , and picking up right where you left off . Comfort , familiarity , and yet surprises in things you had forgotten . Such a treat to spend time with C. S. Lewis .
4 #### I really enjoyed reading this story all over again
5 #### Obviously the books are good ; this is a convenient format to have them all in and its cheap . If you plan on reading this for years to come or pass it down eventually then buy a hardcopy or set of hardcopies .
4 #### A bit light and sometimes goofy , but sweet and magical as well . Plenty of interesting and cool back story . A fun read , and fast .
5 #### A wonderful old - fashioned style tale that sets the stage for The Lion , the Witch & the Wardrobe . Read the series - it will bless you .
5 #### Fantastic narration brought this story to vivid life ! We enjoyed this classic thoroughly .
4 #### The collection I previously read in the 1960 's , started with The Lion , the Witch , a and the Wardrobe , and ended with Prince Caspian . It was a 3 book set . This was my first time reading this book , and . It explains the whole creation of the Narnia World . It may have been banned back then because . of it 's Biblical nature as a comparison . The beginning is good . 3 of the . middle charters were murky , and the last 4 - 5 chapters made the book a very good read .
4 #### The information on what form this would come in was always a little muddy . I heard the hardcover was One Volume , and the paperback was a Boxed Set , so I bought the paperback and it came as one volume . Whatever though , it does nt really bother me since I m not a collector and I just wanted a copy to read . Only I would ve bought the hardcover had I known what I was truly going to get , because the hardcover had illustrations apparently . Either way , its a classic and I m looking foreward to reading the whole thing ! Only I ca nt bring it anywhere because its probab the heaviest book I own . Maybe if you 're going on a long flight or car ride than take it with you to read , otherwise its kind of a daunting task .
4 #### This is a single column copy of The Chronicles of Narnia . Having them all in one volume does make them a bit more difficult to read through , since the single volume is quite large to hold . But it is a great way to have multiple copies for multiple kids . The covers do get mangled pretty easily and end up ripping off . The story , of course , is fantastic and completely a must read . This particular format is problematic . I think if I had to do it over again I would buy a boxed set ( which I have bought two or three times- these are very well read books around here ) . The Chronicles of Narnia are easily readable on a sixth grade level . Kids around third grade can read them if they are decent readers .
2 #### Meh . I love C.S. Lewis . He is an incredible theologian and is very articulate when it comes to explaining doctrines and ideasI have loved reading some of his non - fiction novels . However , I just do n't care for him as a fiction writer . While the story has an incredible allegory to it , his ability to write a story is just bland . Beautiful ideas , but I do n't care for his writing style when it comes to fiction .
5 #### This is an excellent book to read to young christians ! I read it to my four year old and he thoroughly enjoyed it !
5 #### Great to have all 7 stories in one volume .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Unfinished - Volume-1 / dp/1523674237 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Unfinished ( Volume 1)</a>&nbsp;this was always one of my favorites when I was young . I love the books the movies were ok but the books are better .
3 #### .We had to read it for school in 6th grade and my teacher suggested getting the series so I did . I ordered them off Amazon and was so happy !
5 #### Do not bother with any other version of this box set .. this is the one you want . Spend a little bit more money and get this one because its worth it for the quality .
4 #### I always loved this story in general because of al the great adventures throughout it . Basically , Edmond and Lucy and their cousin Eustace are sucked into Narnia to help King Caspian in his quest to find his father 's seven Lords that were key friends helping his rule that were kicked out of Narnia by Caspian 's uncle ( from Prince Caspian ) . What always bothered me in this story is that there is not much emphasis on Edmond but lots on Eustace and Lucy . I feel like that was a bit weird to me but he was really useful and had some important scenes too with interactions with other characters . It shows how he has gained wisdom over time . I do n't know . I think actually now that I have finished this , I should have rated Prince Caspian higher because I think I liked that book more than this , though I never used to . It is funny how your tastes can change over time . My sons really loved this story and were really drawn into it wholeheartedly . They 'd probably give it five stars .
4 #### It has been a very long time since I last read this book . I actually forgot a lot of the details throughout it , so it was a nice refresher course to read it with my sons . They really enjoyed it too . I always remembered this being one of my least favorites of the books , but it was much better than I recalled . Prince Caspian is a boy who lives in Narnia and hears fairy tales from his nurse about talking animals , kings and queens that fought battles , and a lion who saved them named Aslan . His uncle keeps telling him to not believe in such nonsense . All the while Lucy , Edmond , Susan , and Peter return to Narnia while waiting to go to boarding school . They start to remember things that perhaps they shrugged off in the past year . Why are they back in Narnia ? Definitely cute ! !
2 #### I had read these as a child and loved them . Reading them with my daughter , I was both delighted ( to share an experience of my youth ) and also , increasingly , appalled . It is n't the religion that bothers me ... but Lewis comes off as something of a crank even by the standards of his time : dumb characterizations of reformist trends within his own society , casual racism , and - again even by the standards of the time - a remarkable sexism . I 'm not talking about the big stuff that is the focus of articles ; rather the casual comments about " boys are like this ... ; girls are like that ... " This is n't simply the novels being of a different time . It was shockingly regressive even when it was written . Was my daughter excited about the talking animals ? Yes , but the truth is the prose is pretty awful , the descriptions long ( at least for a six year old ) , and the models of virtue pretty awful by any standards ( and , as it happens , I 'm fairly conservative and raise my family accordingly ) . A " classic " ? I suppose , but not one that I would recommend
5 #### These Chronicles truly deserve the title Classic . C.S. Lewis was the master storyteller without a doubt . This particular contribution to literature I have been reading literally all my life . Every few years or so the urge comes to disappear into Narnia for relief from this worlds cares . At 77 years of age I enjoy every page as if it were the first time . I would like to see these Chronicles built into the NZ Education programme . It would open kids minds to whole new ways of thinking .
2 #### I did not receive the book described . Though it is a complete collection of the Chronicles of Narnia , it is smaller and does n't have the wonderful pictures shown on the description , plus it is n't in very good condition . The binding for the back cover is broken . I am sorely disappointed . I already have one very similar to this ( and in better condition . ) I was hoping for the beautiful one described because I wanted to give it to my grandson .
5 #### Wonderful story and Derek Jacobi 's narration is top notch !
4 #### This is a great series for the young and the young at heart . It continues the adventure after the events in the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe and the stakes are higher with the life of the heir to the throne being in danger . The writing style shows that this is a children 's book , but there is danger to the characters that makes the reader aware that its not all rainbows and daffodils in Narnia ; there are bad persons around and the influence of the White Queen is not totally gone . I liked the book and recommend it , especially for children who like fantasy , its lots of fun
5 #### These are beautifully written , engaging tales that everyone deserves to have read to them . There are a few Britishisms that younger folks may need translated , but the magic of the stories is n't spoiled by that .
5 #### I 've of course have read Narnia many times . Reading the first book in order now I can see the connection to the Narnia book . I 'm excited for the next one .
5 #### The best audio recording of a book or series that I have ever heard . I 've never tried graphic audio but I ca n't imagine it being much better and this is a hundred dollars less . The voices fit Lewis 's world and characters perfectly . It is dramatized yet not abridged which is wonderful . The Horse and His Boy is by far my favorite . A really great set that is worth the money and does the source material justice .
5 #### This book is a C.S. Lewis tour de force . When you start reading the book , it begins like a childrens novel . However , as a Christian , Lewis guides the reader into a profound understanding of Christ and his personality through the behavior of Asian , the lion . Unconditional love but with the same strength by Asian to guide the growth of the children into a profound level of maturity by example . This book is highly recommended to those raising children and wanting to do the best they can in teaching principles of life and unconditional love .
5 #### Loved this book . Seemed to start out slow , but got very good . Did n't want it to end so I 'm glad it is a series !
1 #### Crappy set , no box as depicted on the product page . Do not want to give this as a present like I planned . No quality to the books . Returning
5 #### I read them all , then gave them to my niece . They 're good Biblically - based books .
1 #### This was not like the movie did not like it
5 #### Such an inspirational set of CDs . They hit this one out of the park
5 #### Excellent & Timeless book , one of my all time favorite book series that I never get bored of . Love this book so much I made sure I got copies for family and friends . Its Worth the money
5 #### Wonderful , timeless stories . Good enough to read more than once .
5 #### How beautiful a tale this really was . I am 37 years old and finally read this book . It was to my boys at bedtime but it was very hard to put down . C.S. Lewis is a lovely writer and I most definitely has his vision easily through his descriptive narrative .
5 #### This is one of those " must reads " that I never got around to so I got this volume which has all seven books of the Narnia Chronicled in one package . I think it was an excellent decision as the books are presented in the order in which Lewis wanted them read - not the order in which they were written . I know this is a work of children 's fiction but it captivated me from the get go ( this " child " is in his 6th decade ) . If you 've never read any or all of the series then this is the way to get them , unless of course you can afford the set of hardback editions . If you are a fan of fantasy you will not be disappointed . So settle in your favorite chair , with your favorite beverage , sit back and enjoy .
4 #### I love the stories ! But the book itself is a bit heavy and awkward to hold , but it does have seven stories so I guess you have to expect that .
1 #### The cover pictured was what I wanted , but its not what I received . If you 're going to sell something , your listing needs to be accurate .
5 #### I try to reread the Narnia books every couple of years . I want to know Aslan there so I may know Him better here .
3 #### This is the first book in the Narnia series and it laid a good foundation for the rest of the series . The language was easy to read for the target audience and the black and white line drawings add a nice touch . I can see why this series is a classic and would recommend it to any adult who wants a book that may stimulate a child 's interest in reading .
5 #### I love every word C.S. Lewis writes . I think this book should be read before"Lion , Witch , Wardrobe "
5 #### I have enjoyed these books since I was in fifth grade . I bought the series for my grandson for his parents to read to him . My children loved these books too and wanted to pass that love to their children .
5 #### This is the first of the stories about The Tales of Narnia . It is well written and can be read by a youth . There is no foul language . The story itself is quite enjoyable . It is a tale of adventure involving children . It is a story with magic , clever chidren , foolish adults , and talking animals . The story itself has clear religious symbolism . There is lessons about friendship , loyalty , and selflessness . C. S. Lewis is a very fine writer . In the past I have read his non fiction works on Christianity . The author brings a recognizable style to this fine work of fiction . As an American I completely enjoyed the author 's use of British figures of speech , As a grandfather I find this to be a great book to read with a grandchild . Thank You ...
5 #### And again I journey to the Land of Narnia to visit with old friends . This time , having read " A Hobbit , A Wardrobe , and a Great War " by Joseph Loconte , I was a bit more prepared for the rich symbolism . I could also see the views Mr Lewis had of the world in which he lived . I had my Kindle in my hands almost constantly until I had read all seven books through . In addition , I read ' The Magicians Nephew " first . It made sense to me .
5 #### Beautiful and perfect timing . My daughter has to read Chronicles of Narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe for her senior paper .
5 #### Loved this - listened to the audible series for every book . Having never heard / read these books before , it was a bittersweet ending . Loved the series for sure !
5 #### My second favorite book , next to the lion , witch , and wardrobe !
5 #### Do n't even bother with other Audio book versions . These are the only ones you want to listen too !
5 #### Start here before you move on to the movies .
5 #### I have not read the Chronicles since I was a child , and I love returning to them . I think that these should be mandatory reading in schools since it is real literature ( as opposed to what is offered by schools now ) , and also accessible to children .
5 #### We love these books & ordered them for my son . We are two books in & really enjoying it . Quality of books are good & come in a nice set case .
5 #### I love this series . Every family should have a set and reader more often in their life . Children should introduced to these books .
5 #### My daughter loves this , I love it , and I even have my husband listening to it . Radio theatre really brings this to life .
5 #### it 's narnia ! of course it 's good ! I love the movies but I love using my imagination in reading even more !
5 #### The final book in the work The Chronicles of Narnia . I found this very entertaining as the narration was performed by Patrick Stewart and his voices for the different characters especially the mouse was delightful . As we come to the end of the adventure Lewis leads us to Narnia .... Heaven where we all eventually meet . Written especially for children of all ages ... recommended to everyone . I can understand why this series is listed on many lists of books that should be read at least once in a lifetime .
5 #### read all 7 books in less than a week , just could not put it down
5 #### I 've loved this book since I was little , it brought back memories of childhood
5 #### Great quality book , never order mass production before but it had pictures and everything else the original had . Shipped fast as well . Very pleased .
5 #### A great version of the real thing ... I loved hearing the old stories again ! !
5 #### Book 2 of the series The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the best stories for children . An exciting and entertaining story and it does not surprise me to find the works on most book list . Highly recommended for adults to read at least once .
4 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Chronicles - of - Narnia - Box - Set / dp/0061992887 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Chronicles of Narnia Box Set</a > Please note that this particular product set does not match many of the reviews posted . This is a very small set of B&W books . They have small B&W illustrations . Do not expect a large color book set as some reviews claim . The Narnia stories are outstanding -- I do n't think any of us need to write reviews about the book content -- the Narnia reputation is well known . I think what most buyers want to know is what type of book sets these are . And for the record again , this set is SMALL and BLACK / WHITE with no interior color illustrations .
5 #### I love everything Narnia . This book is everything Narnia . I have the movies and now I have all the books --- EXCELLENT
5 #### Beloved classics from my youth . Still a great read .
5 #### Purchased for a young girl as a gift and was enthusiastically received . She is an avid reader and had not read these so was very happy with this gift .
5 #### Probably the most fun and thrilling books I read . I can get so lost in here and I hate to see them end . Read these every couple of years . It is so easy to just get lost in the reading . These work on so many levels . They can be kid 's books , but I can still enjoy them immensely ( and I am mid 60s ) . If you want to read fascinating and fun books , this is it .
5 #### This book is inspirational . Everyone should read it . Christians will find truth that C.S. Lewis was took from his understanding of the Bible and non christians will find the story of good over evil , discipline and character a real encouragement .
5 #### A must have for The Lion , Witch , and the Wardrobe fans , good reading , start in order
5 #### LOVE CS Lewis . This , the beginning of Narnia , is my favorite of the Chronicles .
5 #### We listened to this series on a family road trip this summer and the kids were mesmerized the whole time ! Who knew that an audio presentation could hold their attention even better than screens and video games ! The books themselves are some of the best children 's literature ever written and C.S. Lewis ' classic stories are brought to life in an exceptionally entertaining and engaging format . You 'll love every minute !
2 #### The packaging is nice but the books are numbered in the wrong order sequence . Very disappointing .
5 #### Wonderful set of books , granddaughter fell in love with it .
5 #### This is a wonderful production of Narnia . It 's easy to stay awake because it 's acted out instead of read . The map included is also great ! Made our time in the car go by quickly !
5 #### One of the very best stories in the history of excellent stories . Good binding . Very readable .
5 #### A gift for our Granddaughter that she was enthralled with . All I know .
5 #### What a fabulous series of books for a young Christian to read ! ! ! ! My son and I are both reading this books . I wanted to get into some CS Lewis to pursue more of his writings later in his life , but I instantly realized that my son would love these too - and he does !
5 #### I loved it . If you were familiar with any of the Narnia series , either in book form or movie , then you would understand that the series is an allegory of the life of Christ ( Lion Witch and the Wardrobe ) and how His message affects Christians in their earthly journey . Well , " The Last Battle " is an allegory of the battle at the end of the Thousand year reign of Christ , and the recreation of heaven and earth at the end of the book of Revelations . It is C. S. Lewis ' view of the falling of the stars out of the heavens and the destruction of the earth by fire that makes phenomenal reading .. As allegories go , Lewis is able to destroy Narnia as he envisions the destruction of heaven and earth and the creation of a new heaven and new earth , which is not boring at all . It allegorically explains who the opposition to the rule of Aslan is , and the kind of deceptions the anti - Christ and false prophet.will use to woo people to unbelief . It makes me want to go back and reread the Narnia series from the beginning .
3 #### HarperCollins boxed paperback edition looks very cheap . It 's good for those who want to just read the books , not for fans or those who want a beautiful set of Narnia books . It 's better to save up some money and buy a hardback set .
5 #### I have read all 7 books in this series many times- they are always exciting , thought provoking and excellent . CS Lewis was a master not to be equaled
5 #### A great classic and page turner . The sentence structure / wording is of old and some British cultural references make reading a little slower . But a wonderful story well worth it .
5 #### This book is absolutely beautiful . I gave it as a birthday gift to a 9 year old ( in addition to the Harry Potter series which she already knows ) . She loved it ! She did n't know this series so I was happy to be able to give her something as nice as this for her introduction .
5 #### I love the series and love that it is all in one book .
4 #### The book was good but this is my least favorite Narnia book just because the plot was n't as interesting as the others .
5 #### I remember my mother reading these books to me as a child , so knew I needed to buy this hard - back book containing all 7 books in this one edition . The print is small , but I hope to read it to my grandchildren one day .
5 #### Beautiful set , numbered in order that the author preferred that the books be read . Full color illustrations , smooth lovely paper for pages . REALLY special .
5 #### A very enjoyable read for all ages . Just purchased the next book in the series which is The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe .
5 #### Hands down amazing ! If you are waivering on this , waiver no longer . It 's great ! ! And , we got it for around $ 40 on Amazon though we had previously seen it for $ 80 . So I 'd wait for the lower price if you can bc who does n't love a great deal ? ! !
5 #### Read Mere Christianity and wanted to read his Chronicles of Narnia to compare the writing style and vocabulary in his children 's book with Mere Christianity . Was n't dissapointed with the stories or the religious analogies .
5 #### It was a gift and he was very happy , he loved having all books in one .
5 #### I have read this entire series multiple times since I was a child . I think it should be read to or by all children . The story and the truth inside it are invaluable to all .
5 #### It used to be that there were certain places where you could get into Narnia -- a wardrobe , a train station , the grounds of a particular ( and not very good ) school in England , for example -- or you had to have magic rings . Unfortunately , those places no longer work , and the rings are gone . But a wonderful thing happened , and the world changed : Now , you can get into Narnia wherever you are . You just have to have one of these books with you , and open it , and there you are . If you have n't been , I 'd highly recommend it .
1 #### This Harpers edition places the books in the WRONG ORDER . Do not buy this for your kids ! It will ruin their Narnia . ( And there is a good scholarly discussion on this controversy , documented on Wikipedia . )
5 #### I love it because my non reading grandson loved it and read the whole set .
5 #### A great gift for my 10 year old . She loves to read , and these books were perfect .
3 #### I have had The Magicians Nephew by C.S. Lewis read aloud to me at Summer Camps when we were falling asleep . But I would always fall asleep before we finished it so I never knew what happened . I had a lot of time with the school year ending so I decided to revisit it and read it for myself . And I was kind of disappointed . I had great expectations for it since a lot of people I know talk about loving it . This book is about Polly and Digory who get sent to a place between worlds and accidentally bring back an evil witch . I know there is a great debate about which book to read first , and I asked around and my friends , who love the series told me to start with this one . I think I was disappointed by this book because I had such high expectations for it and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read it younger . I would recommend reading this book to younger kids , maybe around the same time as you would read Harry Potter .
5 #### this is a gift , I read forty years ago and just remember the message which is redemption beautifully written
5 #### One of the best audio series I 've heard . Dramatized , yet almost exactly true to the book , word for word . The only qualm is Aslan 's voice , but nobody seems to do that right .
5 #### absolutely fantastic , just wish author would have been vegan
5 #### A book that can recapture the imagination , time and again . I love every second of it . Every page . Every word .
4 #### This is the fastest I 've read any book lately . I should probably have been sleeping part of that time ! I do have a bit of a problem with C.S. Lewis ' ( Frank the Cabbie 's ) theology on salvation , but the story is engaging , and has many allusions to the Bible , without being preachy . No wonder this has been popular since 1955 . This was the 6th of the Narnia tales to be written , but it gives the background to the others .
5 #### This series is a classic -- and it 's not just for children . I first read all 7 books when I was in 4th grade ( 40ish years ago ) and re - read them every year or two . I often give the series as gifts to children , and the audio version with David Suchet ( Agatha Christie 's Poirot ) is truly wonderful .
5 #### I thoroughly enjoyed this series when I was a child so I was very glad to find all of the individual books combined into 1 volume for my children to enjoy also .
5 #### I love being able to listen to these books ! Such great stories . Good actors reading the parts . Nice sound effects . Enjoyable .
5 #### I loved sharing this with my family . They are inspirational stories to build and explore their imaginations . I especially love their experiences with Aslan .
5 #### We have read these stories to our children for years . They especially liked hearing them when we were traveling long distances by car .
4 #### A great gift for fans . Came shrink wrapped & in perfect condition . Very pleased .
5 #### Somehow lost the boxed set in all our moves . This all - in - one volume is a perfect replacement .
5 #### I read all of their other Narnia books by C.S. Lewis , and somehow missed this one . I love this whole series .
5 #### I bought these in paperback because I could not find hardcover individual books that I could afford . These are beautiful . The original illustrations have been colored and , in a little larger format than the original ( or the ones I had first),they are wonderful . This is my 4th set of the Narnia books ( they keep wearing out ! ) and by far the best I have had . Wonderful editions of my favorite books in the whole world !
5 #### Insightful broaden my understanding not only of World war I but Tolkien and Lewis as well
4 #### Thai book was a great read that introduced Narnia and how it came to be . It explains the wardrobe also . Highly recommended for fans of the movies .
5 #### Over the years , I have heard about this wonderful collection of stories , and have seen the movie , The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe , but had never read this extraordinary series . In reading the series , it became clear to me that , in a way , they are a summary of the Bible , beginning with Aslan singing Narnia into existence much like God spoke the universe into existence , and ending with a new Narnia , just like the " new heaven and earth " , spoken of in The Revelation .
3 #### Great stories , but the book is absurdly big - totally impractical - and the spine is far too stiff . I made a bad decision in wasting money on this ; I threw it out and got the easy - to - handle paperbacks .
5 #### This is not just an audio book , it has a full cast of voices each one tailored to the part . It is like a movie except you get to use your imagination . Seriously , they did such a good job with these , it is a better version than any of the movies ! They are exciting , true to the books , and really draw you into the story ! They are the best recordings of a book series I have ever heard ! PS This set includes all 7 books in the series .
5 #### Wish I read this when I was a kid . A great prequel to the famous CS Lewis novel .
4 #### This series is produced by the group that does Adventures in Odyssey . The acting , effects and orchestration for these Narnia audio dramas however , are superior to even those productions . This series makes Lewis ' stories come to life . This is great for families to listen to together on long car trips .
4 #### This book is an amazing book . It is sympathetic to both the side against Narnia and Prince Caspian 's side . I love it .
5 #### Loved when I first read it and I am enjoying it once again ! Beautifully written stories and only C. S. Lewis could create .
5 #### Nice , especially for a lower level reader or someone learning Hebrew , as it has the vowel markings . ,
4 #### I have read the book along with my son since it was a reading assignment . I enjoy the entire series and this book is just as good as the others I have read .
5 #### The chronicles of narnia is held dear to the hearts of all those who read it and can be considered one of the greatest book series of all time
5 #### Bought this for grandsons birthday . Love the books , love the movies .
5 #### One of the greatest adventure stories told to children and adults alike . Complete with Christian analogy and life lessons . One of the best . Great to have it all in one volume .
5 #### I thought the Chronicles of Narnia were kids books until I read " The Last Battle " . Suddenly I realized I was listening to someone like the John of Revelation describing things too wonderful for the words that he had available . Surely Narnia is a kids place . Thank goodness I lived long enough to understand .
5 #### Never read some of the stories , really enjoying it
5 #### We love this series and it is so fun to listen to add a family . The narrators are fantastic , extremely well done !
5 #### Enjoying the color illustrations . Would have liked hardcover but way too expensive . This is a nice paperback set .
5 #### Books are always better to a good reader , but these are PHENOMENAL for road trips ! ! Certainly better than the movies which were near disrespectful of CS Lewis ' genius as a Christian fantasy author . These radio drama are absolutely true to the books and children as well as adults adore them !
5 #### Huge book as expected . It is n't something you can easily carry around . If you plan to read it while out , then I recommend finding smaller versions that split the book in parts .
5 #### One of the greatest series of books ever written . I will continue to read these even when my kids are grown .
5 #### I read these books years ago . It so pleasant to revisit this series . A recommended read for all C.S.Lewis fans- as well as - of fantasy readers of all ages .
5 #### i read it as a child and now my kids are ready great series never ever out of date
3 #### Having not read any of the other Chronicles of Narnia I was surprised by how simply this was written . Made for a quick and easy read , but I found it boring . I thought there were some interesting religious insights , but I am not interested in reading any more of the series .
5 #### It 's CS Lewis . It 's Narnia . Nothing else needs to be said .
5 #### I loved these books as a child and now I 'm loving being able to share them with my 8 year old . He begs to have more time before bed every night so we can keep reading .
5 #### A wonderful beginning to a beautiful series of stories . Not only are the biblical references a delight , but the pieces that hearken to modern literature are so much fun to discover . Even Stephen King and Peter Straub have " borrowed " bits from Narnia such as a Talismanic apple to save a dying mother after a quest to retrieve it . Not a children 's story by any means , although it can be read and appreciated by children of all ages . Any reader who begins the series with " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " has missed out on a spectacular backstory of the beginning of the world that is Narnia .
5 #### I 've loved these as a child and even more so as an adult . I bought this set to introduce my 8 year old nephew to the magic of Narnia .
2 #### I Jx sjsk sjs sja ajs djdt did DJs DJ disks SK sjs sjs . Jsks . Is xkv d j f
5 #### after more than 40 years of reading these stories , I still recommend them to everyone . i 'm about to pass this set down to the next generation as a gift to my grandson .
5 #### I bought it as a gift , and my sister lovedddddd it ! Really cute presentation and its just awesome .
5 #### The Last Battle : The Good , the Bad , and the Ugly The Good Quote : Possibly the greatest picture of Heaven outside of the Bible is given in the last chapter of this book . I wo n't put all that here , but just the end of the end . Which is , I think , the best kids book ending ever written . Have you not guessed ? There was a real railway accident , said Aslan softly . Your father and mother and all of you areas you used to call it in the Shadowlandsdead . The term is over : the holidays have begun . The dream is ended : this is the morning . All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page : now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read : which goes on forever : in which every chapter is better than the one before . The Bad : This is CS Lewis . He does nt write bad . Period . The Ugly : Off all the Narnia stories , this is the saddest . You can feel the frustration and disappointment of the characters until the final chapter . I love it .
5 #### This is one of the best audio reads I have heard . Each full - length book is read by an outstanding British actor : Kenneth Branagh , Michael York , Alex Jennings , Lynn Redgrave , Derek Jacobi , Jeremy Northam , and Patrick Stewart . It 's bedtime stories for adults , as well as children , as only C.S. Lewis and these most excellent actors can produce . There are no disappoints here . None .
5 #### Best quotes from Narnia ! ! After wearing out The Chronicles of Narnia by reading them over and over to our four kids - my kids bought me a new set at Christmas . Here is the new book one , which use to be book 4 or 5 or something . This is as confusing as Star Wars . Anyhow , here is the Good , the Bad , and the Ugly . The Good Quote : I liked the little section where Digory " has the wild idea of saying [ to Aslan ] ' I 'll try to help you if you 'll promise to help my Mother , ' but he realized in time that the Lion was not at all the sort of person one could try to make bargains with . " Since Aslan is the Creator in this book , it was a great reminder not to think we can make bargins with God . We obey because He is , not to get . The Bad : This is CS Lewis . He does n't write bad . But I 'm guessing he never even went 4 - wheeling , and that makes me feel good . A man should n't be good at everything . The Ugly : The Magician is ugly , and sad in the story . As Aslan says to Polly about the Magician , " I can not tell that to this old sinner , and I can not comfort him either ; he has made himself unable to hear my voice . If I spoke to him , he would hear only growlings and roarings . O Adam 's sons , how cleverlyh you defend yourselves against all that might do you good ! "
5 #### I have not read all of these books myself , and I have not read ( the ones I have read ) them since I was a young child . However , I love these stories . I bought one boxed set for my 9 - year old daughter and one for my 12 - year old stepdaughter . The writing and the stories are awesome and engaging . I have n't met a child who does n't like these books .
5 #### AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL . So incredibly well done , we listen as a family . We give it a billion stars !
5 #### This classic series can be read over and over and over again ! Our paperback copies , bought about 40 years ago , finally gave up the ghost , so we wanted a hardback set , and this seemed to be good value !
4 #### A long time favorite of mine since I was a child - now I get to share the stories with my child . So convenient having them all in one book !
5 #### I bought these for my 14 year old granddaughter . I read them when I was younger and we had the older videos of the Lion , Witch , and the Wardrobe , etc . I loved these books and still read them again once in awhile . My granddaughter loves them ! ! Narnia is a wonderful place to visit and re - visit . Would recommend these to all ! ! All the talking animals , Aslan , the wonderful lion , so much in these books ! !
4 #### Five stars for the Chronicles of Narnia , minus a star for the bonus books . The latter provides a glimpse into the evolution of C.S.Lewis ' writing , but my nonscholarly interest slacked off quickly . Once again , I totally enjoyed re - reading the Chronicles . It 's rather a winter ( snowed in ) tradition .
5 #### Lewis crafts a masterpiece with so much truth interwoven , as to bring joy to the heart . He captures the realities of struggle , evil , joy and joy . Read , and re - read often .
3 #### Great to have the entire collection at my fingertips but I find the typestyle tedious to read
4 #### I always considered The Chronicles of Narnia as purely a children 's book and I was very wrong . It is not on the same level as " The Lord of The Rings " trilogy , but I did find it very engaging and thought - provoking . I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys fantasy works of fiction .
5 #### I read these for the first time in just the past couple of months . I was awed by how much Lewis includes in his stories , things that you can pull on , rely on , relate to , etc . , in real life . To me , it still gives hope , and I thoroughly believe that anyone without an imagination is doomed to living a life of misery and dullness . I would recommend reading this set in the order written , not the current numbered order . One needs to experience Narnia from The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe first ; then once The Magician 's Nephew is read it fills things in nicely . If you were to read the later first , it would likely not leave the writer with as much fulfillment of filling in things as it does when read later .
4 #### Oh How I would love to give a 5 star review but frankly , the cd 's are annoying . Yes , the production is quality , and the vocals are spot on . However , if you 're playing these on a computer or Ipod , BE AWARE ! the CD 's are mislabeled . Each book / cd set has 4 discs ; 2 or 3 will be mislabeled such that any disc , be it 2 , 3 or 4 will have some other data information . So if you 're putting this on an ipod type player , you will be spending time RELABELING EACH ENTRY , including the track names . If you do n't mind this , then DO get the set as the set is the BEST out there . Just pitifully pathetic in the copy / labeling department .
5 #### Love these books ! Great for all children and imaginative adults .
5 #### Love these books ! Great for all children and imaginative adults .
5 #### Immerse yourself in the magic land of Narnia and the adventures of Prince Caspian . CS Lewis simply could not write a bad story about our favorite land !
5 #### The first tale of Narnia truly , though not the first written . Explains how the wardrobe came to be and a right wonderful yarn in its own right .
5 #### Of the seven levels in the series , this is one of the top three . The magnificent , wonderful adventure !
5 #### One of my favorite sets of books for all ages . I was first exposed to Lewis in fourth grade when my teacher read us The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe . I 've read the series countless times since then , as a child and as an adult , on my own and to my kids . We went through so many copies ! Great stories , and underlying spiritual truths .
4 #### I 've had a box set since I was little and when I started rereading mine after all these years , my nephew got curious about them . He 'd seen the movies and liked them and he 's getting into reading a lot more so this was one of his Christmas presents this year so he 'd have his very own copy of the books . At first he was disappointed when he started the first book because it does n't have the characters from the movie , but I urged him to give them a chance and that it does tie in with the other stories . He just finished the first book the other day and said he really liked it after he gave it a chance and he was just starting the next book . It 's fun to see old books like this I read as a kid being read by new generations . I 'm glad nephew has been finding new books to read outside of all the Minecraft stuff .
5 #### This is where it all comes to a close . Lewis rounds up the themes and characters of the classic Narnia series in this final chapter of the saga
5 #### These stories are amazing , really awesome . I ca n't believe I only discovered them at age 60 . Apparently all the world knows how compelling , vivid , and exciting they are -- but somehow I missed that memo . So if you have kids ( age 8 an above , perhaps ) let them read or start reading to them . And if , like me , your 60 , enjoy , enjoy , enjoy !
5 #### Great book to teach about heaven and the work of Christ to children and adults .
5 #### this is a great book series , set was in better than stated condition(excellent condition)excellent price , quick ship
5 #### There are many aspects of this book I absolutely loved . The story is wonderful . It is different than most other books . There is great dialogue and the adventures are exciting . The characters are my favorite though . The characters are created so realistically ( for talking animals at least ) and they all have dimension . Really , the only thing I dislike about it is that it starts slowly . It sets everything up , and that s great , but I prefer books that have me from the beginning . I recommend this book specifically to anyone who loves C.S. Lewis of course . Prince Caspian is also great for young adult readers , as well as anyone who is a Christian or who enjoys religion and/or Christianity .
5 #### The Narnia books are challenging and exciting for children and adults . They are great yarns , beautifully written , and provide examples of courage and honor , treachery and selfishness . This prequel sets the stage for the original first book - The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe - and is a great book on its own . Enjoy !
5 #### My parents read Narnia to me when I was a child . I also watched the BBC version on VHS . It was a world so truthful , so engaging , and so magical , that it has an eternal nature for me . I do n't feel as much that Lewis created Narnia , as found it . I 've recently had the privilege of reading the series to a child in my life over the past three years . She 's not as into it as I am , and she does n't even remember the first half of the series anymore . We started when she was five and finished when she was eight . Sure , there 's sexism and Christian influence and racism . Maybe this is part of the strength of the narrative , as we see these things reflected in our world as well . I do n't think it 's the ideal children 's book , or the ideal story [ with so much emphasis on war and conflict ] .
4 #### Well , very different from the movie . Still a great story !
4 #### A wonderful tale and yet with a slightly different feel to it .
5 #### Gift to my granddaughter , ca n't wait to get into it
5 #### When it comes to " The Chronicles of Narnia " I think it 's all already been said . Each story is beautifully written and can be read as stand - alone volumes , but the richest benefit is gained when one reads the entire set in its recommended order . I can not comment on the quality of the construction of the individual volumes or the box they came in . This product was purchased as a gift that has not yet been opened .
5 #### 10 year old Granddaughter was happy to receive as a gift
2 #### Like the audio but the book itself is a bit dull . I 'm a 6th great teacher using it in the classroom to teach adventure . If it were my choice , I would not use this book . I just do n't care about the characters at all . The adventures are cute and can be fun , though .
5 #### Love this book series . And I love focus on the families radio theatre .
5 #### Timeless story of good vs evil and the good guys win
5 #### Great addition to the set I was building for my granddaughter .
5 #### Addition to the set I 'm building for my granddaughter and she loved it .
5 #### We grew up reading these books and loved them . Bought them to read to our children as they grow . The stories teach good principles and are uplifting .
5 #### This gift was given as a recommendation from someone else and I am glad that I purchased them . The recipient was so elated .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia are in my top 10 most favorite books . The books are such a classic that you get something new with each reading , and as you grow in years . I have returned to read them over and over over throughout my life . For those who are spiritual , there is much depth if you look for it , but not immediately apparent -- part of the beauty of C.S. Lewis ' writing . These have stood the test of time and are considered a classic for these reasons and many more .
1 #### I expected a boxed set of paperbacks with the " Chronicles " but got instead a hard cover containing all in one book . The book looked beautiful but will hardly be picked up because of the small print and weight . I loved these stories and wanted my nephew to devour them .
5 #### Exactly as described and came on time :) great price as well
5 #### I bought these for my granddaughter . They were the first chapter stories I read with my daughter when she was about the same age . I have them in hard back for my own library .
5 #### Great book , written for kids with interesting perspectives for adults .
5 #### Bought this as a Christmas present ... Looks great , in condition I ordered it in .. shipped great ... ca nt wait to see them open it .
4 #### I really like these story lines and C.S. Lewis 's other books . My only complaint with this series , is that it is hard to read ( especially out loud to someone ) because of extra long sentences and commentary . It 's hard to explain but , as a sentence is written there will sometimes be a backstory told within the sentence , and then by the time you get to the end of the sentence you are sort of lost . Other than that I really like the books .
5 #### THIS IS A VERY , VERY NICE BOOK AND IT IS FULLY ILLUSTRATED WITH EVEN THE MAPS INCLUDED . IT IS AN EXTREMELY GREAT BOOK AND THE ONE THAT I GAVE MY NIECE FOR A GIFT WAS GREATLY APPRECIATED BY HER . FAR EXCEEDS THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION .
5 #### Just re - read these three books . It was fun to experience the characters again ( the first was when I was an early teen ) . The characters are classic so lovable it is easy to enjoy the books time and time again . Some friends do n't like the " religious overtones . " I think if you want to see those you can , if you want to enjoy a great fantasy story , then they are that as well .
4 #### Not the best read of the series but still worth the time .
5 #### Both me and my 10 year old love it
5 #### What always surprises me about this book is the excellent job CS Lewis does of incorporating the theology of eschatology in a children 's fantasy .
5 #### One of my favorite series of all time . I 've read and re - read these books multiple times , and I 'm already looking forward to reading them again . I love Lewis ' writing style , I love the storyline , the characters , the world he created and the overall imagination involved . The books are technically children 's books , but I enjoyed them as a child and an adult . There 's definitely a Christian message behind the books , but it 's balanced at a point where Christian readers can enjoy and learn from the themes , but it 's not so overpowering that a non - Christian reader could n't also enjoy the books .
4 #### The book was complex and strategically plotted from the start . It is just that many readers ( including me ) had a hard time understand the beggining until they saw the plot . The story does have great ideas once it gets going . Do n't stop after ten pages or you will miss out on a great book . Peace , Roberto Wick 12 Years Old
5 #### A classic Lewis tale . One has no doubt about who is good , who is evil . Highly recommend this book for personal enjoyment or for reading out loud to the children .
5 #### This was a really enjoyable book . My son really liked it . We have never read the series we have only watched the movies . The book is better .
5 #### A classic and I am glad to glad to get the opportunity to read it .
4 #### It had a good build up but a couple sections in the middle are kind of boring . Overall it 's a great book but not the best in the series so I give it 4/5
5 #### This set is a classic . Written for young teens , at speaks to the discerning adult as well . Well worth the money and time to read .
5 #### Such a great audio theater of a great classic children 's books . My children are just loving these and I 'm enjoying listening to them as well !
5 #### Bought this for my niece for Christmas . I already am a huge fan of the Narnia series . Have been since I was like 10 years old .
5 #### Insanely amazing series ! Love love love ! Imagination for adults and teens . These stories are my all time favorite . Takes you through a journey of adventures but still keeps it clean . Christian author and references but I believe it can be enjoyed by all . The voices and sound effects make you feel like you are there with the characters ! Done with absolute excellence .
5 #### My kids loved this whole series in this last book was so much fun and it really gave you a desire and dream to be in heaven .
5 #### Predictably wonderful . I have read this series many times and find it enchanting .
5 #### An engaging , fun story , which it is not hard to read as if I 'm a part of it , and it 's no waste of time . One who acknowledges the Bible as God 's inerrant word will see many parallels between this story and the world we live in . Indeed , many of the true bigots in our society can be seen in the magician .
5 #### Great series . A classic . Read them years ago as a kid . Bought the set for my kids to read . Way better than these new movies that just came out .
5 #### Radio Theater makes this book series even better than just reading it . I am really enjoying it so far . ^_^
5 #### We bought this set for long car journeys . Our kids are so enthralled with the stories that they do n't want to get out of the car when we arrive at our destination .
5 #### Who does n't love Narnia ? I love the make believe world and all that comes with it ! Reading it with my 11yo . She ca n't get enough of it and I 'm enjoying reading it again after a long hiatus . Great read !
5 #### Very good read for anyone ! Wonderful beginnings ... can't wait to read The Lion , The witch , and the Wardrobe ! Downloading it now !
5 #### This is my favorite book in the Narnia series !
5 #### I liked having the whole set in one book !
5 #### and everyone 's usual first read ( the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ) . Absolutely delightful and fills in the blanks as to what started it all . No problem with Kindle or narration . Highly recommend !
5 #### This is the best book series I have read . I personally prefer to read them starting with the Magician and his nephew and following through to the Last Battle . From the creation of Narnia to the Battles fought and evil destroyed to the overturning of the Underworld to the destruction of Narnia and to the creation of a New Narnia . I cried such happy tears while reading these books . The spiritual underlying in the books amazes me . They were a true blessing .
5 #### Five stars great book It was fun to read it It is probably the best book I have read in one word awesome
4 #### Starting out with in the last days of Narnia , King Tirian is now ruling Narnia after the events of The Silver Chair . One of my favorite things about this book is the way it is interpreted by the reader . This rings true in most of Lewiss book but no more than in this story . I have spoken to very few people about this book and they all got something different from it . Each individual had different messages , themes and interpretations of the story . The Last Battle is the perfect conclusion to the Narnia chronicles and is a stellar example of how to conclude a series in a satisfying manner . I honestly thought the book was very good because it did n't have much violence which it can use and it did n't have any sexual content . The age level I recommend for this book is probably going to be 8 - 12 year olds which is about 4th to 7th grade . I would recommend this book to other people because it is not difficult to read and very is entertaining .
5 #### The Narnia series is really good . I like the 2nd and 5th .
5 #### Exactly as expected and exactly as required . The only negative aspect is the incessant follow up messages from Amazon .
5 #### It 's a fantastic series . I read them when I was a child and now I bought a set for my child to read too . He loves the books and the movies .
5 #### This is one of my favorite Narnia books ! I also really like The Magicians Nephew and The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe !
4 #### Bought for my daughter . She thought it was okay .
5 #### I loved it ! It is very different from the movie , but I think it is better . There is great adventure and a changed life as well as the alluding to who Aslan really is .
5 #### Thought it was 7 individual books in a set , but it 's actually one large book with all 7 in it . Still very satisfied
3 #### I thought it was individual books , but the whole collection . its one HUGE book . maybe the description stated that and maybe I missed it , I have n't bothered to go back and look , but I would have liked it better as 7 books . not a huge deal though .
5 #### Great book , great series at story . I really found it profound the way no one wanted Aslan mentioned or old Narnia talked about like they were afraid . Kind of reminds me of how many people do n't want the name of Jesus to be spoken of .
4 #### This is a beautiful paperback box set of the Narnia collection , that so many of us grew up with . The covers are nice , thick and protective of the pages inside , which are of good paper stock . I have no print fading or errors that I 've noticed . The art on the outter box is beautiful on all sides , with a little read up at the top . For paperbacks , I believe this is the way to go ! Highly recommended !
5 #### I will give this 5 stars because we do love listening to these . BUT ... I am not a personal fan of Aslan 's voice in these ! The kids do n't seem to mind . :)
5 #### Having begun my adventures in Narnia with " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe , " I ca n't say enough about the nostalgia invoked by reading about where it all began . Lewis was a master of deep concepts in simple language , and this book was a wonderful read that felt like going home again .
5 #### I loved these audio books . The professional presentation of C.S. Lewis ' book series is appealing to any age . I have played it for my high school students and it definitely kept their attention . These are a great investment . I intend to share them with my grandchildren .
4 #### A remarkably dark ending to an otherwise quite bright series . As usual , I could have gone without the religious symbolism but then I probably should not be reading this series to begin with .
5 #### Excellent narration by well known Actors straight from the books . We definitely recommend this audio series .. !
5 #### A bit expensive but I really wanted this edition from Barnes & Noble so I had to pay the price : l I was worried because another comment said it was n't the bonded leather edition described in the photo , fortunately for me it was :) and the book came in very good condition .
5 #### I 've been reading The Chronicles of Narnia since the 6th grade . I LOVE these stories ! C.S. Lewis has always been my favorite author !
5 #### This book was fun to read Lucy Edmund Susan Peter but if you have not read the books before this one read those and then this one .
4 #### Love this series . Have read it to all my kids , probably several times . Now starting to read it to the grand kids .
5 #### Terrific book . I 'm an old woman and I still love reading Narnia . C. S. Lewis was the best !
5 #### I love this story and I wish they would make a movie that would make The Lion , Witch and Wardrobe make more sense .
5 #### C S Lewis children 's classic which should be read by all adults . This series does not talk down to children and insult their intelligence like so many books written for children . Beautifully written by one of the world 's best apologist . A must read .
5 #### I ordered this as a chapter book for me and my son to read together . He is 7 and loves the stories and adventures ! It has opened up conversations with us and given us a positive experience . He looks forward to reading it every evening .
5 #### No review is necessary for the Chronicles of Narnia series . It has withstood the test of time and proven itself a classic . I enjoyed them as a child , reading and rereading them all . Now as a father , I get the joy of reading them with my daughter , and once again I find myself drawn back into Aslan 's world and enjoying ever second of it . The boxed set was an incredible value . The books are about the quality of mass market paperbacks , in other words , not high quality . But they are good enough quality and I was able to get the whole set for under $ 20 . So I am quite happy with the purchase .
5 #### Incredible dramatization of Narnia ! Not an audiobook ( not sure how it would compare in terms of included content ) . Our 3 kids listened to them on a LONG drive to / from vacation . They loved it ! Recommended
4 #### Great for kids . The stories are predictable if you are at all aware of the biblical influences in the books . The dramatization is fun for the kids to hear and helps make car trips pass more quickly .
5 #### These are so beautiful ! Purchased them used and they 're in such good condition . Ca n't wait to go back to Narnia !
5 #### A fun read especially if the whole family reads it together . It really takes your mind to another place . Love it !
5 #### Love this series . My children have read it many times .
5 #### Love this series . My children have read it many times .
5 #### Chronicles of Narnia is a classic set of stories -- not just for children , but for adults too . Full of deeper meaning and still great stories , this series is a must read for all ages .
5 #### Well I read the second boo before the first book an I believe that it made this book so much more fun and exciting . It was a great story with a lot of twists .
5 #### I read these as a child and purchased the set for my kids . I re - read them and they are just wonderful , fun books full of adventure and at the same time teaching character and values . If you are a Christian or familiar with the Bible , you will see analogies throughout . Wonderful books for mid - elementary to read to themselves and for parents to read for the younger ages .
5 #### Such a classic . Perfect for children and adults . C.S Lewis is a mastermind
5 #### My son loved the book . He had wished he read this one before the lion , the witch and the wardrobe . Great book .
5 #### As an adult it was great to go back through them .
4 #### I never read this series as a kid , but I do love reading as an adult . I recommend them to adults and kids .
5 #### Let 's be honest , sometimes Amazon gets it wrong ; however , in this case , Amazon TOTALLY got it right ! ! I was really skeptical about the condition of the book . I did n't trust that I could really pay close to $ 12 for something worth so much more . The reviews seemed legit , but I could n't be totally sure . In any case , I was prepared to ship it back for a refund in case it was n't what was advertised . Luckily for me , I was wrong . The dust cover was the only thing that was a little jacked up , but even then it was n't severe . I do n't really care about dust covers anyway , so I just threw that away . The book itself is in PERFECT condition . It is a book that is worth $ 50 or more , but it is being sold for such a bargain price ! You can not go wrong with this purchase . Honestly . Best Amazon purchase ever .
5 #### One of my favorite book series ! ! I 'm 42 and I still pick these up from time to time and read . This set I bought for my twin 13 year old nieces . They were very excited !
1 #### If I had the energy to describe how bad this is , I still would n't be able to describe how bad this is .
5 #### C.S.Lewis . everyone should read all the short stories in this collection . The writing style is different from today .
4 #### Good read . I bought the set for my incoming 6th grader 's summer read and ended up reading it myself . I enjoyed reading the books . The author was very descriptive and felt like I was immersed in the wonderful world of Narnia . I could n't stop reading after I got started .
5 #### This series is fantastic in every way ... the audio and sound effects the actors and actresses truly take you into another place ... this is a wonderful gift not only for children but adults as well .
5 #### These are my grandkids favorite books so I had to give them a very good set they could keep forever . C.S. Lewis is an excellent author even in today 's times . Why would they make movies of these stories if it was n't still a classic today ! I love all his books ! ! All 16 of my grandkids have loved these stories . So if you are looking for a some good stories for the kids with a wonderful moral to the stories , I highly recommend them .
5 #### always enjoy these audio stories ; bought this set for a family member going through chemo for them to have something to listen to . They have really enjoyed them .
5 #### I love this book . The characters take you to lands that are good and evil .
5 #### A great series , CS Lewis writes in a fashion that makes it easy to understand . The creativity and history / adventures in this world are a great masterpeice . What was the greatest point is the true hidden meaning behind the story . If noticed , you could see the hidden stories of the Bible and you would know that CS Lewis was really writing to point young children in the right direction .
4 #### This is a good read for anyone in grades 1 and up . It is a good reread for any who have read it when they were younger . Even though they may have started with The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe . And I had never known this before I became a believer , but it is based on the Bible ( to a certain extent ) . If you want another series to read , I would recommend The Left Behind series ( either the adult series or the kids series ) . I have only read the adult series .
5 #### I really liked the book . But then I like C.S. Lewis as an author
5 #### When my children were small I would sit and read to them at night about Narnia until all the books fell apart ( they had been mine as a child ) . Then I saw the chronicles in Walmart in one volume and picked it up and we ( my 5 and I ) read it until the spine broke and the pages began to fall out ! So I bought another on a different website this one for my daughter who intends to teach second grade and is leaving this fall for collage and has personally read the books probably I or more times and watched the movies so.many ti.es we have had to replace the . Twice as well too ! Then I decided I better get myself a new copy for my own use to read to my grandchildren and so I bought this copy on Amazon.com and then I LAMINATED THE COVER AND SPINE !
5 #### This was a gift to my niece . I loved them when I read them , and I knew she would too . She did . Books for young people do n't get any better than this .
5 #### Bought it as a Christmas gift and the twelve year old kid was very happy .
3 #### This is the first book in the chronology of Narnia , but not the first in the Earth timeline , I 'm told . I was expecting much worse . I saw the movie base on ' The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ' and found it bad in several areas , mostly the story . That 's why you probably should n't judge a book by its movie , even though it 's not the same story . This book is clearly written for children , and as expected it 's a bit simplistic on the consequences of adventuring . And extremely lucky as well for the children . The writing is fun and not presumptuous . The plot is a little expositive , you 're shown what is to come and the present is not as interesting ( very debatable , my personal view ) . I think the witch should have had more development and more time on the spotlight as her arrival could bring a lot more ( fun ) chaos to the story . A lost opportunity I guess . I had to read at least a book by C.S. Lewis . If I enjoyed the genre I would give it another try , as I do not , I guess I wo n't .
5 #### Incredible read as a child ; even more meaningful as an adult .
5 #### This was a fun read , especially for anyone who has read the previous books in the Narnia series . I do n't say this because it ca nt stand alone ( it can ) but because several of the characters that are my favorites from The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe make another appearance in this book : The four British children who discovered Narnia by going through the magic wardrobe , and , of course , Aslan the Lion ( one of my favorite characters of all time ) . Also , the author introduces Reepicheep , a mouse , and the most valiant of all warriors . Too fun ! In this book , the four children enter Narnia again ( only for the second time ) and discover that 1,000 years have passed since their last visit . With the help of Aslan , Reepicheep , and a host of other Narnians - in - hiding , they help the young prince Caspian battle and reclaim the kingdom of Narnia from his usurping uncle . The plot , as you can imagine , contains battles and adventure , but as always , also poses questions about faith , courage , and good versus evil . This is a wonderful book for young children and adults alike !
5 #### I already have a copy of this book but wanted to own this beautiful cover series . Amazing artwork !
5 #### I love these books . I think the dedication in " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " is so accurate when it says that one day Lucy will be old enough to want to read childish books again , and I 've definitely reached that age with this one . It 's definitely suitable for younger ages , but you will pick up new details and themes as an adult . C.S. writes at a quick pace and does n't hang you up on too many details , while still managing to be a deep thinker and writer . I really enjoyed these ! The book itself is light , but big . I was glad to have them all in one book , but it would n't have been as portable if not for my massive handbags .
5 #### What more can be said about Lewis 's awesome children 's series ? The imagination he shows , and the positive messages he conveys make this a must for the library of every child age 5 to 5000 . I enjoyed reading these books to my children when they were young ( about age eight ) . When they got older they picked them up again on their own to enjoy the stories again ( as teenagers ) .
5 #### Of course I loved the books growing up , but sadly my husband has never read them ! I got these for him to listen to on his hour and a half commute to and from work . He loves it ! I wish they could somehow condense the disks a bit so he was n't always changing them . But I understand why not .
5 #### waiting for my boys to get older to read
4 #### I enjoyed this , and would highly recommend the dramatization but the books are still better . For what it is , its excellent but I much prefer reading the books to the dramatization any day .
5 #### its a classic children 's series . i love it even as an adult
5 #### C. S. Lewis has an amazing talent for creating spell binding and unique stories .
5 #### Children and grown ups alike will greatly enjoy this book . This is my favorite book of the series . C.S. Lewis has an amazing ability to bring books to life .
5 #### My grandson has read the books and is now listening to the audio . A good quality production of the epic story .
5 #### This book was well worth the money ! The narration was so good that it was n't " narration " it was dramatic story telling . I wish that all narrators were this good !
5 #### I ca n't recommend this timeless collection of fantasy novels enough to both young and old . The references to the author 's faith in Jesus Christ are subtle but ring loud and clear to those of us who share his faith . This is one anthology that will never grow old or out of date .
5 #### I love all the Narnia books , but this is the best ! CS Lewis is my favorite author , and I consider this book to be one of his top five books . My personal favorite CS Lewis books are : Mere Christianity , The Great Divorse , Screwtape Letters , Perelandra , and The Last Battle .
5 #### I LOVE this series . Started reading it to my children when they were about 5 . It 's a great message for kids and adults and interesting reading to both .
5 #### classic set of books that only the second one gets read , read the series you will learn a lot about the complexities of being human
5 #### This is the first book in the Narnia series by C.S. Lewis ( not the first one written which was the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , but the first in the timeline of the Narnia universe ) . It has been years since I read the Narnia series to my children and since I was looking for a light , fun , easy read , I thought I d dive back into Narnia and hoped I d still be swept away . This is a fantastic book . For any who have read the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , The Magicians Nephew actually explains what so many readers have wanted to know about Narnia : How it was created , why there is a lamp - post in the middle of the wood , where the evil Witch Queen came from , why the wardrobe was magical and so much more . It is well - written and entertaining and such a quick , fun read . On another level entirely , there are many allusions to Christianity , the nature of and the battle between good and evil , creation and so much more , but these allusions are not even remotely overbearing . I am so happy to say that this book retained all of its power to sweep me away and into another world . For anyone who is interested in fantasy books for young readers , this book is a must . As C.S. Lewis is most famous for his Christian allegorical writing , anyone interested in that sort of book will also enjoy this immensely .
5 #### My wife recommended this as I had never read the series . i wish I had read these years ago .
5 #### Naturally a wonderful set , worth the read and money .
5 #### i LOVED this book i think it is a great book for around 3rd - 6th grade , this author took some of my favorite things and put them in a book . the only thing was it was sort of hard to follow along around twords the middle of the book . like i said ( at least i think i remember saying it ) i would recommend it to others . @--}---- (
5 #### So much has been written about the Chronicles of Narnia . I loved them as a child and we are enjoying sharing them with our 7 - year - old twin boys now . Five stars for Lewis . HOWEVER , I do not love this edition . I read so many reviews and lost track of which edition had the books in my preferred order . I know people can have strong opinions about this . ;) I personally much prefer the series in order of publication and this edition has the books " out of order . "
5 #### By far the best audio rendition of this series I 've ever heard . You will not be disappointed ! The full cast of actors and actresses really adds to the overall impact and appeal .
5 #### This took awhile to receive , but worth the wait . I bought it for my husband and he was very pleased with the set . He 's reading them to our five year old and he 's loving Narnia !
5 #### This book is one of my favorite of all times . I have read it almost as much as I have seen Babylon 5 , one being from space and the other from the imagination more than I could hope for .
5 #### Enjoyed Prince Caspian very much ! Finally reading these books I 've hear about for years .
5 #### Kids enjoy listening to these stories during car rides .
5 #### love all things CS Lewis ! We have really enjoyed reading this series with the kids ( 8 , 6 , and 3 ) .
5 #### Great favorite book or should I say set of books took me back to childhood years . I had forgotten how much I enjoyed them .
5 #### This series of books is a MUST READ for every child ( and adult ) . I found them when I was 12 and enjoyed reading them over and over . I read them to all of my five children , and they loved them . This book was purchased for my new grandson ... as a cherished thing to be shared with a new generation ! I have friends who are not Christians who LOVE these stories for their creativity and adventure . My Christian friends and I love the allegory , representative of Christ . We like to discuss that as a family , but it does NOT have to be pointed out at all , and not discussing it does not take away from the story . In fact , over - discussing it can take away from the story . I found it best for my children to discover the allegory themselves . This is ONE large volume with all the books . It is NOT filled with photos . I think this is good ... read the stories and allow the children to picture them in their minds . Kids nowadays spend too much time with videos/ visuals anyway .
5 #### I have loved this series since I was a child . I have read it several times . As a kid I did n't realize that it was a Christian analogy . As an adult I find that it is well written in this regard . As a kid I liked the adventure stories . As an adult , I like the complexity of the characters and situations . It is quite possibly the best children 's series ever written . I have just started to share it with my own children , aged 5 and 7 and they are excited to read it every day . I do suggest if you are sharing it with your children start at The Lion Witch and Wardrobe instead of the Magician 's Nephew , and then go back and read the Magician 's Nephew later .
5 #### I absolutely love this collection ! In fact I only even bought this edition because we wore our other copy out completely ! The cover fell off years ago and whole chunks of story were falling out from decades of use . I 'm all grown up now but I am still so in love with this story . It never gets old ! I really wish someone would make a Magician 's Nephew movie . It all ties together so beautifully when you know the whole story . This copy is gorgeous with the Dawn Treader on the front , it 's still a paper back , so there 's a real chance we 'll wear this copy out too , but thus far it 's holding up really well .
5 #### This was a holiday gift and it was a great present . The stories are good for all ages .
5 #### Highly recommend the Chronicles of Narnia series by C S Lewis . I have read through them several times .
5 #### I loved this series as a child , and I enjoy sharing it with my kids ( 6 , 4 , 2 and 1 ) now . The books are too difficult for a 6 year old to read alone , but they make stories for family read aloud time . I find the chapters a nice length ( about 5 - 10 minutes of reading aloud ) for this purpose .
5 #### Paul McCusker 's radio theater adaptation of the Narnia series is one of the greatest gifts to the Christian church I know ofat least to those elements of the church which travel in minivans . This is a family favoriteno * the * family favorite . McCusker , unlike the directors of the three ill - fated Narnia films ( all of them known Calormens ) , * gets * Narnia . Because he knows Aslan personally . The voice acting is top - notch . The music is expertly done . The pacing is perfect . And the stories are worth the attention lavished on them . They have shaped me : Aslan 's sacrifice , Lucy 's faith and love , Uncle Andrew 's blindness , the dwarves ' ultimate treachery , Puddleglum 's epistemological sophistication , Eustace 's de - dragoning , Shasta 's surprise to meet the planner of his travels . Lewis manages to create interesting evil characters as well as interesting good ones . I have been listening to these albums for ten years , since grad school ; I 've probably heard each one a dozen times . I 'm now delighted to share them with the growing young passengers in the back of the minivan .
5 #### We have listened to these over and over and over in the truck on so many trips . So . Many . Trips ...
4 #### This is a great book to activate the imagination of a child . I like how the author mixes Christianity into it .
5 #### My son and I read it together and we both really enjoyed this fanciful adventure !
5 #### I previously read this and it is a wonderful book . I want to have this in my library because it is one to have in the library to reread .
5 #### According to the receiver of this gift the translation is very good - better than the version she previously had .
5 #### It was great reading it like this in a perfect series . This had quite a few extra treats to read and it made the series even better . I 've been reading this series over and over since I was a little girl and I still love the stories and characters .
5 #### Well , what can I say that has not been said about this excellent series . This is the original numbered reading order of The Chronicles of Narnia and the way they should be read , as written . I wo n't get in to the whole argument about Mr. Lewis trying to be nice to a little boy , and just to appease the child , agreeing with him that he might be right . Us true Narnia lovers know that if he intended to change the order he had plenty of time when he was alive after answering the letter . Reading the books in any order but this for the first time would simply ruin the whole story . After its read , jump around and reread it in any order . The surprise ending is n't a surprise if you read it first . I had read my original copies so many times the covers had been starting to fall apart and I was so glad to find this sealed brand new set .
5 #### Great series for kids . Might be a bit scary
5 #### Awesome ! ! ! Definitely Worth the money ! ! ! My kids will Love them ! !
5 #### Arrived right on time for my daughter 's cousin 's birthday party . Now her mom is reading this with her and says she 's loving the first book !
5 #### Love these books . They make me feel like a child again going on an adventure . Reading these as an adult , I can see the spiritual undertones of these books .
5 #### I can only offer one piece of advice ... get the audible narration by Patrick Stewart . AMAZING .
5 #### I love this Series ! Read it as a kid . Read it to my kids . They read it to me :)
4 #### Great way to get lost for a few hours
5 #### I ordered this by accident , as I already own all the Narnia books . They are all fantastik ! And the series is nicely finished up .
5 #### My son & I loved it ! We hope a movie is made from it soon . Great ending to a great series !
5 #### All of the Narnian books are amazing ! I read them all over and over . They are stuffed full of adventure and who God is .
5 #### It is impossible to describe the effect these books have had on me and my children ; all my family , really . My mother - in - law fell in love with them , and enjoyed reading them to my children . Also loaned a set to a friend of mine years ago and her son LITERALLY read the books to pieces . These are a Christian allegory , with characters that are fall - in - love - withable . Suitable for children AND adults .
5 #### One of my favorite series of books of all time ! !
5 #### It was a gift for my daughters friend . The money saved had her mother worried that I spent too much ! ! I told her Amazon Prime was the way to go !
5 #### This series is a must read for kids and adults alike !
5 #### A great story of good vs evil , redemption and courage .
5 #### It 's the Chronicles of Narnia , what more is there to say ?
5 #### Chronlogically the " beginning " of the Narnia story . A lovely story that can be read again and again . Introduce this to your kids early- before Harry Potter .
5 #### Superb way to illiterate man 's view of the second coming and of what Heaven could be like . Peaceful and comforting . Great for children and adults . A timeless book . But so is eternity .
5 #### This is the first chronological book in the Narnia series and it starts the series off really well . I love this whole series and this book shows how Narnia begins . If you have n't read it , I recommend starting with this book . Do read the whole series . It 's worth it .
5 #### Only one of the best series of children 's books of all time . I am still partial to the original order , and read them to my children in that order . If you 've bever read these , they are marvelous .
5 #### Well written books that have great story lines and strong teaching moments for younger children . It is a great read for anyone of any age
5 #### This is a very nice , quality collection of all seven " Chronicles of Narnia " tales . If you have ever read one and liked it , I highly recommend getting this and reading the rest . The additional essay by Lewis in the back gives a bit of interesting insight into the ' behind the scenes ' of writing this and his other works , and gives some good advice to aspiring authors in the children 's ( or any other ) genre . The original illustrations are all included as well .
5 #### Easily a new favorite book of mine ! The reader gets to experience Narnia for the very first time -- from the exact moment that Aslan breathed Narnia into existence ! What a wonderful moment . So similar to the God 's own creation of our world , although no description could ever fully share the extent of His creation . Polly and Digory step into Narnia , and with them seeps in someone from another world called Charn -- someone evil . A beautiful setup for ' The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe ' . To get to Narnia , they go through a middle landing place , named " Wood between the Worlds " ... and I do so wonder how many other worlds that these two charming kids could discover together . This book provides so much back - story for Narnian fans . Why is there a lamp post in the middle of the snowy woods ? Why is the White Witch embody evilness ? How do animals get picked to have the talking ability ? I ADORE THIS BOOK . It 's beautiful .

5 #### This amazing Narnia experience is a must for your family . Beautiful , intriguing , spellbinding . . . The voices are incredible , and C. S. Lewis 's classic allegories come to life through their talent . Do not miss out on this audio experience . The collection can be passed on to children and shared for years to come .
3 #### I read The Magician 's Nephew first because I wanted to go in chronological order when reading The Chronicles of Narnia ; however , I now wish I would have opened with The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe ( like the publication order ) as that is what I really want to read . The Magician 's Nephew was incredibly slow for me the first 60 % of the book . It 's not until Digory , et al . enter the burgeoning world of Narnia that things start to have the enchanting feel you hear so often about Lewis ' Narnia series . And now I am looking forward to seeing more of what is behind the closet doors .
5 #### A book to read and meditate on again and again ! ! ! !
5 #### Close - runner up to Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings is C. S. Lewis and his Chronicles of Narnia . The Chronicles of Narnia is not quite as definitive as The Lord of the Rings ( although it may well loom somewhat larger in children 's fantasy and between them , Tolkien and Lewis codified modern high fantasy ) . Narnia lacks the same grandeur as Middle - Earth and is of course much more directly allegorical of the Christianity Lewis shared with Tolkien . Yet for me it will always have a charm and place close to my heart - the epic fantasy of children drawn from our world through various portals into the magical world of Narnia , presided over by the great Lion Aslan ( if only he did so in our world , as I would find it much easier to believe in Aslan ) . The Chronicles of Narnia range from Aslan 's sacrifice and resurrection in the first published novel ( The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ) through to the very creation and apocalypse of Narnia . And so enchanting that after reading them , what young reader does n't search wardrobes for other worlds ? I know I still do
5 #### One of my top favorite series of all time , I 've had them in audiobook form for years . However , I wanted to get a book that I could read to the kids , but I did n't want to have to ransom one of them to be able to afford the set . This compilation of all the stories was the answer . It does n't seem to have all the art work ( I 've compared to a couple different library versions ) , but the stories are there and there are enough pictures to keep the kids interested . I would say that my 10 year old son is more interested than my 7 year old daughter . Not sure if that 's an age or gender thing ( or neither ) , but we 've still had a ton of great bonding times reading this before bed . And , sometimes dad looks forward to it almost as much ( or more ) than the kiddos !
4 #### I love the story , but did n't care for the delivery of some of the readers . I gave it to a friend of mine and might try the multiple voice version down the road ...
5 #### Love having all the books in one volume . Now I do n't have to figure what order the books go in . My 4 year old enjoys listening to us read this to him as well .
5 #### I did n't know this would be in one large volume
5 #### always a classic ... perfect gift for adults and children alike
3 #### It was ok . The pace seemed slow to me .
5 #### Ca n't wait to read this with my kids , great quality book and fast shipping !
5 #### Love Narnia and the Audio has been a great addition to my collection
5 #### Old or young , you ca n't go wrong reading the " Chronicles of Narnia " ; seven books in the series , all in this one collection , you will fall in love with each character , anticipating each encounter with Aslan . Fiction , written in Christian fantasy and loaded with Christian allegory , this adventure series will be hard to put down .
5 #### Great book loved the characters such athoughtful idea C.S Lewis perfected the book to the highest degree definitely 5 stars
5 #### I 'll never forget the first time I read Narnia . My parents got the 7 - book set as a gift one Christmas , back over 30 years ago when I was a boy . And I was instantly hooked . What a great series ! Lewis is a genius .

4 #### First book is awesome , second is great and then they start to do downhill after that . My opinion and my kids agree . We planned on reading them all together as a family but by the fourth book they got bored of it . Me , too .
5 #### Every time I read this book , I see something new that I 've not noticed before . It might just be one thing , but in each reading there 's been a new revelation that sparks my thought processes and brings me insight and joy . The audio book read by Kenneth Branagh is one of the best readings of any book I 've ever heard . It is always a good idea to read a book for yourself first , but Kenneth Branagh 's reading was amazing .
5 #### Loved it as a kid so I gave it to my cousin 's kids for Christmas . It did n't come with a box , but it 's way cheaper that way .
4 #### the box was damaged in shipping , but the CDs are not broken .
5 #### These are fantastic books , and my daughter is thrilled to actually own the entire set now ! The images on this set are gorgeous as well . Great product , and fantastic books . My daughter just turned 8 . I read them all to her in the past and now she is reading them all to herself !
5 #### Nothing better than C.S. Lewis ! We love his style and thought provoking way of writing . My son is reading this for his composition class . They are studying Mr. Lewis ' allegory in relation to not only the Bible , but life . Wow , he was a gifted man ! We had this set:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Chronicles - of - Narnia - Box - Set / dp/0061992887 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Chronicles of Narnia Box Set</a>&nbsp;but we lost Prince Caspian , so we purchased this one . My favorite though is this ONE book:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Chronicles - Of - Narnia-7 - Bks - In-1 - Adult / dp / B00K4G62J8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Chronicles Of Narnia ( 7 Bks In 1 ) ( Adult)</a>&nbsp;It 's a beautiful book ! ! The Pro 's of this book : Well written , holds your attention , this is written to younger kids . Cons : REALLY hard to put down ! What a problem to have ! Thankful for great writers !
5 #### Published by HarperCollins under its HarperTrophy premium label . They are luxurious to hold and read , will last many years . Comes in a boxed set of paperbacks . A great edition on premium paper with colored versions of the original artwork . I had seen the HarperTrophy version , was very impressed , and hoped this set was the same ( I would have sent it back if it were not ) and was delighted when it arrived . The series is numbered in the popular sequence , beginning with The Magician 's Nephew which Lewis wrote 6th , not first , and some scholars believe should NOT be read first ( I happen to agree ) because it reveals many details that destroy some of the mystery of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe , the first book Lewis wrote . Imagine reading a description of the details and workings of Harry Potter 's world of magic before reading the first novel .
5 #### I read these to my 4 - 10 year old kids over a year long period during camping trips as well as at home . This is the exact same set as the one I read 30 years ago except the sketches are in color which adds interest for today 's grandchildren who have never experienced B&W TV . The stories remain enchanting as ever .
5 #### Eustace and Jill return to Narnia once again . This time an ape has found a lion skin and turned it into a coat for a donkey . The ape proclaims the donkey is Aslan and starts crazy things happening in Narnia . The Last Battle is the final Narnia book . I did n't especially dislike this one , but I also did n't especially like it . I felt the whole thing was odd and the end was a bit jarring . I recommend it if you are reading the entire Narnia series .
5 #### This was the first chapter book I had ever read and I was blown away . I usually can write longer reviews , but with this one it 's too good to put in words ! ! ! !
5 #### This is an epic story . So much going on . Fully dramatised . Looks like this has been re- released a few times , but the content is exactly the same . The momment I started playing this it caught my kids attention . They were like wow what is this . They all stopped what they were doing and just listened . I actually got this on sale for 50 cents how could I go wrong , so I bought 2 sets .
5 #### This has all of the books in one volume ! Awesome reading that really tells a fantastic story . Well worth reading .
5 #### We read the Chronicles and every single one engaged us to the other . I book to have in a personal library . We just love these stories ! ! !
5 #### Peter , Edmund , Susan , and Lucy , a year after leaving Narnia , are on their way back to school when they are suddenly , magically , pulled to what they eventually realize are the ruins of Cair Paravel . Centuries have passed in Narnia since the children left and now many no longer believe in Aslan or even that the children themselves ever existed . Some Narnians are trying to orchestrate a return to Old Narnia , but they need the children to help them to succeed . I really liked Prince Caspian . There is a lot of action . It is fun to see how things have changed over the many Narnian years since the children were last there . I recommend it .
5 #### I love radio theater ! Focus on the Family is the creator of this radio drama , and it is fantastic . Different voices for the characters , great sound affects , and wonderful music . This contains all of C.S. Lewis 's books .
5 #### Perfect for a young advanced reader . My niece is 11 and loves it .
4 #### This is a great set of books . C S Lewis does n't not often disappoint , but I love this series . It 's a great read if you like any sort of adventure and is great for kids and adults alike . This box set is nicely done , pretty box , and 7 softback books inside . In the particular set I recieved one of the books did not perfectly match the other 6 , maybe it was a slightly older printing , but does n't affect the overall quality .
3 #### After she is tricked by Digorys uncle into touching a yellow ring , Polly disappears . Digory has no choice but to follow with a different ring , one that will bring her back . The kids end up in a dead land where Digory awakens an evil witch / queen . Later , Polly , Digory , Uncle Andrew , the witch , a horse , and a cabby end up in a completely dark land . Soon Aslan the Lion appears and wakes the magical world called Narnia with his song . The Magicians Nephew tells the story of Professor Kirke as a child ( Digory ) and the beginning of Narnia . It was slightly interesting , but mostly a lot of words and not much actual action . It was just okay .
5 #### I love this book , and the illustrations are beautiful ! !
3 #### Love this series , but I did n't realize the hardcover is a single book , I 'm hoping to return it for the actual 7 - book series .
5 #### CS Lewis is my favorite author of all time , and these are a classic addition to any book - case collection .. Great gift for kids to introduce them to his works . Great price . Good condition . Older edition of the print and book cover , but still nice .
5 #### I am happy with the quality of this edition of these classic books .
5 #### I had to hunt this down to add to my Barnes & Nobles Classic collection .
5 #### Beware of the difference between the hardcover and softcover of this edition : the hardcover is a single volume , and the softcover is a boxed set ! But , with that out of the way , these books are some of the most delightful and thought - provoking stories you will ever encounter . I fell in love with them as a child , and still consider them among my favorite works of fictionnow I get to introduce a new generation of young readers to them , who I hope will enjoy them as much as I did at their age ! C.S. Lewis is truly a master storyteller who incorporates important observations of human nature and lessons of morality and faith into a world of magic and endless possibilities .
3 #### It was pretty good it took me awhile to get into it .
5 #### My daughter has to read a Fantasy book and what better book than by a Christian writer ... It 's a big book with many stories in it . This will keep her busy for a while ! :) She loves it ... she is excited to continue reading the rest of the books ...
5 #### Incredible dramatic reading ! ! My kids beg to listen to it ! ! !
5 #### good , used set ....... no scratches . GOODWILL has always sent good products to me
5 #### The books are obviously classics and are already so amazing but the narrators on these CDs are fantastic to listen to . My husband and I , along with all three of our kids ( ages 12 , 10 , and 7 ) love listening to these on our car trips .
1 #### I 'd give it a thousand stars if the publisher had n't persisted in the unforgivable error of placing The Magician 's Nephew in front of the other books , where IT DOESN'T BELONG . The book was written as a PREQUEL . Prequels are supposed to be read / viewed AFTER the materials they precede in the fictional chronology . The version I received has a different cover and the medallion on front says it 's for the 100th anniversary , no the 50th , as pictured . Perhaps after I return this I 'll be able to locate the 50th anniversary edition , where I hope they had n't yet figured out how to mess with a perfectly good thing . Seriously , this whole re - ordering business was a plot by the White Witch . Aside from this one fatal flaw , the book itself is masterfully done . Full color pictures - the ones done by the original illustrator , and an elegant two - column layout for the text , with a ribbon for bookmarking . If anyone out there can stomach living with a disordered series then this is the book for you .
5 #### These are such wonderful stories . My husband is reading them to our 5 - year - old daughter and she loves them . Some books read more easily than others , and attract her attention more , but she 's enjoying them so much .
5 #### Have read the Chronicles of Narnia several times . Excellent ,
5 #### Beautiful ! I have always wanted this - my only kvetch is that they have the new order ( Magician 's Nephew is # 1 ) . :(
5 #### My kids love to listen to this on road trips or during rest time . It has been fun to share a childhood favorite with them . Wonderful listening for all ages .
5 #### We read this book to prepare for discussion in our Bible class . We were delighted to discover how the allegories related to spiritual and Biblical stories . I liked being able to read the tales of Narnia from the beginning . It helps to fit the pieces together . Also , C. S. Lewis ' writes beautifully so his books are a joy to read .
1 #### Well , it 's my fault for not reading further into the description . I thought I was receiving the " Chronicles of Narnia Full Color : Gift Set " but in actuality it was only 2 books of the " Chronicles " in the " Set " I received . I feel the description is somewhat unclear . It 's not worth it to ship back , so since I ca n't give it as the gift I had hoped to give , I will save it for when my little one is old enough to start the series .
5 #### What 's to say ? It 's the Chronicles of Narnia ! I 've been reading them with my 7 YR old Granddaughter and now she has her own set and is rereading each one on her own . She loves them and I love them Such a joy to introduce her to them . They are equally as delightful today as they were when they were written in the ' 40s . C.S. Lewis 's wrote amazing stuff with many layers to be explored no matter how old one is !
5 #### We love Narnia , and this is put together so nicely with the tin .
5 #### still engaged with the Chronicles . Love them and counting for the Silver Chair .
1 #### Lewis 's writing is wonderful , but the digital edition is awful . I purchased this for research purposes , but it 's useless as it 's one long string of unsearchable content . It took me at least 20 minutes to find the start of one specific book in the set .
5 #### Everyone should read this series . I love how Lewis weaves God 's awesome power into the story and his caring nature .
5 #### This book is enormous , a plus for the amount of money spent as well as for reading convenience . It is NOT text only- it is fully illustrated in color . Mine shipped from the UK so it took a little longer to get to me ( in Nebraska ) and it got a little beat up on the voyage , but it was in pretty good condition nonetheless .
5 #### This was the first time I have read VDT and it was one of my favorite Narnia books so far ! I grew up watching the BBC versions and they do n't do the book justice . Although the BBC version is much better than the Film that came out in 2010 . I would say this book is a must read for any Lewis fan .
5 #### It 's by C.S Lewis .......... what more do you need to know ?
5 #### I love the Chronicles of Narnia series . They never get old and are a pleasure to read . Very highly recommended reading .
5 #### I believe C S Lewis is one of the great authors of his time and that his books The Chronicles of Narnia were a true pleasure to read . So far i read them only once but for weeks afterword Narnia was constantly on my mind . I Just think it 's too bad it ended when it did because it would be awesome if there could be even 30 narnia books .
3 #### Edmund and Lucy are back in Narnia in this the fifth book in the series . I enjoyed this book overall but did have a harder time getting through it and found myself trying to understand the meaning in different parts . It was a little " scarier " than the other books .
5 #### The Narnia chronicles just keep getting better ! With in the dawn Treader the Lucy , Edmund , and Eustace join Caspian on an adventure to the end of that world ! The trials they face ca n't stop them no matter how difficult things get . And who can avoid a picture coming to life ? Who could escape the waters of the Narnian Sea ? Who could avoid the temptation of water that turns solid objects to gold ? - I 'm reading the Chronicles of Narnia slowly . One book a year kinda thing . I decided I wanted this series to last as long as I could manage it . And it 's marvelous ! I gave this a five stars on goodreads ! It was magical , enchanting , and an adventure worth the read ! I 'm excited to see how Lewis wrote the last two books .
5 #### Gift to 8 - year - old great - grandson . He 's read three already and loves them .
5 #### Great books and a fantastic story that mirrors the true story of Christ to children . :-)
5 #### Read these as a child way long ago and then bought this original set to have .
5 #### Great quality ! We bought this for a road trip and now listen all the time . The star studded cast of voices is awesome .... Derek Jacoby , Lynn Redgrave , Patrick Stewart ... We love that it is the complete book read aloud but with dramatization for the characters .
5 #### Excellent books ! I how C.S. Lewis was able to write an enchanting story which keeps my interest the whole way through . It is a simple read . I would recommend to youth , and parents to read to their children .
5 #### Same edition my daughter had when she was young , now she has it for her daughter .
5 #### Great classic , glad to have my children read it . Definitely good quality writing .
5 #### THIS IS A VERY GOOD SEARIES OF STORIES-----GIVES SOME ONE DEEP THINKING ABOUT THIS WORLD AND GOD LOVED IT VERY MUCH WOULD TEEL ALL READERS YOUNG AND OLD TO READ THIS .
5 #### When my kiddo cried at the end because Lucy would n't be going back to Narnia ... what can ya say but " wow "
4 #### These are EXCELLENT stories ! ! ! The print is n't incredibly large , and they are printed in chronological order rather than the order in which they were written , but this is a great deal for all seven books in one volume ! C.S. Lewis rocks ! ! !
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia is one of our family 's favorite series ever ! C.S. Lewis entwines Biblical truth with captivating stories , that will grip your attention in all of the separate books . This series is good for every age , with nothing inappropriate for a Christian family . It does make mention of magical features , such as witches , but C.S. Lewis portrays them well as the evil characters that in the end are defeated by the Son of the Emperor across the sea -- Aslan , which represents Jesus , the Son of God . Everyone should read this series ! !
4 #### It is one of the classics for kids will never forget . Brought the bonded leather collection version that can be collected to my personal library .
5 #### My step son loves these books . It was a very nice little set .
4 #### This was a large paperback edition . Beautiful cover , nice illustrations inside ( black pencil drawings ) . I remember those from the books I read in middle school . I got this through Amazon Marketplace . It was delivered promptly and in very good condition .
5 #### Never had a chance to read this series as a kid . I may not be a kid anymore but I 'm really enjoying it .
5 #### a classic that has earned its own nitch in our literature .
5 #### Love Lewis , and this is a great grouping of the entire Narnia series . I bought it for our homeschool . Great value !
4 #### I had my 9 year read this book before watching the movie . He complained that it was boring and not as exciting as the Lion Witch and the Wardrobe .
5 #### Reading this series for the first time as an adult , I loved it . So creative and exciting . I did n't really like the parallel with religion , but religion is a huge influence on a lot of writing .
5 #### The books within the book are full of insights into life . I have always enjoyed the books , but understand them better and enjoy them more after reading Michael Ward 's " Planet Naria , " which is much better than its popularizing sibling,"The Narnia Code . "
4 #### The Kindle Edition of the book is very clean with nice illustrations . This is probably one of my least favorite books in the Narnia series , but is a favorite of many . The setting of a voyage on the sea further opens up the world of Narnia , but the structure of the story seems to lend itself to a group of short stories rather than as much of a build to something big .
5 #### I really enjoyed reading these books again . I have enjoyed watching the movies that are out . I liked the way the books has the beginning of Narina and the end of Narina .
4 #### Needed this book for my daughter . She had to read it for a book report . It had some wear as described which was not an issue . Pleased
5 #### The story is about two children , one of which is the nephew of a magician , who travel to another world . I really enjoyed this story . It was a quick read and captivating so I did n't want to put it down .
4 #### This was a great alternative to buying other sets . We like that it is one big book rather than a bunch in a box set . Having be placed in C.S.Lewis ' preferred order is neat too . We read this to our kids for family time and they really enjoy it . A classic that just keeps giving generation after generation .
5 #### Everyone should love Narnia . I was supposed to read this as a school project . Needless to say , that was n't exactly a chore for me ! I have read the lion , the witch , and the wardrobe before and this really does explain every part of that , from how the white witch started to how there was another world to who the professor was other than just " professor " and even how the wardrobe got there and became a portal practically . Not to mention the warning here from Aslan made sense , with the whole world war 2 setting the lion , the witch , and the wardrobe has . I feel like this should be a big formal review for a book like this , but I ca n't do that . But I do know if you 're 8 or younger , you wo n't really get Narnia , so you might as well leave it alone . I had to read Narnia when I was about 8 . And not only was I bored , but I had no idea what was going on . But reading Narnia now , a few years later , and I ca n't put it down . So it 's great unless you 're a smallish child .
5 #### Love the book . Read it the first time in middle school . Re - reading again as adult it 's even better
5 #### Beautiful edition of much beloved stories by one of my favorite authors .
5 #### We listened to the series over an extended road trip this summer - several hundred miles with no screen time and no whining ! There are a few instances when the background music seems to overpower some of the audio , but not to the point of being problematic . The audio dramas are wonderfully done and really bring the stories to life , but that means these are slightly abridged . However , instead of detracting from the author 's message the dramas inspired us to read the books as a family to find any details we might have missed . Highly recommend , with no reservations !
5 #### Although there might be a " 4 " on the cover of this one , it 's definitely best read as the second book in the series ( after The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ) . Without spoiling anything for anyone who is unfamiliar with the story , this does a wonderful job as a return to the fantastic world of Narnia first discovered in The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . By re - introducing us with characters we already knew but adding some very memorable new ones , the world and the possibilities of Narnia expand , and some beginnings and endings take place . As far as the Kindle version of this book , it reads very cleanly with color illustrations if you 're reading on a color device and does a great job recreating what it was like reading from a box set many years ago .
5 #### Very satisfied with service and item , which was received within the estimated delivery time . I love this book !
5 #### Books were in ok condition . We love the well written classics by C.S. Lewis ! Highly recommend to all ... young and old ! I read the books to my children age baby to 12 and everyone loves hearing these stories ! I was sort of disappointed when I got the books not in a box and very much used . The books are a lot older and look nothing like the description .
5 #### What can be said about CS Lewis that has n't been said already ? Phenomenal stories . Lewis brings you into " other " worlds and you want to stay there . The Christian message is definitely present , but if you are not a Christian , you will not be offended or feel like he is shoving his faith down your throat . Read these books - time well spent !
5 #### Love these classic stories . And this complete hardcover copy is just lovely . the cover photo is nice and the book is put together very well . I think I will be reading from this book to my children and grandchildren for years to come
5 #### We listened to these CD 's while we drove many miles on our recent vacation . They were wonderful .
5 #### Classic books ! My fourth graders read Prince Caspian so this set made it to the library for extra reading . One of my favorite series !
5 #### Great stories all in one book i love it and am going to enjoy it for years to come
5 #### CS Lewis is a wonderful story teller his style is the use of the English language as in Great Britain . The stories all have a moral and involve a spiritual lesson . Very refreshing to read his tales as an adult .
4 #### Great book although a little boring to the students who do not like fantasy .
5 #### This book was amazing ! The characters were so kind and high spirited ! I think C.S. Lewis did a wonderful job creating this book !
5 #### Always been a fan of Chronicles of Narnia , and now have the full set to read to my toddler . :D yay !
5 #### TIP : This version is the same as another one that is much pricier . Compare & save with this version . The person I bought this for as a gift absolutely loves it , and has listened to it over & over again . He said that it was a lot of fun to listen to , with the drama , actors & music .
5 #### Our family really enjoyed this unabridged version during our summer vacation road trips . It 's a great alternative to constant screen time .
5 #### Well thought out storyline , impressive character building , and superb skill in developing characters that are interesting yet thought - provoking . Conceptually sound with a believable plot and results . Great read .
5 #### I 'm an adult but I still read this . Its sooooooo good .
5 #### I discovered Narnia as an adult . Since then I try to read all seven books every year . Each time a see something new . I 've learned much about God , faith , and the life to come . I hope I never grow too old to read them . My favorite are The Magician 's Nephew ( origin of Narnia and comes first in the timeline , though written after the first book ) ; The Lion , the Witch , and The Wardrobe ; A Horse and His Boy ; and The Last Battle ( the seventh and final book ) . The last page of the last book is the best description of what heaven will be like outside the Bible . If you are seeking God but having trouble finding Him , look in Narnia .
5 #### It is a massive and fun book it 's the only thing that I want to read and It is fun to read .
5 #### Jumped ship thanks to the Narnia Voyage of the Dawn Treader movie .
5 #### These will forever define my childhood . I remember being in 3rd grade and our class was giving copies of Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe to read . I still own that copy all these years later and have continued the tradition with my kids . These books are as complex as you want them to be . They 're great for children because Lewis writes in a free - flowing style with some subtle humor . To children , the books are about adventures and fantastical worlds beyond our own . Adults might appreciate the underlying allegory better and thus enjoy the books in this way as well .
5 #### Like all the others ( books ) , Lewis shows good depth of understanding concerning Jesus and the Father . Although , due to our lack of understanding , we can only see partial pictures of what awaits the believer .
2 #### I bought an " all in one " edition . I am disappointed by this supposedly complete edition . there are very few pictures . I have a different edition of " the lion the witch and the wardrobe " that has about 34 pictures . this version has only 17 . I bought this to have a single complete version to read to my daughter , but now I think I will buy individual editions so as to have all the pictures .
5 #### This was a gift to my great niece who is an avid reader . She loved it
4 #### The story i know best is the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe . I 've seen the movies and BBC series , I 've read the book quite a few times , so I do n't know if my familiarity with LWW makes the others seem slow , but they do . They are well written and have a lot of depth , but I struggle to get through the other books for some reason .
5 #### ... the Narnia books never cease to entertain , enthrall , and inspire . The saga of Digory 's path to understanding is worth the price of the book alone . These books keep on giving , decade after decade .
1 #### why is this priced higher than the other books in the series ? ? ? ? ?
5 #### As expected , great . C.S. Lewis never fails to keep my attn . Looking forward to the rest . To other readers , I hope you are catching the references to things of everlasting concern . If not , ask , and it will be given .
5 #### We listened to several of these on a long road trip and my 8 year old daughter and I loved them ! They are great stories and have really good narrators .
5 #### Best narrative put out by Focus on the Family & Radio Theatre . # 1 best seller . Keeps kids captivated . This is the series you should n't miss out on . The price is a bargain . This is something you 'll want to have to pass on through out the family .
5 #### I read these books as a teenager , and I wanted to read them again to my son . Some of the symbolism that was lost upon me as a teenager is so meaningful now . My son is 4 , and he enjoyed the stories , but I ca n't wait to read it to him again in a few more years to see if he 's able to pick up some more of the allegory .
1 #### Picture on page does not match product desc - not even close !
5 #### A wonderful revelation of how much C S Lewis was aware of other worlds in other dimensions and the portals for accessing such , or at least the desirability of such other dimensions , well before " science " began searching for them as they now are .
4 #### I think the story is good , but after reading " The Hobbit " and " Lord of the Rings " , this book reads a bit " soft " , but it will be very interesting for young readers , I suppose .
5 #### Another classic to engage my granddaughter in her summer reading . Great service from the seller .
5 #### Love the stories ! The Order in which it was written does n't matter to me because essentially you are enjoying a world that is not this one .
5 #### Awesome ! Read it to my 6 myths old and she loves it !
5 #### Such a delightful book . Very thought provoking for both young and old .
1 #### I love these books ! ! C.S. Lewis was an excellent picturesque writer . I already have the paperback version , but I really want to have the kindle , unfortunately the price is ridiculous . Please lower the price so that I can buy it in kindle form . Thank you .
5 #### C.S. Lewis is a fabulous author . I read these chronicles as a child , then again as a young adult . Now it is my son 's turn , who is going to the 4th grade . He is reading them during the Summer . I hope he will be as enthralled as I was .
2 #### Reading these volumes to my children was wonderful . Listening to this reader read the same volumes is painfully , sugary - sweet and boring . If you want to fall asleep , buy this . The way he pronounces Aslan is almost obscene .
5 #### I read this book collection about twice a year , and always get more meaning and notice things I did not notice before . This is my favorite C S. Lewis book , and one of my favorite books of all time . You know the question about what book(s ) you would take if you could only take one or two . . this is my choice . Great stories and thought provoking themes .
5 #### The accompanying audio version with Patrick Stewart narrating makes a great combination and is highly recommended . Well done indeed , by the Lion 's mane !
5 #### I really liked how captivating this book was . It was full of action and it was a real thriller . If you do n't love scary , creepy , or sad books , this one is n't any of those things . It is tinged with a teensy weeny little tiny bit of each , but it is still a fascinating story of young boys and girls . It is mystical and mythical and a great follow up to The Horse and His Boy . - Rena 8 years old
5 #### I love all of C. S. Lewis ' books ! Although this was meant for children , I had never heard of this series until after I was married and in my 30 's . I love this because it is a tale that reminds me of Jesus and His home world ! :)
5 #### My granddaughter asked for these as a gift and they are lively . She will have a them for a little long time and the value was very good .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with C. S. Lewis ! This book is so fun . I have always been a fan of the Chronicles . I had not read this one for some odd reason . But now I have ! ! Loved it .
4 #### My son and I just started the Chronicles of Narnia - he is six years old - and we are enjoying the story so far .
4 #### All the recent reviews are of the BOOKS , not the audio recordings . That 's what I wanted to know about : how does Branagh do reading the books ?
5 #### " The Chronicles of Narnia " come alive and you feel you are in the stories .
5 #### The Narnia books came out a little late for my kids ( and me ) to enjoy They are treasures , even 60 years late .
5 #### Awesome series ! Definitely a must read for both younger and older readers .
4 #### It makes a good story full of dreams and enchantments . Worth reading once or twice , but not more , because it is not written in a way that the suspense remains the same every time you start reading it again .... But it 's ok , I still like the stories :-)
5 #### This was the first book my husband bought for me when we were first together and I ask him why . I can tell you know it took me on the greatest adventure of a life time
5 #### Priceless . I just love C.S.Lewis . Good hardcover bidding too .
5 #### Very nice set for the price .. my son is really enjoying it , thanks !
4 #### When the Pevensie children return to Narnia , they are received like King Arthur returning to England . They and the " Old Narnians " learn many lessons on faith as they battle to restore the ancient ways to the kingdom & fight to place Caspian on the throne .
5 #### I have loved the Chronicles of Narnia for many years and I 'm looking forward to reading them now in an electronic format . Lewis is one of my favorite authors . I will never tire of these timeless " children 's " stories .
5 #### My son has n't read this yet , but this a book I 've read again and again numerous times . Fantasy with a touch of morality and descriptive in a way you can almost imagine yourself in Narnia .
5 #### These are really well done . I have listened to them , my teen children have listened to them as they commute to work and school . I will definitely check out more Audio Books by them . Great job !
5 #### This book is a classic . It is aimed at children , but has many lessons for adults as well . It is especially good for reading out loud to children . Lewis is one of the greatest Christian thinkers and writers of his generation , and these books reflect that .
4 #### I bought the set as a gift and the young man seems to really like it .
4 #### The only improvement would be to include more illustrations . Excellent books .
5 #### My six year old granddaughter calls me every Wednesday night to read her a story before turning out the light . We are currently reading the Lion the Witch and Wardrobe . We only a half an hour and neither of us wants to stop but we get two chapters in and then ca n't wait until the next Wednesday . I plan on reading the whole series to her and then when her 15 month old sister gets old enough I will start all over . Never get tired of this and hope to watch the movies with my granddaughters also .
5 #### These have been my favorite stories since childhood and I am now enjoying sharing them with my grand children !
5 #### This is an excellent compilation of the Narnia series . I am reading them with my 9 year - old grandson and we are having a grand time exploring the themes developed in the books . This is how children 's literature should read .
5 #### I 've always heard wonderful quotes from this series , but previously I 'd never gotten past The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . However , I 'm now on the third book in the series and really enjoying and being inspired by it .
5 #### What a treat ! I ca n't believe I waited until my mature age to experience Narnia . This book is funny and thought - provoking with a subtle spirituality . I plan to read the other books in this series and would recommend this as a perfect bedtime read for children .
5 #### These books are obvious classics . No child should grow up being unfamiliar with the magic that is Narnia .
4 #### First book in the series -- I think my granddaughter will enjoy it !
5 #### Can not do better than C.S. Lewis for the story of redemption through the characters of fantasy .
5 #### I 'm really engrossed in this book . I do n't know why I have n't read it sooner .
4 #### Although this was a gift for my grandson , I Imagine the stories are wonderful . I know it arrived in great shape .
5 #### Love it ! I love these books best choice I made was buying them , they 're perfect for kids of all ages from 0 to +99 .
5 #### Like the title of this reveiw , this is THE first book of the Chronicles of Narnia . from the begining of this world to the last battle , this is a magical journey through the bible .
2 #### The anti - Christ type a beast dressed in a lion 's skin to imitate Aslan and start a revolt , leading a battle which Aslan wins . King tied to a tree , Good Friday style - even relieved with water on s sponge . Eventually , heaven and the Earth pass away - new heaven and earth established and the realisation that this earth , and the old Narina are only pale imitations of the REAL world . All very obvious , as usual . As a whole , the Narnia series is very popular , so kids must enjoy them - perhaps because they do not have Christian mythology in their mind when they read it and so it is n't so obviously allegorizing . Apart from Christian mythology , the series opens up the following issues good / evil , right / wrong , death , joy , love , reconciliation , journey - life as pilgrimage , suffering , sacrifice , forgiveness , courage , temptation , trust , new life , loneliness , freedom .

2 #### There s no denying that several children enjoy these Naria Tales and that some of them are ingenious - I like the idea of the wardrobe , in the first tale , through which a different time and space is entered , because it is imaginative and points to an awareness of different realities than that which our finite minds can perceive . That having been said , however , I always feel that Louis is trying too hard to preach a message and that his allegorising is too obvious both to the adult reader and to an intelligent child . There are other ways of broadening and enriching children 's minds than to give them a slanted metaphor steeped in biblical imagery of lions and apocalyptic battles and all too obvious references to Christ . One day , I must talk to a child who has recently read one of these tales and see how s / he perceives it . I 'm all for the ' Tell it slant ' approach and I do n't find this slanted enough .

That having been said , however , I always feel that Louis is trying too hard to preach a message and that his allegorising is too obvious both to the adult reader and to an intelligent child . There are other ways of broadening and enriching children 's minds than to give them a slanted metaphor steeped in biblical imagery of lions and apocalyptic battles and all too obvious references to Christ . One day , I must talk to a child who has recently read one of these tales and see how s / he perceives it . I 'm all for the ' Tell it slant ' approach and I do n't find this slanted enough .
5 #### My favorite series of books I have given them out many times to different children and families
5 #### This is the 5th in the Narnia series . I am enjoying re - reading it on my kindle and sharing it with my 6 year old Grand son who is also reading it .
4 #### A great adventure story ! Always leaving you wanting to step into Narnia and continue the journey to search for Aslan !
5 #### I love The Chronicles of Narnia -- the story , the allegorical content , the underscoring meaning . Boxen is a bonus -- story / play written by 8 year old C S Lewis and his 11 year old brother .
5 #### This is another delightful reading . C. S. Lewis is able to speak about meaning of life within the Christian scope in a fantastic way through the Chronicles of Narnia . I hope you enjoy the reading as much as I did .
5 #### It 's a great compilation of all the Narnia books in a single volume . Reading it to my daughter and I 'm enjoying it too ! I had only previously read the Lion , Witch and the Wardrobe , so the other Narnia stories are fun . These are arranged in the chronological order of the stories , however we 're reading in the published order . The quality of the book is good and should be a nice hand - me - down to my daughter 's kids ( hoping the pages do n't yellow too much or get brittle ! )
4 #### The last battle was sad at some parts but in the end I thought the author ended it wonderfully and could n't have been better .
5 #### Great books for my nieces . They loved them . Disappointed that the ordering of the books had changed since I was a child ( the Magician 's Nephew is moved to the front , and the Horse and His Boy are moved forward , so they are in order chronologically ) , but interesting stories and fun to read . Good books for children 8 - 10 years old .
4 #### The complete collection of " The Chronicles of Narnia " in one book . A classic series that appeals more to children , but is interesting to read nonetheless . The adventures are incredible and intriguing . Definitely a convenient and engaging read for young readers !
5 #### I especially liked THE MAGICIAN 'S NEPHEW because it was illuminating in that I got to watch Narnia come to life with Aslan 's powerful magic .
1 #### Looks totally different than the picture , seems cheap looking , and some words I could not see clearly . Also came slow .
4 #### it 's c.s . lewis . fantasy with morals -- and witches and disease and magic and travels and travails and friends and worlds being created and ruins and fantastical creatures .
5 #### We bought this for our ten year old . She loves to read . The deal we have with her is when she completes a book and writes us a report we will buy her another book . She has an e - reader for some stuff but she prefers the paper . I loved these books as a child . I hope she enjoys them as much as I did .
5 #### Loved the Narnia Chronicles , but the Boxen bonus book was n't to my taste . Narnia should be required reading in elementary schools !
2 #### Writing is choppy and hard to follow . Not as good as the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe writing .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia are a fantastic series of books . No child should go through life without the opportunity of stepping through a wardrobe , looking glass , or other door leading to the fancies of our imaginations . This is a must have for the nine year - old and up crowd .
5 #### My whole family are fans of the Chronicles of Narnia . I purchased this edition to replace a set that had been damaged .
1 #### This book started out good . It got my 6 year old girl and I really engaged and then it started throwing out themes of the worst of Christianity . Aslan ( the God Metaphor ) breathes on children and they fight better in a battle , a character introduced as wise ( a centaur ) tells children to go to war , those the author wants you to believe are pure of heart see Aslan first(setting up a kind of elitism ) , and the world is carved up so over - simplistically into good and evil . I kept stopping the reading to explain to my daughter that I did n't agree with this part and this It was staggeringly a battle of those with Aslan on their side vs those without him on their side and I kept thinking I ca n't believe I am reading something to my child with the Crusades as its lesson . I 'm still disturbed by it . If the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe had you a little uncomfortable with its Christian overtones , I would advise you to leave this one on the shelf . I wish I had . I read literature to inspire and expand my children and this did the opposite .
4 #### delightful . imaginative . fun . kool ... I like the allegorical / mythological ref 's I 'm an adult , and I appreciate esoteric / myth ... I think it 's interesting that a fast - paced ( somewhat-)modern children 's ( fairy - tale ) anthology alludes to Christ & his story /saga . I love how the main characters are relatable , though involved in such fantasy , and the story told in an exciting , quick - paced , spirited way , without being overly emotional .
5 #### I enjoyed getting the back story to the movie . This was a quick , easy read . I would recommend this book .
1 #### disappointed gift for a child the box set came taped together the books were yellowed and brittle and not usable(do I really have to give it a stsar ? )
5 #### The Last Battle Narnia has come to it 's end and Jill&Eustace have come to fight in The Last Battle of Narnia . I was SO happy to see all of my favorite characters come back at the end of the book that I ca n't explain in this review . I was surprised to see that this time it 's an ape that tries to to take over Narnia and " Starts things that he ca n't stop " like calling Tash ( That was NOT a good Idea ) and saying that " Tash and Aslan are one " , creating " Tashlan " . The saddest part was when the young badger was crying because Shift would not allow him to see Aslan . I love this book and the rest of the series . I was sad to see Narnia end but was happy to see it start . The ending was I found a bit creepy but A very happy one , but I do feel so sorry for Susan . I guess I always new that she was only meant for " Nylons , lipstick and invitations " . I was very happy to see Good old Reepicheep at the end , as well as Tumnus and Aravis And Cor and Ramandu 's daughter and Caspian and his son Prince Rillian ( In this book known as " King Rilian " and Oh , The list could go on and on ! What more could make this book better ? ? ? Nothing , It is already my most FAVORITE ! ! ! Long Live Aslan and Narnia ! -Annie Friginal
5 #### Great alogory of faith . Not exactly theologically driven but great read .
5 #### This is a marvelous collection . The performers really make the story come alive . My family also enjoyed the artwork on the cases . The tracks are fairly long so if you have to stop and eject the cd make sure it 's near the beginning of a track .
5 #### My kids very much enjoyed this . He could n't put it down . Two day read for him .
5 #### Lots of fun to read . It does n't matter if you are young or old everyone can enjoy the Narnia series .
5 #### C.S. Lewis was an extraordinarily deep thinker . One benefits greatly from reading any of his works .
4 #### Good book , however the stories are out of order as originally written by the author . It is a super large book with large print , like something you would give to a child .
5 #### All my kids love these books . They have a timeless quality .
5 #### These are absolutely beautiful books . The illustrations will make these stories , which are already wonderful , spring to life for both children and adults .
5 #### like the set of book and it is in fine condition . Hoping to learn more from this volume .
5 #### As with the other books in the Narnia collection , Prince Caspian is an excellent piece of literature brimming with adventure and moral lessons we ought to be instilling in our children . Do n't let Lewis ' vocabulary ( as it relates to his era and British culture ) discourage you . My 6 - year old and I are on book 4 and he is loving it . He quickly makes connections between Narnia and the real world , especially regarding Aslan 's character and Jesus . I explain or elaborate when necessary or when he asks questions . I also skip words like " ass " when used as an adjective . ;-)
5 #### A person never outgrows these books . They 're all such a great adventure ! I would recommend them for any person at any age .
3 #### After following these kids through adulthood the ending sucked . Quite frankly I do n't think it could have ended any other way but I really was disappointed . It is extremely patriarchal and offensive to any feminist . Still , it 's hard to read the series and not finish . I 'm just that kind of person .
5 #### A fantastic beginning to the Narnia chronicles ! It is very myth - like with new worlds discovered through magic rings and talking animals in the newly - created land of Narnia . I could definitely see the notes of biblical references to Genesis , God , Adam and Eve , even down to the forbidden apple tree . Many wonderful quotes of advice were included and I can see the book being a wonderful introduction and child - like explanation of God to young kids and plan to read it to my own when I have them . But , that is not to say it is n't a great read for adults , too ! It 's a nice escape from reality ( as all books should be ) , a dip into another world for a time .
5 #### I love these books ! I 've only had them a few weeks and have almost finished the series . Very well written books , that even being an adult , you can enjoy . I really like the way the author makes references to the Bible . It was the main reason I wanted to start reading books by this author . The books came with the cover illustrations pictured . They are obviously worn , but still in good shape . Extremely happy with my purchase .
5 #### This is the complete Chronicles of Narnia ... not just the Aslan bits ... All Works ! Amazing beautiful leather bound copy with gold leafing on the pages and a silk ribbon to mark your page . This book was apart of the Barnes and Noble leather bound collectible series . However , this book is now completely out of print .
5 #### This is a terrific set , neat album holders and designs on each disc . Very good sound quality . The metal case is sturdy and attractive as well .
5 #### Wonderfully packaged and fantastic rendition of the stories by Focus On The Family Radio Theatre !
5 #### Cs Lewis makes this story action packed and makes you sit on the edge of your seat
5 #### How embarrassed I feel to admit that I have n't read this book before now ? Very embarrassed . Its been recommended to me a million times . But the truth is that sequels often disappoint me ; its hard for a sequel to live up to the original book . VDT lives up to the original book . I would even say ( gasp ! ) that it surpasses the original book . Crazy . Action . Adventure . Bad guys . Good guys . Good guys who are a little bad . Bad guys who are a little good . Great plot . And all aboard a ship . Fabulous .
4 #### A little slower than the other chronicles , but still enjoyable .
2 #### I ordered a hardcover , received a paperback book in excellent condition . I shall return the item for the item I desired to purchase . I assume this was just an accident , I expect to be a very satisfied customer soon enough .
5 #### I did n't realize that it was a Christian allegory for young people , but I enjoyed it anyway . Very very sweet .
5 #### My family and I so enjoyed listening to these audiobooks ! My kiddos who are 10 , 9 , and 7 were all entranced by them and my huby and I also loved them . We have really been impressed with every audiobook ( more like audio " play " ) done by Focus on the Family 's Radio Theatre . I also highly recommend The Hiding Place and The Legend of Squanto by them .
5 #### My granddaughter is enjoying her new set of books .
5 #### I just love this book . Was surprised at all of the additional books .
5 #### great to have on hand - easy to read over and over again at any age .
4 #### Originally posted at www.readbetweenthebooks91.blogspot.com 3.6/5 stars ! This is my first time reading these books ! Can you believe it ? ! I absolutely loved the recent movies with William Moseley and Anna Popplewell . And knew that it was time . Its past time , really . So I went into The Magicians Nephew not knowing too much about this specific book but knowing enough about the future ones to get the gist of everything . And it was just so great to read . A bit nostalgic in a way because of the movies . It was very interesting to find out how everything happened . We see how Narnia is made and we meet the Witch and I practically squealed when Aslan came into the picture . I freaking love Aslan . I did find that the writing was a bit iffy , though . Mostly the dialogue and that s just because of how dated it is . Obviously . There s not much to say because I feel like everyone and their mother has read this series or at least watched the movies and know enough of what the stories are about . But I do know that I ca nt wait to read the rest of the series !
4 #### I did n't realize this was the first book in the series so I had previously read The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe . This one was pretty good . Digory and Polly were far from being insipid and intolerable children as I tend to expect . I quite liked them , especially Polly insisting that Digory apologize for hurting her , his recognizing he had done wrong , and her graceful acceptance of his apology . Jadis seemed a bit derivative , if C S Lewis had actually read any H P Lovecraft . Or maybe she just reminded me of Joss Whedon 's Illyria . She was scary , no question . This had some elements of deus ex machina such as the apple only working on Jadis in a certain way , and working a different way back in our world , but it 's a children 's fantasy so I 'm not complaining much .
5 #### I purchased this for a 10 - year old girl who is just beginning to build her library of favorite books . Really , this series is a must .
5 #### There are 3 different ways to read this series ! Do n't waste time complaining about the " proper order " I am SURE C.S. Lewis WOULD NOT CARE ! ! ! ! ! The series is wonderful . DON'T WASTE TIME BIT****G. About the order ! !
5 #### This is possibly my second favorite book in the series .
5 #### Excellent box set - a great gift for kids and adults alike .
5 #### Great book for children and adults . Interesting to see how Lewis wrote a prequel after the fact . Stitched together ver well
5 #### Finally , instead of keeping track of 7 different paperbacks --- which I will now give away --- all of the CON are contained in one hardback which opens flat so that there is no page rollover . I am delighted with this singular volume that puts each book in the author 's preferred order . Now all I need are some Turkish delights ;)
5 #### Great box set of all 7 Narnia books . Perfect gift !
5 #### This set is amazing and totally worth it . I love listening to these on CD . They were a replacement for another identical set I got but they became scratched and damaged . I should have made a digital personal copy in case that happened but I did not . These are enjoyable for all ages I think . They are not dramatized so may seem slow if you are expecting a movie pace or something . They work great on long car rides or when doing chores . I like to listen to them as I paint . I love how each book is narrated by a different person .
4 #### I love the size of the print for my 66 - year - old eyes . I a enjoying revisiting this children 's classic series . I am opting to read them in the order that Lewis completed them , rather than the order that they are placed in the book .
5 #### My daughter is really enjoying this series . She is in 6th grade . Love the Christian theme throughout .
5 #### I loved these books as a child and read them over and over again .
5 #### I could n't put the book down , I loved the beautiful christian parallels that stood out to me so boldly . I recommend this book
4 #### This is a great edition of the series . Regardless of anyone 's opinions about the order of reading the stories , these prints are of a good quality . The paper is a heavier stock than your average checkout lane novel . It 's a pure white paper with a bit of stiffness to it . The full color pictures are a nice touch . They 're randomly interspersed throughout the books and create a nice breakup of continuous typeset . This box set means you wo n't have to carry around the big " all - in - one " edition . We recommend buying it for your school aged children .
5 #### Beautiful book - and the stories are great of course .
5 #### This was a gift for my son and his 8 - year - old daughter . They enjoyed reading it together .
4 #### This is actually a prequel to the Chronicles of Narnia , so I m not quite sure why its listed as # 6 , but oh well . These are not the traditional characters you are used to in the rest of the Narnia series , although some make debuts . We are introduced to Diggory and Polly . Diggory has just moved and is pretty miserable since his mom is sick and his dad is across the world working and he s stuck with his crazy uncle and stuffy aunt . He meets his neighbor Polly and after striking up a friendship they begin exploring the attics above their attached homes . Thanks to Diggorys crazy uncle they both end up unwillingly entering a new and magical world , which actually becomes multiple worlds . I really enjoyed the fun way Lewis uses description in this one . Its much more fun for the kids to hear as well . This book gives a great introduction into the world of Narnia . If you ever wondered how Narnia and the lightpost and everything came to be , this will answer your questions . I am a fan of the allegories between Lewis books and Christianity , this one in particular , the creation of the world . The kids enjoyed listening to this one , a chapter a day and we still finished it pretty quick . I would recommend it for all ages .
5 #### It may not be as good as a Harry Potter book , but It was still really good . I love this book !
5 #### I loved the tension and the cliff hangers . I I 'm just a kid so that is all I got bye .
4 #### Its nice to have it all in one book with an attractive cover . Its better than Lord of The Rings . However , the the themes are a bit violent and reflective of the times . Most but not all stories would be appropriate for any age . Classics as a whole , but not perfect stories . The writing is very funny and reminds me of Roald Dahl . None of the stories are as good as the first Harry Potter book . Entertaining and would make a good gift , especially at Christmas . I think every child deserves to think of themselves as royalty , because they should know that they are important in their own way .
5 #### I read this series to my children and bought this boxed set for my granddaughters . This is a tremendous series .
4 #### I liked it but it was much bigger in size than what I thought we 'd ordered for my daughter . It is large and hardcover .
5 #### excellent series . There was a reason that J R Tolkein was best friends with CS Lewis . Both amazing writers .
1 #### its ablut james Cameron sittibg in his room when a lion ate him and his wonful head rolled like a ball mean soccer ball
1 #### This book , in my opinion , is very baaaaaad . This is just a warning;some of you may not think the same as me . I 'm not critisising the author or anything , but I feel this book does n't express the terms correctly . It 's not exciting , and the author did not keep you in suspense , unlike Book 1 . You can buy this book , I'm not stopping you . I 'm just telling you what I think . If you have anything you want to say , even if it 's for critisising me , you can find me at youtube . My channel is JoleneTKY.See you !
1 #### its about tom cruise sword fight ing with jackie chan and then the lion ate them all there soul cried for 5096 years the end
5 #### I read this book in under 3 hours , which I did n't expect at all , tho I read the others in a matter of days and weeks , but I did n't remember anything of it from my childhood , so I rushed thru it , but did n't expect to finish it in about 3 hours ! ! ! The ending is sad yet happy as you realize they 've all come full circle to Aslan 's country but you know what that means in the end . Nevertheless , I think the ending will leave you smiling . Great book !
4 #### Purchased this book set for my 8 year old niece who is an avid book reader . I wanted to get her a set of books she could keep forever . I read this series years and years ago and loved it then . She was excited to get reading , as she was already familiar with " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " from seeing the play on a field trip in school . I wish the box that the books were in was more attractive , but that 's just a personal taste thing I suppose . I 'm not a fan of the art work . But it 's about the stories inside , and those are great , so overall happy with the purchase !
5 #### I did n't realize there was a prequel to the Chronicles of Narnia series . I enjoyed reading how Narnia was founded !
5 #### My kids are 6 and 11 . There are mornings where the 6yo says excitedly to the 11yo " Wanna go downstairs and listen to Narnia ? " and they both run excitedly to the stereo . This particular version is not just an audible read , but dramatized -- so it 's fascinating for the kids . And the holder is a work of art in and of itself . My only regret is not waiting to use it on a 15 - hour road trip !
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for and delivery time was excellent !
5 #### The children and I read this book together in the evening . Written after the Chronicles of Narnia to explain how Narnia came into existence . It is quick and light reading but very enjoyable . Not as detailed as the Chronicles but as always addresses some difficult life issues and has positive outcome .
5 #### This set was actually purchased as a christmas present for my nephews half way across the country . I spoke with my brother when they arrived and he said my older nephew was actually picking them up to read , while my younger nephew looks interested but is n't quite reading chapter books yet . I consider it a good investment in their library and collection . It arrived in good time , before the date , and in good condition ( this was actually purchased not during the holiday season but before it . ) I was very happy , thank you
5 #### Great , as are all the stories in the Chronicles of Narnia ..
4 #### It gave me a glipse of what I imagine heaven to be .
5 #### These books are great reads , I recently read them myself and liked them so much I bought them for my nieces . I like that they are in individual books ; I have seen the series in one large book , but I think that makes them seem more intimidating to grade schoolers . Easy enough to read for children , but entertaining enough for adults . The box keeps them in good condition when not being read .
5 #### Always been a favorite story . Fun to read to kids and imitate the British accents and sayings . ( When the girls cry , it 's called " blubbing " . )
5 #### Fairy tales both for the young and old . Captivates , and does not let you go . Could not stop reading till I was finished . A book that is as much of a great read is:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Quest - for - the - Lost - Name - A - Transformational - Thriller - of - Metaphysical - and - Visionary - Fantasy - Soulmate - Romance - Esoteric - Initiation - and - New - Age - Spirituality - Metaphysical - Fiction - Series - Book-1 / dp / B00N99OLVI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Quest for the Lost Name : A Transformational Thriller of Metaphysical and Visionary Fantasy , Soulmate Romance , Esoteric Initiation , and New Age Spirituality ( Metaphysical Fiction Series Book 1)</a > , which describes the deep mysteries of life , overcoming death and mastering life .
5 #### It is epic especially when you read the lion the witch and the wardrobe first because then it is so unraveling to the reader(s ) it gets you so like , ohh that 's where she came from , or that 's how it was made or started.and I just love the series so far .
3 #### These come in the new order - not the one CS Lewis originally published them in . They actually number the books this way on the front . So , The Magician 's Nephew is listed as Book 1 . We rearranged them ourselves , but still , they look out of order in the box .
5 #### Foor school , but as yet they have not listened to it . love the novels .
4 #### I love this whole series , the Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe is obviously the best so far , now I 'm onto the Silver Chair and the High King , and I ca n't remember if I ever actually read those as a child so I 'm looking forward to it ! The thing to remember here is this is n't your typical fantasy book where the good army fights the evil army , the bad guy gets defeated in the end and so on , this is a book about discovery , a ship searching for seven missing lords and attempting to map unknown waters in the process . It does n't have the climactic battle ending or anything , but if you 're a fan of the Narnia series , it is a necessary tie in between the first books and the final ones , as you now say goodbye to the last of the Pevensies and move ahead to Eustace and Jill Pole ( who is probably mentioned once in this book ) . A good read !
3 #### Great story ! Very magical wardrobe ! I loved the book and will read it whenever I get a chance ! My stepmom Mary and my dad recommended it to me and I loved the book ! I recommend this book to anyone who likes magic !
5 #### Loved them all keep them all coming and thanks
5 #### This is the second set of this wonderful series we have purchased . The kids love to take them alone on family road adventures and they tend to be left behind at restaurant tables and hotel rooms . Hope the finders enjoy them just as much as we have .
5 #### Perhaps my favorite of the series . Have not read in a long time and had forgotten how great this book is !
5 #### I guess this is just what I wanted , since it is a Christmas present for my granddaughter . I 'll know the impact ( good or bad ) when she starts reading it .
5 #### I purchased this book to replace one that was lost from my Narnia Series . Of course , these are classics . There 's not much I can say that has n't already been said , but I like that the Narnia Series is loosely based on biblical principles and that they are told in such a way that is interesting and exciting to children . I became hooked on the series when I was in the 4th or 5th grade . My children enjoy them as well . I would recommend this to anyone who has a child who is interested in fantasy , and especially who might be leery of allowing their children to read more secular books like Harry Potter .
5 #### Just as described . Fast shipping . Was a gift for my daughter and she loves it .
3 #### I am currently reading the Chronicles of Narnia to my daughter . They are delightful stories , but sometimes they feel a bit lacking . In Prince Caspian , it feels a bit anti - climactic . The final battle is fairly glossed over , and in the background behind the final battle everybody is conquored nearly off - stage ( and only described later ) by Aslan and Bacchus . I 'd have preferred that Miraz have a bit more page - time later in the book given his role as the villain .
5 #### Among my favorite books ever ! The symbolism which C.S. Lewis used to tie Naria and its characters with the Christian Bible stories of the creation , death and resurrection of Jesus , teachings of Jesus , and story of the end times is very interesting . These books were loved by my children as I read a chapter a day to them , by me as I read them in my teens , and my me as I 've read and re - read them throughout my life .
2 #### This came ... ripped up . The back cover is shot . I 'm really surprised ... unpleasantly so . And the pages are darkened ... just not a good gift for Christmas at all .
5 #### These audiobooks are tremendous . I enjoy the BBC Radio theatre productions as well , but I love a good narration on a good book .... and these are great narrations on great books . Great product and great value !
5 #### I am so glad that my mom got me the chronicles and got me into the series ! C S Lewis is one of my favorite authors
5 #### These stories are fascinating and I take them with me whenever I travel on trips in a car . The hours of driving just seem to fly by as I feast on the beautifully - read works by C.S. Lewis . My grandson loves to listen to them whenever he spends the night at our house . He goes to sleep hearing these great stories .
5 #### CS Lewis is a magician in his ability to convey deep spiritual truths in simple children 's stories . I 'm so familiar with " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " ( the traditional first book in the Narnia series ) that I always seem to get stuck in it , so I decided to restart my reading of the series in this volume , which Lewis intended to be the start . It was absolutely delightful and deeply inspirational . I 'm now proceeding with " A Horse and His Boy . "
4 #### Books were n't quite as high quality as I wanted them to be . Great books though .
5 #### My son and i have been reading a chapter in this every night and we 're several hundred pages in . Note that this combines all the books into one , and puts them in a different order than the multi - book version I have . However , I 've concluded that I like the order with the Magician 's Nephew starting first , as it fits better chronologically .
5 #### C.S. Lewis is a master story teller . He keeps you interested in both the plot and the characters . I plan to read the rest of the series .
5 #### A fairly short read that gives a great story of how Narnia began .
5 #### Bought this set for a gift . Have read these stories many times over the years as children were growing up . Now granddaughter will be reading them to her daughter ! The battle between good and evil is portrayed brilliantly .
5 #### I love the way Peter Edmund and Lucy enter the Narnia series at the end ! What was sad is that since Susan was my favorite character I was sad that she changed and refused to speak about Narnia and her past life . Great book once again ! Keep it up C.S. Luis ! ! ! !
5 #### i like reading the stories in the small paperback version .
5 #### My children are loving this collection ! I have 4 children ages 11yrs to 5yrs , and we listen to these CD 's whenever we are in the car ... even if it 's only a 10 minute drive to our destination . We are on the 5th set of discs/5th book of the series and we are very happy with the collection thus far . The fact that my children ask to listen to it says everything . '
4 #### loved reading all of these but chose not to read in the order they gave but in the order CS Lewis wrote them .
5 #### JMJ 12 year old : " C.S. Lewis did a very good job writing these stories and used very exciting words . I think this story should be enjoyed by many people for many years to come . " 9 year old : " I like the work of the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis and think that its exciting adventures should be shared throughout the world from generation to generation . It was about how Lucy , Susan , Peter and Edmund fell in love with Aslan and became kinds and queens of Narnia . " 10 year old : " I like it because it had a lot of adventure in it . It was easy to read but sometimes hard to understand . There were some words I did n't know the meaning of . I recommend it for anybody . "
5 #### I first read The Chronicles of Narnia as a child and have loved them ever since . This is my favorite book of the series , though they all are wonderful . I am glad to have it on my Kindle now .
5 #### Amazing , highly recommended . Also available from Christian Book Distributors .
3 #### the book is very well written and has some interesting characters that are eventually ruined by heavy handed christian parallels . Lewis basically copies the bibles origin story . It 's too bad he could n't find a proper identity for this book , because the series could have been great .
5 #### Love these books ! ! the great stories are awesome and not to mention the box set .
5 #### Nice edition , the manageable size helps these to be approachable for my 3rd grader , and the covers have metallic detailing that is beautiful . If you are n't familiar with Narnia , they are a powerful and fun fantasy series . They contain some wonderful Christian allegory though a lot of it is n't overt ( at least not as , say , Little Pilgrim 's Progress ) . Children 4 + enjoy listening to it read aloud , children 7 + enjoy reading them , and there 's plenty about them for a teen or adult to enjoy reading as well , whether it 's for the first time or the tenth .
5 #### This was a good book and it was very good book because it was adventurous . Thank you for this awesome book !
5 #### This is one of the BEST version I have heard ! Since I have received these CD 's I 've already had them borrowed several times . People love to have them playing when they are cleaning , traveling etc . This version allows you to " see " Narnia , you 'll understand when you hear them . I 'm in my 30 's and grew up reading the books but I still enjoy listening to these stories . They get better as you get older and realize C. S. Lewis analogy 's to scripture . Bottom Line : Buy you will NOT regret it , ever ! The best present ever !
3 #### This book completes the series and the Christian allegory . As a result , most of the book is dedicated to the end or heaven . Thus I think this was the weakest book in the series . Nothing against heaven , but it never really makes great literature . It was very difficult to explain this to my young listener . It was also difficult to sustain their attention . If you are reading for the allegory this is your book . If you are reading for closure , this is it . If the excitement and draw of the series has waned , you can skip it .
5 #### the skipped so much when they did this as a movie .
4 #### well , that 's quite a difference from the movie ! I read this as a child but could n't remember it so I decided to re - read the entire series recently . it 's still as magical as when I read back then !
5 #### I have read this Author over and over again . These books seems to be for children but they are deep in thought . Compare the story with our belief in Jesus Christ . You will find you know the STORY that comes out under the child 's story . Read them .
5 #### My Grandkids just love these books . They are a bit on the young side but they get so excited when it is time for me to read to them . They both like fantasy and adventures so these have been fun to read .
5 #### Great . I really did feel a lot of spirituality in here .
5 #### A wonderful way to get the whole series at once . It might be too big a book for a child to handle , but would be fine for an adult reading to them , which is what I hope will happen with this volume !
5 #### A wonderous and beautiful story . My daughters favorite book so far . A must read for anyone searching for adventure and a glimpse of heaven .
3 #### These are okay , but they are the size of mass media paper backs height wise .
5 #### Fun to read to my little boy .... Time spent together with a great book
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia is one of my favorite book(s ) of all time . I just finished reading it for probably the tenth time in the last 20 years . It always makes me smile , laugh , and cry . It challenges and encourages me . Timeless truths .
3 #### Kind of not clear in the description when I purchased this but ... This is NOT a set of the Chronicles of Naria Books ! This is one giant , unwieldy book with all the stories in it . I got this to read to my homeschool class and this is really just very difficult to work with . Individual books would have been better , so just be aware of that . I 've also found sereral misprints in the book where words are repeated and once where some were left out , that made it difficult to read out loud . It 's really a subpar book " set " which is sad , because the Chronicles of Narnia is , was , and always will be some of my favorite books !
5 #### Felt the same as when I read it as a youth .
5 #### I saw more of the allegory this time than I did when I was a teen .
5 #### I love these books . I have worn out many copies of this epic journey . I also have the hardback edition which I am using . I bought this as a present for a lady that was turning 50 and as CS Lewis said , there may come a day when you are old enough to enjoy fantasies again .
3 #### Would have been better if the books were arranged in the order published .
2 #### Wanted the collection of the books . Got one LARGE book . Too much for a teenager to handle . Will keep for myself so I can talk with niece about it .
5 #### This book was SO much better than all the other ones . because I go to a Christian school I have had to read all the Narnia books . Before I read this book I considered the series very dull and unbelievable . The thing that was so great about it was that it gave me a different POV about the books . This book explained that are Narnia is not a just some magical place that you get to by going through some wardrobe but it is , like are world , one of thousands of universes that the only way to get to one universe to another is by magic . This book also explains , were the white witch came from , why the wardrobe is a portal into Narnia , and the origins of that two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve prophecy from the lion the witch and the wardrobe . They also go to other worlds besides Narnia .
3 #### My least favorite of the four Narnia books I have read so far . Not bad , but not as good as the others . I was a little bored ; less drawn into the emotion and adventure .
5 #### Great book I think anyone with a thirst for adventure would love this ! Totally worth buying the book , get it now !
5 #### I read The Chronicles of Narnia to my children but , it has been awhile . I did n't miss the symbolism and was a lovely read and good for any age group .
4 #### A lovely story ! It 's like a fairy tale for more grown - up children . :-) I daresay , I even enjoyed " Prince Caspian " better than " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " . The writing is so clever , and the " people " and " creatures " ( for the most part ) are so charming ( except for the evil ones ) . Looking forward to reading more of the Narnia series .
5 #### Must read for children of all ages ! C.S. Lewis is a fantastic writer !
5 #### I had read this beginning book of this series in my own childhood and though it seems shorter than I remembered I was able to see all the hidden analogy the author masterfully concealed in this great children 's story . Some of the older English words I had to define and explain to the kiddos , but my six year old enjoyed the tale .
5 #### Great set - the paper quality is fantastic and lend themselves to an enjoyable reading experience
5 #### Great price . Got this to read through the stories with my fiance and her to kiddos . The movies are pretty good , and got there interest . But the books are really good .
5 #### I 'm 17 and love it . They are very interesting books with fantastic story lines . And here they are , all seven of them , in one book . Now how cool is that . C. S. Lewis is a great writer and you can certainly see that throughout these books . Very original and interesting story lines . My favorite of them all is The Magician 's Nephew because it told how Narnia came to be . I definitely recommend you get this book . You wo n't regret it .
5 #### Must read again and again . At 58 I feel like a kid again . What could be better ?
4 #### This is not what I expected , it was much better . This is a single book , where my intention was to buy the series . Lovin it !
5 #### Yet another great Narnia book ! Much better than the movie . This one was actually a lot different than the movie . More so than the other books . Even if you have seen this movie you need to read the book !
5 #### Great book with all of the stories . Best price out there .
5 #### Great to listen to on long car trips with kids . Also great to use if you have trouble sleeping .
5 #### This book is a " must " for children . These stories are C.S. Lewis 's great continuing anthology of Narnia that are written for the child 's mind and understanding . It is so written that it will engage their imaginations and the adult reader can even delve into the deeper meanings of the stories - Biblical stories written to unlock the Godhead 's mission in this world . Great work , great price , timeless usefulness .
5 #### Bought these for my grandson last year . He loved them .
5 #### This is a great way to encourage reluctant readers !
5 #### Have not read it yet . I have neard good things about it
5 #### I was a middle school librarian for over thirty years . The popularity of the Narnia books was always high , even before the movies came out . I enjoyed this first volume so much , I purchased all seven titles in Kindle format , and several studies of the themes , allusions , and influences Lewis used on the series . I also recommend his books on Christianity as profound , but very read able .
5 #### I loved reading this classic , learning where Narnia and our world first met , and hearing the power and purposes of Aslan ! Such a fun read !
4 #### After rereading this a second time , I found I liked it almost as much as the Lion , the witch and the wardrobe and would like to see this put into film as well , as it explains the creation and founding of Narnia . Hopefully that will happen !
3 #### It is an ok book . Nothing happens until the end when The big battle happens . Not the best book I ever read
5 #### These are great stories for young folk . I 'm in my second childhood , so I enjoyed them twice over ! Nicely boxed for shelf space savings , and priced quite reasonably .
5 #### Adventures abound as Caspian , Edmund , Lucy & Eustace travel from Narnia eastward . Dragons , invisible people , foreboding darkness , lily seas are only a few of the exciting discoveries during the journeys .
5 #### Beautiful book for any library . A collector 's item which children will also love .
5 #### Phenomenal book . It 's a very easy book to read , so if you 're thinking of buying it for a child 6 and over , go ahead . That said , The Chronicles are a series , and you should probably start with either The Magician 's Nephew ( which was printed later , but is actually a very , very important prequel ) or The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , which are equally amazing . Plus ! When you 're finished reading the book , you can watch the movie ! It 's different than the book ( which is always true ) , but still great .
5 #### A wonderful book . A very , very , very adventurous book . Kina creepy in parts like in the old house and Charn but We loved it at the end .
5 #### The beginning of The Chronicles of Narnia . Timeless . A great read for adults & children . C.S. Lewis captures the magic & imagination of every reader .
5 #### C. S. Lewis is a master in combining imagination with logic , depth and practicality . This book will make you think about life and death , good and evil while giving some insights about Narnia and how everything started .
5 #### I have been pleasantly surprised to find how much more appealing this book was than the Lion , Witch , and Wardrobe . My young son was just enthralled with this story . The adventure , pace , and story are perfect for my kindergartener . The allegory was lost of course , but how can you compete with a swashbuckling mouse ? ( I was actually surprised at how much more page for page allegory there was . I 'm not sure I saw all of that 35 years ago . )
3 #### The Mahician 's Nephew is a wonderful and clear example of a Christian allegory . For throughout it we see many references that can help us understand the true meaning of the book when taken beyond the primary plot . All in all , the book was good albeit slow and in many ways frivolous . It was interesting and enjoyable to learn about and better understand Narnia and how it came to be and in that sense this book was the best prequel / entry book to the series in my opinion . I look forward to the other books in the series and hope that the plot gets better , or potentially just has more action . At times I did wish it did not force it 's message so strongly , for at times I felt it had no purpose other than to teach religious meanings but this could just be an " adult " ( am I really ? ) issue where we read into things more than we are meant to . I would recommend this book to many but I 'm unsure who I could or would recommend it to for fear that it would encroach on their own personal beliefs .
5 #### Ca n't say much on this because bought as a gift . But books are great and cheap . Its at a lower level so perfect for children .
4 #### As far as books go , The Chronicles of Narnia are classics that will never cease to be on bookshelves . I purchased this for the library , as I felt it would be better for people to check books out one at a time instead of one book with all seven stories . The cover artwork on them is n't the best I 've ever seen , but the stories are still the same ! Very pleased with the purchase !
5 #### Command - line Weakness in this case is the best possible freelance work with you and the best possible to use it uses type of duty to use it for dead at a time of duty to use to make a time of year to the best possible freelance workers at the best possible freelance workers at the best of all the time to use to use the Eye travel this year and a half life mod for a
4 #### My students liked the box 's design and the first book was borrowed on the same day I unpacked it and put it on display .
5 #### I have now read four of the Chronicles of Narnia and I am still loving absolutely every bit of it ! I ca n't wait to start the next one ! Recommended for children of ALL ages ! !
4 #### I have read all the Chronicles of Narnia . This last book is a little more complicated theologically . The others are easier to understand . The ending here is beautiful , but puzzles me a little .
4 #### Really best after witch . This one is a little slow and sometimes deviate from topic . But overall really entertaining . Must read .
3 #### love the stories of Narnia , the book printed is ok the paper is not great .
5 #### As a huge Chronicles of Narnia fan my daughter really enjoyed reading this book over the summer .
3 #### You really should have specified that this is one volume and not the set of seven books we are used to . How can my grandchildren share this way ?
4 #### Awesome . Not as fast paced as the second book . But this book is the base . So must read . Author is clearly taken the story to a higher level even adults can read .
5 #### Read the Chronicles of Narnia in the original order , first as a young adult , then to my husband , and then to my various children as they grew . I am now ordering a set for my grandchildren . I agree adamantly about the original order . I can not imagine appreciating the other books without first knowing who Aslan is in the " Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . " Wish the publishers would take note . You can read them in the original order by taking note of when each book was published .
5 #### This boxed set from 1970 is something I 've always wanted . It conjures so many memories for me . I love the books - especially " The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe . " These books are in order of publication - which I prefer and as I read them . I have liked the films - though I did n't really understand the changes and additions to the stories . I 'm looking forward to the next film which is suppose to be " The Silver Chair " - another favorite as I adore Puddleglum .
3 #### Last Narnia book . The ending was a bit surprising , but if you figured it out somewhere along there that this entire series was a Christian allegory , it was n't much of a shock .
5 #### Are you kidding ? Good for all ages . Depth that never disappoints .
4 #### Good book , but a little slower moving in the third quarter of the book , then it picked up . However this could be the writers decision to do it this way to give the reader also the sense of forever being on The Dawn Treader sailing . Very good ending .
3 #### It 's weird how these books skip around in time . I do n't remember much about this . . . I think I just read it to get through it and go on to the next one . I do n't really find myself very drawn to Narnia . It 's weird how these books skip around in time .
3 #### A rather humdrum ride on a ship . I wish I did n't feel so often that the narrator is lecturing me sneakily .
3 #### Ooh , you get to see how the wardrobe that leads to Narnia came to be . I started reading this because it seemed ridiculous that I never had , and it was such a classic .
5 #### We loved reading this series with my daughter . We did n't read them in the order they are boxed though , went by the order they were written as other reviewers mentioned . I think that was a good idea .
5 #### Great story . A classic . Eustice 's storyline is my favourite part of this book .
5 #### A birthday gift for my Grandson . I was surprised at his eagerness to read these classics over playing video games during his quiet time . A real accomplishment was achieved for getting him started on the classics .
5 #### A marvelous finish to an engaging series . The Christian message is crystal clear . A great read !
3 #### boring book for my 10yo . she wanted to move on to the more exciting books .
5 #### This book is beautifully illustrated . It is nicely bound and has a pretty red ribbon book marker . It is large enough that it can also act as a coffee table book . it would make a great gift .
5 #### To go through all of these at once is like being renewed in spiritual freshness .
5 #### I absolutely love this book ! It reflects so much on the Christian faith that some might be offended to , but has the in depth dramatic feel , that will stay with you for a lifetime ... not that Christian books ca n't have that feel , but it will probably bemy lifetime FAVORITE book .
5 #### You are never too old for fairy tales . I am75 y / o and I loved reading this book . In a world that seems to be falling apart at the seams , it was great to sit down and read about the exciting adventures in the stories about wonderful Narnia . Of course you know pretty much how the stories are going to end ( they are , after all , fairy tales ! ! ) and that 's really the point . I found the authors style of writing made for an enjoyable , easy read .
5 #### I bought this for my granddaughter because she was doing a book report . She watched this only after she had completed the book report . Passed with an A. See , reading is good !
5 #### My absolute favorite of the series ! ! The movie totally ruins it , as it is NOTHING like the book . Highly recommended reading !
4 #### Certainly not my favorite of the series , especially with the weird doctrinal issue of Aslan saying that a life lived for Tash counts for Aslan , and those being in Aslan 's country not being able to see or hear others ... definitely odd . The ape gets annoying as a bully to poor Puzzle the donkey , and I find it sad that Susan no longer believes in Narnia . However , that is a sad reality in the lives of many people . The other books in the series are definitely more adventuresome , and I think with the focus not on the Pevensie children , part of the interest for me , faded .
3 #### Unfortunately this story is just too descriptive and long winded . It appears that the author ran out of ideas and it has none of the magic of the lion , witch and the wardrobe . My 8 year old son and I did not finish it . We watched the movie instead .
5 #### Bought this as a gift for mother . Well received .
5 #### I had read this book before so I knew it was good but it came as described and came sooner than expected which was a bonus .
5 #### I have read this book before so I knew it was good but it came as described and came sooner than expected which was a bonus .
5 #### I have read this book before so I knew it was good but it came as described and came sooner than expected which was a bonus .
5 #### BOok used to replace missing one of the same in our church library ; it 's been years since I actually read this book , but it is an an enjoyable book for sure
5 #### This is a great series . I already own these books and I just bought this set for my nephew . Everyone should read them they are great for all ages .
5 #### Great book that any child or adult should read . I give it a 5 out of 5 because it 's a wonderful book .
5 #### As a lifelong fan of sci - fi and fantasy it is surprising that I am just now getting around to the Narnia series but I am glad I finally am ! ! Book one was awesome and I 'm hoping it gets even better from here ! !
4 #### C.S. Lewis has a lot to say even though he left this earth 50 years ago , he is a source of wisdom practical and moral that needs our full consideration !
5 #### This book is often downplayed as the least " exciting " of the Chronicles , but after re - reading it recently I found I enjoyed it more than I recalled . It details the Pevensie children 's return to Narnia as well as Caspian 's youth , escape from his usurping uncle King Miraz , and the uprising of " Old Narnia " who champion him as their true king . Themes include faithfulness , belief under persecution , doing the right thing even when others do n't support you , and bravery in the face of probable defeat . In Narnia , of course , many elements of our Greek / Roman mythology are actively present - at least when Aslan calls them forth . Many of us have probably wondered what it would be like to see places we are fond of and/or have lived in once they become part of the past , or archaeological sites , and Lewis does a nice job of that with Cair Paravel ( although we note that it is restored and in use by the time of Voyage of the Dawn Treader ) . The Chronicles of Narnia have been dear favorites since childhood , and now that my middle years are almost gone I still take a lot of pleasure in reading them .
3 #### This is a softcover volume with all seven Narnia stories . Nice size book , nice cover art . The binding does not hold up well against a family of determined readers .
5 #### Very fast shipping , we are so happy with the seller - invisibledog , the book was used but exceed our expectations . All seven books look great , like new ! My daughter was so happy to have it . She could not wait to start reading them soon . We are happy with our purchased . Thank you very much !
5 #### I love having all the books in the series in one volume . The book came packaged well for protection . Delivery was very prompt and it 's appearance was exactly as represented .
5 #### My favorite of the Narnia books I have read so far . I was disappointed by Lion , Witch etc but Prince Caspian was great !
5 #### This is a great book that shares the joys of childhood - both curiosity and loyalty . It also exhibits the results of doing what is right , even when tempted to do the opposite .
5 #### This book is really good and is n't to long so I recommend anyone with a love for adventure to start reading the Narnia books
5 #### A fun read that I just finished with my daughter . Not quite as good as the lion , witch , and wardrobe , but a great prequel to setup that story .
5 #### Perfection at its finest . These were my favorite growing up , now they are my favorite growing old . JRR has nothing compared to CS Lewis .
5 #### C.S. Lewis was a very good writer . His books have been so great to read . I loved the Chronicles of Narnia .
5 #### What a wonderful book ! It is interesting from cover to cover for both my children and me . Loved this book .
5 #### Beautifully written . A great intro into the actual land if Narnia . I thought it would be different . BUT HEY , IT TURNED OUT EVEN BETTER ! ! ! !
5 #### I loved the Narnia Chronicles -- C. S. Lewis 's imagination is rich and full of a mythology of his own , with unlikely characters ( aside from the children ) and set in an alien world . ( It is interesting to note that Lewis and J.R.R.Tolkien were members of a literary group called The Inklings that met in an Oxford Pub . ) This volume comes at the end of the series and all that went before is made clear . While it is considered children 's literature , I find I 'm quite happy to pick up this , or any of the other volumes , and have a quiet trip into a world filled with symbol , interest and mystery .
5 #### Purchased this for my child to read for school . I needed it quickly so he could meet the time line . We received it in record time . The book was as described . My child enjoyed reading this work by C.S. Lewis .
5 #### I 've read this to my children , and they are now reading to theirs . My 6 year old grandson is thoroughly loving it !
4 #### I of course started by Reading The Lion , Witch and Wardrobe . And was hooked then started back by getting The Magician 's Nephew and thus it began . I then read all of them one by one and was very glad I decided to read all of them . Like I mentioned before they are a vary good read for young and old .
5 #### In every sense of the word ; there is not a better , more meaningful , or better written series out there . Do n't delay : start again at the beginning and find what you missed the first time through .
5 #### Renew your faith , as simply as a child . Be reminded how life can be , and step back to a time of manners , respect , honesty , and expectations .
5 #### this book is great for those who are going into high school or even middle school i have read this book before and had to get it again i enjoyed the setting and roles these people played
5 #### Good . Hi good . Read it . Plz . Worth while . Good book for your nook . Read this plz . If u dare
5 #### The classic fantasy stories that turn out right in the end . This is a good way to get your children interested in reading books . Read the first one to them or with them and they will love it . They will become insatiable readers .
2 #### Plenty of typos in the text . However , the price was right - you get the whole series for practically nothing . I 'd say that makes the value match the price . Note- sorted in publication order , not chronologically . If that matters to you , one way or the other .
4 #### I was so excited that all of the Narnia books could be bought at once , and for so cheap ! All of the other copies of these books are so much more expensive and can only be bought alone . This is a really good deal and anyone who enjoys the Narnia stories should buy it . However , this copy does have a few small issues , but nothing too distracting .
4 #### I 'm a huge fan of this book and the whole series . I managed to get all 7 for 14 dollars through a kindle daily deal and I 've enjoyed having them all in digital form . Worth a buy if you 're looking for a chapter book for your middle school child or even if you 're adult looking for solid christian reading material . Only knocked it a star because this particular book drags a little bit .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia has been one of my favorite series since childhood , and even now that I 'm middle aged ( plus ) I still enjoy reading these books every so often . This book is SO much better than the recent movie version . Whoever wrote the screenplay should have been truer to the book , because it did n't need embellishment . I came out of the movie theater scratching my head and wondering what I 'd just seen because it was n't The Voyage of the Dawn Treader . There are so many enjoyable adventures in the book . From the smallest episode like the close shave with the sea monster to the retired star Coriakim 's island the book has plenty of adventure for younger readers , or those like myself who can still remember being young . It brings back the idea of the possibility of encountering something unknown , the thrill of discovery .
5 #### Th I s is my second set in 15 years . I love , love , love the Chronicles of Narnia . I also love the new updated colored covers .
5 #### Another excellent tale in the series . The children return to Narnia and meet the Prince who will follow in Narnia after them and the tale to his taking his rightful place . Very fun story to read . Great for kids and a little escape as an adult .
5 #### The Narnia series is of course a classic set of books . This arrangement all in one book is well done with a few illustrations and placed in chronological order per the story world .
5 #### This book starts as a normal book . Then a girl and boy are swept into a magic land . This book really shows how God sort of is . Aslan is the representation of God . If you read this book , you are sure to like it . It is very interesting and parts of it are hilarious . It is the book that begins a series of very good Narnia books .
5 #### I read the Chronicles of Narnia on my own years back and really enjoyed it . I like to be transported to other places in books . I have enough reality surrounding me every day . I am currently about halfway through reading this book aloud with my 10 year old stepson and he is really enjoying it ! There 's action , adventure , love and acceptance . It 's a really well written book with just enough of everything you could want .
5 #### Clarity & understanding & reassurance & hope for all is the message , and the result . Definitely the pinnacle of the series - HOPE !
5 #### I purchased this for a friend 's birthday . He is using it in conjuction with a bible study class and is enjoying it .
5 #### It 's been 30 years or more since I discovered these books -- and read them all through rather quickly . I wanted this book : hardcover and in order , so that I could enjoy them again . I 'm so glad I got them in this format , as I have children and books get lost for seasons of time ... I am amazed at how fresh the writing is , how insightful Lewis is , and how much I still have to learn !
5 #### This was a birthday gift for our 10 year old granddaughter . She was excited to receive it ! I 'm sure she 'll go through them as fast as I did when I read them !
5 #### I HAVE 3 DAUGHTERS IN COLLEGE WHO LOVE LOVE LOVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE . THEY ALL HAVE VARIED INTERESTS BUT LOVE TO WATCH THESE TOGETHER AS SO DOES THEIR MOM AND DAD :)
4 #### A fun beginning to a good series . This book sets the scene for the greater stories that are still to come .
5 #### I love the book and it had been so long since I had last read it . The book is similar but quite different from the movie .
4 #### I did not fully enjoy this book at first . The plot was not well developed in the first 3/4 of the book . The end of the book was wonderful and I finally understood the plot . I enjoyed the world building aspects that the end of the book had . I also enjoyed the introduction to the next book that was at the end of this book . I want to continue reading the series , but I hope the rest of the series is better than this book .
4 #### I started reading these to my 4 year old at bedtime and I love the format as it let 's her get close and look at the pages . I believe the pictures are the same as the normal formatted books so do n't expect a lot of extra illustrations but my daughter has not minded the lack of pictures and has really engaged in the story . I 've only been able to find " The Lion , With and the Wardrobe " , " Prince Caspian " , and " The Voyage of the Dawn Treader " in this format .
5 #### Love listening over and over to these books . Unabridged . Great voice .
5 #### This book was amazing awesome theme and great ending . It showed a lot of adventure and how everyone that has ever been in Narnia was there at the end was cool amazing book nice job C.S.Lewis
5 #### It is a little hard to find this wonderful collection ! All characters have their own voices in this CDs . My kids love them ! Despite of the fact it is faithful to the books , it is not a literal transcription of them . About 3 CDs retold the main dialogues and facts of each book .
5 #### We read these books to our kids when they were a bit too young to read them themselves , and then they all read them over and over , until the set is dog - eared . Wonderful imaginative reading with deeper lessons to learn as you read .
5 #### When i saw this book for the first time , i 'd have no ideas what this story is . So i thought to myself that i can give it a try . And when i read this book , it was very exciting . And to me , this book is lovely and special to me . Because after i read this , i started to read narnia series so i love this book especially .
5 #### Real or fantasy ? After reading , if an animal spoke to me , I would join in conversation . The lesson is beautifully taught .
5 #### Want to fully experience Narnia ? Read these to a five year old and listen to them retell the stories each day . The allegory is not lost when subtle hints are provided . Thank you C.S. Lewis
5 #### I love the Chronicles of Narnia . I read them all to my children growing up . I enjoyed listening to the Unabridged books as I drove somewhere or while at home . Excellent .
5 #### My niece loves the Narnia series , and this set made a very nice gift . Attractive packaging for a timeless series .
5 #### This installment of the Narnia Chronicles is my favorite . I love the adventure on the open sea , Reepicheep 's fearless willingness to tackle nightmares and dragons , the fascinating people we meet right along with the crew , the turning point in Eustace 's life , and my very favorite Narnian creatures , the Dufflepuds . I recommend the whole series !
3 #### Kind of slow . But I know others who liked it . Maybe it 's just me . I could n't finish it , so I may not be the best person to go by
5 #### This was my first time to read one of the Narnia books . It is a short book that is an easy read . This book sets up the beginning of the world of Narnia . I enjoyed this book and look forward to the rest of the chronicles .
5 #### It does n't get much better than the Chronicles of Narnia so this book is no exception . I enjoy reading them all together and I love how this book brings the hole Narnia world together and explains the beginning .
5 #### Chronicles of Narnia - A well loved classic - good for reading and rereading . The boxed set also makes a great gift .
5 #### I loved this book as a child and I still love it as an adult . It 's one of those few books that you want to read several times . The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe are more well known . But this is a very good book .
5 #### I really enjoy C S Lewis writing . This book is a great kickoff to the Narnia series . I look forward to continuing my journey with each book .
4 #### Great read for children . honestly it helps me understand the lion the witch and the wardrobe better . looking forward to the rest of the series .
5 #### I have finally finished all the series as of 2013 , but started years prior before the first motion film came out , and loved it . Ultimately , this was my favorite one out of the entire series !
5 #### Read these when I was a kid . or maybe my parents read them to me . I ca n't remember , but I remember each story and I loved them . I 'm going to read them again to see if it was my preteen mind that loved them or if they were really great . I suspect they were great as I 've never heard anyone say anything bad about them
5 #### This collections , written by an amazing British ( Irish ) writer during the second world war , combines fairy tales , with a modern sense of action and adventure ; great character study ; interesting descriptive writing to stretch the imagination and attention span of kids zeroed in on texting ( kids who like to draw can have a lot of fun drawing Lewis ' precise and detailed descriptions ) . Christians will see profoundly meaningful themes in these books ; this series gives the essence of the Bible storyline from beginning to end , to children , without once mentioning Jesus or any of the Bible characters . Lewis takes decades of pondering difficult themes such as good and evil , death , choices , etc . , and presents them to children in a simple and profound way . My 10 - year old 's reaction : " this reaches very deep inside me to places I did n't know I had . " It does indeed .
5 #### I grew up reading these books and I love them . I love the deeper meaning and the story , esp . the talking animals .
5 #### Great book to read to your little ones . Highly recommend it to your nightly routine . Very well written and easy to follow .
5 #### I have n't read The Magician 's Nephew since I was nine or ten yeas old . I found it as an adult , sat down for a couple of hours , and read it again . I was n't surprised to find that I still loved the adventure and still became involved with the characters and story . C.S. Lewis , as usual , does a marvelous job with his writings .
5 #### It was interesting to read and see how the world of Narnia had ended and the new world of Narnia started . This is similar to the battle of good and evil and the battle of God and Satan . I really enjoyed reading them , my third time .
5 #### Probably the best of the Narnia books , except maybe the Last Battle . Even though he write it as a prequel , it works wonderfully as a separate story .
4 #### I love CS Lewis , his adult series and this children 's series . He gives such insight into how God could have created our world , through the writing of the Magician 's Nephew . Aslan , a type of Jesus , Narnia is at first " without form " , and then , a song begins ..... Wonderful
5 #### Absolutely delightful ! Hard to believe I 've been around for 70 years and am just first reading the Narnia Chronicles but glad that I finally did . Great story . Great writing .
5 #### I 've had this box set since 2005 and it is still in great shape ! I 've moved a couple times and I 've re - read the books many times- but the set is still like new . If you love The Chronicles of Narnia- you need this set . For kids , or adults ; for yourself or a gift , this box set is perfect . The covers match ( which I love ) and the box keeps the books clean , safe , and together . What are you waiting for ? Add this set to your cart ! :)
4 #### All seven books are present in one nice Kindle package with nice intros from Lewis 's son . Unfortunately , they are ordered chronologically rather than by publication order ( Magician 's Nephew is first , rather than Lion Witch and Wardrobe ) . I prefer the original publication order , but it 's easy to read them in the order I want .
5 #### C.S. Lewis was a great story teller . This tale is a great read for children 6years and older . I have read the series more than once before children of my own and after . Adults should not shy away from these stories because they lack ' Adult content ' . This story is the beginning of some wonderful adventures without the worries of sex and gore .
5 #### Good quality book . I bought as a ' required read ' for my daughter 's 5th grade class . She has n't finished reading this yet , but it looks very good and there are a few color photos throughout the book to help break up the long reading chapters .
5 #### I was introduced to these books back in 1975 when I was in the 5th grade . Mrs Kalinger would read a chapter after recess so we could relax . When my daughter went into the fifth grade , I bought the set for her . We had a contest to see who could read all of them first . ( I won ! ) There were some episodes I saw on PBS over 20 years ago but the movies renewed my interest . Now my children are gone with children of there own . Its a good time for grandpa to sit back , relax and read the wonderful books of C S Lewis .
5 #### Always a pleasure reading , and always a pleasure reading the " Chronicles of Narnia " books ! I was thrilled that I was able to read this wonderful book from my iPad !
5 #### I read The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe a LONG , LONG time ago . Loved it . Now , I own all three movies . LOVE THEM ! ! ! Curiosity got the best of me so I had to know the full story . This is a wonderful series ! ! ! If you love the movies , you have to read the books .
5 #### I am an adult who never tires of reading the Chronicles of Narnia . I wanted a copy for my Kindle .
5 #### Look out Riordan , the next big thing is at you by the back ! The Chronicles of Narnia are great to the moon and back(and I am not exacerbating ! ) :) keep reading !
5 #### Great detail and great excitement ! I love the Chronicles of Narnia and this is my new favorite ! It is amazing ! ( :
5 #### Review by 10 - year old reader : this book is funny , scary , and very interesting . C.S. Lewis is an amazing , gifted writer .
5 #### By 10 - year old reader : C.S.Lewis was a very gifted writer . The book was interesting , funny and awesome . The Narnia series is the best .
5 #### THIS is By far the best book my kids have ever owned . Loved it as a kid and I still love it . My 6 , and 8 year old are crying because we are almost at the End of the Last book . Love that all the books are in one . And the essay in the Back moved me to tears . Best buy I have every got from amazon .
5 #### My nine - year - old daughter and my husband have both been devouring these books . The box is a neat way to keep them all together and the classic stories are top notch .
5 #### We actually own 2 books from this collection already but it is still cheaper to buy as a boxed set than to buy 5 books . The quality is good and my boy is very excited about it when it arrived . It 's a great bargain .
5 #### This is a wonderful book to read ! It keeps you entertained and you start seeing connection to our lives ! I read the entire book in one afternoon and evening ! So awesome and I ca n't wait for my Granddaughter to read it too ! She loves The Chronicles of Narnia movies ! I am sure she will enjoy this book and have such a desire to read the entire series ! I ca n't wait to start the next one ! ! !
5 #### C.S. Lewis 's work has been my favorite since I was a child . I was first introduced to his work as an 3rd grader , and have never stopped enjoying it . I have read these stories over and over and just needed a copy for my Kindle . My kids have also grown up reading these stories . They are a treasure for us . You can read the stories and get lost in them . You can read them for yourself or you can share them with your kids , and share in some wonderful adventures .
5 #### I loved it I think all of the book are great and I do n't like reading it was great and enjoying
5 #### Even as an adult , if you like fiction , this is a great read with good principles and a great story line .
5 #### I love the books but I am sad that is the end of the chronicles of Narnia books :( I really wish someone would continue this amazing story
5 #### I was captivated . I read it in under 24 hours . Did I say read ? I meant devoured . Wonderful book . Ca n't wait for the next one !
5 #### Hey i have loved this series for many many long years since i was young so yes i was very happy to buy yet another beautiful set of the series . the movies are also good and just Epic . i have gotten lots of comments on my reviews on the series on goodreads and here on amazon saying i read the series out of order this is the true order in which C.S , Lewis wished the books to be read in . 1 . The Magician 's Nephew 2 . The lion , the witch & the Wardrobe 3 . The horse and his boy 4 . Prince Caspian 5 . The voyage of the Dawn Treader 6 . The silver chair 7 . the last battle this is the true order in which the book must be read in .
5 #### I love everything written by CS Lewis . I own most of his works . I had a slipcase of the paperbacks , and gave them to a little disadvantaged girl who wanted to read them . When I saw the hardback single volume , I had to have it .
5 #### The 7 book series on the Kindle format is affordable . The only problem is , the chapters within the individual books are hard to access . The novels are timeless , always entertaining , and provide a rich platform for basic Christian theology . Readers from ages 9 to adult can understand it on their own levels . I enjoy reading the series every 5 to 10 years .
5 #### A friend has the books . Paperback . I read them a wanted my own set . Thank you for just being Anazon .
5 #### Loved that this tells how narnia came to be . Especially the part about the tree . I 'm glad I read this after the second book because now I understand why the story continues !
5 #### Bought this larger book as it contained the entire series . Arrived in excellent condition - would definitely recommend this series .
5 #### The chronicles of Narnia continue with this story - with incredible insights to the battle of good versus evil that occur within the hearts of us all .
5 #### I read this to my 5 year old son , and we both are often on the edge of our seats . I DO have to sensor it a little . There are scenes where heads are lopped off , and I tell those parts in a more appropriate way for a 5 year old .
1 #### I will never knowingly purchase anything from this seller , indobestsellers , again . They mailed it in a flimsy padded envelope , so the display box for the set arrived dented . When I sent it back , they said it was NOT damaged and charged me a restocking fee ! Thankfully Amazon made things right after a long hassle with the seller . But the books in this set were fine and are a favorite in our family , a great classic to read and reread .
5 #### These books are a def a good purchase for parents who want a good set of story books . Easy to store and easy to read . I would recommend these for sure !
5 #### This was a gift for my 11 yr old granddaughter . She devoured the books . Provided just excitement she likes to read . Wholesome and very entertaining .
5 #### I enjoy light reading and this just collection just fits the bill . Recommend to anyone who would really like a fantasy collection
1 #### I am doing a report on this book , but I do n't recommend it to young kids because it is really confusing and is really runny with boring facts .... But it is a great book for adults .... course , then again , I am only 6th grader .....
4 #### This book was ok . It did not seem very magical . I would not read it again the other books are better in this series
5 #### My wife and I read the Chronicles of Narnia when we both were in college , and we enjoyed them . When we found out that our daughter - in - law had not read those books yet , we just had to get her this set . Since this set came from the UK , I was pleasantly surprised with both the speed of the shipping and the postage for it . Hopefully , this gives the seller a high mark , because I am more than pleased with it .
3 #### I love the Chronicles of Narnia and just wanted a boxed set for out new book shelves . It 's an older used set but it serves the purpose .
5 #### I wanted my tutor child to have this book because C.S. Lewis is a fantastic author for children . When I gave it to him , he was a little overwhelmed because the book is large and heavy . I emphasized that he need only read one story at a time . I hope he will read all of them at one time or another .
5 #### My daughter loves these books , great series . I never knew there were seven books , so glad to find a complete set .
5 #### Bought as a gift for my husband and he loves this book on tape , great story . Was and is a great choice .
3 #### You do not get the item shown in this picture . It is a small boxed set with art that did n't seem to go at all with the stories . Must be a 1970 's " Xanadu " type thing . Since these were a gift for my little girl , I felt cheated a little . Wish they had been honest about the covers .
5 #### This whole series is so well read ! The actors picked are all big names with Shakespearean theater experience . they read clearly , at a good pace , with excellent voices for various characters . the reading and voice characterizations enhance the story instead of getting in the way of it . We will listen again and again , and I would highly recommend this for children and adults .
4 #### I 've loved these books since I was a child . They are realistic in that they worry about food or water , whilst being extremely entertaining . They have a solid moral grounding without being preachy .
5 #### We take long road trips during the summer and we love listening to this in the car . Wonderful , first - class production .
4 #### I have n't read the book , but I honest ca n't wait to start . I heard so many great thing about the book
4 #### I have to admit these books do n't measure up to the collection I read as a pre - teen . But , what does ? And he loved them . Is n't that the most important thing ?
5 #### This is the prettiest version the Narnia books I 've found . I would recommend this version to all C. S. Lewis fans .
5 #### There 's a reason this is a classic . The beautiful pictures painted in words could decorate the halls of the most majestic castles in England .
5 #### This collection is priceless . It is worth the money ! I 'm a spiritual person who has decided to delve deeper into all the religions of the world and the depth of these stories from a myth and biblical standpoint can not be understated . A necessary read for any child of any faith and for all eclectic households but also a great read for adults and those who have an interest in mythology , biblical / religious studies , and of course literature .
3 #### I liked the humor and some of the characterization in this book . It was n't a bad book . I think it is a book for children ( who may not get some of the humor ) or for die - hard CS Lewis / Narnia fans . I think the plot is simplistic . I enjoy reading young adult literature , so this is not about me being " too old " for this genre . It seems to have taken 6 years for Lewis to write this book , and I can see why he had trouble getting comfortable with it .
5 #### I like this book . I recomend it to everyone . It is really goodand I like the cronicals on narnia series . :-) :-)
5 #### This is the " first " in the series and explains a lot about the beginning of the series . Great beginning to a great series .
5 #### great condition , last one of my collection i was missing . i did not see anything outside the ordinary . all in all satisfied .
5 #### All the books with colored illustrations ? How can you go wrong with this hard - cover book ? There are even maps I have n't ever seen . My one complaint is that it starts with The Magician 's Nephew , which I would n't start with when reading the series , but I guess it 's chronological .
5 #### These books as all who love them know , are jewels , they subtly bring love , understanding and confidence to the young people reading them . The new order may have it 's own bean counting logic but it blunts and ignores the powerful magic sense of discovery of the original order . Shame on the cold callous logicians .
5 #### I have yet to read them , but the book is one to have in your personal library . To have the whole series in one large , beautifully bond , hard - cover book is a must .
5 #### My granddaughter and my son loved it ! It was sent as a Christmas present and arrived with no problem . There are quite a lot of CDs in the set [ 30 or so ] , which was a bit of a surprise . But my granddaughter is supposed to like to listen to books , so now she has a ton to listen to .
5 #### He loves this gift he received for Christmas . The seller was very gracious in going out of his way to get this to us in time for our Christmas weekend . My grandson puts his earphones on at night and reads along with the narrator as they travel the land of Narnia together . I am sure it will inspire him and awaken the gifts he has hidden in his heart to believe in Him whom he can not see ...
5 #### Everyone has their favorite Narnia book , and I think I 've re - read this more times than any of the others . Of course , all the Narnia books are golden , but there 's something about a sea voyage and discovering new lands that 's always appealing . Glad this is out on kindle now so I can keep enjoying it !
5 #### It is a really good book . I Recommend it for all readers . And it is a Christian book , and its funny .
5 #### I bought the set as gift for a young reader . She watched the movie and has always wanted to have a complete set . She loves it
5 #### If you wanna talk about a good book try this one . I could read this book over and over agian willingly ! It 's has such a great storyline with great character development . It has charecters you learn to love and charecters you ca n't stand ( but do n't worry those bad guys do n't last very long ) :) . Plus it contains great morals that can be applied to your life . If you do n't care for C.S.Lewis 's writing you will find yourself thinking the opposite . That gave it a shot . I read this book unsure if it was good or not and now I find myself rereading it over and over agian -- haven't become bored of it yet ! The Cronicles of Narnia is a good series , well written and it makes a great childrens bedtime story too ! ^u^ ~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~
4 #### My husband wanted these and I bought them for a Christmas gift . He really enjoys the material . He can relate the stories to the Bible .
5 #### Enchanting tale of Digory and Polly who are tricked into using Magic to explore other worlds . They find a witch and with their selfish Uncle Andrew , land in the beautiful new world of Narnia . I found this story enchanting and look forward to reading the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia . If you enjoy fantasy , based on Christian themes , The Magician 's Nephew is a classic treat . C.S. Lewis is an author that belongs in your library !
5 #### The books look great . The cover was very cool looking and the little girl that got it for Christmas was very happy . Thank you .
5 #### A fantastic world you will never want to leave and one you will want your children to travel to as well . Where life lessons are learned with talking animals and adventures both good and bad , but you will leave with a very full heart .
5 #### This book I do have the movie , but I love the book much more ! The movie puts in a love interest between Susan and Caspian , but that is n't the way C. S. Lewis intended it to be . I always feel so st peace when Aslan speaks or you read anything about him in the chronicles of Narnia books .
5 #### I just loved this book it was awesome ! ( LOL ! ) Thanks C.S Lewis . Your a great author .Plus I love that your a Christian .
5 #### I had been hoping a collection of the Narnia books would come out . I was overjoyed when i found this would be released for Kindle . I am enjoying the Horse and His Boy right now and will spend the next few months devouring the next 4 ! ! ! !
5 #### This set of audio books is excellent for children AND adults . It was given as a gift to someone who had wanted this for awhile . I 've read the first book of the set as a child , and so read the whole set as an adult and they were hard to put down . I recommend this to anyone who has a hard time reading , or fitting reading into a schedule - to use while driving or doing something else like waiting for a doctor 's appt .
5 #### Love CS Lewis ' works for his daughter originally though she had grown up to be a young lady by the time he finished writing these stories of adventure . I 've read them , two granddaughters have now read them and my daughter - in - law has also read them . Will advise others to read them . Fun reading of adventure .
5 #### This timeless classic compilation makes a wonderful gift to any young reader . The quality of printing and the product is excellent . Highly recommended addition to any literature collection .
5 #### This is a nice quality box set for the money . My 10 - 12 year old grandchildren are entranced by the stories , and are reading them avidly .
5 #### Very nice Hardbound copy of this great work ! All of the series in one book ! So glad I came across this on Amazon ! Did n't even know it existed .
5 #### My grandson loves to be read to at night.by his dad . I received a thank you note from that eight year old saying how much he is enjoying this series ..
5 #### Fantastic ! Not just a book for children but is a great series for nighttime reading to your kids .
5 #### Having seen the movies over years has peak my interest in reading the books . I am not disappointed . I was visiting my step daughter over the Christmas Holidays and saw her 7 volume collection on her book shelf . I picked up and starting reading - could n't put it down . I then purchased my own copy . Excellent reading young and old !
5 #### This book was a gift to a friend . Narnia changed my life forever . My only complaint is the books are now printed in " Narnian History " order , which is ridiculous . They should be read in the order written and published by C. S. Lewis . I am sure his godchild , Lucy , for whom he wrote the stories would agree . If you read the way they are placed in this volume , many delightful surprises will be removed .
5 #### I purchased this set for my Granddaughter as a gift so I thought I should read a few of the books . Parents should either read these books with their children or read them at the same time so you can discuss them with your children . Children need to understand the Christian overtones and themes in the books . The book are not very long and the plots are easy to follow . They are very good books for children .
5 #### This is not a " text " only edition . All the illustrations from all the books are here - and in color . The first book - " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " remains my favorite of the series , but each book has it 's virtues . For Narnia !
5 #### As a retiree , I still find these great stories fun , inspirational and real page turners . There is a reason why this collection is a perennial favorite . Enjoy ! ! !
5 #### I love anything by C. S. Lewis . His space trilogy and Narnia stories are both fun to read and enlightening .
5 #### Bought this book for one of my granddaughters and she loved it . Knew she would . I have always loved the Chronicles of Narnia ever since I was a kid and try to read the series at least once a year .
5 #### Creation scene was amazing ! ! C.S. Lewis had a gift for hiding profound theological truths into stories that even the youngest of children could enjoy .
5 #### I gave this as a gift to my niece , but the quality appeared very nice when I received it and it was well packaged .
5 #### My daughter already had this book . We just got a new puppy and he found it and chewed it enough to ruin it . I was please to find it on Amazon for a good price . Thanks .
5 #### My grand daughter saw the movies and she was glad to receive this set of books for Christmas . She has already read the first book .
5 #### I was given this series as a child and recently ordered it as a gift for my niece . In the time between my gift and hers , I 've read the books about 5 times and I enjoy them every time . It 's definitely geared towards older kids , but can be enjoyed by anyone .
4 #### The family loved listening to this series while driving cross country . We hated getting out of the car at our destinations .
5 #### The first of the Narnia books should be read before any of the other books in the series . We learn how the Witch was brought to Narnia , how Narnia came to be and are introduced to Aslan . It is written for children , but adults will enjoy it too . If your children are reading these books then as a parent you need to read it too . The underlying Christian themes should be discussed with the Children who read this book by those old enough to understand them . We learn the secret behind the wardrobe and why it can transport the children in book two , the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe to Narnia .
5 #### My daughter loves this collection of books . I believe she will hang on to them for her children to some day read .
5 #### This is a children 's book ... well , supposedly it is . I 've read several times over the 20 years I 've had it , and each time it " takes me away " to fun and meaningful places . This book was a gift , but I 'm rating it here because it is simply a must have even if you 're not a child . It 's FUN !
5 #### this is a good book and a great way to get it and will teach you and learn what to to right
5 #### this is a good book and it will teach and you will learn and help you figure out what what to do
5 #### this is a good book and a great way to get it it will teach and you can learn etc ,
5 #### this is a great book it wiil teack and you learn and a great way to get it is like this
5 #### This book was a great book . I loved when they were creating Narnia . I also liked the adventure with Fledge and the garden
5 #### My daughter had this set since she was 8 years old , she loves Narnia . She loaned a few books out to friends though , 2 came back very damaged and one never came back . I bought her these this Christmas to replace her set . She was very happy . She said she would not loan any out this time . I told tell them to go to a library lol !
5 #### As an English instructor and lover of literature , I would recommend this collection to those who enjoy delving into literature on many levels , as well as those who would like to read this series to or with their children . Narnia is a magical land with much to be gained for the reading !
5 #### My 8 year old love this set . I love that it is digital and not very expensive . Easy to recommend this .
2 #### The book needs a lot more drama . There was barely any action in it . Some parts of the book are interesting and exciting , but mainly the book has a lot of details . The Magician 's Nephew is one of the worst books that I have ever read . I recommend for the author to read the Percy Jackson series and revising your writing . I did enjoy enough that I want to read the next book in the series . Remember , all of this is my opinion .
4 #### This was a Christmas gift . I have n't ever read the series so I ca n't comment much on that , but she seemed to be pretty excited to receive it and the packaging was good .
3 #### The box set is one way of having the entire series at your fingertips . Be warned that some of the books are absolutely boring . First three are decent but near the end you are questioning your sanity . And this is coming from a guy who can spend 100 hrs on a Tolkien wiki so I have more patience than most when it comes to fantasy .
5 #### Narnia was always a favorite of our family as were all of the well known children 's books . I decided to purchase it for my great granddaughter for Christmas . This is a reading family . Every night , a story is read and there are a lot of books in that home . It 's a wonderful whimscicle story that never goes out of style with my families . Chronicles was on the list for " tonight 's bedtime story".when I left my son 's home last night ..
4 #### My one problem is the order . The Narnia books just do n't read as well chronologically . It makes the little inconsistencies stand out , and , for example , ruins both much of the mystery in " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " and the reveal at the end of " The Magician 's Nephew . "
5 #### I first read the Chronicles of Narnia in paperback about 3 years ago and was fascinated by it . When I got my Kindle I had it down loaded to it . You wonder why ? I find myself going back and re - reading parts of it , especially where Aslan is resurrected . I highly recommend it for people of all ages .
3 #### bought this book for my son to read for middle school class . the print is extremely small . Was hoping for larger print
5 #### I love how this offers all the individual short novels of the chronicles of narnia bound up into one for a great price . I got this for my boyfriend and he loves it because he can just bring the whole book with him wherever he wants and does nt have to worry about the individual books . Thanks so much for shipping this quickly it will be very loved and appriciated . These are some of the best stories around .
5 #### I bought these for my grandson . He has some difficulit reading however he loves books that are sets or have continuations of adventures with the same character(s ) This was perfect .
5 #### this shipped super fast ... books are in excellent shape ... will be a christmas gift for my son that is learning to love reading
4 #### I read The Magician 's Nephew several times as a young kid and really enjoyed it . A couple weeks ago I picked it up again and read it to my 9 year old daughter ... she really loved it . I think it is one of the easier books to read for younger children as the language is not as flowery as say , The Dawn Treader . I consider it one of my favorites of the Narnia series .
5 #### C.S. Lewis ' young reader classic has lost nothing over the years . For those of you who have only seen the movies , a much more wondrous and well - rounded world awaits you . I envy you the treat that awaits .
5 #### There is come confusion as to which of these books was actually published last by C.S. Lewis , but here 's the best thing : None of that will stop you from enjoying it immensely . This book in particular is epic , but so are the rest of them . If you have not yet picked up this series , do it now . I recommend to anyone . I insist to anyone . I expect of everyone , to read this series .
5 #### I have been a fan of C. S. Lewis ever since I was a little boy . This is a book that I will treasure for the next 20 - 30 years !
5 #### I chose this for a Christmas gift for my grandson and this set was more that I expected it to be . I highly recommend this one because the illustrations are really good as well as the stories that these two books relate ! Every parent and child should read The Chronicles of Narnia - and then see the movies that have been made from 3 of them . This is a large set of two - in the case - perfect for gift giving !
5 #### This really is a fantastic series and this is just another wonderful book in the series . These are a must read for everyone . Kids and parents alike . This was probably one of my favorite with the adventure that takes place in this one and the hard lessons .
5 #### Well - put - together version of the classic Chronicles of Narnia in a well - illustrated hardback book . I have enjoyed reading these stories to my young sons who are now in their 20s . For those not familiar with C.S. Lewis 's classic tales , these very entertaining " science fiction " stories are a wonderful way of reinforcing a parents desire to introduce the Christian gospel message to their children . broken people who need to be rescued but have no way to rescue themselves meeting their creator who is ready , willing and able to make them whole again by His own self - sacrifice .
5 #### Beautiful box set ! Better books . I still have the books from my childhood ! I have purchased two sets this Christmas for children I know . These days , most kids can download books , but there is nothing like having a book in your hand ! Love it !
5 #### I had n't read these books since I was a teenager . To read them again as an adult , having seen some great film adaptations of the stories , reminded me of Lewis ' insights into who we are and Whose we are . I love the use of Aslan as the Christ figure , the counsel he gives and the gentle reproofs when they are needed . Hooray for C. S. Lewis !
5 #### it is wonderful to have color pictures of these beloved books in such a gorgeous volume with high quality paper and binding .
4 #### The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a pleasant fairy tale , readable for adults as well as children . It tells of the voyage King Caspians ship Dawn Treader as it sails on a perilous journey to find the lost Lords of Narnia who departed and disappeared under the reign of the prior King Miraz . Eustace is a new character who joins Lucy and Edmund ( from the original book ) on board the Dawn Treader , as they escape sea serpents , slave traders , perilous pools , dragons and invisible creatures . Highly imaginative and readable , it may not be the best of Lewis but it is true to his simple , endearing style .
5 #### I have loved the books of Narnia since I first read them . And I now get to share them with my daughter 's .
5 #### 31 hours of wonderful story telling got me from California to Montana and on to Utah this summer . Good recording !
5 #### As a senior I confess that this is the first time read for me . I saw the movie ; however never read the books . The imagination of C.S. Lewis is truly remarkable . And yet through his imagery we are able to see and feel the majesty , power , and love of Christ .
5 #### Narnia is such a wonderfully written , classic set of books . I read them as a child and now I 'm reading the first one to my kids . It 's fun to hear the laughter and see the wonder on their faces . They fire the imagination as well-- Einstein said kids should be reading fairy tales .
5 #### I have seen the movies , but there were novels here that helped explain some things such as how Narnia came to be . Love the books and love the spiritual messages therein . C.S. Lewis is one of my favorites . I have n't finished all of the books , but I only have a couple more to go . Very well written with likable heroes and dastardly villans such fun ! !
5 #### This has always been one of my favorite books . Had been ages since I had read these stories . Was great to read them again and to have them all in one book .
4 #### Decent telling of the story . If you can get it on the cheap it is a good buy . There are a bunch of cds that cover the story Prince Caspian . It is good , do n't get me wrong . I like to imagine things . If you do n't have time and just ca nt this is the way to go .
5 #### This is one of my all time favorite stories , written by the master story teller , C.S.Lewis . It is a great classic .
5 #### A well developed and written story of the classic struggle of good over evil that is interesting for children and adults .
5 #### The Narnia books are unique and irreplaceable classics and are in the finest bracket of children 's fantastic tales . Unlike most , these have a metaphysical message under the stories , making them equally enthralling for the adult as well as the child reader . This kindle edition includes the original , magical illustrations by Pauline Baines . Just marvellous , and one of my best purchases .
5 #### Having a beloved classic to read on my Kindle app , and at a very reasonable price ! You ca n't go wrong with this one .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia have been my favorite books for many years . I really enjoyed the additional book included in this set of C S Lewis ' writings at age 8 .
5 #### I have been reading this with my 7 year old . It is fantastic . And although the words are not " dumbed " down like today 's literature , she still gets it and really enjoys our time together . Read a chapter a night . I have even been moved as I parallel his work with God 's grace , wow !
5 #### One of the best books by one of humanity 's best writers . An absolute delight . First read it when I was 7 . Read it countless times since . My daughters love it now . It feeds creativity and imagination in a child .
5 #### The books are awesome . I have read " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " many times , and I read the other books twice . I love the Chronicles of Narnia ! The imaginary world C.S. Lewis creates , really makes you feel like you`re there ! And with little hints at the redemption story , it`s even better ! My favorite of the books was " The Magician 's Nephew . " Meglena Ivanova Author of The Legend of The Moonstone
5 #### Wonderful books with excellent readers . Each reader brings something special to the stories and I never tire of hearing them .
3 #### The Last Battle is entertaining , but kind of strange and predictable . Again there is a battle , again Aslan is long - awaited and comes to save the day at the end . It begins with a False Prophet , a Donkey Puzzle that is told to disguise himself and parade around as Aslan , at the command of an Ape named Shift . This distracts the Narnians and brings them under the yoke of the Ape , who is directing the donkey what to do . Shift the Ape is in turn allied and under the command of Rishda the Calormene , whose nation is invading Narnia . Ultimately it falls to the heroic Last King of Narnia , Tirian , who with the aid of the children Eustace and Jill will help overcome the Calormenes . Rishda takes his ruse to the heights by confusing the Calormene God Tash with Aslan , creating a Tashlan which he says represents both gods . He is ultimately destroyed by Tash , who it turns out is hiding in the very stable that it was thought the false Aslan would be . In the end , the Calormenes are defeated , in spite of the rebellion of a company of Dwarfs against both Narnian and Calormene . Aslan returns , and there is final judgment and Apocalypse over Narnia . The children return to their fictional world , with the exception of Susan who now appears too grown up for it . Does that sound strange as a summary ? Well , then it is simply a reflection of the book itself .
5 #### As an ex - teacher librarian I have always loved this author and series . But have never owned them . So a treat to buy them in one book .
5 #### I love C S Lewis , and while the books are used , they are in good condition , and it is nice to have the set now .
5 #### I love C.S. Lewis . I have n't read this one yet , but I am confident in the quality to the journey to come .
3 #### In the sequel to " The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe " , a group of humans ( Telmarines ) has conquered Narnia , and the essence of the plot is the struggle of good Prince Caspian against his wicked uncle , the King Miraz . The children are summoned back to Narnia to help the good Prince . C.S. Lewis is not my favorite author , but his fiction is fairly good for its simple , light style . Very readable for kids , still light entertainment for adults , there are a few points of subtle commentary on human nature that make it still engaging reading .
5 #### Great for a good chronological read ! A must have for any avid Chronicles of Narnia fan . Plus , who can put it down ?
5 #### Excellent books which I enjoy to read , this books are what make the movie , Narnia . Which is my all - time favorite movies . So 3 movies come from half of this book and the set of books are actually backward but I started from first to end , anyway .
5 #### I would recommend this book to my friends . They would love this book because I loved this book . I wish I had all the books in this series .
5 #### The book is in excellent condition . It 's shelf - friendly having the whole collection compact into one book . My daughter of eight and I have been reading it and we both enjoy it immensely .
5 #### The prequel to The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe this is a key book in an excellent and much loved series .
5 #### The entire series is excellent . This is not my very favorite in the series , but it is a wonderful book all the same .
5 #### Gave this set as a gift to a friend and his teenage son . They were so excited to receive it . Son could not put them down . After he completed his homework , he would grab his book and read until bedtime .
4 #### I read the entire series to my kids as they were growing up and now , traveling with my Kindle , I get to read the same stories to my grandkids ; so much fun !

5 #### My favorite stories , beautifully read ! I have listened to these numerous times ! Ms. Regrave 's Dwarf voices were terrific ! Michael York was excellent !
5 #### A fascinating book by a Christian author . I 'm currently reading it to my child and he loves it . There are a few things I have to edit , but I pre - read the night before so , when it 's time to read , I have any edits I need to make ready .
4 #### Ca n't wait for the silver chair ! I will start reading it ASAP . My favorite so far was Prince Caspian . Bye
5 #### I bought this series from a book club in the late 70 's , loaned a few of then to some neighborhood children , and never got them back ! I thought as long as I needed to replace a few , why not replace the entire series . These books are easy to find as paperback , but finding hardback copies was difficult ! The stories are new every time I read them , and Aslan is just the character children need these days . But I do n't plan on sharing these books --- they can go to a library !
5 #### i happen to really like narnia . read them as a kid as stories . now re - read them countless times as a grownup . sometimes i read looking for deeper meaning given cs lewis ' faith , other times i read just to enjoy the stories . read them to my kids and they love them to . the characters , the plots , the intrigue and adventure i love it all . recommended for all big kids and little ones too
5 #### I bought this as a birthday present for my granddaughters 11th birthday . I was happy to find the complete set of all seven books in one purchase . I 'm hoping this will help her develop a love of reading .
5 #### The first time i read this book i thought it was super boring(i guess i was too young . But a while later i read it again and i really enjoyed it .
5 #### The movie could n't touch the book , like so many cinematic renderings . Touching in its symbolism . Beautiful in its character development . Parable without being preachy . Lewis is simply the best in wholesome children 's literature .
5 #### Not much else can be said about this book that has n't been said since Lewis wrote The Magician 's Nephew , but since I thought it was such a delightful story , I intend to add my two cents . I am an adult but I would recommend this to all children probably 8 and older , give or take a year or two based on maturity and reading level . It has all the elements of a great kid story and is told through a whimsical voice that makes the reading colorful . The story offers insights into human nature and consequences , and I liked that Digory and Polly , with their youthful innocence , were able to instinctively understand and articulate some of that nature . Wonderful book .
3 #### I have always wanted to read the series and finally got the chance on my third deployment to Iraq . The first couple of books were pretty good but the rest of them left a lot to be desired . Raymond Jones is the author of ` This Page Intentionally Left Blank FM 101 - Knuckleheads ' < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/This - Page - Intentionally - Left - Blank - FM-101 - Knuckleheads / dp / B00GGS5O3I / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">This Page Intentionally Left Blank FM 101 - Knuckleheads</a >
5 #### This series is amazing , one that I like to re - read every couple years . Each book is its own adventure ! I look forward to reading them to my kids some day !
3 #### Books were very old . The first one in the series was not in the best of shape . O.K. otherwise . C.S. Lewis is an awesome thinker .
5 #### This volume was the first I had read of Narnia . I 'm so glad I read it all in one book . I could n't wait to see what happened in the next adventure . And I did n't have to . This book will be passed on to future generations .
5 #### This is a well crafted tale of how Narnia came to be starting in the childhood of " The Professor " from the Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe .
5 #### The books go by fast ( way too fast ) but they are an absolute classic . You got ta love the books with all four kids more than the rest , but they 're all enjoyable .
4 #### Having read all seven books and seen every movie this far , I consider myself a true fan of Narnia . For an ending this book did not disappoint . And like Jill I wish Narnia could go on forever and as in this book it will live forever on my Kindle and be read again and again .
5 #### And enjoyable adventure that explains the origins of Narnia . A fun , yet insightful story . It 's a perfect precursor to The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe .
5 #### I reread this for pure enjoyment ! Love C.S. Lewis ! The whole series , even better in book form than in the theater .
5 #### I reread this for pure enjoyment ! Love C.S. Lewis ! The whole series , even better in book form than in the theater . To be honest , this is my favorite of all in the series .
5 #### I love having all the stories in one big book . i got it for story time with kids and i think it will be a treasured book . :)
5 #### Grandson enjoyed this set of books and is putting them in his collection . He 's got a library of good books that will probably be worth more some day
4 #### As always , the value from Amazon is unbeatable ! My only disappointment was that I thought this would be a 7 volume set and found it to be one book with all seven titles included . Oh well , if that 's the worst that I can complain about I guess I do n't have much to complain about !
5 #### This was a purchase for my children as I like them to keep reading and learning to further their education . They enjoyed it .
5 #### I liked the book . And I would recomend it to children about 9 - 12 . My favorite character was Aslan , the lion . ~Review written by 12 year old girl .
5 #### The ending is great where it has one of the best description of heaven that I know of . That all good things in this earth is a shadow or a copy of the real thing in heaven .
5 #### This book is my favorite . It always has . The VOYAGE of the dawn treader is a must read , especially for anyone who is indeed reading the whole series .
5 #### The experience of reading together with you child(or any child you can find ) is one that will bring many good feelings to you and that child for many , many years . I read this series in my early 20 's and then to each of my girls when they were in kindergarten and first grade . The youngest child did a comparison of Aslan and Jesus Christ all on her own . She amazed her teachers with her depth of knowledge about the Bible and the Chronicles of Narnia . Good stories are held within these pages !
5 #### I LOVE THIS BOOK , BUT WHO DOESN'T ? ITS SO WELL WRITTEN READ THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER ITS MY FAVORITE !
4 #### It is great to have all the books under one cover . I had pocket sized editions of each title ; enjoyable , but it tends to leave you ready for more when all the others are still in the bookcase .
5 #### this small piece of literature is the forerunner to the seven volume chronicles of narnia . It was written afterward and answers who the witch is and is about the characters themselves . suitable for reading to children ( some of the stuff kids watch on tv and see in the movies scares me ) . this is good old fashioned story telling . EXTREMELY FULFILLING in the way only well written stories can be . 221 pages , with some illustrations . a short read and a very good one .
5 #### ever since I received the book I 've never put it down ! recommended ages 10 and up . This novel contains the whole chronicle of Narnia series and places the books in the chronological order of events in the land of Narnia .
3 #### Series was exciting . Ending as a let - down it was as if he ran out of interest and just wanted to end the story . I was glad that I finally read all the Cronicles . Glad I did n't read it as a kid . I would have quit reading If I did n't have any clue of the subtext .
5 #### Great series . my son loves to read and he love this series . now that he has a Kindle he reads even more .

5 #### Great series . my son loves to read and he love this series . now that he has a Kindle he reads even more .
5 #### Excellent book that was very helpful to me with my graduate school class . C.S. Lewis will always be known as an excellent writer .
3 #### I loved the Wood between the Worlds . The description of this idyllic place blissed me out . I felt quite stoned . But beyond this , the book just seemed to ramble on . I found the biblical analogies as nonsensical and lacking as the tales they are based on . Natasha Holme Author of ' Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia : A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder '
5 #### Ever since I was a child I have loved these books , and I recently bought them again to read them to my children , who are as entranced and in love with them as I had been . " The Voyage of the Dawn Treader " has always been my favorite -- off at sea , seeking adventures , being with friends , it 's a wonderful book . The transformation of Eustace gives it a moral slant , but also highlights the need to give people time and space to change -- do n't write them off too quickly , because they may be capable of being a better person in the future . A great book , with great lessons for children .
5 #### The audio version is great a great complement and easy to listen to . Professional reading . Well worth it as you listen / read your way through the adventure .
5 #### of the Chronicles of Narnia . I bought the professional audio version as well and love listening and sharing with others .
5 #### My dad read these to me 25 years ago ( the same printing ) . I bought these to read to my kids in the original sequencing before Hollywood and the new publishers messed things up . My seller was great . The books and slipcase were in near perfect condition , much better than mine would be if I still had them .
5 #### My 4 year old son loves having this read to him . The section on the creation of Narnia will give you goose bumps , provided that you have a reasonably well - functioning imagination . Introduces children , in an appropriate way , to the concepts of goodness and evil ... something they would otherwise learn " the hard way " in life .
5 #### This book series made me want to read more when I was a kid , and its still as great as I remember it 11 years ago .
5 #### I love the C.S. Lewis books . Enjoy reading them over from time to time . Added the collection to my Kendle for this reason .
5 #### I had forgotten how well written the last of the Narnia series is . Lewis is more open about the Christian basis of the series in this than in any other , I believe , but weaves it into a compelling story . There are so many elements at play , and all are done so skillfully , that it is difficult to single any one out . New well developed characters meet those from the prior stories and it is a very satisfying conclusion for all ( with one exception ) . It is nice to finish on such a high point .
4 #### I 've been a Narnia fan since i was a little girl and I 'm just now at 23 reading the series . I 'm sure if i was still an adolescent I would have given it five stars . Ca n't wait for the second book !
5 #### Incredible writing by one of history 's greatest writers . I read this with my 12 year old daughter and it brought great joy to us both . It also served as a springboard to some really valuable spiritual conversations . I would recommend this book to anyone of any age .
4 #### ... and just decided to refresh my memory about it . To anyone not well versed in Christian doctrine , this will read like a somewhat old style fantasy novel ( as will the rest of the books in the series ) . To those of us who do understand Christian doctrine , and understand these books were designed to be teaching tools for tweeners and younger , they 're a good read with a good additional message .
5 #### though it does seem boring at first it 's a really good book .I've read it a lot and I still like reading it .good luck putting it down .
5 #### and the Chronicles of Narnia are classics that Kindle makes it easy to carry around with you all the time on one 's Kindle , tablet , or laptop .

5 #### This amazing book is about a fairy land called NARNIA where you can meet talking animals and see a lot of magic and adventures . Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy are returning to boarding school when they are summoned from the dreary train station ( by Susan 's own magic horn ) to return to the land of Narnia -- the land where they had ruled as kings and queens and where their help is desperately needed . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Charm - An - Amazing - Story - of - a - Little - Black - Cat / dp/1609764188 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Charm : An Amazing Story of a Little Black Cat</a >
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia is a perfect children 's fiction book which describes an amazing adventures of Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy in the magic land called Narnia . For here is a world where a witch decrees eternal winter ; where there are more talking animals than people ; and where battles are fought by Centaurs , Giants and Fauns ! ! Brave kids have to fight with wicked Queen and help the triumph of justice .
5 #### I read this as an adult and loved it ! I bought it as a one book set with the books placed in order as Lewis intended them to be read and not the order they were published in . So The Magician 's Nephew was book one and The Lion , The Witch and The Wardwrobe were book 2 . Narnia , the story , the symbolism , all of it is fantastic ! A great read !
5 #### I bought these for my 8 year old daughter for her birthday and she loves them ! ! She 'll disappear into her room and read for hours because she ca n't wait to find out what happens next . I was a little nervous buying this set for her as she gets scared easy but so far it has n't scared her once ! Great buy ! !
5 #### Written in easy reading language this book makes for a great read for grown ups as well as kids . And inspires to know God more .

5 #### If they give awards for audio CD readings , I hope Kenneth Branagh won one . His performance is completely captivating , using his voice in a wide variety of ways for the different characters . It 's also a well done package . Each chapter of the book has its own chapter on the CD - and the cardboard container lists the chapter titles and the running times so that you know how long it will take to " listen to one more chapter . " Disc One of the 4 - CD set is also an enhanced CD containing , not only the first three chapters of the book , but also the color illustrative artwork for the story , and two web links . You wo n't regret buying this .
5 #### Great book to read or have your child read to you . So imaginative and rich descriptions , it would n't be difficult for them to picture the story . Plus the great illustrations , loved this book !
5 #### Having watched the movie , I thought it was time I actually read the books and I loved them . I read all of them and enjoyed all of them .
5 #### This book is beautiful . Since I got it as a gift for my grandson , I am very pleased with the quality .
4 #### What a good book . It explained much about the origin of Narnia while also having a good story all its own . I especially liked the explanation of how the " wardrobe " came to be .
5 #### Somehow a grandchild must have borrowed this book and failed to return it . It had to be replaced so the set will be complete when it 's time for the great grands to begin the series . I first used the series when I was a fifth grade teacher of religious education . Oh , the wonderful discussions we had . Then the books were read by my children and grandchildren .
5 #### The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the BEST Narnia book ! The Voyage of the Dawn Treader serves up 5 star adventure as our seafaring friends travel amazing new lands . Every new land has it 's own kind of adventure . And beneath the adventure aspect we see a novel of great depth which allows for some outstanding character development . In particular , the journey of Eustace of going from being a jerk to being a reformed and redeemed character is splendid . Then there 's Reepicheep . Reepicheep 's undying belief in the existence of Aslan 's Country and his persistence in wishing to see it out along with his sheer nobleness make Reepicheep , apart from Aslan , the strongest animal character in the Narnia series . And Caspian himself has his moment toward the end where he has to realize who he truly is and where he truly belongs . Just a wonderful blend of engrossing plot and character growth . 5 out 5 stars easily .
5 #### Great book set and a wonderful price ! My daughter is loving reading the same books I enjoyed as a child !
4 #### This book was a good story continued from the fourth Narnia book , Prince Caspian . I thought the adventure aspect was great and the story did not drag out at the end , but there is a little mystery at the very end that I wish would have been explained . There is a bit of humor and I think this book and the serious are great for all ages !
5 #### I loved this book as a child and I still love it today . Now I am sharing these great adventures with our children !
5 #### Delivery great The book was wonderful as I expected , and I really enjoyed it . I got what I wanted , and I got everything I needed . What more do you need ? I recommended it to my friends .
5 #### Now I know the backstory to the movie and look forward to reading the rest of the books in this series . It was an easy read and I finished in two days .
4 #### Bought this set for summer reading with the kids , have n't read it since I was ten . We 've had a great time reading them ! My kids enjoy it , I 'm enjoying it , and my husband enjoys the half an hour of free time to catch his breath before bed time ! LOL I would n't recommend it for children under six though , it is written in an old fashioned style and I spend a lot of time explaining some of the lesser used words to my six and eight year olds .
5 #### Plus getting to know new ones . I will continue on to the next book . Maybe some other of c.s . Lewis
5 #### What more can be said about the Chronicles than what 's already been said ? They 're a classic among classics and I enjoy them as much as an adult as I did as a child .
5 #### You do n't have to be a kid to enjoy this series . A friend loaned her set for me to read -- Once I finished , I knew I had to have my own set to re - read again and again !
5 #### I was hesitant to read this book as I thought it may be a bit ' childish . ' Boy was I wrong . If you are a Christian , and a visual person like me , this is a must read as it will so clearly picture the biblical principles for you . It was a blessing to read . The way Aslan is portrayed and the words he speaks is touching to say the least . Great read ! And a fast read as well ! I 'm on to the next book !
5 #### I have had this set on my bookshelf for many years . I just read them and am enchanted . These stories are just as interesting and appropriate for adults as they are for children .
4 #### I am impressed as well as surprised at closely these books follow the movies or vise versa . Though there is more detail in the movie than the book which is rare , the more important elements are included in both .
5 #### This seven book box set is a nice collection of C S Lewis ' " Chronicles of Narnia " . The box itself is colorful and makes an excellent storage container for the books . The price is reasonable and I 'm completely satisfied with the purchase . Lewis ' stories are a good read for children or adults and I recommend this box set to anyone who would like to have the complete works in one handy set .
5 #### What a fascinating and delightful read . Playing in the fields of the mind of CS Lewis . What a truly enjoyable experience .
5 #### I can see why this book in the Narnia series was moved from its original position ( No . 1 ) to the next to the last in the series . Even though it deals with events before The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ( usually considered No . 1 ) , it is more abstract in some of its concepts . Quite profound in its own right . I especially enjoy the re - creation of the earth by Aslan . It is more meaningful after reading many other books of the Narnia Chronicles .
5 #### Loved all of it allot . It was more detailed than the movie . I Am excited to read all the other books
5 #### I purchased this set to listen to on our regular 12 - hour drives to see our grandkids . This was very reasonably priced for a 7 - cd set and it turned out to be very well done . The reader was very pleasant to listen to and did an excellent job of reading the various parts . It kept us well entertained during the entire trip . I ca n't wait to get to the next cd .
5 #### Just finished reading this series again-- fantastic as always . This book is a must read to continue the wonderful story .
4 #### good read could n't put it down and had to at times so I could sleep and eat . Being laid up I was able to read more of this at one time .
5 #### I can not recommend the Narnia series enough , for people of all ages . Even though ostensibly for kids , I have enjoyed these books at all stages of my life , from teens to middle age .
5 #### I am only dismayed that it took me over 60 years to pick up this wonderful series . Each story stands alone , but are all the better when read in the complete volume . I found each story to be spell binding , taking me to far away places and on adventures that captivated my imagination . During the time that it took to read these volumes , I was a kid again experiencing the exciting adventures of everyone involved in the individual stories . I was only sorry when the adventure ended .
5 #### After reading some " fluffy " novels this book is like a breath of fresh air . The last in the Narnia series and written beautifully with descriptive language . The only one in the series that really makes you think . The ending reveals a lot about what the writer feels about death . If you are interested you should also check out C.S Lewis 's autobiography particularly his relationship with the love of his life . A great book for all ages
5 #### This was a fabulous book . I highly recommend it ! So run out and place it on your new kindle fire !
5 #### Not many authors can successfully write a fictionalized or an allegorical account of the end times or of heaven and do it justice , but Lewis did . His parallel world includes many Biblical truths interpreted in a beautifully fictional way , that does not detract from Scriptural truth , but rather , confirms it in small , parable - type examples . You would think the last book of the Narnia series would leave you feeling sad and unfulfilled , wanting more , but not so . The books brings the series to a beautiful conclusion , leaving the reader happy and full of hope .
5 #### This is a great book to read with teens or advanced preteens and CSLewis always has a good message in the subtle story lines .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books in the Narnia series . The imagery of the various settings is absolutely wonderful .
5 #### My favorite part of this story is how Eustace 's greed causes him to turn into a dragon . Seems like there are lots of good lessons for the reader in all of that , and in how Eustace becomes a boy again .
5 #### This book centers on Lucy 's relationship with Aslan , and it 's a beautiful story about Lucy 's personal growth toward making her own decisions and developing her own determination to follow her heart .
5 #### This is my favorite of all of the Chronicles . It pulls in new characters and concludes the series for the old characters . It ends on a lovely , hopeful note that Aslan 's country is a place of new beginnings and that the story goes on and on .
5 #### Gives the background for " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . " Read this one first and see where Jadis came from and where the wardrobe came !
5 #### In 1980 I read The Chronicles of Narnia and fell in love with the book 's . But when I read the Magician`s Nephew I could not gift out why it was not the first book . It may not have been written first , but it should been read first , because than questions about where the wardrobe came from would never need to be asked . I love how C. S. Lewis writes , his writing draws you in and you really do n't want to stop reading . But you know you must because life still goes on and you do need brakes form reading . Q
5 #### This was a Mother 's Day gift for my mom . She loves Narnia and she wanted something with larger writing than her old paperbacks . This has all the stories , in order of how they go chronologically , according to the story , NOT in order of how they were written . However , if you want to read them in order of how they were written , you can still do so , as they are all in one volume . The graphics are great , really enjoyable and the entire map of Narnia is on the dust jacket and the main cover . A little pricey , not really , for a book this large , this heavy , and of this quality , it 's totally worth the price I paid ! My mom loves it and I ca n't wait to borrow it ! Note : The first book came with a torn cover and my mom sees these as collectors items ( as do I ) , and Amazon quickly shipped a new one out w / in 2 days it was here and had a perfect cover . They paid for the return of the other book and as always , I was quite pleased with Amazon customer service .
5 #### I saw this in a bookstore several years ago , and not since . I 'm very glad to have found it here on Amazon . It 's wonderful to see Pauline Baynes 's illustrations ( in color ! ) throughout the book , some of which I had never seen before . I do wish it had a better shot of the Baynes map of Narnia than what 's on the covers , arguably the best Narnia map available , but it is an excellent copy of the Chronicles for the money , and I highly recommend it .
5 #### Like me , if you 've come here looking for this series , you are probably well aware of the quality of the writing . I looked through a lot of different editions here on Amazon trying to find a collection that was well made . The pages have this heavier , smooth feel to them ( I 'm sorry , but I do n't know what this type of paper is called ! ) so they are durable . The illustrations are fantastic . My nine year - old loved the movies when he saw them a couple of years ago but we never did get around to reading the books . He is working his way through them now and loves them . Definitely a keepsake .
5 #### I read this several years ago . Wanted to reread it . The best part is A slam singing creation . I can imagine God the true creator singing the Universe into being !
5 #### This was a great book . I loved it as much as the rest of the series . I ca n't wait to read the silver chair .
5 #### I have read these books at least twice before and love them and felt it was time to read them again but had given away my last set . I also have the privilege to know the man who brought them to life in film ..... at least his parents and he made such a good job of the films
3 #### Having been so familiar with the L , W & W for so long , It surprises me that I 've taken so long to finally grab the earliest book in the chronicles . The surprises continued as I read the piece . Unlike the typical ' children accidentally visit and save Narnia ' The Magician 's nephew instead visits a number of worlds , including Narnia which he unintentionally infects just as Aslan puts the finishing touches on creating the place . The story follows a many wondrous things happen structure , rather than a more comfortable - setting , tension , resolution - format , which makes the book a little un - compelling . Really this book serves entirely as allegory , although I confess the message gets a bit fuzzy - is evil a malevolent alien being plaguing paradise , or is evil just a thoughtless choice by a child ? I 'm going assume Lewis is suggesting both , because the alternative it 's I 'm to dull to comprehend the message . Ultimately this book is for those really keen on finding out more about Lewis ' works , but is hardly a must read to understand later ( more famous ) books .
5 #### A classic CS Lewis , the beginning of the series of the chronicles of Narnia . I love Lewis and this book is an excellent quick read to introduce you to the amazing world of Narnia . Love !
5 #### This book held the attention of my children better than any maiden book I have read . C S Lewis has a way of writing for children that has been lost to us . I will buy and read all of the Narnia books for them , so they can enjoy these books like I did when I was a boy . My daughters review ( she 's 8) : Magical , adventurous and funny . A good book for everyone . My son 's review ( he 's 8 too ): It was fantastic and I like how they made uncle Andrew the animal signs the animals watched him , like he was in the zoo .
5 #### Well worth reading ; for your self as a child , YA or adult . Or just reading it to your own children and thereby getting to read it yourself .

5 #### This is last in the Narnia series but you do n't have to have read all the others first . Jill and Eustace from The Silver Chair are drawn from London to Narnia because the land is in peril . Calormene men are invading and the talking animals need a leader . The youngsters are brave and clever but the army is going to be unstoppable . They try to summon the High Kings and Queens from an earlier time as well as the talking bull , bear , dogs and so on . There are battle scenes and all does not end happily . But the young people find happiness with Aslan the lion in his kingdom beyond the world . This is really well written and as good for girls as boys .
4 #### This was written as a prequel to the Narnia books and describes how the land of Narnia came to exist , in a retelling of the creation myth . A boy and girl in London creep along a series of linked attics and explore them , but instead of an empty house they find a doorway to another world . This is a woodland with ponds and each pond is a world of its own , the woodland serving to link them . Aslan the lion comes along and breathes life into a new land , filling it with animals . A cabdriver and his wife from London are set in this land to be its first rulers . There is not much more to the tale but it is nicely written . The other books are much more adventurous .
5 #### I was drawn in , right there . The Dawn Treader sets sail to find the seven lost lords of Narnia and encounters a slave trade , death water , a land where dreams ( not day dreams ! ) come true -- and a dragon . Now , lots of stories have some or all of those elements , but the difference is C.S.Lewis telling the story . The reader is drawn into the voyage even as the children are drawn into the sea painting . And along the way , there is plenty of food for thought . Plenty . I 'd recommend it for meeting Reepicheep , alone . No , I 'm not going to tell .
5 #### Deception and traitorous villainy set this young prince on the road to discover a world he thought only existed in fairy tales . Kings and queens are called out of another time to give aid , but it seems too little and too late . Honest badgers and dwarfs and treacherous hags and ogres , naiads and dryads and magic weapons -- and lovely character development : these are all part of Lewis ' arsenal of wonderful story telling .
5 #### In the end , it becomes harder and harder to determine which side is the " right " side . Faith is tested and many things begin to become clear ....... after " the end " . This is cryptic , to be sure , but the book is marvelous for its story , so near to things contemporary and so fantastic at the same time . My description would not make one want to read it , so I wo n't try . But monkeys , lions , unicorns and dwarfs enter in along with deception , deep friendship and surprising twists . Who would n't want to read that ?
5 #### Lewis is a writer . His stories , including this one , are captivating with delicious characters , fascinating plots and satisfying endings . Narnia is called into existence and Digory grows up because of his uncle 's rotten schemes and his own choices . It 's always fruitless to try to describe the books about Narnia , but if one will once read them ..... well !
5 #### Aslan is on the move , we love that all the stories are in one book ! This is a must read for families !
4 #### This book is so HUGE that I can barely hold it in one hand , even though it is light - weight paperback . Guess I thought I would be getting a set of books , but that 's not so important , I just was astonished at the thickness of this book -- it 's 2 1/8 " thick ! Hardly a book to read in bed , which is where I like to do my " spare time " reading .
5 #### I 've read them so many times and I just keep reading them over again . The chronicles of Narnia aware classics !
5 #### Mr. Louis knows how to tell a great story ! For once i came to the end and do n't hunger for more . Of course I know he is n't around to write any more . I have been reading night and day since I got my Kindle to read these chronicles , and I feel greatly fulfilled .
5 #### Bought this for my son and he loves it . He likes the fact that the books are all in a box and can be stored away neatly . He will read and re - read them again .
4 #### Not my favorite book the the Chronicles of Narnia ... Still good though . C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors . :)
3 #### Not my favorite book the the Chronicles of Narnia ... Still good though . C.S. Lewis is one of my favorite authors . :)
5 #### I have bought this set for all three of my kids . It is such a wonderful story . In my opinion I like to read a book before I see the movie . The movies are a little violent at times . My nine year oaks is reading these now . Since out cat is named Aslan he is really enjoying them . Ca nt lose with this set for a gift either .
4 #### This was an interesting way to illustrate there was more to the world of Narnia , than the forests and mountains . A fun adventure for males and females from 10 yrs on .
5 #### Although the movie stuck very close to the book . I find that reading is a much better way to understand the characters and what they are thinking and C.S. does that so well in this book . I would recommend to children ( 10 + ) and adults .
4 #### At first I was n't sure I was going to enjoy this book . But I stuck with it and was glad . It was also sad that the series ended . But then all good things do .
4 #### Awesome book . It helps explain how it all got started from Aslan & the White Witch . If you like the movies then it is a great book to read .
4 #### It 's a quick read , nothing really special , but fun , especially if you 're into the genre and want to see how he retrospectively " created " Narnia .
5 #### Edmond , Lucy and their cousin Eustace travel on a great and fantastical sea voyage with Prince Caspian to find and rescue the seven lords of Narnia , and while on the way discover the land where Aslan lives . He reveals a great secret about himself that he lives in this world by a different name . Who could that possibly be ? The similarities are too many , and I leave it up to you to figure out the identity of that person .
5 #### I am a huge fan of Lewis and the Chronicles . In each of these books we are swept into regions of fantasy , of Knights and Queens and talking animals and noble ideas . Buried in these magical settings are Christians concepts which I enjoy but they are presented in such a way that few would find them offensive . I highly recommend the entire Chronicles of Narnia . Richard Pendleton
5 #### I read this book by C.S. Lewis years ago to my children . Just finished reading it again and loved it even more .
4 #### CS Lewis is such a good author . Both kids and adults can be taken in by his storytelling and the Magician 's Nephew is no exception . It 's a great prelude to the Lion , Witch and Wardrobe .
2 #### Fun to read to my daughter , while explaining the parallels with the Bible and Christian faith . This was an interesting way to relate and interact with my daughter . I wanted to keep going in the book without her and then read it again for her .
5 #### This series was a childhood favorite for me ! I ordered this set as a gift for my son and he 's already in love with the books !
5 #### The Cronicles of narnia by Cs Lewis is definetly a five star book ! It is very detailed and suspensfull . My favroite thing about the book of all is that the end of the story is good to leave open story guide lines to start one more book in the same series .
5 #### 5 stars ! A classic . I miss harry potter ! This fills that void . Wish young kids would read before going to the movie !
5 #### The story went much smoother . Things were much more believable in the book . The events fit much with the prior books than those portrayed in the movie .
5 #### The book is an old favorite of mine . The stories are wonderful . My mother read them to me and I 'm going to read them to my son .
5 #### We chose to read this book as a required reading for me of the children , but enjoyed it so much that we finished reading out loud as a family . I highly recommend this book for all ages .
4 #### I first read C.S. Lewis ' The Magician 's Nephew back in college , and it remains my favorite book of the Narnia series ( Aslan got to be kind of a hardass by Prince Caspian ) . I 've always liked The Magician 's Nephew because it answers a lot of questions one might have about Narnia . Why does Professor Kirke 's wardrobe lead there ? Why is there a lamp post in the middle of nowhere ? Where did the Witch come from ? How did the Professor know about Narnia in the first book ? Also , Lewis had a knack for wonder and whimsy that few others possess . One caveat , though : People who are n't Christians might not appreciate the Biblical allegory of Narnia 's creation . The whole thing parallels Genesis . In The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe Aslan represents Christ , but here there are a lot more Bible metaphors . Of course , this is par for the course when it comes to C.S. Lewis .
5 #### i 've been looking for a nice set of The Chronicles of Narnia that does not have the movie pictures on / in them ( i 've loved the books way before it was a big movie ) , and this set is not disappointing !
5 #### Just as I remember from being a kid ! Full of wonder is Narnia ! I love to read this series of books !
5 #### I am an adult female . I have read a TON since buying my Kindle touch . These books went on sale one day and I bought the whole series . I LOVED this book . It is a great read . I had never read the series before or watched the movie . Be sure you read The Magicians Nephew before the others ! It is a great back story .
5 #### I did n't think I would get so taken by the manner in which it ended . Thank you to C. S. Lewis for wrapping up this imaginative story by bringing all the characters back to my memory
5 #### I remember reading this series when I was just a kid . In fact , I still have those books - they have torn covers , bent pages , and weathered spines . When I saw the sale of all these books for my Kindle for only $ 1.99 a piece , I knew they were going to be downloaded ! And , as always I was transferred to Narnia as I lay in bed ... What a great author ! !
5 #### When I was in third grade , our teacher read us " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " and ever since , I have been inspired to write . C.S. Lewis is an unbelievable writer of great fiction with powerful Christian messages embedded . As a min - thirties adult , I decided to go back into the world of Narnia and for the first time I read the book that started the entire series . This is a great read if you want to know the beginning workings of this classic world . I highly recommend it for all ages . Share it with your kids as well . Never too old or too young to visit Narnia .
5 #### This is the 4th book in the Narnia series . I have been having a great time reading this book . There is a battle in every book you should definitely read this awesome book . It was a little bit creepy . You should read this book .
5 #### Every one of the Narnia books are great , but I realized reading this one why ( in part ) I enjoy them so much ... I 'm a sucker for a happy story , and if too many bad things happen ... or it takes too long ... a happy ending is n't a happy ending . These are truly happy endings ... Now it 's time for sleep with great memories of a king and wise lion ...
5 #### I loved this book as much as all the others before it , except the horse and his boy , which did not read , for it was not interesting to me . So good , read it . If you read it , I guarantee you will love it . The only thing I disliked in the book was the slow part with Prince Caspian , how the dwarf took half the book telling his story . I wanted to hear more about the 4 kids , Lucy , Susan , Edmund , and Peter . Love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### The last battle , as well as the other Chronicles of Narnia , are fun reading to me . Lots of intrigue and adventure make these books very entertaining .
5 #### yes I loved the books , I found his style in this series different but it grows on you . I also was happy with the quick shipment . thanks
4 #### I did n't think I was going to enjoy reading this as much as I actually have . I am looking forward to books six and seven now .
5 #### To my knowledge one of the best edition of The Chronicles of Narnia , all in one book and with the original drawings in large scale and colors . A must for all Narnians ( and tourists too , of course ) .
5 #### Read as a child , a mother and a grandmother . So fun , beautiful and profound . We ca n't wait to read the grands book two !
5 #### Retread this book after probably ten or fifteen years and it has definitely stood the test of time . Quick read , we 'll written , great pictures !
5 #### One of the smartest writers of all time , CS Lewis makes the argument for Christianity to the school aged set . And grownups need to read it too .
5 #### The Last Battle is a very exciting and spiritual experience . I like his writing and I like his very complete characters . I hope everyone reads the whole series right up to the Last Battle it is a very fulfilling experience .
5 #### This series of stories by C.S. Lewis are wonderful . They have a great moral to them . I let my granddaughters borrow my hard copies so I purchased the set for my Kindle . Enjoy being transported to Narnia !

5 #### My son was hooked to the book from the first page . He is now on to the next book . .
5 #### This is an excellent book . The storyline is well written and my son loved the book . It 's very inspiring and I definitely would recommend this book to all my friends and family .
5 #### I recently read the first book in the series , and I could n't wait to read this one . I loved the idea of a prequel to the books . I loved learning about the creation and beginning of Narnia . I also loved the biblical base . I loved looking past the words on the pages and connecting the book 's events with biblical truth . I read this book in two days ! ! ! I just could n't put it down ! : )
5 #### These books are amazing . I enjoy listening to them on my long drives to and from work daily . I love how the characters just come to life .
5 #### I have read this story before ( actually the whole Narnia series ) but it had been awhile . The story really draws you in and holds you until the end . I will probably read it again when my grand daughter is old enough to understand it .
3 #### I remember reading this when I was a young girl and liking it . However , now when I try to read it , I find the style a little dry and boring , kinda like the Lord of the Rings books . :( Do n't get me wrong ... I like the Narnia series , but I guess I 'm not used to Lewis 's style of writing .
4 #### I have loved almost every book CS Lewis has written and this one is not really an exception , but seems just a bit less riveting and fascinating as the other Narnia stories .
4 #### Again , a good one to read with my grandchildren . It grew a little tedious at times though , did n't hold my interest as well as books 1 - 3 did .
5 #### Reminds me of grade school . Fun , upbeat , has a moral lesson and of course makes me want to read more .
4 #### Have n't had time to read it all . Just expect to love it as much as the rest of the Narnia series
5 #### The first CS Lewis I have read . Just fell in love with the Narnia series . That 's exactly why I ordered more of them . Since these seem to be geared to younger readers , I guess that makes me young at heart .
5 #### It was just like the movie , Although a lot better because it was more , well , Explanatory , in a way that I can not put it in . You should get it , Especially if your already a fan in any case :)
5 #### I have enjoyed this book , this series , over and over again since I was a small child . I am now reading them to my 3 kids ( who are also loving them and begging for more ) and I am STILL enjoying them . This series is one of those that you periodically read every year or two . C.S. Lewis does an amazing job on this and on all his other books , Narnian or not .
5 #### I really enjoyed reading this book , it was one of my favorite series books that I read when I was in high school .

5 #### I really enjoyed reading this book , it was one of my favorite series books that I read when I was in high school .
5 #### Although I read The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe many years ago , this is the first ( Narnia time ) in the chronicles series . I thoroughly enjoy them all . See my review of the above for more details .
5 #### This is the 2nd time I 've read this book . It was even better this time ! Hopefully , the movie will do it justice !
5 #### Everyone should read the entire Narnia series . It takes you to fantasy and back to reality . If you read it as a child , take the time to read it again .
5 #### This is truly a magnificent book ! all the illustrations have been colored and are just beautiful . as far as i know , this is the only book where all of ms bayne 's lovely illustrations are in color . i have treasured it for years
5 #### We bought this set for our 9 year old son and it was a big hit . Good quality set of books and packaged nicely . This is a cheap price for years of enjoyment .
4 #### After seeing the movie , the book was definitely different than what I expected ! There are some things that match up but some of the key point are n't the same . Overall , it was a great book and I 'd definitely recommend it !
5 #### i love this book because of c. s. lewis ' view of what heaven might be like , which comes near the end of the book . i love what his imagination imagined , and think it might well be close to the truth .
5 #### CS Lewis was a great philospher and teacher . His stories let the reader understand deep principles . Always well written and thought provoking
5 #### The Narnia series is unsurpassed for all ages . When our children were younger , we read the entire series to them after my sister - in - law purchased the series for us . It fostered a love of reading in our children that continues to this day .
4 #### This timeless series holds much wisdom for all ages . A fast - paced adventure that will hold the attention of all ages . It 's a wonderful series to read out loud .
5 #### Though we read this out loud to our children when they were young , it 's time to read the series again and enjoy it all over again .
5 #### When our children were young , my husband and I read all of the Narnia books out loud to our three children . We all loved the books . It 's time to read them again .
5 #### I never read the chronicles as a child , but am finding them extremely diverting . I 'm so glad to spend time in Narnia
5 #### Great series for kids to read or for us to read to our grandkids too young to read them but old enough to follow the story lines . Get them , you wo n't regret it .
5 #### I 've read this series before . Great stories . Well worth getting them on ebooks to read to our grandkids as they get old enough to listen to me read them to them or old enough to read them by themselves . A win / win series . Get it .
5 #### I 've read the whole series before and it is well worth getting it on ebooks . Would recommend it to those who enjoy some ' magic'/scifi stories . I plan to read them to our grandkids as they age enough to understand what 's what . Enjoy .
5 #### I re - read this book ( and the whole series ) every couple of years or so and it 's nice to have it on my Kindle , so that I can pick it up whenever / wherever I want !

5 #### The story is grown up,(not ADULT , in the sense of something you ca n't share with your children ) but with all the complexities of deception and seeing through it , being aware of exactly who and what you follow , and why .
5 #### There are STILL stories that do NOT glorify evil , bad attitudes , selfishness and all without being priggish or preachy . This is just clean fun and adventure .
5 #### I love all the Narnia books ! They are a chance to share a fascinating story and the faith behind it with my grandchild now .
5 #### Even as an adult I read and reread the whole Narnia series , and look forward to sharing it with my granddaughter !
4 #### This book is a quick , enjoyable read . The first time I did was as a child ... and I 'd be glad I read it again even if I remembered it from the first time . :-) It would be a great way to help teach a child some morals , and for a Christian parent to point back to the One ... I look forward the rest in the set ...
5 #### this series is so good and this is one of my favorites in the series . Lewis is so good at describing the characters and action - a great storyteler !
5 #### I love this entire series - they are a must read . I do n't understand why I did n't read them when I was younger . but I loved them . this book about Prince Caspian was one of my favorites of the series . I love Lewis ' characters - he is an excellent storyteller !
5 #### what an excellent way to end the series . I loved that most of the characters were mentioned in one way or another to wrap up the series . Lewis is an excellent writer !
4 #### A good book , but a little hard to understand .Over all I liked it . It was fun to read . Good book C.S Lewis
5 #### I love the movies based on these books and decided to read the books . I was not disappointed at all .
2 #### Last summer , I took a continuing ed course to keep up my educator certification . For the course , I wrote two comprehension units . I had to consider Bloom 's Taxonomy in writing the questions , so that students would develop deeper level thinking . I purchased this book last year for this year 's homeschooling with my oldest daughter who is in fourth grade . I did n't look closely at it when it arrived though . And I had her complete the first unit for The Magician 's Nephew . I am putting together a unit right now for her that will address all of the story elements , so I went back and took a closer look at this book with that in mind . I was really disappointed when I realized that all of the questions I read as I skimmed the book were all literal questions . The author did go beyond yes or no , but not to any deeper level of analysis . Student simply need to look in the text and write the literal answers to the questions . There are questions about the setting and characters , but it 's all mixed together and the words that one associates with the story elements : point of view , theme , plot , climax , character development , setting are n't directly used . I would not recommend this book .
4 #### Not a bad story . My son just started reading this series and likes it . You could not beat the price for the series .
5 #### As a girl myself and now for my own children , this book is the beginning of a delightful and magical journey that need never end . The undertones of Christianity ring true for me now as an adult and make the story fresh and , at the same time , comfortingly familiar . The genius of C.S. Lewis is unmatched .
5 #### This was very different from the movie but I enjoyed it very much . I ca nt wait to read the next book , I hope the make another movie of this series .
5 #### I read some of the series as a child and have seen all of the movies , but reading the series is giving life to it all again . I have such a special place in my heart for these books . I love sharing them with my grandchildren .
5 #### Never read these stories as a child , but find them charming nonetheless . This first book in the series of seven is engaging and imaginative . If one desires a more casual read of C. S. Lewis material , the Tales of Narnia fit the bill !
5 #### I read these books to my daughter each for bedtime story and it is nice to have the whole collection together in one little box .
5 #### Having read this series before I knew when I saw that they were a Deal of the Day for the Kindle I had to pick them up . This is a great go - to series any time you are wanting to get immersed in a fantastical world . Lewis does an amazing job of painting a picture with words . It 's a great read for kids and adults alike . That 's why it has stood the test of time to become such a classic . This book provides a fun beginning to the world of Narnia .

5 #### This is a classic , every one should read these wonderful books . What can be said that can do it justice . Reading in chronological order is the best . This one first .
5 #### The book is great . Illustrations are cool . The book came quickly and I really enjoy it . The only thing I 'd take off half a star for is that it 's big and a little heavy since it 's the whole series all in one book .
5 #### the book was in brand new condition and looks perfect . it is a nice addition to my collection of books .
4 #### Always a fan of the books of Narnia . Really never read all of them and plan to do so . A great read for all ages !
5 #### This book is filled with wonder . The suspense of how Polly and Digory get into the " other worlds " will keep you reading ! I 've seen 3 of the Chronicles of Narnia movies so far and they definitely need to make this one into a movie ! Ca n't wait to finish out the series :)
3 #### The last Narnia book is the least favorite of mine . A clever ape concocts a scheme to rule Narnia using a counterfeit Aslan . The first part of this book is not as compelling a read as the other books in the series . But when the heroes are captured and the world is about to end , Lewis creates a beautiful vision of the Real Narnia that leaves you with the deep longing he called joy .
4 #### The 4 children of " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " find themselves pulled into Narnia but it looks nothing like the world they once ruled . Meanwhile , an unhappy prince discovers that the country his uncle rules is not what he thought it was . There are marvelous creatures in hiding and his own life is threatened . The two plots eventually come together and a fateful contest of swords will determine the future of the land .
5 #### I love all of the Narnia books but this is the best . 3 children fall into a painting of a ship only to find themselves on a voyage to the end of the sea . Lucy and Edmund have been here before but their unpleasant cousin Eustace has a hard time adjusting to a world of talking animals , dragons , living nightmares and a good but untamed lion . Lewis ' world building gifts are working at their peak as the shipmates encounter one enchanted island after another . I hate coming to the end of any of the Narnia books but leaving the decks of Dawn Treader was the most difficult task of all .
5 #### In this installment of the Narnia Chronicles , we discover how this magical world came to be . 2 children discover a way to travel between worlds . They encounter a cruel tyrant , a silly dabbler in magic , a noble cabbie and find themselves present at the moment when Narnia lyrically comes into being , only to have the newborn world 's existence threatened almost immediately .
5 #### I remember reading " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " when I was a child but I never read any further than that book . When Amazon offered the whole set for $ 1.99 each , I decided to give them another try . I am so glad I did ! What a marvelous book ! I am going to buy the rest of the set as soon as I finish writing this . I recommend " The Chronicles of Narnia " to everyone .
5 #### what 's not to love ? great reading at a great price ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! recommended for all ages -- makes great bedtime reading even if you ca n't read yet !
5 #### This was a gift , awesome price and awesome item . This is a fantastic buy and this item shipped so quickly ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### MY 11 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THESE BOOKS . SHE HAS ALL THE MOVIES , NOW SHE HAS READ ALL OF THE BOOKS THE FIRST WEEK SHE GOT THEM ...
4 #### it 's really long so if you have a lot of time to kill , great read . sit down with a cup of hot whatever on a blistering cold winter evening and you 're good to go .
5 #### Claire Bloom is one of the great . Such a pity that more of her work is not on CD The Secret Garden , the Book of Y are the ones I know and would love to own .
5 #### Again , a most glorious read . Each time that I read this story , I begin to understand what it is really about . This is told in a very beautiful way and with deeper meaning . I would highly recommend this book to any one who enjoys a deeper story ! !
5 #### Well , the whole false Aslan thing is a catastrophic turn of events but , really ? ! Who could have thought that " Aslan " is a donkey - with a witty ape . I 'm not saying that the book is bad - it 's really a masterpiece , but that 's just my opinion .
5 #### The product worked great . I will buy this product again in the future . I am very happy with the purchase .
5 #### What a treat ! This story was as good as it was the last time I read it . I highly recommend this book to any one who enjoys a story with a Christian message .
2 #### The subject did not hold my daughter 's interest and she quickly tired of this book , unfortunately . A little too much on the relationships in the book and not as much mystery as she had hoped .
5 #### This was a wonderful book . I never read it as a child but thoroughly enjoyed reading it along with my son . We are now on the 3rd book of the series . The illustrations are beautiful and add to the story , especially for younger readers .
5 #### Another episode of the Chronicles of Narnia . I love them all and read them all annually . I highly recommend them to everyone .
5 #### One of the Chronicles of Narnia , how could anyone not like them . I love them and read all of them annually .
5 #### My mother wanted the books by CS Lewis for her Kindle and I got them for myself at the same time , as I had never read them . I am about 3/4 of the way through this book and love it . It fills out the land of Narnia from the beginning .
5 #### It is a wonderful story . The beginning of the series . It was a kindle purchase , so I had instant access . I was completely satisfied .
4 #### Yet again , another good read by C.S. Lewis . However , this is the beginning of the end where each chapter after that is better than the last as quoted from the book itself . See where Aslan brings his people , and what happens to those who choose not to believe . The real adventure has always been with those who muster up the faith , and believe without seeing . Although there is a reunion of various characters from all of the books , allow C.S. Lewis to take you on one final adventure through Narnia , where the new Narnia is one without end .
5 #### This is a great collection of a wonderful story . How convenient to have the entire series in one tome . Superb !
5 #### Even though I am an adult I love these stories and this one is no different . I love how easy it reads and how you get pulled in and find yourself on the deck of the Dawn Treader !
5 #### Magnificent ending to a beautifully written series . Sad to be at the end but elated to start at the beginning .
5 #### My grandson ( 9 ) has read half of the books since I gave the collection to him for Christmas . He is taking away from his ipod time and spending it reading these books , Hooray ! !
5 #### This was a gift for a family member . They loved it very much . Thank you for putting it all in one .
3 #### * * spoiler alert * * " The Last Battle " was good because it is C.S.Lewis but it was not my favorite of the series . I really liked in the end how he brought the past characters back to make it a happy ending . He put a couple of twists at the end that I was not expecting which made it a happier ending . The book however as a whole was very dark and at times very difficult to convince myself to pick it up again . I am glad to have read the entire series because it truly is one of the best series I have ever read .
5 #### I have enjoyed these books since I was a kid and got them from the library . By the time I owned the books though , somebody decided the story is better read in chronological order rather than published order . I could hardly disagree more . I am very happy that I was able to find this older set illustrated by Pauline Baynes that rightly place The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe as book 1 rather than The Magician 's Nephew .
5 #### Reading this book was like visiting with an old friend and listening to stories ! I could n't put it down . This is a great book for anyone who likes fantasy !
5 #### Love this series and you ca n't read just one without reading the rest . Have read this series so many times ...
5 #### Love this series and you ca n't read just one without reading the rest . Have read this series so many times ...
5 #### Great books , good read , very good author , c.s . Lewis is awesome and a great inspiration . It is hard not to love these books .
5 #### The Narnia Series is not only a children 's classic -- it is a bona fide , unmodified classic -- one of those books that one 's students plunk down on the lecturer 's desk and say , " read this"--well , anyway , mine did . Lewis is a master of the English language , exceeding in mastery even Tolkien ( Lord of the Rings ) .
5 #### Ordered this as a gift for someone , we have already read them and they are wonderful , would recommend to anyone 10 yrs & up
4 #### I bought this set for my boys and they love it . The box was in pretty good condition , but most importantly the CDs were in great shape !
5 #### I like C.S. Lewis and think that God had given him a great talent for writing . The Chronicles of Narnia are full of adventure and live lessons , that you will have to read and find our for yourself .
5 #### I really like C.S Lewis and think that God blessed him with a talent of writing . The Chronicles of Narnia was well written and I did not want to put the books down , this is coming form someone that is not a big reader . He also puts little life lessons in each of the books , you will just have to read it and find them yourself .

3 #### This is the last time Peter and Susan will be in Narnia . When Caspian blew the horn , time on earth stopped for the kings ( Peter and Edmund ) and queens ( Susan and Lucy ) of Narnia . They opened their eyes to a very strange place , but knew somehow that it had something to do with Narnia , and therefore were not scared . The common theme in this book seems to be that the majority of the folk and creatures only believe what they see , and many common myths ( like ghosts ) that were created , passed down , and re - created . Although the children believed in the magical world of Narnia , and Aslan as well , the older children had doubts . What Lucy saw , they did not , so they kept pushing forward , instead of following the lead that Aslan gave to Lucy early on in their adventure to help Prince Caspian . However , after the adventure through the wardrobe , Edmund was more inclined to believe Lucy . And so most of the other creatures of Narnia also had their doubts . For instance , I believe Tumpkin ( a hedgehog ) said he believed either Aslan or the White Witch ( whoever would help them defeat Miraz , and help Prince Caspian in battle . Read the book to enjoy the rest of this adventure . Although , in my opinion , it is n't comparable to some of the other journies C.S. Lewis takes us on in the first few books .
5 #### I 've read the Narnia books several times each . They are great for 4th-6th grade kids . Some good lessons in there if you keep your eyes open for them .
4 #### Digory and Polly , with the " help " of Digory 's uncle , get themselves into ... well , into another world . Will they ever get home ! The first in the Chronicles of Narnia series shows how Narnia came to be .
5 #### CS Lewis never fails to amaze me as a writer ; he had a great imagination . His friendships with other such writers is very obvious .
5 #### It arrived on time and in good condistion . She really like it better then he thought he would . At a good price .
5 #### This is the best of the Narnia series but anything by C.S. Lewis is worth reading , especially his books on faith .
5 #### Bought it for my mother . Beautiful binding and cover . The reading is easy due to the regular sized font , but there are no interior drawings , which I wanted .
5 #### As a lifelong Narnia lover , this book is one of the best purchases I 've ever made . It 's absolutely beautiful , well - done ( other than a few scattered formatting errors - no big deal in a large collection like this ) and fantastic . I anticipate having this book for the rest of my life , and sharing it with my children and grandchildren .
5 #### My 8 year old girl who loved the Lion & Witch and the Wardrobe , wanted more . She asked for Christmas and got this set . She is loving book 1 . The language is rich , characters broad , vocabulary expanding and emotionally complex but clear . I get bulletins as she reads .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia are the best children 's books ever written . I read them all to my children and they , in turn , are reading them to their children . This volume is a great addition to the books themselves .
5 #### The set arrrived later than expected and not in the time frame indicated . I could have purchased the set at our local book store for about the same price and the recipient would have had it in time for Christmas .
5 #### Wonderful book ! I could n't walk away from it ! Reading this book is like being with an old friend telling stories !
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia series is a timeless classic . I was reminded of this when Disney made The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe into a movie . After the stunning on - screen visualization , I went back and reread the series for the first time in a number of years and found that they had n't lost their flavor . They are still amazing , and the images they evoke in the reader 's mind are as strong as if you were watching them on the big screen . I wanted the series in individual books , because I like to read them in the order in which they were first published , namely : 1 . The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe ; 2 . Prince Caspian ; 3 . The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ; 4 . The Silver Chair ; 5 . The Horse and His Boy ; 6 . The Magician 's Nephew ; 7 . The Last Battle . That 's my preference , and I reordered them in the box they came in before I put it on my bookshelf . The covers and binding on this version are very nice .
5 #### Beautiful illustrations and hard bound . I bought it for a young girl who loves fantasy . The Magician 's Nephew is a must read for those who want to understand the back story to The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe .
5 #### C.S. Lewis ' series of The Chronicles of Narnia is a great series for children everywhere , and made a perfect Christmas gift .
5 #### Wow , what a great book . I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE . It was a fantastic plot setter , and made the whole series make way more sense
4 #### Even though I was told ahead of time that the books did not have a box I was still disappointed that they did n't . However , the books were in excellent shape and that 's what matters most !
5 #### C.S. Lewis is like early David Bowie . He is just never NOT good . Though I love all of the Narnia adventures , the Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the best of the series . There is action and adventure . There 's a love interest . We meet precocious children , a talking mouse , a cursed dragon , a ginormous lion who is actually a metaphor for God , and a group of jumping dwarves who can not seem to agree on what they are called . This voyage is one that will leave even the most cynical reader thoroughly engaged .
5 #### The basic set of Narnia books . My daughter uses these for her writing class which is focused on C.S. Lewis .
5 #### I never was interested Narnia , but I simply talked with one person long about Narnia books and decided to buy them all and read . And this was first book in my country which I read . I fell in love with easy reading , I read this book during about 6 hours without non stop reading because I could n't put it away . My childhood was such misery without these books . I even cried many times reading it . I always cried when Aslan appeared in plot , I do not know why , but he made me cry from joy . I think it is good book for children , all serie is great , I read all 7 books in two weeks during my summer vacations and I woke up in morning just to take book and read more and more . I read every sentence and every sentence made me think : " What will be next ? " . Adventures made me very interested because I love adventures , fantasy and such worlds never existed . I like to simply read books , I hate books which I read and think what the hell author wanted to say . But Narnia was easiest books I have ever read , interesting , simply and made me feel happy every day . They lifted my grumpy mood I have every day .
1 #### Was surprised when I ordered this that it was not a box set of 7 books but one gigantic book with all the stories in it . Make sure you know what you are buying , the name of the product was deceiving .
5 #### This was a gift to myself and i love it , its a great book . Brings a map of narnia and some extra content to undersatand more themasterpiefe this is ! Loved it !
5 #### I read them twice . What insite Lewis had . I see Jesus Christ in each book . I will keep them as a collection .
4 #### I wanted to read this series , and it was recommended to me to read this one first , even though it 's the sixth book in the series . What a wonderful book and now that I am on the actual first one , it 's making so much sense . I love this story and C.S. Lewis has a beautiful way of telling the story and painting the scene ! ! Wonderful !
5 #### Very nice looking book and a comforting weight . Good illustrations . Makes a great gift and impressive for a young person . The book will last well through the years .
5 #### C.S. Lewis is a great modern author who wrote the Narnia series , of which this is one . This is overall the best book in that series - a wonderfully well written story , a great adventure with many lessons taught , great characters - girls , boys and talking animals . This book is suitable for reading to children , for encouraging children to read and for reading by adults . I read it for the first time when I was in my twenties . It introduced me to C.S. Lewis . I just bought three - two for Christmas gifts , and one for me since I no longer have a copy . Really , do n't miss this great story at this price . I am much looking forward to reading it again .
5 #### Our family loves this book and the illustrations just add to the wonder of the collection ! We 've given it as a gift a numbver of times as well . A must - have !
5 #### I got this book for my stepson b / c he had read all my other books and so I got him this one to finish off the series .
5 #### No one can capture the heart of children and adults alike quite the way C.S. Lewis did with the Chronicles of Narnia . The movies that have been are great , no doubt , but nothing compares to the actual books . Voyage of the Dawn Treader is my favorite Narnia book , though strangely it 's not my favorite movie . The adventures found by the main characters are unforgettable and larger than life ... and I really love the way they introduced Eustace 's character . Anyone with half an imagination , regardless of their age , should enjoy this story .
5 #### No one can capture the heart of children and adults alike quite the way C.S. Lewis did with the Chronicles of Narnia . The movies that have been are great , no doubt , but nothing compares to the actual books . This may be the most amazing book of the series . The adventure here is far more thrilling , far more life changing , than any of the others . But for me , I was left with one question ... What happened to Susan ?
5 #### No one can capture the heart of children and adults alike quite the way C.S. Lewis did with the Chronicles of Narnia . The movies that have been are great , no doubt , but nothing compares to the actual books . Prince Caspian was actually my favorite of the three Walden Media movies and is a great book as well . Though it 's very different from the movie it 's still captivating and full of wonder and excitement .
5 #### Was given these books as a 12 yr old and they have been a favorite ever since . I used to read the whole series like 3 times a year . Wonderful book series . Great for young to old ages . A classic . ( Note : did not have this specific box set . I had an older version )
4 #### I 've collected all the 1st edition reproductions of the Chronicles of Narnia series , however I have to say that the U.S. edition printing was on slightly better paper . The U.K. editions are printed on " eco - friendly " recycled ( i think ) paper , but the paper is n't as fine or smooth and seems a bit cheaper than the american edition . Even the jackets do n't have that satin feel , but rather seem to be made out of basic uncoated paper . All in all though , beautiful book , with nice color picture on the inside page
3 #### This book is the fifth book in the Chronicles of Narnia series . The series was written by C.S Lewis and contains 7 books , which are : The Magician 's Nephew , The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe , The Horse and His Boy , Prince Caspian , The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , The Siler Chair , and The Last Battle . Many new characters are introduced in this book . The main characters come about the Dawn Treader when they are sucked through a picture in their room . They then meet Caspian , a former friend and ally , who takes them on his ship , the Dawn Treader . The main characters discover that Caspian is on a journey to find seven lost lords . The lords were banished when Caspian 's late uncle Miraz usurped Caspian 's father 's throne . The main characters decide to join Caspian on his journey . They sail through many adventures , until they reach the World 's End . I enjoyed this book , but it was not the best I 've read . The adventures were slow , but then again I suppose the book was just not my style . It is very well written , but there was n't much action . I do recommend it to children ages 8 + , but it may be difficult to understand if you have not read any other book in the series .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia were some of my favorite books growing up and I can not wait to receive this book to thoroughly enjoy them all over again .
5 #### Have not read this since my son was a youngster , and we read as bedtime stories . Recently saw a movie on TV about CS Lewis , so decided to purchase for future reference and maybe for visits from grandchildren .
4 #### This , in my opinion , is the best of the Narnia series giving a firm nod towards classic medieval fantasy . It has the most exciting story and you ca n't wait to find out what lies in wait at each of the ship 's destinations . The Narnia series was written as books for children , but their tone and vocabulary -which have come from a bygone and more literate age - now mean that most adults can enjoy the Narnia series too without the feeling they are dumbing down . For those of you who like such classic fantasy , but maybe something not so innocent and darker , I would try&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Lord - of - the - Rings / dp / B002RI9176 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Into - The - Trees / dp / B009KVBC20 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Into The Trees</a > .
5 #### The Magician 's Nephew is one of the best books in the Narnia series and gives a delightful introduction to the world of Narnia . The Brillance of the Magician 's Nephew is that you literally experince a world from it 's beginning . I love how the very first thing you see in Narnia is the creation of Narnia . And I love how you see the creation of Narnia , piece by piece and see Narnia grow and expand as it 's born . It brings a mixture of amazment and contentment to see the birth of Narnia play out . I alos enjoyed the description of the Wood Between the Worlds and it 's pleasent lonliness . And the ending was so cool . I 'm glad Digory had thw wood from the Narnian tree made into a wardrobe instead of just burning it . :) Finally , the Magician 's Nephew becomes an even stronger story after the Lion , the Witch and the Warbrode is read because of connections between the 2 stories . As much as I liked the Magician 's Nephew when I read it , I liked it even better after I 'd read the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . The biggest weakness of the Magician 's Nephew is that the physical appearance of Digory and Polly is never described so you 're left to wonder what thy might look like . All in all , the Magician 's Nephew is a great introduction to the Narnian world and is my 2nd favorite of the Narnia books behind only the Voyage of the Dawn Treader . A 5 star effort .
1 #### This is not a Folio Society book as advertised . Do not purchase this product if you are looking for Folio Society .
5 #### Another great story in this wonderful land of Narnia , C.S. Lewis is one of the all time great writers that takes his readers with him into the world of his imagination and beliefs . This book is the finale and it helps the reader understand Narnia better than all the previous stories , loved it .
5 #### The book was in great condition , and Lewis seems to raise the bar with each successive chapter , whether it 's by inserting little life lessons or using grammar that engages you as a reader .
5 #### C.S. Lewis never disappoints ! I 'm reading this to my granddaughter and she loves the " cliffhanger " chapters . It 's always , " Can we read the next chapter now ? " . Sounds just like her dad when I read it to him ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I 've been wanting to read C.S. Lewis ' series for a while now and I 'm happy I 've started . I had herd from a lot of people that it is a great series , I have to agree with them . I did n't so much expect it to be on a 3rd grader reading level , so it 's not so mentally demanding and I got frustrated every now and again because my recent reading has had much more detail and character development . But I ca n't be upset at the book because I was n't its intended audience . There is - however - one MAJOR flaw with this series . You can buy them all compiled into one big book , but you ca n't buy them in one big heap on a kindle ! ! ! I finished this book in less than a day , and if they all came in one big collection , I could have just kept reading into the next book .
5 #### The book answered questions from the Wardrobe book . I read Wardrobe first . The Nephew really needs to be read first . I did not know about it prior to Wardrobe . I really enjoyed the book . Am looking forward to the rest of the series . I am a fan of CS Lewis . Charles ( vwstud )
5 #### I had read some of the books within this complete work before and loved them . But it 's even better now to watch my son enjoy these adventures . He is eight years old and needs help with some of the reading , but this is interesting enough to keep him hooked . He ca n't wait to read it every night .
4 #### We are enjoying this book that is actually the " before " story for * the lion the witch and the wardrobe . * my 8 year old and I like the different references to things we recognize in Narnia . The writing is okay - not as good as TLTW&TW , but it has good suspense !
5 #### This is an excellent series and I love how all the books are put into one huge book with gold trimmed pages . Totally worth having this as part of your collection . :)
5 #### I saw the first movie and then bought the entire set . Books are always better than the movies . A well written series . Fast , fun and exciting . Highly Reccommend .
5 #### This is truly a magical , and wonderful book ! I have seen the movies , but decided to read them in the order where this is the first book , it is an amazing one too . It answers the questions you might ask , it tells you how Narnia came to be . I would recommend this to all ages , it 's a very great story , I could n't stop reading ! I just love this ! And I hope everyone else will too ! (:
4 #### Swept back into Narnia with one unwelcome companion -- their difficult cousin Eustace -- Edmund and Lucy find themselves pulled aboard the Dawn Treader , which Prince Caspian sails to the Eastern edge of the world . This is my favorite of the Narnia books . Eustace delights me : I wish more correlation were made between his flaws and Edmund 's , but his flaws are balanced by realistic yet transformative growth and ultimately sympathetic representation ; he 's always been the Narnia character I remember and love best . As for the rest , the book is numinous : the Dawn Treader travels through waters which are striking , surreal , and evocative ; the book is emotionally rich , transportive , and vast . Its travelogue format limits its plot , thus it 's not the most memorable or iconic of the Narnia books ; it also has its low points , like the ineffective comedy of the Dufflepuds and the explicit , subtlety - destroying Christian allegory of the last page . But more often than not , it is the very best of what it is : a journey into the wonders of the unknown , leaving both character and reader forever changed . I love it beyond measure , and of course recommend it -- although , for a first - time reader , the series is best read in order .
5 #### The wisdom of C.S. Lewis stands the test of time . The Last Battle is a readable and inspiring story which is easily applicable to our current world situation . The clash of good and evil , the interplay of innocence and ignorance , the contrast of greed and selfless sacrifice draws readers of all ages into deeper levels of thought and understanding . I have read the whole series repeatedly with children and adults . The themes resonate at all levels , and the last volume is particularly worth another reading with an eye to contemporary developments in the world scene .
5 #### How I missed reading The Chronicles of Narnia books is a mystery ? As a young teenage I read non - stop , so the hole is now filled at middle age . The first book will soon be made into a movie , looking forward to seeing how it 's depicted . These books are so rich in visual detail and deep thought they are a joy to read .
5 #### I read the Chronicles of Narnia many times to my children : now that I 'm grown , I still read them occasionally . They are so full of wisdom , and rich in imagination . It reads beautifully and well . I suppose in this politically correct age , I should mention something . As to females , the books read as though they were written today , but Lewis kind of had it in a bit for Arabs . Two of his books ( The Horse and His Boy ; and The Final Battle ) feature an Arabic - type culture , and the Arabic - type princes does marry the English - type prince ... and there are noble and ignoble folks in each group . Still , there are two places in which he uses the term " darkie " : it does not mean what Americans envision , and it is a quote from an angry character -- but I always paused to explain the term and why it is wrong to use it when reading to my kids . Aside from that , it is simply amazing a bachelor could write such beautiful books !
4 #### First book I have read by C S Lewis ! Very entertaining ! I love the way he sets the story line for the rest of his books !
5 #### Very often , when reading any ' New Age ' literature , I come across references to the ' Narnia ' series by C S Lewis . So , to satisfy my curiosity , I purchased the entire set expecting to find something at the level of Winnie the Pooh . Although the series is geared to the younger mind and their fascination with mystical adventures featuring young heroes , there are some real gems of spiritual wisdom here . The character of a creative being , in the form of a Lion , and the evolution of living things which exist at different levels of consciousness can easily be applied to much more complex philosophical concepts . Now that I have become aware of Hollow Earth theories , it might be good to read this series again , this time looking for hints of the connection between the two . It may be that the world of Narnia does not just exist in the imagination . I believe that this series is a good thing to read as a child to facilitate the opening of the consciousness , but then even better to read as an adult to discover the things we have learned about life and its mysteries which connect to this story . In summary : we should never stop learning ; the lessons do not have to be difficult or complex . It is possible for them to be simple and enjoyable .
5 #### Outside of the movies , this is my introduction to Narnia . I had heard of it , was vaguely aware of the story , but had never sat down and read it . What a wonderful read on several levels . Great kids story in general , great message for everyone . I think the series works in the order presented , even if it 's different than the publish date . Each book is a great read in its own right , let alone as part of the greater story . These are " coming of age " stories in a very true sense , not only in a learning about oneself , but also in a sort of religious way . It is a highly recommended read in my opinion .
5 #### Have not read this yet , but looking forward to a great , classic read . The movie prompted me to want to read it all .
5 #### This is chronologically the first in the Narnia series , although it was not published first . I loved it . I had just seen the film The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe twice when I read this , but I definitely enjoyed the book on its own and ca n't wait to read the rest of the books . Plus it was so interesting to see the creation of Narnia and the special connection that humans have to it . I 'm a little confused why there are n't more humans in the Narnia of The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe since originally the king and queen were human ... I guess I 'll just have to keep reading . For more reviews , please visit my blog , CozyLittleBookJournal .
5 #### Classic children 's story that adults will love too . Your mind and your heart will be stimulated by this fine fantasy . My daughter at 34 still thinks its the best series she has ever read and we are raising a new generation of Narnian 's with the grandchildren . As CS Lewis once said " A children 's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children 's story in the slightest . " Do n't pass this one up !
5 #### We found out how much our grandsons enjoyed this series of books that we decided to read them ourselves . We ordered the single book to have all the stories in one book , nice for the adult reader in the family . C. S. Lewis , considered one of our greatest writers ; with his stories reaching every age group . Very entertaining stories and just the right amount of illustration . Nice to hold a real book in my hands too . I ordered a set of individual books for our grand - daughter after reading the first book . I 'm sure she will love them too . Oh the book was as advertised and arrived in great time and shape . Would order from this seller again .
5 #### It all starts when two children put on magical rings that bring them to a magical and extraordinary land . I liked this book because it 's very interesting . It is very easy to follow and read . I am a very big Chronicles of Narnia fan . If you like Lord of The Rings then you will like Chronicles of Narnia !
3 #### I absolutely love " The Chronicles of Narnia " by C.S. Lewis , but in this ultimate book of the series , he only delivered a mediocre story that is not deserving of the title " The Last Battle " . For one thing , there is not much of a battle going on , compared to several of the other books in the series . I would expect the Armageddon to be a little more dramatic than being thrown into a dark hut serving as a donkey 's stable . Although some reviewers are horrified at the treatment of Susan in this book , Lewis is merely expounding on his own theological beliefs , and its not quite as cold - blooded as it might appear to some people who are not familiar with certain Christian belief systems . I was a little more aghast at the now obvious racist overtones in his descriptions of the Calormene enemy . I think the author , if he were alive , would gladly allow an edited version to be released that was not so obviously prejudiced . I am sure C.S. Lewis was a great guy , but sadly , just a product of his times ; as we all are .
5 #### These are masterpieces of their genre . They are very readable . I got a boxed set when I was in high school , and read every single book . They are far deeper than the Christian symbolism some would say . Study the last book very carefully- he is talking about something Thomas Banyacya , the Hopi elder , talks about , a time when only those whose hearts and heads are joined will survive . This series has influenced other books , notably&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Chronicles - of - Chrestomanci - Volume-1 - Charmed - Life - The - Lives - of - Christopher - Chant / dp/006447268X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Chronicles of Chrestomanci , Volume 1 : Charmed Life / The Lives of Christopher Chant</a > . It has portals , the other worlds of Quantum Mechanics , there 's quite a bit here , under a great story .
5 #### Although my mother complained about a too boring storyboard , I think it has an exciting story about the four kids and Prince Caspian .
3 #### Well the story is good , but the formatting is bad and hard to navigate . There can be more illustrations yo make the book more interesting
3 #### Well , it is a good start for Narnia but the story is a bit too boring . The improvement can be made by : 1 . ) More interesting story 2 . ) More details 3 . ) More adventures
4 #### " ... While The Magician 's Nephew is definitely one of the more understated of the series , I always enjoy reading it . It is n't lacking for adventure , though there are no battle scenes , and when the Talking Beasts of Narnia come about , there are a lot of funny moments involving them and Uncle Andrew . There are some nice morals for young readers , but not in a preachy kind of way . Again , it 's not quite as action - packed as some of the others in the series , this book is very captivating , and you really get a sense of it building up to the others ; having re - read it , I am eager to finish re - reading the rest of them !

5 #### This version of The Chronicles of Narnia is the only complete one I have found that publishes each book in the proper order .... as CS Lewis wanted it to be . Thus , instead of " The Lion , Witch and Wardrobe " being first ( as most publishers suggest ) , it is " The Magician 's Nephew " which comes first . This is the book which explains how Narnia actually came into existence . The chronology is correct and there are many questions answered as the rest of the books are read . Not only that , but the pictures are beautiful and appeal to a child 's first reading of the series .... or an adult 's seventh reading .
5 #### Love this book ! You get all the book of The Chronicles of Narnia in one book ! Very easy to read , and very compelling for avary age . It 's a book for all the family not just for children ! I had never read it before and i love it ! I will read it to my nephews .
3 #### very small amount of audia , 1 page per chapter which I think is too little and still call it an audiobook .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia has been a favorite of mine for years now . It 's brilliant , fast - paced , adventurous , dangerous , classic , breathtaking , awe - inspiring , and at times , laugh out loud funny . This is a timeless series that anyone can enjoy , no matter how old - or young - you are .
5 #### I love these Chronicles , and have read them numerous times . Reading as an adult I 'm even more captivated than I was as a child . C. S. Lewis is amazing !
5 #### The Magician 's Nephew takes place in an old small town in England in a small house Digory is living with his aunt and uncle while his mother is deathly sick . He is outside and he meets poll who loves advancer . Poll asks Digory to explore this old house . To get this house you have go this little whole in the wall . So the get to this house and who do the meet Andrew his uncle . So he ask poll to try on this ring then she is gone . Now Digory has gone on this big advancer to try to save poll and his home . I think this book was real good it answers most my questions . By Bridgett E
5 #### I had always heard about the chronicles of Narnia . I had a few hours , so I downloaded this onto my kindle and enjoyed the read . I liked the way C. S. Lewis made the unbelievable seem like " could this be possible " I , also , like the way he enlighten on the correlation of " we love the goodness of the lion if we have goodness in us , but it we do not have goodness in us then the Lion is something to fear for he is exposing our worst to us and we do not like this . "
5 #### I thoroughly enjoyed the three motion pictures , and I decided to start reading the series . I have chosen to read the books chronologically because I felt that I would n't run the risk of spoiler alerts . I just finished The Magician 's Nephew ( 2:40am 3/19/2012 ) , and I must say that for all of my scientific beliefs that it was a moving experience indeed . Clearly a religious book , The Magician 's Nephew traces the creation of Narnia at the paws of Aslan , told via the travels of Digory & Polly , two English children who discover magical rings that allow them special means of translocation . The short book is full of uplifting and inspiring sayings , and I turned the final page feeling better for having read it . Not only is this a great book because it gives added information to fill in the gaps , it is also an inspirational book . Highly recommended .
5 #### Hardcover : $ 16.99 Through this enchanted painting , Edmund and Lucy , accompanied by their unwilling and unpleasant cousin Eustace , once again enter the magical world of Narnia . Once aboard the magnificent ship " Dawn Treader " , Edmund and Lucy are reunited with their old friends Caspian , the young king , and Reepicheep , the daring mouse . They embark on a noble voyage , to find the seven lords of Narnia who were banished during the dark rule of Caspian 's evil uncle Miraz . Unforeseeable adventures and dangers await them as they sail farther and farther from charted waters toward the " utter East " that Reepicheep has dreamed of since his youth . It is there he hopes to find the mysterious home of Aslan , the majestic Lion and King and Lord of all Narnia . ( From the dust jacket ) Book 5 248 pages 16 chapters
5 #### We are pleased to have this Narnia book set for our home library . The story has been enjoyed by our family . We recommend it to other families interested in this series .
5 #### Living in London with his dying mother , young Digory befriends Polly next door . When his selfish Uncle Arthur tricks them into going to another world , they inadvertently bring a cruel witch to London and then find themselves at the birth of a new land called Narnia , where Digory will suffer the most agonizing test of his life . Although not the first Narnia tale Lewis wrote , it tells the tale of how Narnia came to be , as well as being an engrossing story in its own right , with charming color illustrations . Technically written for children , and suitable for most young people ( the Witch may trigger nightmares in very sensitive little ones ) , the beautiful characterization and layered plot lines provide plenty to enthrall adults as well .
4 #### Seven books in one volume ? Is it worth it ? My answer is yes , but mainly for the price savings . I purchased this new copy for under five dollars . If I purchased each book on it 's own it would have been more for each book . Even the Kindle version was eight bucks each . This version has 768 pages but if you pick up the box set each book has over two hundred pages making it over 1500 pages long . How did they do it ? By using very small print . Kids may not mind but at my age , even with the reading glasses , it 's a bit of a struggle . My six year old is enjoying it so it 's worth the headache I get . The cover is nice and the original artwork dispersed within the book adds a nice touch . If you are going to get this copy of The Chronicles of Narnia I highly suggest spending a few dollars more and getting the hardcover version . At 768 pages in a paperback form it 's not going to last long and it 's harder to hold . As for the order of the books ; read them however you like but this book has them in C.S. Lewis 's preferred chronological order . If I were to do a review on the novels I would give them five stars . If you 're looking for book to read to your children , it does n't get much better then this . Enjoy .
5 #### At one point I could n't put down this book ; finished it and found that it was already 2 in the morning . Then I read it again a number of times . It was the emotional connection I had with the story that hooked me . I ca n't go into detail because of spoilers , but suffice to way that this book is a fitting close to the series . The characters are raw and the plot epic . It also felt like I was being readied for something .
5 #### This one is a little different from the other books because it seems rather episodic in style . But that 's understandable , seeing as they are voyaging from one island to the next . The overall impact is still a satisfying one : true adventure and glory , all the quirks of people included . The ending is worth the read .
5 #### Lewis creates a believably desperate situation in this 4th installment of the Chronicles of Narnia . A situation most people can relate to , because it speaks of the treachery of men gradually choking out the magic in our lives . Ever felt that way about your life ? Read this book .
5 #### It may have been CS Lewis who said that if you ca n't explain a concept to your grandma , you have n't mastered it yet . In this book , CS Lewis masterfully expresses his vision of our origins and the happy Creator . This book pulls you into that happiness . :-) Yet it is n't a naive fairy tale , lingering about is a familiar , relatable evil . An excellent beginning to the Chronicles of Narnia . I suggest starting here , then working your way chronologically through the books .
5 #### Actor , director , producer , Shakespearean scholar Kenneth Branagh brings his melodic voice and its gently inspirational interpretation to bear upon this rather excellent audio production of C.S. Lewis 's ' The Magician 's Nephew . ' Branagh genuinely possesses one the most pleasant and inviting voices to listen to any story , let alone this fascinating prequel to ' The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . ' One need not be a child to experience the fertile imaginary scenarios that are drawn and colored here . This work is highly recommended .
5 #### I have wanted to finish reading this collection for over 30 years . Just could not find the time , nor the desire to take the time . This set solved that for me , and makes it much easier to revisit .
3 #### Lewis does a good job when he writes the passage where the children do n't all see the lion the same time , only the youngest does and then the next youngest ... and that the older children sometimes do n't believe the younger for petty reasons . But , at many other times , the general reader seems to suffer because Lewis is writing for children , and his analogies often suffer from oversimplification . One of Lewis 's early failings is that he tries to make too much hay out of his talking animal analogy . All religions have their miracles , and some are said to have happened relatively recently . This does not mean that all reports of miracles are true , or that everything in the bible without exception was meant to be taken literally . But there are other flaws . Prominently , at the end of this book , Lewis , falls prey to the sloppy writing habits concomittant to most serials . Out of seemingly nowhere , he adds a long list of nameless and faceless , one - dimensional characters and quickly condemns them . What he does n't do is write anything about them that would make us believe that they have souls . Among them , a bunch of mischevious schoolboys suddenly turn into swines , and Lewis is the Circe who transforms them . There 's no charity here : he is condemning children , in mass , without us even meeting them . This is not the Christian spirit , and the oversimplification present in his analogy is often galling .
5 #### I think this book was the 2nd audio book I 've ever listened to and it spoiled me forever ! The way it 's done is fantastic , almost like you are watching a film . Each character in the story is read by a different actor , the music score is outstanding , the narrator does a great job . I wish I can find other audio books this good ... suggestions anyone ?
5 #### Great books for young people to read and having the entire set is a plus . Bought as a gift for older Grandkids and they have enjoyed reading the series . Packaged arrived well within the alloted time frame and was very well packaged . Very nice set of books , thanks Amazon . Ellen P.
5 #### Lucy , Edmond , Susan , and Peter had returned safely to England after their visit to their uncle 's house and then to Narnai through his wardrobe . And now the war 's over and they are back in school but desperately want to go back to Narnia . As they are waiting for a train to come a hole opens in the wall and when they go through it they recognizer the place as Narnia . But then they find the city of Care Paravel in ruins with only a few pillars and some of their old things left . It had been hundreds of years in Narnia but only one year in our time since they had ruled Narnia . Only their journy they meet Tumkin and Prince Caspian and they all work together with the help of other Narnian 's to gain back Caspian 's throne from his evil uncle who is destroying Narnia . In the end Aslan comes and helps them , but he tells Susan and Peter that this is their last time in Narnia because they are too old , but Edmond and Lucy will be able to come back sometimes soon . I really liked this book . The first one , The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe is still my favorite but I like this one too . Originally posted on 3 Book Bees Blog
4 #### This review is for the ENHANCED KINDLE EDITION . I was afraid that this would n't be the full book , but it is . Even better , for those with iPads , etc , it has a wonderful seven minute movie summary , just perfect for younger kids , and it includes EXCERPTS in audio from each chapter , read in a wonderful British voice . The key point is that these are excerpts , so do not expect the entire book to be an audiobook . If you have the right equipment , I highly recommend this version over the other kindle edition !
5 #### The enhanced Kindle book is really neat , with embedded audio that goes along with each chapter . It 's a good value for the price since you get an eBook and an audio book . Note , this seems to be specifically designed for iPhones / iPads and I do n't know how it will work on other devices .
5 #### Our son requested this boxed set of The Chronicles of Narnia for our grandson . Our grandson was delighted . Thanks to Amazon the gift set arrived in plenty of time for Christmas & in good condition . We can always count on Amazon .
5 #### The books came in a timely manner . The price was great . They were brand new and excellent condition . My grandson was very happy with his new book .
5 #### I bought this book for my husband who had read all the books in the series as a child . It shipped quickly and looked like new . I quickly got into it and read the entire series before handing it over to him . A great book , excellent condition , and will be enjoyable to read to our children when they get a little older , which was part of the plan , too . Thanks for the service !
3 #### Did not see the package " open " in the add - too quickly decided to get it - really wanted the volumes separate for a young reader . Beautiful book - but wish it had been stated as such .
4 #### Though the Chronicles of Narnia books are written as a fairytale for children they follows C. S. Lewis 's philosophy that , " A children 's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children 's story in the slightest . " * MILD SPOILERS * This is Narnia 's book of Revelation : the end of the world as we know it . It is a fitting conclusion to the series . There are interesting parallels with and departures from the biblical book of Revelation which keep you guessing where it is going next . It also means that you can expect a lot of death and sorrow before the end , so this may not be suitable for some young , sensitive children . I do have mixed feelings about this final book in the series from a doctrinal / theological point of view . What bothers me is that at one point Lewis indulges in blatant pluralism , or at least radical inclusivism ( salvation through sincerely following any religion , even if that includes rejecting Christ ) with the character Emeth . This is far outside the mostly - orthodox Christianity that underlies the rest of the series ( and contradicts e.g. John 3:16 - 18 ) . On the flip - side , portraying all but one of the dark - skinned people as opposed to Aslan and all that is good comes off as a bit racist . Balancing out the disappointing bits is Lewis ' description of the joys of heaven . It is absolutely beautiful ( if a bit Platonic ) and far surpasses the silly / boring notion of sitting around on clouds and strumming harps for all of eternity .
5 #### Though the Chronicles of Narnia books are written as a fairytale for children they follows C. S. Lewis 's philosophy that , " A children 's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children 's story in the slightest . " This book is currently numbered as the first in the series , because it describes the creation of Narnia . It was originally book # 6 and in that order read like an interesting prequel once you are already well - acquainted with Narnia and its history ( think : Star Wars Episode I ) . It works either way , but " The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe " was written first and clearly intended as an introduction to Narnia ( e.g. " None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than you do " ) . As such , I personally prefer to read in Lewis 's original order , but it 's ultimately a matter of personal preference . Though children from our world are the main characters in this ( and other ) Narnia stories , the true hero is Aslan , The Great Lion and Son of the Emperor - Over - the - Sea . Aslan is clearly a Christ character and each book , besides being a fun fantasy story , explores a different aspect of His character . In this book He is revealed as Creator .

Aslan is clearly a Christ character and each book , besides being a fun fantasy story , explores a different aspect of His character . In this third book ( by Lewis 's original numbering ) of the Chronicles of Narnia , C. S. Lewis reveals Aslan as the one who guides and renews . This book which details a voyage across the sea to unknown lands is more episodic than his other books ( think Homer 's " Odyssey " ) . I can never settle on which of the Narnia books is my favorite , but this one is always close to the top of the list .

This second book ( according to Lewis 's original numbering ) reveals Aslan as the one who provides help , though not necessarily in the way we might expect .
5 #### The prequel to The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe , this tells of how the wardrobe was made and what all happened to its owner when he was the age of the young kids in LWW . A wonderful story , albeit not QUITE good for young kids .
5 #### This was purchased as a gift and I thought the price was most reasonable . I got it and was VERY PLEASED . I 'm sure the recipient will love this set of the Chronicles of Narnia and I 'm proud to present it .
3 #### The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is without a doubt an incredible story , but Derek Jacobi 's narration of it does not do it justice . Though definitely gifted in Shakespearean roles , he does not seem comfortable reading children 's literature and did not sound quite natural in his interpretation of " Voyage . " His rendition of Reepicheep was particularly grating on the ears !
5 #### I have seen the three movies and now have read the 7 books . Their not too long . I was surprised how little war is in the books , much less than the movies . Great story and a good price for the set .
5 #### I got this book to replace one in my collection which had been lost . I remain a fan of C. S. Lewis , and of his friend , J.R.R. Tolkien . They both wrote about Man and Nature and Evil and Good , with different aged audiences in mind . They both used Fantasy , which ' helps make the medicine go down ' .
5 #### What a grand adventure The Magician 's Nephew turned out to be ! I do love a book that is well written and the language here is top notch . While it is not a terribly long book , I did find myself going back to re - read passages because of descriptions and honestly , I did not want to leave this adventure right away . Mr. Lewis , you have put a spell on me with your words and story telling . It has been a long time indeed that I have had this much fun reading children 's literature .
4 #### The Magician 's Nephew is the story of Narnia 's creation and , as all the stories do , is full of Biblical allegory and inspirational aphorism . In it we learn how the White Witch comes to Narnia , where the lamp post comes from and how the Wardrobe came into being . Of the Narnia series , it is perhaps my very favourite . Especially as I did not read it first ( it was not the first written ) and got to experience the joy of piecing the puzzle together . As with all the stories , I find that they mean something entirely different to me now , as an adult , then they did when I read them as a child . Well worth reading and re - reading . They never get old .
1 #### I bought this because I wanted all of these wonderful stories in one volume . The books are great , this is not a review of them , as they are some of the best fantasy stories of all time and I highly recommend reading them . However , this particular volume was described as being a " new " product and it did not look new to me . The front cover had a deep crease near the binding that caused the entire cover to be shifted over and did not cover the pages fully . The lower right corner of the cover also had a folded crease . I was unsure about returning it after I discovered these things beacuse I really wanted this complete volume and the coverart is really lovely . But as I turned the pages I noticed ink blotches . There were not just a few and they were not small . There were dozens of them on many of the pages . I found this completely unacceptable for a book termed ( and PRICED ) as new , so I returned it . I would recommend the books , but perhaps not this particular product due to the many issues my copy had .
5 #### These books are great . This is a great value to get all of the books in one volume . C.S. Lewis is a wonderful writer . Enjoy !
5 #### I read this book years ago , but I love it as much , maybe even more now than I did then . This , I would have to say , is my favorite book in the whole Narnia series . I wo n't spoil it for anyone , but my favorite character would have to be the magician 's nephew ... If you like good books or your children like good books , I strongly suggest you / they read it . Prepare to fall in love with yet another of C.S.Lewis ' books !
5 #### I bought this for my 10yr . old daughter who proceeded to read it in a little over a week . The life lessons in these books as well as the spiritual values are refreshing when most of the books aimed at our children today are centered around glorifying vampires , witches , zombies and such .
5 #### This series was put out by the BBC . It is not read by one person but acted by several persons . The music is good and the story is wonderful . Well worth the cost and the time spent listening
5 #### this is a great book and if you spend a lot of time in your car this is good because you can enjoy the book while you drive
5 #### I read this book when I was ten and fell in love with C.S. Lewis and his chronicles of Narnia ! I loved it then , and I love it now !
5 #### I first read this series back in high school . I enjoyed it as much now a I did then . A must read for readers of all ages .

5 #### I ordered this inexpensive , yet " like new " copy of C. S. Lewis , The Last Battle . I was very pleased when I received a copy that appeared never to have been used . It was pristine ! Nice deal , to say the least .
3 #### I find that many books written for younger readers can appeal to adults as well - especially in the fantasy genre . This one does not cross that bridge so well . But hey , my kids will probably like it .
5 #### I really like the book , although I thought it was going to be broken down into multiple books . Not seller 's fault , but it is too heavy for me to hold . Very good condition .
5 #### I first read this book as a child and just recently listened to it as a book on CD . As an adult , the wonder and magic of this story is just as present as when I was a child . In fact , it is more so as I understand more of the nuances of the story now than I did back then . I recommend this book for children of all ages ( and adults , too ) , especially if you are just starting the series . I think that reading this book first helps you understand everything else that happens in the series much better .
2 #### First time I 'd read the book almost to the end , I was thrilled . The stories were surprising and imaginative . However , now I know that in the ending book of the Chronicle , author C. S. Lewis gives dubious teachings that totally contradict with the Bible . Being wiser in this regard , I could n't recommend this book to any Christians , neither children nor adults . The book , made by this so - called Christian preacher , claims in the last book ( The final battle of Narnia ) that Aslan ( there are clear references to Jesus throughout the Chronicles ) and " Tars " ( some other " god " ) are the same . Here 's the translation of that claim ( chapter 15 , my translation from the Finnish version ): " My child , all that you 've made to serve Tars , I take it as your service to me " . So it clearly states that believing in any other god is the same as believing in Jesus Christ and His Father . So Lewis totally opposes to the message of the Bible and the Gospels . What 's more , this claim is intentionally in the book : my friend has told me about " the pastor " Lewis 's teachings that are in line with this uncomprehensible distortion of the Word .

5 #### I read the book to m y 8 year old , a chapter or two a night and we love it . We are actually on the second book in the set and we love the suspense , the characters , the story and the life lessons . My son and I enjoy the time together , enjoy trying to guess the next move and just talk about the story in general , trying to see the application in real life .
1 #### Nothing wrong with the content , it 's classic , but the book material is ultra low end for a hard back : light hardback cover , super - thin paper ( basically transparent ) , spine has no reinforced cloth strip , spine glued with no stitching . Dust cover okay . Do n't bother buying the hardback from this publisher . I ca n't see it standing up to much more wear than a paperback , which this book will get no doubt . Totally disgruntled . I like the cover art though .

5 #### Somehow I missed out on these wonderful tales as a child of the fifties . What a treat now to sit and read with sheer delight this imaginitive master piece of C S Lewis . Thanks to Amazon I am discovering many wonderful books I somehow was too busy to read in earlier times . A must to reread to my grandkids . I have also gotten out of print books as well as the best sellers of today .
5 #### This book is incredible . beuatiful description and wondrous symbols . this has it all . recommend this to kids age ten to age sixteen . It may sound a little young for a siteen year old . takeit from someone who rea narnia as a teen . its not . this book very sad however . and for a smaller child it may easily scare . the battle is very bloody . though one must imagine the fight . which allows a larger audience . i ca nt knock it anywhere in fact . i just wish lewishad rewritten narnia for adults as well . mabye somebody will one of these days . may The sword Rhindon ever flash in our hearts !
5 #### C.S. Lewis ' writing is a treasure , and this book includes all of the volumes of The Chronicles of Narnia . Newly popular with the advent of the movies , the books are amazing on their own and well worth a read by children or adults !
5 #### If you enjoy reading The Chronicles of Narnia , you will enjoy listening to it even more . The actors and actresses that lend their voices to reading each book are wonderful ! I would highly recommend it
5 #### All 7 books are amazing , and there 's not much more to add to the many great reviews . " Voyage of the Dawn Treader " has always been my personal favorite , but honestly they 're all good . However , I just want to suggest quite strongly that you read these books in the order they were written / published and not in this new order . " The Horse and His Boy " and " The Magician 's Nephew " are both more meaningful after you are already quite familiar with Narnia . Even the new order is rather odd , but do n't bother , read them as such : The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe Prince Caspian Voyage of the Dawn Treader The Silver Chair The Horse and his Boy The Magician 's Nephew The Last Battle
5 #### While the lit ' people will yalp about orders of books they miss what moke this the most lovely of the books . It is the greation book . John 1 did n't meen much until I read this book . Then I read what The Word and Being In and With The Word was . The words are not his best , but what they say is of the Holy Ghost .
5 #### Read these over 30 years ago , loved them then and now . Interesting to read them in a different order . Classic fantasy for all ages .
5 #### A lot of the more negative reviews have mentioned that the books are out of order . Although , yes , the order is not the original written order of the books , C.S. Lewis asked , after he had finished writing all of the Narnia books , to have the order changed to this " new " order . The publishers are merely doing what the author requested . You can still read them in the old order if you like . I enjoyed this series very much ! A classic for children and adults ! Very highly recommended ! Even if you have seen the movies , you still must read these ! They are wonderful and quite different from the films . There are 7 books total , each somewhere around 200 - 250 pages , with occasional pictures .
5 #### I 'll just say what everyone else has said . This book is absolutely beautiful ; it feels and looks much more expensive than it is . I 'm not sure about the whole " leather bound " thing , because it does n't really seem like leather . I 'm not really worried about that , though . The one thing I do n't like is that it 's has the different books in chronological order instead of the order in which they were published . I know this is a great controversy among Narnia fans , but I prefer the order that Lewis wrote them in . Enjoy !
5 #### My daughter is 8 and we decided to start reading the Chronicles of Narnia . We read this first and I 'm so glad we did . So far it is my favorite ( we have 3 more to read ) . It was funny and exciting .
5 #### I read all the books when I was a kid , and re - read them all as an adult after the first movie came out . I prefer the original order that Lewis wrote them in . But in the box set , you can order them however you wish . I understand the argument to put them in chronological order , but it 's kind of like going through the Star Wars trilogy and then the Star Wars prequel trilogy . If you go through them chronologically , instead of how they were released ( in both cases ) you as the reader are aware of things that you would n't be by reading them in the order they were released . For instance , if you read " Magician 's Newphew " first , you know a lot about both the professor , and the White Witch ( as well as the nature of magic , the wardrobe , the lamp post , and Narnia itself ) that you would not if you started with " Lion , Witch & The Wardrobe " . All of the books are great reads . The stories on the face of them , are great fantasy filled with heroics and wonderful magic . The stories imagery is deeper than that of course . Though not truth themselves , they are vivid depictions of the truth , a sort of divine imagination . The new movies do fairly decent justice to the books , but as always , the books are better .
4 #### Prior to this year I had only read The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe from the Narnia series . I 've seen the movies with my kids , but never finished reading the remaining 6 books . When I finally decided as a adult that it was time to read the complete chronicles , I started from the beginning with the Magician 's Nephew . This book feels a little dark compared to the story ( LWW ) I was most familiar with . It explains how Narnia came to exist , how humans were able to enter the world , and perhaps most crucial - how evil was able to enter Narnia . This becomes the basis for all future events within the series . While all of the books in the series are able to be read alone as individual stories , I would highly recommend taking the time to read the series from the beginning and in order . It becomes something larger and more meaningful as a whole than what it is in pieces . There really is a bigger picture , which is something I think we miss when we focus only on our favorite elements .
5 #### This is the third book in the series that I have bought . I like the reader and it is enjoyable to listen to . The whole series is a family favorite .
5 #### This is a great collection , I like the fact that each book is seperate and with the original art work . These books are a classic and I 'm glad to have them , I will be able to read them to my son so he can enjoy them too .
5 #### It has been almost forever since I first read the CS Lewis classics , and it is because of that series I read as a child that he has been my lifelong favorite author . If you like the other six , there is no way you will not enjoy The Last Battle . My only advice is , do n't start with this book . Start with The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe or The Magician 's Nephew . If you have read all the others in the series , you ca n't go wrong with this book .
5 #### This boxed set of classics tales of Narnia was intended as a gift and my son and his family were very pleased to receive it .
5 #### Narnia is a mysterious , magical world , stocked with mythical creatures , talking animals , and symbolism . Lewis was a master storyteller , and these tales are ones a reader never forgets . A must read for all ages .
5 #### This audio book is great . As a homeschool mom I find it to be a wonderful source of educational entertainment .
5 #### Any potential reader of The Chronicles of Narnia will already be familiar with the great reputation of these books , and there is very little I can add to the material already widely available . I can merely recommend this text to any person , particularly children and " grown - up " readers of children 's literature , who had n't read these books to do so as soon as possible ( preferably curled up in bed with some ovaltine or hot chocolate in hand on a still and rainy evening ) . Certainly this collection is very well bound , the texture of the paper and the vivid colouring of Baynes ' beloved illustrations makes these books some of the most beautiful ( and not to mention affordable ) copies of C. S. Lewis ' books available .
5 #### Prince Caspian is another great installment in the Chronicles of Narnia . C.S. Lewis is an amazing writer and story teller , and this book proves to be no exception . I really like that Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy are back in this book as the main characters . I enjoyed reading about the Pevensie children rediscover Narnia . About 1,000 years have passed since they ruled Narnia , so Narnia looks a but different . I loved how Aslan revealed himself to the children one by one showing that the others should just believe . Narnia is such a magical world that I think anyone can enjoy reading about . I know I will reread these books in the future , and when I have kids I will read this lovely series to them as well .
5 #### The Magician 's Nephew is a lovely start to the Chronicles of Narnia . In this book , Lewis explains how the world of Narnia came to be . It was fun to read about Polly and Digory 's adventures to different worlds . I like how it was explained how the wardrobe came to be along with how the White Witch came to be in Narnia . If you have not read this book , I definitely recommend that you do . It is an exceptional classic . The story is amazing and beautiful . People of all ages will enjoy this book , I think . It has something for everyone .
5 #### This is the complete Narnia collection read by Kenneth Branaugh and other great English actors . An excellent way to hear the Narnia tales in order beginning with " The Magician 's Nephew , " which precedes " The Lion , Witch and Wardrobe . " I recommend it highly .
5 #### I purchased this edition because I wanted a hard copy ( not a paperback version ) and this is a very beautiful edition . My book arrived before it was promised , well packed and in perfect condition .
5 #### This one - volume hardback version of the complete Chronicles of Narnia is beautifully conceived . It includes all seven books with the original illustrations graciously colored and set on an elegant background . Although it may be a bit heavey for small hands to hold and is not as easily carried , it is perfect for a parent or grandparent to read with a beloved child . The stories themselves are among the best ever told .
5 #### What more is to be said about this than what the other reviewers have already said ? My only real comment is that I do n't buy the link between this and Christianity . I think that 's people wanting to make a connection between the author and the book .
4 #### This book was on my Grandson 's Santa list . He was thrilled . I bought myself one too ; so I could read it and talk to him about it .
5 #### I bought this for my sister in law and she totally loves this ! Ca nt stop talking about it .. super thick book ! Really good price as well !
4 #### Love the stories , but did n't read the product description closely enough . The books are bound together into one large book , so awkward to carry around . I would prefer separate books . It 's also in the " new " order . C.S. Lewis had " The Lion , the witch and the wardrobe " as the first book ( when the children first enter Narnia ) . When his nephew took over , the nephew changed the order and put the " Magician 's nephew " as the first book ( when the animals first receive the gift of speech ) along with a couple of other changes . I prefer the original order .
5 #### These books are amazing and they are so worth their price . The pictures look great and its so nice to have the whole series in a little box to keep them all together ! Great product and was received in a timely matter right before the holidays .
5 #### I bought this for my son as part of his book collection . I first read these when I was in 5th grade and loved them . My husband and I both had boxed sets , but they are worn out now because of use . We read them to our children as they were growing up and they could n't get enough .
5 #### I 'm not going to review the book content or stories themselves here . If you are looking at the 7 book collection of the Narnia series , you already know this is a timeless masterpiece by C.S. Lewis for children and adults . What I will review here is the beautiful publishing quality of this particular set . Each book is printed on heavy , high gloss extremely high quality paper . The print quality is superb and easy on the eyes and the color illustrations are numerous and well done . While paperback , the covers are sturdy and the book spines appear to be well manufactured to last a long time , a must as I 'm sure my kids will be reading these over and over . In a publishing world where so much is made cheaply and meant to be disposable , these buck the trend and are well made to last and to be treasured .
5 #### I have to say that this book is extremely awesome ! ! Sometimes throughout the book it gets a little strange but of course that is the wonder of Narnia . If you happen to get a little bored throughout the book just hold on and wait for the end . The end is just amazing . Anyone who says Aslan is not a type of Christ obviously has n't read the evidence . The end really shows the symbolism of Aslan .
5 #### This is a terrific book and cd set . The stories are vividly told and inspirational . This is a most appreciated gift besides and read again and again set of books . I would highly recommend to anyone .
5 #### Unlike the earlier accounts of NARNIA being entered through a closet , this one has NARNIA entered ( and then left ) through a picture of a ship at sea . WWII is still going on , but coming to an end . The boy Eustace has a rationalistic outlook , scorning the existence of NARNIA and , even after entering it , long disbelieving what he was experiencing . He complains about everything , and supposes that everyone around him is crazy or something . There are fascinating scenes of storms at sea , invisible monsters , a search for special swords , and a reunion with Aztlan , the beloved salvific lion . The movie seems to be alluding to the invisible role of Jesus Christ , and fellow Christians , in discouraging Christians from sinning . When Lucy is tempted to acquire extreme beauty in return for following the Evil , Aztlan ( representing Jesus Christ ) appears to her and warns her . When one of the young men is tempted to acquire major political power by consorting with the Evil , a fellow of the crew discourages him . But when the unbelieving Eustace comes across gold , he gives in into a temptation , and becomes a dragon . How will he be returned to human ? There is a moving reunion with Aztlan , in which he praises the NARNIA characters for their moral choices . This seems to parallel the reunion of dead Christians with the Lord , who rewards them for their good deeds .
5 #### While the plot of this book may not be as cohesive as other books in the Narnia series , the scenes are mental eye - candy that seem primed to explode onto a movie screen . Mysterious characters create a sense of wonder and splash elements of the bizarre into the story . Yet it is returning characters Lucy , Edmund , and Prince Caspian carry the story of a remarkable journey . While " Dawn Treader " may lack a villain , it is the story of a journey and challenges faced on that journey . With storylines that mirror elements of Christianity , it is a reflection of the journey many people are traveling . The story begins with Lucy , Edmund , and Cousin Eustace catching the journey already in progress . Caspian and his crew are seeking the seven lost lords of Narnia . New lands reveal new fates , and add a new dimensions to the plot . While the change in Eustace may be a predictable part of the journey , it is still amusing to read . Other surprises may catch the reader off guard . Though the book stretches the boundaries of fiction at times , the C.S. Lewis closes the story nicely . The ending is particularly pleasant for those that had trouble wrapping their brains around certain scenes . " Voyage of the Dawn Treader " is a worthy addition to " Narnia " for which I hope the movie does justice .
5 #### The Voyage of The Dawn Treader is a classic sea story comparable to Homer 's Odyssey . It starts shortly after where Prince Caspian ends , and we encounter both ferocious sea serpents and harsh opinionated humans , yet unconditional love triumphs over all . Most fascinating of all is Reepicheep the valiant mouse who bravely encounters and befriends a dragon - his natural enemy ! We see the imperfections in Caspian and Lucy and are reminded that they are every bit as human as are we . Best of all , it is a delightful read . I enjoy taking Voyage of the Dawn Treader to the beach and read it while listening to the waves ! As the movie is being released soon , I believe it wise to read the book first , or right after . The Voyage of the Dawn Treader belongs on the bookshelves of those who wish to sail into a delightful saga of the sea.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Prince - Caspian - the - chronicles - of - narnia - movie - images - inside / dp/0061231134 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Prince Caspian the chronicles of narnia ( movie images inside)</a><a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Lion - the - Witch - and - the - Wardrobe - Movie - Tie - in - Edition - rack - Narnia / dp/0060765488 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe Movie Tie - in Edition ( rack ) ( Narnia)</a><a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/THE - SILVER - CHAIR / dp/0007296185 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">THE SILVER CHAIR</a><a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Last - Battle - The - Chronicles - of - Narnia - Book-7 / dp/0064409414 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Last Battle ( The Chronicles of Narnia , Book 7)</a >
3 #### I have searched high and low and discovered that the Chronicles of Narnia can not longer be obtained in their original publication order which is far superior than the current order . Even Lewis ' writing within implies that the first book should be the LWW NOT MN , for in the LWW he suggests that Aslan the Lion has never before been encountered , but if the order reverts to the current one , then this statement rings hollow since Aslan was previously encountered in MN . Reading MN gives too much away about the magical wardrobe and other things when such things are more satisfying learned much later as Book 6 instead of Book 1 . For this reason , I will not purchase a modern set because they all are numbered according to the latter order and not the original publication order . For this reason I give it three stars instead of five .
4 #### I read " Lion etc " as a child but never read the other Narnia books . I just re - read " Lion " with my 7 year old and then we could n't wait to dive into " Magicians Nephew . " There is some discussion over which book should be read first . I am glad that we read " Lion " first - it makes it more fun to read " Nephew . " Anyway , we loved it ! Hoping a film is in the works ...
1 #### I 've always loved the Chronicles , as well as CSL 's other writings , even though I consider myself an atheist . The thing about CSL 's writing is - it 's funny ! In my opinion his observations of human nature are gentle , humorous , and NOT preachy , although he is a christian . The reason why this edition gets a " negative star " rating is because there are at least two changes in this new edition . Why would you change an author 's published words ? I guess to correspond with the movies , even though I seriously doubt that the thousands of kids who read these books in the original form were traumatized .
5 #### This volume is solidly bound and has a magical feel , just like the stories inside . Pauline Baynes ' illustration from the Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe is embossed on the outside . In fact , the new 60th anniversary edition of the entire Chronicles of Narnia is exactly the same as this volume . If you love these stories , get this book and rediscover them .
5 #### I was delighted to get this complete collection of the Chronicles of Narnia in chronological order with the full color , original illustrations . As a child all I had read were the individual paperbacks checked out from a library . I have already written separate reviews for the Magician 's Nephew(chronologically first)and The Horse and His Boy(my favorite ) . In The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe(chronologically second)four British children discover Narnia " where it is always winter , but never Christmas . " I think this is the most allegorical of all the chronicles . Read a Christmas story like no other -- redemption on an epic scale . The Horse and His Boy comes next -- the action occurs during the timeframe of the Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . Next in time sequence is Prince Caspian . A rightful prince , only a boy leads an uprising of the Old Narnians , believed to only exist in myth ; and wrests the kingdom back from his usurping uncle . Then comes the Voyage of the Dawn Treader . King Caspian is now a young man on a quest to explore the far reaches of his kingdom . Find out who turns into a dragon . After that comes The Silver Chair . Two children find and rescue King Caspian 's son from his long enchantment . Can you trust the beautiful lady ? The final book is The Last Battle . Narnia is corrupted with lies and subjected to slavery . Who is really behind the evil ? How will it all end ? Where is Aslan ?
5 #### How would you like to be related to a professor everyone thinks is a little mad ? Digory is not so sure when he finds out that his uncle is using him and Polly the neighbor girl as guinea pigs for an experiment . Go with Digory and experience the creation of a perfect world . But beware a serpent has entered the world under a different guise . Will Digory and Polly ever make it home again to London ? This fantasy is a good value , you get three worlds not just one:)Be sure to read The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe the next book chronologically in the series .
5 #### I purchased this just so I could " read " the entire Narnia stories and compare it to the movies . The audio quality is great and I liked that they changed " readers " on every book . It kept it interesting . The stories themselves are " okay" ... I do not think the are " timeless classics " . If you thought the movies were " okay " , then you will think the same of the stories here . The movies follow the books fairly well . If you loved the movies , you will really enjoy the books .
5 #### We took a family vacation with our two young boys and listened to three entire stories during the hours and hours we spent on the road . My boys LOVED these stories ! The actors do such an amazing job at making each character come to life . Kenneth Brannaugh was a favorite of ours . I would encourage anyone with small children to buy this set , especially for long drives .
5 #### I love this style of book , its durable and has good pictures and a great story .
5 #### As another reviewer pointed out , this is meant to be the second in the series . This edition is the one I had ( and still have ) as a child . Not quite as gripping as The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe , but C.S. Lewis is a genius . Interesting fairy tale on its own , even more interesting to delve deeper and find the religious meaning and symbolism .
5 #### This is a classic in every sense of the word . It may not be as detailed as " The Lord of the Rings , " the work by Lewis ' friend , J.R.R. Tolkien , but they are just as good in my opinion . The fact that it is written so simply in order for young readers to understand also makes it appealing for adult readers too . It allows the reader to imagine the world of Narnia and its inhabitants , making it all the more real and accessible . In fact , each one of the seven tales is so good that I ca n't really claim to have a favorite , only judged them based on how well they work . In that sense , " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " is the strongest of the stories while " The SIlver Chair , " is the weakest . In short , this is a book that can be enjoyed at all ages and would also be a great way to ease young children away from short picture books and into larger novelizations . In fact , I think I will read these stories to my kids .
5 #### VERY IMPORTANT to understand this is book number six in the series and is NOT the complete chronicles of narnia . This is also not a book club book or a libary bound book or even a paperback . Orginal MSRP in 1955 was $ 7.95 , Book states number line in every book if it does nt its a lower quality BCE ( Book Club Edition ) and believe me you DONT want those book by the " peoples book club " as the glue dries out they fall apart FAST .... Little review of the book now : A wonderful book in the series , well writen like all the other works by C.S Lewis . Easy to read for younger adults I would say ages 10 on , maybe younger but for sure age 10 or 3rd or 4th grade level . This book does have some pictures but is n't a " picture book " . Regardless of my view , pick it up and have the little ones read and read some more books .
1 #### Promised a set of 7 and only 2 arrived . The books were for a child who would have been excited to own and read the whole serries , now we are both disappointed .
5 #### As a long - time ( 32 - year ) fan of the Chronicles , at first I doubted whether an audiobook could compete with the written word . But this is more than another audiobook , it is radio theater , with multiple actors , sound effects and music . The stories are amazingly well done . And I like this voice of Aslan ( done by David Suchet ) better in almost all places than what the recent movies use ( Liam Neeson ) . These stories almost perfectly adhere to the original , unlike the movies , which deviate wildly and end up blurring some of the major themes . And you 'll never find a better bargain : 19 CDs , running 21 hours , for about $ 25 . Clearly profit was not the motive behind this production , again unlike the movies . I give the set away as gifts and try to get the word out what a special treasure these are .
5 #### Product came in excellent condition . Enjoyed reading the adventures of the children . Had not read the other books before other than " The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe " and thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the adventures . I am going to pass the boxed set down to my grandchildren as I know they will enjoy them also .
5 #### this book is a classic for all children hungry for an adventure . I know that there was a movie i thought that the book was a * * * * * star and the movie a * * * * star .
5 #### The voyage of the Dawn Treader is a heartwarming story . it is about Lucy and Edmund along wth there cousin and Caspian . But for the rest of the book you need to read the adventurous and loving middle to the end . but in the end it does say that two very important People(A king and queen ) must never come back . but understand this if you read the rest of the book then you will know that Asln said " this is not the last time you see me . it will be the last time in narnia where you see me . but in another world you must learn my diffrent name and side of me ........
5 #### I really love this set of books . I had " The Chronicles of Narnia " in one heavy book which was hard to handle . This set separates the books into individual parts that I can carry with me , one at a time . They are light - weight and easy to hold . It 's a wonderful addition to my library .
4 #### My husband reads this one to the girls a lot . It has all the the stories , but we do n't read the last one because everybody dies and he has weird ideas about the afterlife . But a good collection to read outloud otherwise . A chapter a night seems about right .
5 #### This book was purchased as part of a grant fulfillment by Kappa Delta Pi - Eta Theta Chapter of Brooklyn College . This book was included in our annual read - aloud and book give - away at Sesame Flyers in Brooklyn . The children were thrilled with the books !
5 #### I was surprised that all of the books were here and the print was large enough to read . Not a book to take on a trip with limited space because it is rather large , but a great book to have around the house or on road trips .
5 #### My kids are reading and enjoying this series already . It comes in a very nice hard copy box set .
5 #### Being a new parent , I 'm so excited to have such a treasure for our book collection as this ! The stories are great teaching tools , and I love having all of the books in one big volume with full color illustrations . It is certainly a book that will be read over and over for many years to come .
5 #### I highly recommend this set for readers of all ages . I 'm a ' mature ' reader and I found them highly interesting and well written . Early teens could read them , and I think younger readers would like to hear them read . A classic .
3 #### I enjoyed reading The Magician 's Nephew , it cleared up a lot of things about the creation of Narnia and interesting information about some of the characters . Looking forward to read the rest of the books in the Chronicles of Narnia .
4 #### The Voyage of the Dawn Treader takes the reader back into the world of Narnia , the ocean east of Narnia anyway . We meet Prince Caspian on a sea voyage to the East in search of seven noble men who , having been sent there by Caspian 's now deceased evil uncle , Miraz , never returned . Lucy and Edmond along with a new character to the Chronicles , their cousin , Eustice , sail along for the ride . Along the way they encounter lands with mysterious inhabitants , dangerous creatures , and staggering beauty . I found this episode of the Chronicles of Narnia to be one of my favorites so far . The return of Edmund , Lucy , Caspian , and especially Reepicheep is a welcome reunion . The new human character here adds both humor and depth to the story and I enjoyed the development of this character . The Christian allegory continues strongly here with many scenes which will no doubt stick in my mind for a long time to come . The ending is especially good . The illustrations were thankfully included in the Kindle copy and of good quality . I recommend this book for any who seek a way to Lewis ' magical world .
4 #### In this the fourth book in the Chronicles of Narnia , the four children from The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe return to the magical land of Narnia to find things greatly changed from the way they left them . A young king is on the run from his uncle who seeks to usurp the throne and the four children , who are kings and queens of Narnia themselves must battle a new foe and restore Old Narnia . The Christian allegory is quite strong in this book as it is with others . I found it a joy myself to return to Narnia after some time away . The new characters are quite fun . This story is better than the book previous ( A Horse and His Boy ) with good action and progresses the history of Narnia . I enjoyed this one enough to jump straight into the next one , The Voyage of the Dawn Treader . I was reading the Kindle version and was very pleased to see that the illustrations were included and of good quality . Recommended .
5 #### The following comments are for the CD audio book version of " The Chronicles of Narnia " by C.S. Lewis . This audio book collection consists of 19 CD 's with a total playtime of approximately 22 hours . Focus on the Family Radio Theatre has undertaken to record the seven Narnia books . The end product is a masterwork of audio dramatization . These books are brought to life with a cast of over one hundred actors , an original orchestral score , and cinema - quality digital sound design . Each CD is indexed into numbered tracks of 10 to 14 minuets lengths . The audio quality is uniformly excellent . This listener found all actors to be fine speakers whose clear pronunciation and moderate pacing a pleasure to listen too . The British accents added to the pleasure of my listening experience . At first I thought I would be overwhelmed with all the fanfares , sound effects and the multiple voices . After all I was use to one individual reading out loud a novel , clearly articulated but just a voice . I soon found these dramatizations uniformly excellent and enjoyable . I wish I had this set when my children were pre - teens then I would have another reason for listening to this set again . On minor negative comment : I was not happy with the packaging of this set of 19CD 's They are housed in a tri - fold LP size binder . It takes up a lot of room and it is a chore to remove the disk .
5 #### In this , the fifth book of The Chronicles Of Narnia , Lucy and Edmund have returned to Narnia without Susan and Peter , who are now too old . Their cousin , Eustace , considered obnoxious by everyone except his parents , is brought along with them , although he is fond of telling them that Narnia and Asland do not exist and are just a figment of their imaginations . They arrive to find that King Caspian has decided to take a voyage on his royal ship , the Dawn Treader . He plans to sail to the end of the world and find out what lies there and along the way . He has pledged to determine the fate of the seven lords , friends of his father , who went on expedition when Caspian was a child and then never returned . Lucy , Edmund and Eustace accompany Caspian , along with other characters the reader has met in previous books of the Chronicles . The company encounters many strange lands and people . There is the Land Where Dreams Come True , the Land of Deathwater , the Land of the Dufflepods , and the land where three of the lords are found to have been asleep for years . The reader is drawn along on the adventure , interested to hear what will befall the company next . At the end of the book , Caspian returns to Narnia , while the children return to their world . This book is recommended for readers of all ages , and is especially recommended for families to read together .
5 #### It 's a great buy and kids LOVE IT . I 'm a reverend and watch the things I buy for her ... this was a winner !
5 #### If you 've never delved into C.S Lewis ' great fiction stories then here is the place to start . This particular edition has less illustrations as it is the adult edition . I do n't know why people think that adults do n't like pictures when they watch so much TV ! Wonderful stories that will take you into another world and maybe make you think as well .
1 #### You may not have minded this as a kid , but coming back to it as an adult , it 's painfully obvious that " The Magician 's Nephew " is the point at which the Narnia series jumped the shark . The White Witch comes back to turn - of - the - century London and does nothing more than commandeer a carriage ? Come on . Everything was going fine until I got to chapter three ( " The Wood Between the Worlds " ) in which the author states that the planet Jupiter has a single moon : " he saw Jupiter quite close -- close enough to see its moon . " I was unable to read any further . I mean , what an idiot . Any schoolboy knows that there are at least 63 Jovian satellites . Check Wikipedia if you do n't believe me .

5 #### There are certain books you have to read when you 're young . You can come to them when you 're older , of course , but it 'll simply be impossible for you to lose yourself in the illusion . Things will seem silly and obvious , whereas the same thing , to a child 's imagination , will enchant him in spells of wonder and mystery . I 'm thinking here of books like the " Oz " books and Harry Potter . Then there are books that you must be mature to read ; if you 're not , they 'll strike you as dull , tedious , and confusing . I 'm thinking , say , of the Earthsea cycle . But the most excellent aspect of C. S. Lewis 's Narnia tales is that they can happily service both : kids can read them with wonder , and adults will find deep lessons here too . Very well done .
5 #### I recently ready the " Chronicles if Narnia " . As a child I had read " The Lion Witch and the Wardrobe " for school and remember it being a good story . After the movie came out it made me want to read the entire book . When I set out to do this I did n't know what to expect but what I found was a world where right and wrong , good and bad were explained using terms that we all could identify with . Ideas and thoughts that made sense for young and old . And most of all a captivating world where all these things take place . In a world where animals talk and there was good and bad . This is a book I will read again and someday read to my children as I feel that there are lessons to be learned by all in the writing of this childrens book !
5 #### Love this version of Magician 's Nephew done by BBC Radio . Great accents add to the drama .
5 #### when i was 9 i tried this book and i thought it was boring . but when i became ten , i picked it up again and i thought it was awesome ! ! ! this is a great book !
5 #### This is a single - volume edition . I have another single volume edition , an import from the U.K.:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Chronicles - of - Narnia / dp/0007117302 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Chronicles of Narnia</a > , but this one is much nicer . That one is a flimsy paperback , but this one is a classy job : bound in raised leather with gilt edges and a silken placekeeper . ( It features all the well - known illustrations by Pauline Baynes . ) Everybody notices and loves the binding . It also reproduces the Chronicles in reading order , so that means " The Magician 's Nephew " first . At the end , there is also an excerpt from a kind of Narnia dictionary , " Beyond the Wardrobe : The Official Guide to Narnia , " which is here represented by about 30 pages of character descriptions and commentary on the themes . There are no footnotes anywhere in the book . This was published by Barnes and Noble , intended for the discount bins in their stores , which is where I found it . It 's certainly most elegant and durable edition I have , so I consider it to have been quite a bargain indeed . I have only two complaints : 1 . Maybe I 'm just getting old , but the print seems uncomfortably small . 2 . It was n't well edited : once every 20 pages or so , there 'll be a glaring typographical error .
5 #### Wonderful book ! Wonderful Kindle version ! Wonderful experience all around ! I greatly enjoyed reading this book . I first read The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe wayyyy back in 6th grade . I decided that , with my new Kindle and cheap access ( only [ ... ] ! ) to each book in this series , it would be a great thing to read all of . Well , I just finished The Magician 's Nephew last night ( after reading the last 3/4 at 1 am ...... ) and could not be happier with my purchase ! The formatting is wonderful , and I think the cover looks spectacular on the Kindle ! The table of contents is great , the pictures ( although they can be a little bit difficult to see on the small screen-- but still certainly good ! ) look nice on the Kindle , and the essence of the book was not lost in transfer from print to electronics . Amazing book . Amazing Kindle Version . A+ ! Now if only all Kindle books were this nice ...
1 #### My parents got me a box set of Lion Witch & Wardrobe books as a child . I read through the first one and found it nominally interesting , but not something that I would pick out on my own ( I already knew the story from animated versions ) . I think I may have read half of the second one eventually . I was a heavy reader and followed lots of series type books , but in this case the plot did n't really flow for me . I think I MAY have heard something about a biblical connexion , but did n't think on that that much . It was only since a few years ago that I looked back at the books and saw how glaring the connexions were , and how the awkwardness with which a story was crafted to match biblical myth was the very thing that made it uninteresting to me .
4 #### I was looking for nicely illustrated , hardback Narnia books . I was a bit disappointed to find that while the artwork is in color , it is tiny . In fact , it could n't be much smaller or you 'd never be able to see any details at all . fortunately , my four year old is really good at just sitting and listening to someone read to her , so she 's enjoying the books , anyway .
5 #### I was given a set of * The Chronicles of Narnia * as a gift when I was about 13 , and they were my introduction into the world of fantasy novels . I consider them the greatest fantasy writing even now , 35 years later . C.S. Lewis wrote these absorbing tales over 50 years ago , yet they remain as fresh as ever and as appealing to adults as to young people . Part of the reason for this ( besides the plots themselves ) is that Lewis avoided the pitfalls a lot of later fantasy writers fall into , e.g. , preoccupation with the details of spell - weaving / magic , hordes of supernumerary characters , drawn - out plots , and over - written scenery . Lewis tells just enough to let the reader 's imagination take hold and create his / her own images , while keeping the cast of characters in each book manageable and interesting . The world he creates is unique unto itself , not the pseudo - medieval or spiritual - realm derivatives many fantasy writers fall back on . Younger readers will enjoy the stories as " fairy tales " ( as Lewis referred to them ) , while adults will find a positive spiritual message that is not , however , preachy . These books are a great value because you will reread them and always get something new from them as well as enjoying the characters who come to seem like familiar friends . They make a great gift for others or for yourself !
5 #### This is the last book in the series The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe . This is my fave book in the series . In this book the world of Narnia ends and Aslan brings the characters to a beautiful new world . These books are worth reading regardless of your age or religious preference .
5 #### The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a fantasy adventure story set in the land of Narnia . We embark upon a voyage of discovery and danger with Price Caspian , Lucy , Edmund and the mouse Reepicheep . One of the distinct pleasure of reading this book is how the author , with economy of words , transports us as a passenger on the Dawn Treader - " when they turned aft to the cabin and supper , and saw the whole western sky lit up with an immense crimson sunset , and felt the quiver of the ship , and tasted the salt on their lips , and thought of unknown lands on the eastern rim of the world , Lucy felt that she was almost too happy to speak " . A word of warning to new readers your enjoyment of this story will be greatly enhanced if your read the Narnia books " The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe " and Price Caspian " before the " Dawn Treader " . As an adult reader of fantasy I can , without reservation , recommend this novel to all age groups . I surmise that many adults pass on the Narnia books because they " appear " to be written for pre - teens . The continuous popularity of the Narnia books long after the passing of Lewis and well before the recent films suggest to this reader that these books were intended for all age groups .
5 #### It was a purchase to encourage my granddaughter to read . She enjoyed the books even though she had a set . These were newer and had prettier covers , she said .
4 #### This is yet another top notch audio production . All the Narnia books have been converted to audio with great music and voice actors , and this one is no different - Highly recommended . The story itself makes one laugh at the movie that came out and how different is was , but one can also understand that a lot of what happens in Prince Caspian could be removed as being labeled " filler " . Nevertheless this is an enjoyable story and is the only story that contains all the four children as a main focus from the original " The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe " . This is the second time they enter Narnia and they have been called back by Prince Caspian using Queen Susan 's horn which she was carrying and lost at the end of " The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe . " Prince Caspian 's lives in a world where humans have taken over Narnia and the talking animals and beasts are now just legend , and legend that is not encouraged throughout this new realm . Prince Caspian is the rightful Heir , but his uncle is wielding the throne after Caspian 's father 's death . And once he has a son , Caspian is doomed and must flee , and he flees to find the old Narnians and take back Narnia for the old Narnians . This story tells of that and how the old Narnians battle to win back Narnia . It 's a good story , not one of my favorites in the Narnia series , but still good nevertheless .
5 #### This is a wonderful third book within the series of the Chronicles ; a lovely story with nuanced religious messages . Even those that are not Christian will appreciate the journey of discovery of the children and the beauty of Lewis 's message . As for this audio version , it is wonderfully read . I however , enjoy the movie version voice for the mouse , which is deeper and more stately . The reader speaks the mouse part as a higher voice indicative of the smaller animal . Wonderful for long trips with children , a car or subway ride . Beautiful tale !
2 #### Political correctness strikes again at Scholastic . Book 7 ( The Last Battle ) is the most obviously evangelical book , so Scholastic left it out . Otherwise , a reasonably well done version of one of the greatest fiction series ever written . I 'd stick with the 1976 version or the recent one . They 've got all the books , and the books themselves are better built .
5 #### I would categorize this series as a " Must Read " for any fantasy / adventure fan . This was one of the first books I picked up in the fantasy genre , and it inspired me to not only read more fanasy but in my own writing . C. S. Lewis is a master at telling an old tale through a new lens . This series is not just for children . If you are scepticle , give them a try and I believe you will be pleasantly surprised . If you enjoyed the latest movies that are out ( The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe / Prince Caspian ) , you will enjoy reading them all . For the Christian reader , these books will give you that little tug on your heart that you feel when you come across something good . This is definately a " Must Read " for you too . I recomend reading them to your children as bed time stories . Best wishes and better adventures , KC
5 #### The books of Narnia are wonderful , I bought and made an excellent choice ! The stories are great , and very easy to read and understand .
2 #### I suppose I was quite sad with the end of this book . It did n't really seem to have much purpose other than to end everthing in a most depressing way . I happen to be an atheist , but I do n't mind reading literature like this if its done well , but this is not . The book just seemed kind of empty . Really nothing like the Silver Chair , which I thought was a lot of fun to read or even Voyage of the Dawn Treader , which had a very allegorical ending , but I thought it was done quite well . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * SPOILER * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * With this book , there was yet ANOTHER war , and then everything goes away . And why would you kill all but one young girl . What a terrible way to end the story . I 'm really offended that there was only 1 darker skinned person who made it to Aslan 's kindom . Maybe it was just the Narnia part of Aslan 's Kingdom and other people were allowed in the other sections . But even so you could only find one " good muslim " in all of Narnia . I 'm going to give Lewis a bit of a pass because of the time this was written , but even so I doubt I would read this to my young children . Its not appropriate for my children , who will be black , or any other race I think .
1 #### I kinda liked the first movie of the series . Kinda . I thought it strange that children should be given weapons to go to bloody battles . Anyway , since the vast majority of books are much better than their corresponding movies , I decided to give the Narnia books a go . But the first book in this compilation is not " The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe " , is " The Magician 's Nephew " and maybe that was part of my disapointment . Maybe not . What is important is that I did not like " The Magician 's Nephew " and therefore could not go on reading . It is really a shame , they should not have altered the original order .
3 #### Edmund and Lucy Pevensie return to the magical land of Narnia in the company of their disagreeable cousin Eustace . They accompany Caspian on a voyage to find the loyal noblemen who were exiled by his evil uncle . This installment of C.S. Lewis 's series is rather episodic , as our voyagers sail from one adventure to another , so your appreciation of it is bound to be colored by how much you enjoy the individual episodes . While some , such as Eustace 's encounter with the dragon , are very interesting , most did not appeal to me very much , and I felt the book suffers from the lack of a unifying dilemma . One very strong aspect of the novel , however , is the development of Eustace 's character as he grows more self - aware .
5 #### These books were a present from my husband . My paperback copies have been read so many times they were falling apart . These books are much sturdier then my paperback set . I was also surprised to find more illustrations in these hardbound books then in my old paperback books . The books are lovely and I look forward to a lifetime of enjoying them .
4 #### These books are all short and easy to read . They are not exactly pretty to have on your book shelf either . With that said these books are great for all ages . I 'm 23 and read all 7 books and enjoyed them all . I would recomend these books to anyone .
3 #### I am very happy that I have finally received my Chronicles of Narnia Box Set . There is only one issue that I have . I was under the understanding that this was the 1994 print edition , but it is really the 2008 print edition . I just hope that when you purchase this box set that you do not think that it is the 1994 print edition , but you will really be receiving the 2008 print edition .
5 #### This is the entire collection of the Narnia series . What an incredible set of books . Fictional characters have challenges that they must each overcome . Many stories in these books are based on Christian Values . I love the books and frequently recommend them to others .
4 #### The book arrived on time as advertised , and in good shape , as advertised . I would not hesitate to order from this vendor in the future .
5 #### I had to read this for class . The author CS Lewis wrote books of fiction and nonfiction that deal with moral and religious themes and reflect his Christian faith . He wrote a fictional series about the land of Narnia and I was n't sure I would like it since I 'm not usually into children 's books or fairytales . I like only some fantasy . I 'm not one of these people who jumped on the Harry Potter bandwagon . But I read that Lewis was good friends with Tolkien , whose " The Lord of the Rings " I pretty much enjoyed , so I was hoping this would be good too . And it was . It 's about these kids who fight an evil witch with the help of a lion to save the creatures of Narnia . Sounds a bit like the " Wizard of Oz " , does n't it ? Anyhow , it 's an unforgettable story of heroism and an allegory of good vs. evil . It was first published in 1950 and is still very popular today .
3 #### I was pretty excited to start reading this book to my 9 year old daughter . We have seen the movies , so the only book in this series that captured our attention was the magician 's nephew . My sister said that she read it to her kids who range in age from 15 - 2 years , and they loved it . ( shrug ) Maybe it is just because we started The Chronicles of Narnia just after we finished the FableHaven series , which was awesome !
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis is one of the definitive works of children 's fantasy literature that still influences the imagination of our present culture . Lewis , one of the great Christian thinkers of the past century , was a contemporary of J.R.R. Tolkien and together they formed a literary discussion group called The Inklings , meeting at the University of Oxford , England in the 1930 's to 1940 's . This superlative fantasy begins when the Pevensies , a family of British children , stumble upon the doorway to a magical world called Narnia , wherein they are called upon to oppose evil forces . The world is populated with dryads , unicorns , and large talking Beasts as well as humans , and the ruler of this world is Aslan , the great lion . The interaction of Narnia with our world is developed throughout the series as more magical doors open for the Pevensies and other children , just when they are needed most . The series is an allegory of the Christian Gospel , wherein Aslan represents Jesus . However , it has become a classic in its own right because of its excellent writing and outstanding imaginative qualities . Narnia has had a resounding impact on the fantasy of today , and there is still a lively discussion among scholars and other thinkers about the profound themes of Lewis 's vision .
5 #### I 'm pleased with this box set . The books have a high quality look and feel to them , and you can tell they are made to last .
4 #### Have read it many times . My daughter is finally of age that she will sit and listen - paying attention to the details and trying to follow the story . So I am joyfully sharing these stories with her , now .
5 #### This book tells the story of how Narnia was created , how the White Witch came to be , and at the end , it tells why the wardrobe is made and what it 's made out of . Very quick , very good read .
4 #### Love the stories . Started reading it too our children . The eight year old loves it but the 6yr old found it a little bit too much and somewhat scary . For children would be better to read the abbreviated versions .
4 #### I bought this set as a gift for a relative . It arrived quickly , in good shape , and was exactly as advertised . I 'm very pleased with the purchase . Now , I just need to borrow the books from my nephews and read them myself - they look interesting .
5 #### I love the original edition of Prince Caspian with the illustrations by Pauline Baynes . The pictures are in color , and the pages are quite thick ( great for younger children ) . The CD 's are the icing on the cake .
5 #### Items arrived in a timely manner in the conition described . My daughter was very excited . All was fine from ordering to delivery ! No problems .
4 #### C.S. Lewis 's final book in the Narnia series , The Last Battle , bring Peter , Lucy and Edmund , now aged , together with new characters to save Narnia , then see its end . Will this be the way of our world ? Read it and consider the possibilities .
5 #### I 'm 26 years old and I enjoyed these books so much ! They were great ! ! ! The background seemed to be written from the bible with all kinds of imagery to support it . I thought it was just beautiful ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I recently ordered&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Complete - Chronicles - of - Narnia / dp/0060281375 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Complete Chronicles of Narnia</a > , which has full color illustrations and maps . It is a beautiful book , arrived here safely , and is in great condition . I highly recommend this book to Narnia lovers anywhere .
4 #### For being a brand new book , it was a little " rough " around the edges , but I still was very pleased . I thought the shipping was fast and the seller was very friendly !
5 #### This is a wonderful set of books all included in one volume . All seven of the Chronicle of Narnia books are inside , arranged in the order the author originaly intended . The print was clear and easy to read , paper was regular weight , ( not like tissue paper like some lower priced books are printed on ) , and was well worth the money . This hardcover set was less expensive than some paperback sets of individual books cost . It takes up a smaller amount of space on my bookshelf and will last much longer than the paperback ones will last . Great set from a prompt , careful seller ! I would purchase it again from the same seller if I wanted another copy for a gift .
5 #### CS Lewis ' Chronicles of Narnia ( the entire series , not just the best known " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " ) is a thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking read for children and adults . My husband & I have enjoyed reading them together and are happy to see that our 2 daughters ' imaginations are wrapping around these so - real characters and fantastic stories . We are all developing stronger moral characters in ourselves , and really having a great time at it , thanks to CS Lewis !
4 #### The only problem I had with this was that there were those annoying " Now a major motion picture " emblems on all the books . I know really that 's not a big problem but I could have used so forewarning .
5 #### As a teacher and a book lover , the Chronicles of Narnia are one of the best series of books ever written . There was morals , actions , values , great vocabulary , descriptive detail , and more . If you look at children 's chapter books written today there is too much " sheltering " and lack of intelligence in them . Books of the past used to make kids think a lot more !
5 #### The Pevensie children are summoned back to Narnia thousands of years after the end of their reign to provide aid to Prince Caspian , who has allied himself with the talking animals of Old Narnia to unseat the cruel uncle that has usurped his throne . C.S. Lewis delivers more lessons derived from the Bible in this volume of his Christian parable , most notably the necessity of faith in keeping believers from wandering off the true path . In light of the foreign misadventures of our recent administration , I was most touched by the aspects of the story that touched on ethical conduct in times of war . Peter challenges the evil King Miraz to personal combat to avoid mass casualties ( if only our own leaders could resolve conflicts in this way ) . At one point , some of Caspian 's followers try to summon the spirit of the White Witch to aid them , but the Pevensies put a stop to that . They -- and Lewis -- understood that going to the " dark side " out of expediency is a sure path to losing one 's own soul . Lessons aside , Lewis delivers as a storyteller , as well . This is an imaginative , fast - paced fantasy and a worthy addition to the series .
5 #### To all the parents out there , every child should read this wonderful boxed set . Beautifully packaged and fun right from the very beginning . The stories have all the morals that every child should learn .
5 #### We are enjoying the most wonderful time with our grandchildren reading these books . We are reading more and watching TV less . They now want to be read to . How exciting !
5 #### I started reading the Chronicles of Narnia Boxed Set a few weeks ago after watching the second Narnia movie . I have decided that , even though the movies were both well done , the books are better . I do hope that movies of the other books will be made . The books are entertaining and do n't get bogged down with never - ending battles like the movie versions do . I recommend the books to all age groups ( I 'm a senior ) and have enjoyed reading some of the reviews of the series along with finding out more about C. S. Lewis .
4 #### My journey through Narnia continued with this second novel in the series . I thoroughly enjoyed Prince Caspian and found it to be an even better book than The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . Part of that may stem from the fact that this story had less to do with discovering Narnia and more about the magic and events taking place there . Another wonderful book and I look forward to reading the next when I come to it .
5 #### I had just purchased this box set for my daughter . I was so pleased with the quality and production of the box set I bought another for my sister and one for myself . This brought back all the pleasure of when I first read the books myself . Its a real pleasure now to sit back and enjoy as the stories are read by professionals such as Michael York , Lynn Redgrave and Patrick Stewart .
4 #### These books are filled with many adventures of the Pevensie children . My favroite was A Horse and His Boy . Some books are hard to get into , but I am not much of a reader . Even so , I finished the series in two weeks . You may have to explain dialouge w / younger children . Also a few pages had smuged ink or small portion of the words missing .
5 #### This is by far the best book set I have ever owned in all my years . Man , woman , and child can all appreciate it . I bought this particular set for some friends of mine who have some kindergarten aged kids , just learning how to read . These books are FANTASTIC for " story time , " and a great motivator when you 're encouraging kids to read on their own . Great product , and the tie - in to the movie series got the kids immediately excited .
5 #### This was a favorite book in our family so we bought it as a Christmas gift for several people this year . Recommended reading for kids and adults .
5 #### I received the set about a week ago and am already in the forth book . I enjoyed the two movies and am enjoying the series . I received the set in almost perfect condition ( was listed as very good ) . I plan on giving this set to my neice when she gets a little older . She is only six at the time and enjoyed the first movie but has not seen the second movie yet .
5 #### My youngest son and his wife recommended I read The Chronicles of Narnia . I 'd hoped to receive it as a Christmas gift . I did n't , so I bought it for myself . I got a great deal from Amazon.com . The hardcover book arrived quickly and in perfect condition . I am just finishing another series of books and am so looking forward to reading this book . I much prefer all 7 books combined in one .
5 #### If you , like I , have read your Narnia books to pieces , thn this is a great replacement volume -- or a wonderful gift to give to introduce someone to the world of Narnia . I 'd especially recommend it to parents who spend time each night reading to their children -- you will have the whole set at hand , and the children can be kept interested for quite a while ! The text is easy to read , and the illustrations capture the people places and " feel " of Narnia well , giving children ( and adults ! ) a face to go with a name etc . WELL worth it ! ! ! Should you want to introduce Christianity to your kids , or to someone else , this volume also gives a wonderfully gentle way to do that as well .
5 #### Chronicles of Narnia are a wonderful set of stories about what Christ can do for us in times of great turmoil and troubles . I recommend this to all parents as a great way to share with their children , young and old .
5 #### Seller was very prompt in sending my book , Chronicles of Narnia . It is in great shape , just like new . I was very happy with the service and would definitely buy from this seller again .
5 #### In this book , two children , Polly Plummer and Digory , embark on a series of adventures into other worlds after first becoming friends in London where Polly lives in a row house . Digory lives with his aunt and rather strange uncle , staying there while his father is off in India . The uncle tricks the children into using rings to visit other worlds , but as a result of these explorations serious complications result . In one world the Digory awakens a cruel and evil queen , Jadis , who had destroyed her world and now seeks other realms in which to exert power . Ultimately she exploits the children and eventually arrives at Narnia as it is being created to become the evil counterpart to Aslan , the great lion .
5 #### In order to get the intended story of Narnia read them in their theatrical release . At first , i must admitt , that i was confused as to why " they " ( movie people and such)would release the 2nd book within the series , The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe , before the first , The Magician 's Nephew , but afterward i thought of the order into which i was introduced to Narnia . My 2nd grade teacher first read LWW ( # 2 ) to us & then Prince Caspian ( PC,#4 ) and so on with the stories containing Lucy and Edmund . Only THEN is it time to see the creation of Narnia , the importance of the lampost and other seemingly insignificant elements . So i would say that the correct ( or less confusing & complicated ) order of reading would be 1 : LWW ( # 2 ) ; 2 : PC ( # 4 ) ; 3 : VDT ( # 5 ) ; 4 : SC ( # 6 ) ; 5 . HHB ( # 3 ) ; 6 . MN ( # 1 ) 7 . LB ( # 7 )
5 #### This is well - written , fun fantasy with a message ( though not a preachy one ) . Enjoyable for middle schoolers and adults , grab something hot to drink and curl up for a fun escape . This is one of those books the movie does n't spoil . The characters are memorable and believable .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia series has been a favorite of mine since childhood ... expertly written , incredibly original and overall a delight to read for kids and adults alike . I love everything about these books !
4 #### Having completely worn out three sets of the Narnia books , I saw this one and thought " Hmmmm ... Hardbound , all together ... what could be bad ? " It 's missing many of the wonderful Pauline Baynes illustrations that are inextricably part of my own Narnia experience , and it 's too big to be purse - stickable . Other than those factors , the prose is the same , and it 's a good Narnia collection to keep on the shelf .
5 #### These books are a must read for people of all ages . These books are an excellent way , especially for children , to introduce or become introduced to the ideas Christianity . In addition to that , they are excellent sources of entertainment . They are very fun to read and once you pick them up you will probably find them very hard to put down . Wonderful books to read for yourself or fantastic to give as gifts . There are n't enough good things I can say about these books .
4 #### I was looking for a set of the Chronicles of Narnia for my 10 year old grandson . This was what I wanted . thank you
5 #### " The Complete Chronicles of Narnia CD " set is one of my favorite all time purchases for my family ! This is truly a bargain at this price for so many hours of quality entertainment that is safe for all ages . All seven of the The Chronicles of Narnia series are included ( The Magician 's nephew ; The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ; The Horse and His Boy ; Prince Caspian ; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ; The Silver Chair ; and The Last Battle ) . The writings of C.S. Lewis are firmly in realm of classic literature and , whether or not you choose to dwell on the obvious religious overtones , the story telling transcends the critics who would ban or promote these tales based solely on theological imagery . The production quality of the CDs and recordings is of the highest standards and I expect this set to last us many years . Highly recommend !
5 #### This is not particularly a review of The Voyage of The Dawn Treader plot or story line . Plot synopsis of this book can be found in many other places . My purpose here is to review this audio version . I am in the process of reading The Chronicles Of Narnia to my children , we are immensely enjoying the experience . Recently I started to read this to my kids at bedtime . We were enjoying it , but it seemed to be taking a long time to finish . A fairly lengthy car journey was coming up so I decided to get the audio version read by Derek Jacobi . I thought I had been doing a pretty good job of reading this book aloud , until that is I heard Mr Jacobi 's version . His narration is absolutely perfect . The changes in voice , tenor , pitch and accent were so seamless and convincing that it really was hard to believe that only one person was reading . My son 's comment that " even the boring bits are exciting , with this reader " is very true . This was a wonderful and memorable way to experience this classic " must read " book . When our car trip was over there was still a little bit left of the book , but no one wanted to go back to me reading it ... , not even me . Highly Recomended .
5 #### It 's a classic , and now that they are making movies off the book it is even more popular . I wo n't go into detail , many readers already have . You wo n't regret buying this book .
5 #### If you have n't read these books , you are missing something very special ! ! I have always admired C.S. Lewis and his writing ..... but , after reading the Narnia books , I have even more respect for him and awe for his genius ! I LOVED these books ! !
5 #### My favorite books and my favorite author -- C.S. Lewis . The stories are about life , living to the fullest , and about the Author of life . I never tire of reading the stories and I learn something new each time I read them about compassion , forgiveness , and redemption .
5 #### It was a very enjoyable read ! I did n't want to put the book down . I would have liked to have seen a little more interaction between Caspian and Peter , and a more detailed battle sequence at the end .
5 #### This item arrived in great condition and as described . They came in good time , as well .
5 #### If the description and picture on this item is at all accurate , this is indeed the published order set ... This is the first Narnia set my parents bought me when I was young and I 've read the covers off it -- and sadly I 've not been able to find a good hardcover set published in Lewis ' original publishing order . All the book publishing companies seem to think chronological order is necessary . If you are looking for the original order - this is it !
5 #### The books were in great condition when I received them . Being a bog fan of the movies I wan't to read the books . However they are defenitly written for children but are also worth your time if you still have a big imagination as an adult .
3 #### This book seems to have been written to give the classic " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " from the ' 40 's a history , but later ? C.S. Lewis continued to write about this alternate fantasy reality with the Christian overtones for seven books . I do n't rate this as one of the better ones , but they are all interesting mixes of magic , alternate worlds and Christian divine right of kings mythology . We have ordinary boys and girls on their summer/ vacation " adventures " become princes and princesses in Narnia where the horse and other animals talk . This story starts the sequence as the boy and the Lion Aslan create a new young world where Narnia is a kingdom . Time and space and laws on nature are different in these parallel worlds : Charn from where the witch comes is very old , Earth is between in age and Narnia 's world is new . I have to say that even the worst of these books is very well written and thought out by a master story teller .
4 #### I got this box set for my 7 year old daughter . As it turns out the whole family has enjoyed it . The stories are simple enough for a child to read and have enough symbolism for an adult to enjoy . We 've had great talks about the books we 've finished and race to get to those we 've yet to read . Your kids are much smarter than we think . My daughter has picked up on most of the symbolism and has great insights on the characters . Do n't expect the books to have great layers as the movies do . They 're written for children and enjoy them as a child would .
4 #### It has been a long while since I read the Magician 's Nephew for the first time . Nonetheless it came back to me to make the second time a even better experience . It is very well written and we enjoyed the creation of a new world and a beautiful world it was . This is a great book for all ages especially for those who enjoy magic . Anna del C.

4 #### Prince Caspian is one of the tales of The Chronicles of Narnia . It takes place after Peter , the high king and his siblings left the kingdom many years before . They returned to find animosity between the realms of prince Caspian and the magical creatures . A knight called Reepicheep that is a talking mouse , a dwarf and the cast off prince find themselves on the same side as the high king Peter and his siblings . After they learn to trust each other , they unite to bring peace to all races and the throne to his rightful heir . A great tale full of action . Anna del C.

4 #### The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the story of the two youngest Pevensie children and their very obnoxious cousin on their return to Narnia . Caspian , now King , had sailed to find the seven lords that his father sent on an adventure but had never come back . The children joined him and the Knight Reepicheep , who is a talking mouse , on the ship The Dawn Treader to new adventures . From the discovery of new lands and their perils , slavery , new species and the truth of what happened to the lords ... this book will keep you entranced and open your imagination to the outer most places . Great for anyone who enjoys traveling through CS Lewis ' imagination . Anna del C.

3 #### I 'm always torn on what rating to give the Narnia books . I think if you take the series as a whole , it is - in a way - better than the individual books . I did enjoy " The Last Battle " quite a lot ! And , unfortunately , took longer to read it than I would have liked ( which probably did n't help the flow of it ) . But , for the most part the good and the critiques are the same as always . The world of Narnia is beautiful ! Aslan is always magnificent ! What we learn of the characters is enjoyable , and often fun , and I end up feeling like they have become friends . The premises are always intriguing and filled with " right and wrong . " But , because all of this is so good , I 'm left wanting more ; more character development , more on the world , and the plot delved into further . The ending went on - just a tad - long , for the individual book , however if you consider it the ending for the entire series , I think it 's probably pretty accurate . If you have liked the other books in the series , then I 'm sure you 'll want to eventually read this one ! It is quite an interesting concept / plot , and the story makes some interesting points . And , of course , the world of Narnia is always worth visiting !
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia are a great way of helping children begin to understand a relationship , adventure , life and characteristics of Jesus Christ . They were written by a Christian man who knew Jesus personally and who was able to express Jesus ' personality in a way children could grasp . I love the imagination he uses and the character of Aslan . I love most of all the forgiveness Edmund receives and how Aslan sacrificed himself for Edmund . A great picture of our spiritual need as a human race as a whole ; our greatest need is forgiveness .
5 #### " The Voyage of the Dawn treader " may be my favorite book in the " Chronicles of Narnia " . Many of the other reviewers have made comparisons , however I see it a little differently . I am reminded of Swift 's " Gulliver 's travels " and its imagination and satire . Obviously , the Lewis has updated the satire and changed aspects of the story - but both have the same sense of adventure . Another added bonus to " Voyage of the Dawn Treader " is the humor . Several of the chapters are very , very funny . The land " of the invisible people " comes to mind as an especially funny section . In truth , Lewis has included all of the ingredients for a fine novel , humor , high adventure , coming of age , and moral decisions . The plot is nicely woven together and does n't seem to jump as much as " Prince Caspian " and some of the others , so in my opinion " Voyage " may also be the best written of the books in the series . Final tally - Humor " A " Adventure " A " Writing style " B+ " Overall - " A " - a very solid read and sure to be one of your child 's favorites !
5 #### These books are great and to have them all in one is even better . It starts off great and ends even better each chapter is better than the last !
5 #### I bought the set for my grandchildren . Before passing them on , I read the set to ensure it was safe for them to read . The bottom line is that this is a classic set and worth turning each page and reading each word . This is a set you could read to your children or read with your children enjoying each minute .
5 #### We had seen the movies and heard of the series but never read them . We decided to purchase the complete seris on CD for a trip and they are awesome . I recommend these books for anyone wanting a good family friendly story . These were never boring and they are filled with good lessons ; but not preachy .
5 #### In this last book in the Narnia Chronicles , even from the beginning , I felt this book was the end . And I really wished C.S. Lewis would have written more tales about Narnia . This book brought forth many emotions . I was angry that the monkey was making the lion suit . I was happy to see Jill be so brave and smart . I was sad to see the wood nymphs die , being chopped down . I wanted to cry when I read about who died . I felt a connection with all of the characters in some kind of way . But at the same time , I learned so many lessons . Even today , the themes in this book ring true . How some try to decieve in the name of God . How fear can grab hold of us and make us do things we do n't want to do . Also , how beliefs can change from when were children to when we become adults . I think this book was wonderful along with the entire series . It was so well worth my time to sit down and read about Aslan , and who he clearly represents in my own life , and the many characters that feared him , respected , and loved him . Thanks .
4 #### I saw the movie first , and I believe that was a mistake . Because once I sat down to read this book , I was expecting the movie to follow the book . I was , of course , wrong . To read this book , I believe you got to have somewhat of an open mind and be imaginative . The Kings and Queens come back , and they come back many years later . The last time they left Narnia , they were much older ... like young adults , and they come back in this book as children again . Narnia has changed and has changed for the worse . But the children , Prince Caspian , and the other Narnians fight to set things right . Aslan is not throughout the book , but shows up just in time . But I must admit that I was sad to read that Peter and Susan could not come back because they were too old , and the same time , I completely understood why . Overall , this was an excellent read , and C.S. Lewis writing is such a treasure . But this one was the book I liked the least out of all the books in the series . I guess the movie did ruin it for me . Thanks .
5 #### A favorite series since I was young , but seems to get better with age ! I find the lessons and characters erupting --like magic-- into my own life . Though generally considered Christian - based , it stands alone . The performances are all wonderful , but Kenneth Branagh is truly inspired in " The Magician 's Nephew " . He is a brilliant ( as the Brits would say ) story teller . It makes me laugh out loud just to think of his voices for the talking animals ( the bulldog , she elephant , leopard ... )
4 #### The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is not one of my favorite books , but I will admit that this book is stuffed with great adventure . And it kept my attention . It 's like you ca n't wait to see what they will see or go to next . C.S. Lewis brings back Lucy , Edmund and Prince Caspian , but also a new character name Eustace . If C.S. Lewis was trying to make the reader dislike Eustace , then he did a great job when it came to me . I did not like him at first , but Eustace develops as a character , and I did eventually change my mind about him . Every island they visited was different , and I really appreciated the fact that each island and each event was well written . Even little lessons are taught without really throwing it in your face . I have written before C.S. Lewis is an excellent story writer , and this book proves that again . I hope you enjoy the book like I did . Thanks .
5 #### C.S. Lewis , in my opinion , is an excellent story writer . This story is wonderfully written and full of captivating ideas . I liked the fact that the story takes its time , taking perfect moments to explain the characters and events . Some of the things I was glad to find out is where the Wardrobe came from , where the Queen came from . I even laughed at the Queen during some of her charades and understood immediately who she was . I was also glad to find out who the Professor was in the house of the 2nd book . Even the lamp post was explained . Even though , this book is geared towards young readers , I believe adults will find enjoyment in it , as well . It is a great book . Thanks .
5 #### This is the third set of Chronicles of Narnia that I have bought for my daughter over the years . She is 19 now and pregnant and has reread the series until the books fell apart . Now that she is about to have a child of her own she wanted another set to read to her baby . This series is truly a classic that will be read for generations to come .
5 #### I think of all the options available at Amazon , this is the most cost - effective . The only thing I recommend doing is to read the books in their original published sequence and not the chronological timeline . The reasons for reading this by chronology is simply thin -- despite what the book description may say at the back of this volume . Besides , you lose the mystery of discovering Narnia through the Wardrobe . There is a strong aspect of milieu - discovery within these stories . To read them by chronological order removes the sense of exploration . Besides , the chronological ordering destroys the otherwise continuous narrative of the Pevensie children and -- to a degree -- destroys the 4th wall . In short : Buy this book 'cuz it 's cheaper :) Go to the copyrights page and read the stories according to their publish date for the authentic and more complete experience .
5 #### Upon reciept of the book set , I immediately began reading , and it has been very enjoyable knowing I have the full set to read and enjoy for many years to come . Packaging is just right and the books type set is good for these poor old eyes .
3 #### As always , I somehow manage to get wrapped up in the Narnia stories . I do n't know how or why , but I 'm always curious as to what the next chapter will be . This felt to me more like a collection of short stories than anything else . Each few chapters starts a new adventure , and there are very , very few plots lines that hold over . And the few that do have little weight to the current " adventure . " Nonetheless , the adventures that are embarked on are beautiful and intriguing , and the various islands are described with incredible detail and each one is unique from the other . Again , I felt ( as I do with the other Narnia books I 've read ) that there is so much more that could be expanded on , that the worlds and the characters have so much more to offer than what is told . But , in a way I suppose that is a compliment as well , because I 'd want to know more . And , as always , certain characters ( most characters ) are very delightful , each with his or her own personalities . And , of course , there is always something most beautiful and touching about Aslan .
4 #### This book tells the story of Digory Kirke a boy who is sent to to a magical world by his mischievous magician uncle , in order to rescue his friend Polly , who was sent their moments earlier by the uncle . They discover a world that they never knew existed and they are also present for the creation of Narnia by Aslan . CS Lewis published this book after the other six Narnia volumes were released , but he does a good job of writing this prequel . You find out that young Digory is the old professor who appears at the beginning and at the end of the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . The witch also makes a brief appearance in our world in the city of London , but Digory is able to get her back into the magical world . The ending of the book is very touching , and provides a nice segue into volume two . I gave the book four starts instead of five because the storyline is a bit sluggish in the early going and not quite as enthralling as some of the other Narnia volumes . But it is a good one andf you 'll want to read it if you saw the Narnia movies or read any of the other Narnia books .
5 #### I largely credit my love of reading with The Chronicles of Narnia . My fourth grade teacher read the entire series to our class and I loved every minute of it . With the contemporary release of theatrical versions of the first two installments , I 've enjoyed rereading the books for the first time in twenty years . Prince Caspian is beautifully simplistic . Aimed at children , the ideas of duty , compassion , and heroism are wonderfully relayed in an easily digestible format . When I was a child , I found the stories incredibly stimulating , but now as an adult I realize the life - lessons Lewis taught with each installment of The Chronicles of Narnia . Prince Caspian is the story of doing the right thing even when you must go against everything that seems natural . It is the story of putting your faith in a higher power and purpose and leaving mundane worries behind . Keep in mind , however , that Lewis offered more than just a morality tale . Prince Caspian lays the groundwork for an epic story to come . In Narnia , Lewis created a varied and fantastic world where mythology , religion , and reality seamlessly meld . I so look forward to reading the rest of this series as an adult and critically analyze Lewis ' style and purpose . I also , however , look forward to reading the series to my daughter when she 's old enough . I ca n't wait to see the wonderment in her eyes that only a child can experience . ~Scott William Foley , [ ... ]
5 #### These editions have character listings in the beginning of each novel that are very helpful . They are easy to read and illustrated !
4 #### It 's difficult for me to assign a star - rating to this book . I think because I 'm so used to " epic " youth fantasy that I find this lacking . But , I must remember that it is a " children 's " book , and I must take it for what it is . The book reads a bit more like a beautiful outline . Some things are delved into , but for the most part situations and characters are only touched on the surface . But , this does make for a fast and intriguing read . And for whatever reason I do feel invested in the story and characters . A few sections seemed a little overlong or confusing but those were very few , and for the most part the story flows quite effortlessly . And Lewis manages another batch of delightful friends ( or " DLFs " ) ! I 'm still a little unsure of the ending , but perhaps it will be explained further in the next story . And as always , there is something so special about the world of Narnia and Aslan the lion ! !
3 #### Just to be clear , the Narnia Series is one of the best children 's book series ever written . However , I found Prince Caspian to be much less compelling of a story than Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . The book was good and I give it 3.5 stars , but it is not great . The Christian allegory is still there , but it is much less obvious . Nevertheless , this is still a good book and children will really enjoy it .
5 #### The book came sooner than I had anticipated and is a new copy at a great price . Thank you much .
4 #### The Pevensie children are called back to Narnia in order to save it from the tyrannical rule of Prince Caspian 's uncle , who has destroyed almost all of the magic and wilderness from Narnia . Aslan also joins the children . Peter , Susan , Lucy , and Edmund all return to their roles of Kings and Queens of Narnia . Not as clever and imaginative and exciting as the first book in the series , but still very magical and delightful . The enchanting and complex characters of Reepicheep ( the brave mouse ) and Trumpkin ( the conflicted dwarf ) definately make the journey worth it .
5 #### Prince Caspian is the second published installment of the Chronicles of Narnia series . It is a little darker than The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe but still definitely kid friendly . As I stated in my review of The Lion ... Christian themes are woven throughout the book ; however , I believe you can still thoroughly enjoy the book even if you are not a Christian . Prince Caspian picks up one year in earth time which is approximately 1,300 years in Narnia , after the great battle and victory portrayed at the end of the first book . This time Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy are summoned back to Narnia to help Prince Caspian , the rightful king to take his place . Aslan , which from a Christian theme , is portrayed as Jesus Christ does not play as visible of a role in this book as he does in the first . He finally makes a formal appearance about two thirds into the book C.S. Lewis ' writing style lends itself to a quick and pleasurable read that can be enjoyed by young and old alike and I would highly recommend the first two books in the Narnia series and plan to continue to read through the rest .
5 #### It is great having all of these stories in one big , beautiful book . We are soon to start our 3rd time reading it . We have an 8 year old daughter and it is one of her favorite books - ever ! She is an avid reader and her imagination and grounding have both been magnified from these stories . We read it aloud and she reads it by herself .
5 #### I had this EXACT set when I was a kid . I think the art on the covers is the best of the bunch . I read these books 3 times through when I was about 11 - 12 and am now 27 and remember them almost all verbatim ! The movies are going to be a blessing to all - especially those who read the books !
5 #### In anticipation of the soon to be released movie version , I decided to familiarize myself with the plot by reading the book . Though this may not be as strong of a story as " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " , it still possesses the charm of the first book in the series . Since Peter , Edmund , Susan , and Lucy left Narnia , the world changed rapidly . Although only a year has passed in their world , time moves much more quickly in Narnia . Narnia has since fallen under the tyrrany of King Miraz , causing the talking creatures to virtually vanish . With King Miraz 's plan to dispose of the heir to the thone Prince Caspian , the future of Narnia is darkening . But when the same horn that once summonded Aslan recalls the Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve , Prince Caspian has allies in his claim to the throne . While this may not be as strong of a book as the first book in the series , it may be unfair to hold the book to such a high standard . The book is a quick read and easily engages the reader . The Chronicles of Narnia may be the high water mark of C.S. Lewis 's writing career . One can only hope the movie matches the standard of the books .
5 #### Why not have the entire collection in one book ? You know you 're going to read every book written in these Chronicles ! ! Tagged under Childrens literature but they are a great read for adults too . I read them as a child and I 'm re - reading them now .
5 #### Sadly , the " Chronicles of Narnia " boxed set that I treasured as a child is out of print , so I decided to replace it with this collectible edition that contains all seven books in the series . I ca n't find any fault with the books themselves : These stories about four children who travel repeatedly to the world of Narnia are treasured classics . In this edition , the books are presented in the order that author C.S. Lewis preferred , which sucks . The correct order that I recommend is : 1 . ) " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe , " 2 . ) " Prince Caspian " , 3 . ) " The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , " 4 . ) " The Silver Chair , " 5 . ) " The Horse and His Boy , " 6 . ) " The Magician 's Nephew , " and 7 . ) " The Last Battle . " If you are new to Narnia , I highly suggest that you read the books in the order I listed here . If you read the books in the sequence they are arranged in the book , you will be very disappointed because everything will happen out of order . Also , I was a little disappointed with the quality of the book itself ... the binding cracked almost as soon as I opened the book . Still , for $ 14.95 , this edition is a steal , and the Narnia books are just as enjoyable to me now as they were when I was a young girl .
5 #### I understand people 's objections to this edition of the Chronicles of Narnia and in a way I concur with them . I have read these book over 30 times over the last 40 years and of course I know the correct order . The reason I got this edition is so that I can have them in an easily transportable form to carry with me . There is nothing better than the boxed set with them in order but for convenience sake this one is okay
5 #### My daughter needed an updated version as her original one was falling apart . Great pictures
4 #### This final book in the Chronicles of Narnia series thankfully returns to the early splendour of " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " . After " The Silver Chair " , which seemed a little flat compared to other books in the series , " The Final Battle " restores some of the magic that made the first few novels so enjoyable and successful . Lewis does well in beginning the novel from the point of view of the Narnians , specifically the last King of Narnia , instead of the from the childrens ' perspective . We begin to see a particularly brave story develop from who is essentially a Christian author : A false Aslan has begun corrupting Narnia from within , who eventually comes under the thrall of the vicious realm adjacent to Narnia . Considering the powerful although admittedly insipid themes that Lewis is fond of , it seems a brave move to take his allegory so far . As a child the danger must read very real , and as an adult it is interesting to see the mythology of Lewis ' realm with his potentially fully drawn . Cracking characters and a smooth , compelling storyline make this one of the best of the series , as good as " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " and a fantastic , thrilling and emotional end to the book series . 8.5/10
4 #### Third book printed , fifth book chronologically . I began re - reading the Narnia series after coming across a beautiful boxed set of all seven novels . Mainly this was out of nostalgia , as these were favourites when I was young , and I was interested to see how they held up as adults . I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose , and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story . This one 's a fine companion to " Prince Caspian " and feels more like the second half of that novel rather than a novel in its own right , but this does n't stop the enjoyment of the tail despite the feeling of implausibility that the reader gets at times . The growth of the characters following previous instalments is tangible and feels authentic however , and the whole thing is as entertaining as the books set before it . 7.5/10
4 #### Second book printed , fourth book chronologically . I began re - reading the Narnia series after coming across a beautiful boxed set of all seven novels . Mainly this was out of nostalgia , as these were favourites when I was young , and I was interested to see how they held up as adults . I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose , and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story . As the first real sequel to " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " , this manages to draw out the story and history of Narnia so that Lewis ' creation reaches its full potential . The character of Caspian is readable although a little stiff at times , and the dialogue does falter occasionally where elsewhere in the books it is very smooth . The description of the voyage and the encounters of the crew are imaginative and still feel very original , and the transformation of Eustace still brings a bit of a chill , even in hindsight ! Great for youngsters and very readable for grown - ups . 8.5/10
3 #### Sixth book printed , first book chronologically . I began re - reading the Narnia series after coming across a beautiful boxed set of all seven novels . Mainly this was out of nostalgia , as these were favourites when I was young , and I was interested to see how they held up as adults . I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose , and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story . " The Magician 's Nephew " is more clearly a children 's tail than any of the other stories . In terms of construction is it relatively formulaic compared to the other novels , beginning with the children discovering strange rings which transport them to Narnia in its period of creation . This is where the book differs from the others in the sequence . We get to see Narnia created from almost nothing , the birth or " arrival " of the godly Aslan , and the seeds of " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " in particular . The Christian metaphors are laid on a little thickly here , but a child would n't notice them , nor would the allusions to Christ or Adam and Eve spoil their enjoyment . As an adult I found the story very readable , but sadly insubstantial compared to " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " or " Prince Caspian " . 7/10
5 #### I read this book years ago when I was younger and have been looking for it ever since . All chapters in one novel is ideal , even though its not in chronological order , that is the only let - down with this book . Other then that , it was a delight to read again , a charming story with great characters , a must read for all ages . I highly recommend this book to avid readers of this genre .
4 #### For me , personally , this is one of the finest in the series . Though it may seem to start off a bit slow at first , the pace of The Last Battle quickly picks up during the latter half of the book . You can tell CS Lewis builds up to the final epic scene , using elements from previous books , as well as , of course , some new ingenuity . The last scenes of the books are strikingly unforgettable , and will leave the impression upon readers that , if they have n't felt like visiting Narnia before , they most certainly will now .
5 #### I purchased this edition of the " Chronciles of Narnia " to utilize with the literary analysis class I was teaching using Thomas Williams " The Heart of the Chronicles of Narnia . " I wanted a text which contained all seven stories that I could take to class with me each day . A bonus plus of this edition is the Narnia Timeline in the center of the book . It is a nice teaching tool to utilize with your students . The " Chronciles of Narnia " were written by C.S. Lewis a professor / theologian who taught at Oxford and Cambridge Universities . The stories consists of seven books , " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , Prince Caspian , The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , The Silver Chair , The Magician 's Nephew , The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle . " The books in this edition are arranged in chronological of the order in which the stories take place . The stories are a delightful read for both children and adults . They are timeless tales of wonder which present Biblical truths .
4 #### It is the classic novels . I liked having the series broken up into individual books ( I have seen it before all bound together ) . They are easy reads and very enjoyable !
5 #### Besides being such a great addition to the series , the book itself contains so much depth and plot that I believe the book is good enough to stand on its own . The voyages of Caspian , the Pevensie kids and Eustace created such a page - turning book that no one who reads their stories will leave without great joy . Lewis ' brilliance and careful construction of the story builds up the final conclusion ( which is epic in itself ) in such a beautiful way that I can not help but claim that this book of The Chronicles of Narnia is by far my favorite .
3 #### That is no question about the books themselves is classic and excellent readings . But the quality of the paperback is poor . If you are building up your own library and want to have quality books , it is better going to B&N bookstore , at lease you can feel the pages before making a purchase . Needless to say , that is what I will be doing from now on .
5 #### Prince Caspian presents an adventurous fantasy tale of how Edmund , Peter , Sue , and Lucy are dragged into the magical world of Narnia . They are faced with the task of saving Narnia from the cruel King Miraz 's rule . King Miraz plans to wipe out the magical creatures and beasts of Narnia . His nephew and rightful heir to his throne is Prince Caspian . The kids had been to Narnia before , so they were not too surprised when they got there . As a matter of fact they were Kings and Queens of Narnia in the previous book . When they finally meet Caspian they go on a great Adventure together and have a magical time as always .
4 #### From the cute and loving ( and yet serious and deep ) tone of " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , " Lewis takes his fantastical stories even further , proving that this dreamworld of his is more than just a Witch and a Lion , but that there are histories , lives , and truths that are just waiting to be told about Narnia . Even though this book is definitely a turn for those familiar with the lightheartedness of his first Narnian epic , Lewis ' second installation brings more depth and believability to his characters , albeit the darker and bloodier tone this book generates . Without the rest of his books , Lewis ' first classic might have just been another fairy tale that ends when the book is shut . But with the other six installments , the stories get bigger and deeper , and the world of Narnia becomes even more real .
5 #### I love these books and I 'm glad that Amazon got them to me cheap and timely !
5 #### This book is a must - read for any age . It appeals to an indefinite age group , as in contains elements of fantasy and wonder , yet still manages to carry depth and philosophy ponderous for adults . It is a series of books that can and should be read from an early age to those in their seasoned years .

A read for all ages . These classic stories by C.S. Lewis are captivating with battles , journeys to the different lands of Narnia , dragons , dwarfs , talking animals , and other characters you 'll remember well after you 've read them all . Most intriging of all is the hero who is,"not tame " .
4 #### This book is a wonderful fictional masterpiece , portraying a magical world where anything can happen . The main characters , Digory and Polly , are sucked into a magical wood by a deluded and eccentric uncle . There they discover that they can transport themselves to different worlds , and end up waking evil Queen Jadis and releasing her into Narnia . This book is wonderful , especially if you have read The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , because it explains a lot about the book , and it really is a great read .
5 #### I could n't wait to get this book and enjoy all the stories . They are all here and in the order C.S Lewis had wanted them read in , once he completed the set . I could n't put it down . I am 37 and found it very enjoyable , I loved all of the Potter books and would recommend this to the fans of them . A great read for all ages ! I read them aloud to my family and we all could n't wait for the next chapter !
5 #### This is book one of the most famous fantasy series , up there with Harry Potter and The Lord of The Rings . It was written quite a few years ago , but it does n't have an " old writing style " that a lot of old books have . The story begins in London where two kids , Polly and Diggory , get some magic rings and are transported to a another wold where they encounter a witch and end up bringing her to a brand - new world called Narnia . That 's the main storyline , but do n't worry- there 's a lot more to it than that . It 's well written , maybe a tiny , tiny bit too descriptive , but that 's just me . If you guys are fantasy readers and you have n't read this than do n't miss out on all the fun and read it straight away !
5 #### Like many I live in one town and my parents live in another . So I travel a lot of holidays or weekends . A good audio book is a treasure . The miles past faster and you can tolerate the traffic better . We listemed to the ' Magician 's Nephew ' narrated by Kenneth Brannagh and he was so good , that we sat in the car an extra 15 minutes to finish the CD we were on . Thanks for the wide variety and prompt delivery of many hours happy traveling .
5 #### CS Lewis was an incredible man . He was very intelligent , and in his later years - an amazing man of God . The Chronicles of Narnia series is in my opinion one of the best fictional book series of all time . I know these are written for children , but I myself did not read them until a couple of years ago - just before they announced the movies were to be made by Walden and Walt Disney . There are parts that I know if I read again will make more sense the second time around , but overall the whole series was just so intelligently written - you truly can lose yourself in Narnia and I often found myself daydreaming of being there and walking up to the next horse on the street to have a conversation - ok maybe not that far ... I highly recommend these books not only for children in first grade or older , but I highly recommend these books to any Christian or any fictional book lover in general . I think as a Christian - you might get some things out of this series that other might not ... maybe you will get something out of it I did n't as a non - believer , I do n't know ... but the subtle things that Lewis did with these books that portray aspects of God and the Christian life are amazing . Overall these books are great and very easy to read .
5 #### C.S. Lewis is high on my list of favorite authors . The Chronicles of Narnia are among his best , and I was very impressed when I read these . They are very pleasant stories , and his talent as both a storyteller and a person of good character shine through . They are among the best children 's fantasy novels and are a classic . I appreciate the Christian theme in these novels . He is able to weave that into the stories in such a way as to make a very good parable which helps children ( and adults ) better understand the atonement of Christ , and some other basic tenets of Christianity . It is perhaps not for the fervent atheist , but probably none of C.S. Lewis 's novels are . They have an audience , and they serve that audience very very well .
4 #### Basically , there are several missing kings . A man named Prince Caspian sets up with three people from a different world to help him find seven missing kings(from the previous book)and eventually find the end of the world . Among the crew are Susan , Edmund , their cousin , and a talking swashbuckling rat with a sword . Not the kings all are still alive . My favorite part of the book was when the Dawn Treader was attacked by a sea serpent . The crew sees about 50 poles ( the spines of the serpent ) ahead in the water and has to go through them . Immediately the sea serpent starts to coil around the ship . One person tries to kill the serpent by hacking at it and breaks his sword , but everyone else is moving . They start to push the coils off the ship . The crew just barely avoids getting crushed and sails on to find the lost kings . I recommend this book to anyone who has not read the 5th book in the Narnia series but likes the material . This book is good for many other people too . This book is for children and adults alike . People who like myths will like this story . Fantasy and adventure also await all those who read this book . Does it sound like a book to read to you ?
5 #### ' The Last Battle ' , by C.S. Lewis is the final book in the chronicles of Narnia . In this book , an ape named Shift decides he should be in charge of Narnia . He starts things he is n't able to stop , and amid the confusion , a neighbouring country is trying to take over Narnia . I thought the best part of ' The Last Battle ' was when the last battle actually takes place . It 's great because it 's King Tirian and his few followers battling against seemingly unbeatable odds . Do they win or lose ? You 'll have to read the book to find that out , but this sequence is so well written that you can feel what Tirian is feeling while he fights for his freedom . ' The Last Battle ' is a spectacular ending to the Chronicles of Narnia . One reason it 's so good is because of the message it gives and how it makes you think . This book has lots of cliffhangers , so you always want to know what 's going to happen next . Also , this book is written from more than one characters point of view . All these things together make ' The Last Battle ' a really great book that deserves to be recommended .
5 #### How do you conclude one of the most vivid and imaginative stories of all time ? Very carefully . The adventure comes and goes but the real story starts when Aslan comes to unwind his creation . The end is as great as the beginning ; from calling down the stars to each person giving an account for their life . When all is done , Narnia is revealed as it truly is . And , it is even greater than before .
5 #### After reading the first book in the series I always wondered how the children from our world would make it into Narnia . This edition has an especially creative re - entry . When they arrive they find themselves on an amazing ship with an even greater assignment . A main theme of this book is overcoming fear , both the known and the unknown . Being on the seas brings many adventures , from strange people , foreign lands , sea creatures , and even a journey into complete darkness . In the end , fear is conquered and the mission is accomplished .
5 #### A great continuation to the series . One of the great themes in this book is that courage and virtue come in all shapes and sizes . It contains great lessons for the young reader while giving them an escape to the amazing world of Narnia .
5 #### I did n't expect to like these books ; I do n't care for fantasy . But these were more than that . I read them to my children years ago , and by the third book , I was hooked , too . We each have different favorites in the series . C.S. Lewis does an excellent job in turning Biblical truths into epic , mythical stories . A danger of these books is that the stories are so engaging , you might read them instead of the Bible . I 'm sure that was n't Lewis ' intention ; rather it was to turn children onto Christianity with his understanding of it . I would definitely recommend this collection for families . The collection is one of my 10 favorite children 's books of all time .
5 #### Every great journey has a beginning . The Chronicles of Narnia is well served with this book . While this story is foundational to all the adventures that will follow , it is a complete entity unto itself . The characters are vivid , the settings will capture the imagination of readers , and way that Lewis writes makes you feel more like your watching a movie than reading a book . This series is a great gift to young reluctant readers .
5 #### The first book in the Narnian Chronicles I ever read ( age 11 ) was the last in the series , ' The Last Battle ' . It has always been my favourite . ' The Last Battle ' is not just the last story in the series , but is the story of the end of Narnia , as well as the ending ( and the beginning ) of other things . In it Lewis references dualism ( ie Tash ) , false prophets ( Shift the ape)and other apocalyptic themes , and takes a swipe at atheism ( the dwarfs who can not see Aslan ) . It is a very satisfying and bittersweet ending to the best ever children 's fantasy series .
5 #### A classic that I read as a child . I read this aloud to my middle school class and they all loved it , too .
5 #### I purchased this volume in order to create a permanent place in my library with an economy of space . I have long loved these stories by C.S. Lewis , have given them as gifts and or simply considered them as a part of my life . After the recent movie was released and stirred the flames of my interest , I wanted something available to read as well as to keep . This volume is excellent on all counts . The type face and construct of the book are surperb for the price . I rate it a 5 star keeper !
5 #### I am almost thru with the Chronicles of Narnia and have thoroughly enjoyed it . Great read and so absorbing .
5 #### Boxed book set was in like - new condition ; on line description was precise . Shipment was prompt . Would not hesitate to order from here again .
4 #### Nice box . Paperbacks are cheap productions but it is an ok set for the price .
5 #### I loved the Lion , Witch and the Wardrobe as a child and read it probably four or five times . I had never read any other of the Chronicles of Narnia books and decided to begin reading the whole series to my 8 1/2 year son and 5 year old daughter . The Magician 's Nephew was written as the prequel to LWW five years after that book was published . There are varied opinions as to whether to read the book in sequence or not . I decided to read the books in sequence from 1 - 7 . The story is about friends Diggory and Polly in Victorian London who are exploring a passageway between their houses when the wind up in Uncle Andrew 's study . Uncle Andrew is a would - be magician and coaxes Polly into trying on a magical ring . This begins the pairs adventure into the Wood between the Worlds where they encounter the evil Queen Jadis , and ultimately Aslan , the talking Lion who creates the world of Narnia . At times , I think Lewis gets a little ham - fisted with the allegory , especially in the middle to latter part of the book . Overall , this does n't diminish the enjoyment of this book . My chilren and I thorougly enjoyed reading this together and the minute I finished the last page , they were begging for me to start the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe .
5 #### The Magician 's Nephew ' is the sixth novel published in the Narnian Chronicles . It tells the story of how Polly Plummer and Digory Kirke ( the magician 's nephew ) came to be present at the founding of Narnia by Aslan the Lion . This is another excellent entry in the series , introducing the memorable characters of Uncle Andrew and the frightening Queen Jadis who used the ' Deplorable Word ' to destroy her own world of Charn . There are of course parallels with Biblical accounts of creation , and the doctrine of Original sin , as Jadis takes an apple from the Apple of Life to gain immortality . There is also the theme of Temptation . Digory yields to temptation and rings the bell in Charn , which revives Jadis , and ultimately leads to the introduction of evil into Narnia . But he resists the much greater temptation to steal the Apple of Life for his dying mother . This is probably one of the most powerful scenes in all the Narnia stories . The book though is full of many other memorable scenes , the desolate word of Charn with it 's dying sun , the wood between the worlds , and Jadis 's tumultuous visit to turn of the ( 20th ) century London
2 #### The Last Battle does bring the return of some familiar characters from other books , in the form of a big old team - up . However , that is about all that is good about it , as the allegory shoveled into this gets really very groaningly tedious , even for a kid . Really pretty dull .
3 #### The two older children from the other books have been given the arse from Narnia as they are now too old and boring to be allowed back . Different rules for lions , it seems . Anyway , the two younger are staying with an annoying cousin , and end up on a ship with Caspain , now a king , and a talking rodent . Ship quest time .
3 #### The children from the first Narnia book return there to find that many centuries have passed in Narnia time . Those who were once boss types in Narnia have to solve a bit of a usurpation problem , with the aid of a couple of characters , including the old fleabag himself , Aslan .
3 #### I suppose you get a problem when you age your child characters and do n't let them come back into your story if they are too old . So , Lewis here has gone for the sequel trick , using the character of the old guy from the Lion , Witch and the Wardrobe , some kids , and filling in some backstory of Narnia , including the furniture .
5 #### I was almost 40 before I read this seven - book series . What a treat it was for an " old man . " If you have kids , do them a favor and forget about the computer game and give them this series for their next birthday . Hopefully , they wo n't wait as long as I did to read them .
5 #### Love the books ! They are the perfect size for travel . I sent them to my husband who is stationed in Iraq and he loves the books . They are light weight so they will be easy to pack and bring home when he returns . The box is great because it keeps all the books together and you do n't have to go fishing to find a book . Great product .
5 #### The book is wonderful . It is full of life and vigor . Ca n't wait to read the rest of the books .
5 #### I had only read two or three of the Narnia stories before picking up the audio CDs . I found that reading the stories to myself was somewhat less than captivating . The audio CDs , however , were quite the opposite . I have come to the conclusion that these stories were meant to be read out loud . This collection has a wonderful cast of narrators that present the stories perfectly .
5 #### one of the best authors of all time expecially for childrens or young adults ... everyone over the age of 7 should read these books regardless of thier ethnic or religious affiliation .
5 #### My first thoughts on receiving this book was " wow , this is huge " . You 've got to understand , there are seven full novels here with hundreds of illustrations , so it 's going to be a large book . It 's comparable to average textbooks in size and width , the illustrations are fantastic and the maps are brilliant .
2 #### I returned my set as I felt it was very expensive for a small and inexpensive paper back set . This review covers more that than how good the written material was . Though I have not read them , my wife did as a kid and she believes they are excellent .
5 #### The Magician 's Nephew is a beautiful story for children . I read it out of curiosity and will soon read it to my 2 year old nephew . The whole book is 100 pages and an adult or older child could happily digest it in one sitting . The plot is fascinating and biblical allusions are everywhere , from the creation to the temptation of Adam and Eve . Best of all is Lewis 's crisp prose and rich dialogue . The Magician 's Nephew is a great start for the series and easily one of the great classic 's of children 's literature .
5 #### ' Voyage of the Dawn Treader ' is the third novel ( in publishing order ) of the Narnian Chronicles . It follows on the events of ' Prince Caspian ' as Lucy and Edmund are visiting their obnoxious cousin Eustache . A picture of a sailing ship on the wall of Eustache 's guest room grows and grows until the children fall into to it , entering Narnia once more . They find themselves on the ship The Dawn Treader , with ( King ) Caspian and Reepicheep the mouse . Caspian is voyaging east in search of seven lost lords who were driven from Narnia by his evil Uncle Miraz . Reepicheep is looking for no less than Aslan 's land- which is reputed to be at the end of the great eastern ocean . This much better than both ' Prince Caspian ' and ' The Lion , the witch and the wardrobe ' . Lewis really hit his stride with this one . After this , the rest of the series is uniformally excellent . The children have many adventures such as being captured by slavetraders , encountering a dragon , and even meeting a fallen star . The introduction of Eustache allows Lewis once again to show the redemption of a character , as well as make pointed comments on modern ideas of parenting . Again the Christian themes are very lightly hinted at- they will never again be as overt as in the ' The Lion , the witch and the wardrobe ' .
4 #### ' Prince Caspian ' finds Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy getting ready to return to school at the end of summer holidays , when they are suddenly pulled by magic into another world . Of course , at once they suspect they are back in Narnia , but nothing seems familiar to them . It turns out while only a year has passed in our wold , centuries have passed in Narnia . This is the second published book in the series ( 4th in the internal chronolgy ) . The first 2/3rds of the book are quite good , as the kids realise where ( and when ) they are , encounter Trumpkin the dwarf and learn of the recent history of Narnia , and the story of young Prince Caspian . However once they reach Caspian the story really sags , as it just seems the characters wait around until Aslan fixes everything . The Christian references are toned down a little in this one . All in all the weakest of the series -probably closer to 3 1/2 stars .
5 #### I thought this was the 2nd Narnia book published , but I 'm afraid I 'm way off . It was probably the 2nd to LAST Narnia book published . Oh well , it 's certainly a marked improvement of the Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . It actually has a bit of humor in it . There 's a whole lot of cool magic stuff in this book , like teleportation rings and quick - growing soil , which makes the story fairly interesting . Its not so much a parable representing the stories of the Bible as it is an original story using Biblical motifs . I think the only thing I did n't like about the book was some events being brought about suddenly with no build - up , almost like they were just carelessly added to progress the story . Like the whole Digory 's mother being sick thing . You 'd figure it would be the entire emphasis of the first chapter , since it 's so crucial to the plot . But I think it gets quietly mentioned maybe once or twice before page 60 is reached . Also , at the very end Digory 's dad inherits a lot of money and gets rich . I mean , really , why is that even needed ? You need the ending to be THAT freakin happy that you 'll just slap something like that in there with no build - up ? But all the neat magic stuff in the story by far makes up for all this , and the tale is at least as enjoyable as the classic Wind in the Willows .
5 #### The movie was very well done but nothing compares to the books . The continued story of Narnia is one adventure after another . I 'm not sure I can pick one that is a favorite over all the others but book 7 , The Last Battle , is the most satisfying " last book of a series " I 've ever read . If you have never read them all , or have n't read them for many years , I would highly recommend revisiting them .
5 #### Seriosuly , there are over 900 reivews of this set already so I doubt you really need me to break it down for you again . I read parts of the series a long time . I kept meaning to read the whole series but never got around to it . I picked up the boxed set , started at book one , and had a great time going through the books . I am 28 and still found these books very enjoyable .
4 #### This is , by far , the best book Lewis wrote . Maybe I 'm just saying that because it 's the first of the chronicles , but the chemistry between Diggory and Polly , the way they play off each other as they venture off to the land of Narnia , is something that lodges in your mind years after you 've read the novel , and wo n't leave until you pick it up again . Christian overtones -- obviously , this is referring to the story of Adam and Eve . Great way to start a series by going all the way back to the beginning ... literally .
5 #### a biblical paradise of the mind such a fantastic escape from reality which soothes the soul , and more importantly , redirects one back to our God
5 #### Which is the best Narnian chronicle ? Could n't begin to choose just one , even if my life depended on it . Each has such a high level of craftsmanship ; each has such a broad scope of imagination . However , one unforgettable scene in THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER must arguably rank as the best of the entire series - when Reepicheep the mouse continues the journey into Aslan 's country alone , not with fear but with great longing and tremendous courage .
5 #### The Magician 's Nephew This is the book in the Narnia series that I enjoyed the most , but I believe this is partly because I read " Wardrobe " first . The revelation of the origin of the queen , the making of a rift to Narnia , and the learning of the children 's heritage were particularly fascinating because of the questions that " Wardrobe " had so successfully set up . Also , the creation of Narnia , the history of the wardrobe , and the placing of the lamppost were most entertaining . I especially liked learning about the particular evil of Queen Jadis . Reading this reveals much insight to TSRs inspiration for the Drow . Queen Jadis is one of the most intriguing characters in Chronicles , and I missed her presence in the majority of the books . The book 's religious symbolism is artful and intricate , and the book is divurgent from the others in the Narnia series in that it spends much of its time in our world , and that creatures from the other side actually appear in our world as opposed to exclusively vice versa . Plus , we even get to journey to the place between worlds and to the dead universe from where Jadis is freed . A deeper understanding of Lewis 's fantastic universe is revealed , but infinite possibilities are left to the imagination ! J. Lyon Layden The Other Side of Yore
5 #### The Last battle is a fitting end of one the greatest fantasy series of all time . Lewis does not let readers down with his last installments , and tells a great and freshly imaginative story while tieing up all loose ends in the Chronicles . Unlike the the other stories , this one starts out in Narnia with a spotlight on the bad - guy : an ape finds a lion pelt and uses a dumb but unsuspecting donkey to inact a huge farce to put himself in power . The callous and stupid apes treachery and callousness is sure to enrage lovers of Narnia , and unlike the other books we get a real sense that even in Narnia there can be true pain and suffering . Lucy and Eustace go through a sort of Baptism of fire in order to deliver the magical world from despair , and good King Tirian is shown to be one of the most likeable , well developed , and valiant rulers in the series . The barn at the end of the book is an especially powerful symbol of the seering light of the presence of God , and the death and rebirth of Narnia is a bittersweet but powerful analogy of the Book of Revelation . J. Lyon Layden The Other Side of Yore
5 #### The fifth book in the series finds Lucy , Edmund , and Eustace joining Prince caspian on a ship called The Dawn Treader , which is setting sail to little known Narnian territories where Caspians uncles have been exiled . Each island explores a different sin by which an uncle fell , and a different magical encounter for the voyagers to face and resolve . The developement of the mighty mouse Reepicheep is an especially welcome treat for children , and the scene in which Eustace becomes a dragon and embodies his own foul heart , so gaining a sort of enlightenment and a definite change of character , is a particularly skillful use of symbolism . The reaching of Aslan 's kingdom is also a symbol of enlightenment , with the Kingdom of Aslan invoking the Kingdom of Heaven in the reader 's mind . The islands can be seen as steps in the path to heaven , and the character developement along the way can be seen as an outline to the steps towards righteousness and spirituality . As a fantasy or as a religious writing , this is a hugely important book ! J. Lyon Layden The Other Side of Yore

5 #### Peter , Lucy , Susan , and Edmund are once again whisked into the land of Narnia when they least expect it : while in a subway together several years after " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . " Narnia has been conquered by a plotting king , and the " old Narnians " are now scattered in hiding from the wicked humans . The children must aid Prince Caspian , the exiled rightful owner of Narnia , and win their kingdom back for the good of all . This is an epic tale with many new and fascinating creatures introduced , with a central theme of faith . The fact that Lucy is the only one able to see the glimpses of Aslan when the struggle becomes bitter speaks volumes about the virtue of faith , and we can already see in this installment how Susan began to lose hers . The children are not only called to Narnia to save it once again , but to teach the new Prince the value of the old and magical ways of Narnia , and to learn a spiritual lesson themselves . J. Lyon Layden The Other Side of Yore

The revelation of the origin of the queen , the making of a rift to Narnia , and the learning of the children 's heritage were particularly fascinating because of the questions that " Wardrobe " had so successfully set up . Also , the creation of Narnia , the history of the wardrobe , and the placing of the lamppost were most entertaining . I especially liked learning about the particular evil of Queen Jadis . Reading this reveals much insight to TSRs inspiration for the Drow . Queen Jadis is one of the most intriguing characters in Chronicles , and I missed her presence in the majority of the books . The book 's religious symbolism is artful and intricate , and the book is divurgent from the others in the Narnia series in that it spends much of its time in our world , and that creatures from the other side actually appear in our world as opposed to exclusively vice versa . Plus , we even get to journey to the place between worlds and to the dead universe from where Jadis is freed . A deeper understanding of Lewis 's fantastic universe is revealed , but infinite possibilities are left to the imagination ! J. Lyon Layden The Other Side of Yore
5 #### C. S. Lewis is a master at his craft . The Chronicles of Narnia book set is a must have for every library . The series works on so many levels - as a straightforward fantasy story , as a Christian allegory , and so forth . The story of creation , how evil came into the world , the concept of sacrifice and the glorious return home ..... it 's all covered . I only wish that he had written many more books to create an even larger series . It 's that good .
5 #### Not much to say except I just finished reading the series for the first time yesterday , and I 've found the whole thing truly enthralling . One other comment I 'd like to make is that there seems to be a big to - do about how to read Narnia . I read them in chronological order . Maybe I was fine with it because I did n't read the whole series either way when I was younger . But to me the entire thing is enjoyable so I say read it any way it strikes you : chronological , original publishing order ( which is 2,4,5,6,3,1,7 if you 've got everything listed in chronological ) , backwards , or just a mix of this one and that one . ( Although maybe I should n't recommend those last two ? ) All I 'm trying to say is that all the books are good , regardless of order . Read and enjoy them . That 's my advice .
5 #### The product came quickly . It was exactly as advetised and met expectations . Thank You . I enjoyed the stories very much they exceded my expectation .
5 #### I am very well pleased with my purchase of this boxed set . It has been such a pleasure reading it & it never gets old .
5 #### There is a great controversy about which order in which to read these books . My simple recommendtion for myself and all those people that loved these books as children ( rather than as a Christian Theology Lesson ) is to read them as you did as a child . The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , then becomes the natural choice to follow and the story unfolds from there . If you are interested in Lewis and theology then perhaps The Screwtape Letters are more your style another excellent book . As far as Narnia is concerned Fantasy for children and adults alike it rates 5 - Theology lesson - 3 .
3 #### I finally finished this about two weeks ago . I had been reading other books inbetween each of these . Word to the wise , read them in the order they were printed , not how they are numbered here ! You can get by but some things just wo n't make sense or will be spoiled . All and all I thought the series was good . The Lion , Witch and the Wardrobe is probably the best and is the most known . I liked Voyage of the Dawn Treader the most after that probably . I think anyone who is a fan of the genre must read these books , but like I said they are a little outdated , but that is n't really a bad thing . They can be childish at times which is why I gave it a 3 instead of a 4 . I know this is a box set of children 's books , but other serieses I think are more enjoyable to both children and adults on different levels . You should go out there and pick this one up and give it a try yourself no matter what I say though .
5 #### This book transformed my view of heaven ! CSL has an amazing work here ! David W.
2 #### As has been stated previously , this is printed " out of order " , that is not a big deal as far as I am concerned , I just read them in the order I want to . I was VERY disappointed in the binding . These books can not be read twice because the pages fell out of the binding . I love reading , especially in bed at night . I read 5 to 8 books a week . I am careful with paperbacks so that they stay together for reading after reading after reading . 3 books in this series lost pages . Covers were nice , with the metalic effect . Would have preferred they spent the money on the quality of the books .
5 #### Compelling , insightful , inspiring , entertaining , enchanting , fully capable of making you think . This set is not just for young adults -- much of the intent of the author , I believe , is to reach all young minds , from children to adults , and speak to each individual on a level suitable to their comprehension . There is a reason this set is a Classic -- It takes you away , to a land and people and creatures who become believable , viable , and capable of changing not just hearts , but worlds .
5 #### Very pleased with the books . Great condition , fast service . Excellent price !
5 #### We really enjoyed the different readers for each of the seven stories . I 'll never get used to people re - arranging them into chronological order , but that is easly fixed . The only real issue I have is Patrick Stewart reading " The Last Battle " . I kept thinking that Aslan was going to beam them up . Otherwise , they are great fun and especially good for long car rides .
5 #### I have really enjoyed it . The only thing that could have made it better is if each character in the story was read by a different actor .
5 #### Written in WWII , but object lessons that are still very relevant . Must - read for children .
5 #### Great book for children as well as adults . My 13 - year - old devoured the set and my 9 - year - old son is next in line . I know there are discussions about which order to read the books , but my daughter read them in sequential order and had no complaints . Really nice for anyone who enjoys fantasy and has an imagination .
4 #### From the way it was advertised I expected this book to be presented in five separate volumes instead of one . Since it was a gift for three children , separate volumes would have been easier for them to share . However , they were delighted . They had seen the movie and upon opening the book the oldest said " Wow ! This is the REAL thing . "
4 #### I bought this as a gift . It 's a nice softback set that comes in a box / case and includes an additional ' map ' of Narnia . I felt it was a good value .
5 #### Everyone that I gave this book to has told me over and over again how much they appreciate it . I recieved the books soon after ordering them . They were in good enough condition to give as a gift .
4 #### This is a great set of books to have in any home . This set is n't done as nicely as some but well worth the price . They are a great read for children and adults . And at this time with the movies coming out a great time to pick them up and find out what is happening next .
5 #### It is quite a big book and every word is worth it ! There are seven books in the same cover , it is easy to read and to follow . A book that is filled with magical places and people , lands of imagination and skies of infinity . A recommendation to all , do n't wait until the movie comes out , I know that it already has for the second book ( The Lion the witch and the wardrobe ) , try to read it thinking that you have never seen the movie , the movie is great but not quite what the book is all about ! It even is a great book to read as a bedtime story to young kids .
5 #### How did Narnia begin ? I 'm here to tell you , look no further than here ! I know of people who are beginning with this book , and reading them in the following order ... # 1 : The Magician 's Nephew , # 2 : The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe , # 3 : The Horse and His Boy , # 4 : Prince Caspian , # 5 : The Voyage of he Dawn Treader , # 6 : The Silver Chair , # 7 : The Last Battle . That 's how I read them , and that 's how my wife is currently reading them . EITHER way you read these books , they are worth it ! This is the beginning . This is where you 'll find out just how Aslan created Narnia , His world . This is where you 'll find out how temptation came into play . This is just a glimpse of temptation and greed . And if you enjoy Lewis , you wo n't be able to put this down ! You first meet young Digory , and he meets young Polly . They run into a set of rings made by Digory 's crazy Uncle Andrew . And YES ! That is simply the beginning . So much more comes into play . You might even run into an evil witch named Jadis ! Oh yes . This is Lewis 's brilliant beginning . It is also beautiful , and just takes you to Narnia better than Hollywood could ever imagine . Are you ready to take your first steps ? Once you begin , it is so hard to end ! I know . I read this whole series , 1 - 7 in 2 weeks !
5 #### The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ( Narnia ) was purchased for our granddaughter . There was no problem with the transaction and she 's thrilled to have the volume .
4 #### This is a dream work -- stories I love read by actors who get every drop of nuance out of it . Profoundly good stuff , of the sort I 'll listen to over and over until I know it all by heart . I 'd listen to Patrick Stewart , Kenneth Branagh , Derek Jacobi , and Lynn Redgrave read the phone book ; I 'd listen to a telephone operator reading C.S. Lewis . How glorious to have the two pleasures in one project ! The only performance I 'm less than staggered by is Michael York 's reading of the first book , _ The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . _ Whether it was his choice or the director 's , he uses a patronizing , sing - song lilt , as if reading to very young and not very bright children . It insults the book and the audience both , and it 's hard to listen to without rolling your eyes . All the same , the other readings and the material itself more than makes up for it . Well worth whatever they charge for it !
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia Box Set was given both to our daughter and to our granddaughter . They were happy to receive them and , after reading the set , were even more pleased . We also gave them the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Inside - Narnia - A - Guide - to - Exploring - The - Lion - the - Witch - and - the - Wardrobe / dp/0801065992 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Inside Narnia : A Guide to Exploring The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>&nbsp;to further enhance understanding the Narnia books . The review from them : FABULOUS ! No need to say more . ~ Mrs. B.
5 #### I decided to get these for long road trips . After reading the different reviews I bought this set . We live with our daughter and her family in a large house , so altogether there are 10 of us . Our grandchildren love this series ( ages 9 yrs to 9 months ) . They have listened to them over and over . Our 18 yr son has listened to them too . The vote is that this is the best ones yet and we 've had a few . C. S. Lewis can weave a story like no one else . It 's cause me ( 56 yrs old ) to go back and re - read this series . I think it 's a wonderful gift for grandchildren and grandparents .
5 #### I have purchased this set for my children , grandchildren and nieces / nephews . This set I purchased for a friend in Romania . She loved it and is excited to be able to read books in English since she is 17 years old and still learning . She loved the books .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia has remained a classic ever since it was published , and it is no wonder why , once you read the series . It 's a pity , though , that everyone compares Lewis 's work to Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings . Yes , both works are classic fantasies , and both of the authors were buddies . But the two works are much different in style , prose , and message . Lewis 's book is a masterpiece by itself , and although I loved the Lord of the Rings as well , Narnia has its own excellent qualities that can not be compared to Lord of the Rings . There is a particular edition I want to recommend , and that is the one - volume hardcover Chronicles of Narnia book . It is beautifully bound , and its cover art is stunning . The one thing , though , is that the paperback edition has the same paper quality and cover art , and is a cheaper alternative to the hardback . But for those who want the sturdier , more enduring edition , the hardback is the way to go .
5 #### THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA IS BOTH TIMELESS AND AGELESS . BOTH YOUNG AND OLD CAN ENJOY THESE BOOK TOGETHER AND GET SOMETHING DIFFERENT OUT OF THEM EACH TIME YOU READ THEM . THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONES LIBRARY .
5 #### I ca n't take credit for this review because I read it somewhere before .... this series should be read three times during your life . Once as a child , once while you in your 30 's and once when you are elderly . As pure fantasy , nobody has been able to match the rich story line . Who would not want to go off into a magical world , have an entire life there and then return the original world and no time has passed . Great story , interesting characters and a great read !
5 #### I have twin 10 year old boys who are enjoying reading the set .
4 #### The Chronicles of Narnia - the audios were really quite good . They are each done by different actors . Kenneth Branagh , who I know from Harry Potter 's Chamber of Secrets , did well with the story telling of the first book " The Magician 's Nephew " . All the other actors were wonderful as well . But the best , to me , was Patrick Stewart , in " The Last Battle " . What a performance . He caught my attention . So very dramatic , very passionate and funny ! Overall , I enjoyed it . And to me , it 's almost up there with Harry Potter 's audio , and Lord of the Rings audio with Ian Holmes , playing the role of Frodo . If you want to buy it go for it !
4 #### Another excellent book by CS Lewis . Great imagery , realistic child characters ( my son could easily have been one of the kids in this story ) and awesome imagery . Again , felt the book , like the LWW book by Lewis also seems to leave a lot of unanswered questions ... I want to know more about the rings and where they came from though , and it 's not like me to want a lot of back story in a book , but this book is essentially ALL backstory for the other books in the Narnia series , and I loved it . Recommended even for younger readers ... (my son is 11 )
5 #### We began reading this book on a road trip across Tennessee . The stories are excellent but if how a book feels in your hands - in terms of ink color , paper quality , ease of keeping it opened to the page you 're reading -- this edition is outstanding .
5 #### I 'm a sci- fi and fantasy book lover , and I loved the series , and recommend this to all who love fantasy . One hint : Do n't turn the series down because of others bad opinions or how you felt about the movie ( most of the time the books are better than the movies ) , try it because it 's a great series . The characters become real to you as you read and you learn to love the fantasy characters as well ( Tumnus , Aslan . and so on .. ) . I loved all the books , even The Horse and His Boy which most claim is n't very good . Get a chair , relax , and read a great read ! !
5 #### In the Chronicles of Narnia , there are a few books that stand out - The Last Battle is one of them . This book really ties up the entire story . There are characters that are easily forgotten that show up again in this book and it 's really a treat to hear from them again . The ending of the Chronicles of Narnia is interesting and it really makes your mind wander when you 're finished with the book .
5 #### I 've seen the movie and I 've read the book . I normally write in detail on what struck me and pulled me as I read . But I must reserve myself and offer a simple point of view . Why ? I hope you ask ... and if you did ask ... I 'd say .. the book and/ or the movie is too good to ruin with a review read it , watch it enjoy it as if you do n't know a thing about it and it take you where the writer intended . if there was a Ten STAR reting I 'd have clicked it .
5 #### Against the usual tradition of favoring " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " , " Prince Caspian " is my favorite of the Narnia series . The story opens with Lucy , Edmund , Peter and Susan , the old kings and queens of Narnia , now only children off to school . But before they can catch the bus , Narnia decides that it has need of them and brings them back to the land . Meanwhile , Caspian lives in the now - tyrranical Narnia in the days after the rule of the old kings and queens . He is fed bits and pieces of the old magic in stories told by his nurse , and then finds himself on a quest to bring that magic back . On the way his story seamlessly meets that of Lucy , Edmund , Peter and Susan , and the novel rises from there . The magic and philosophey of the Narnia books is clear in Prince Caspian . The battle of good versus evil is here , as always , but CS Lewis has a way of making it work cliche-- you could say that Narnia was the book that all the other cliched ones branched off from . I really do love these books , and they 're a nessecity for any fantasy reader .
5 #### These stories , short in length but big in content , are fantastic . I would probably skip Prince Caspian and The Horse and His Boy if I were to read through the series again , but each and every book contains solid characters . Whether they are " sons and daughters of Eve " or some mythical creature , each character is so easy to get invested into . More than any of that , however , is how moving these stories are . To be moved by a children 's story seldom ever happens , and it is special when it does because of the wholesome nature of it . Highly recommended for all ages !
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia is an excellent book ! It really had me turning the pages . This book is great for younger children and even older children . You wo n't want to put the book down , when you read this book . Cynthia Marie Rizzo , author of Angela and the Princess , Julie and the Unicorn
5 #### While " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " was published first , it 's " The Magician 's Nephew " that truly starts off the Chronicles of Narnia . In this book , you 'll learn about how Jadis first came to Narnia and what the Professor had to do with it . You 'll learn about the lamppost , about why the wardrobe acts as a portal between worlds , and you 'll get to watch the founding of C.S. Lewis 's magical land . It 's fun , engaging , and a great start to the series .
5 #### Like most readers I presume , I read this book fourth in the order of the Narnia series . That is the only way that this book will really make sense to anyone ; reading this without reading at least The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe ( Book # 2)first would cause you to miss a lot of context and , frankly , appeal . With that background , I found this to be a good book , and at least as entertaining for me ( reading this to my kids ) as the aforementioned more famous title . If the latter is a re - told account of the Gospel message , then Prince Caspian might be a parable of the modern Church Age . To the " modern " characters in Prince Caspian , the four kings and Aslan and old Narnia are all things of myth and fairy tales ( just like worldwide floods and resurrections , right ? ) . Yet , the moderns get a chance to encounter the old world and experience a little real reality . All in all , it 's a fun book to read and a chance to experience characters that become old friends for Narnia readers .
4 #### I like this boxed set . It 's neat , small , cheap , and it keeps the dust off of my books . However , they did reorder the books to the chronological rather than the way they were written . Nothing is stopping you from simply changing the order in the box . ( Unless you 're like Monk and ca n't stand having the numbers on the spine out of order . hehe )
5 #### This is perhaps my favorite book in the Chronicles of Narnia , though I have to confess I 'm not sure why . One of the things I love most about Narnia is all the wonderful creatures -- dwarfs , centaurs , fauns , and the host of talking animals . But other than the ingenious character of Reepicheep , the characters on the voyage are human . And yet this seems appropriate , for the tale is a very human one , where we find our characters grappling with greed , desire , and a yearning to connect with the divine . The appearances of Aslan in this book are more haunting and prophetic than usual , it seems to me , and the ending of the book -- and indeed the voyage -- is wonderfully satisfying , despite the fact that there is no grand battle or dramatic clash between forces of good and evil . Of course , there is a lot of fun sprinkled throughout this book . The tale of Eustace and the dragon is brilliant , and the adventure with the monopods is charming and whimsical in a way that is reminiscent of the many Oz books by L. Frank Baum . After reading " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " and " Prince Caspian , " this book seems to take Narnia in a new direction , one which I think all readers will embrace .
5 #### I rarely find a book that I do n't want to put down . The Magician 's Nephew was such a book . The story moves along quickly , and is written in an easy to read style that does n't bog down your mind with details , but rather opens your mind and allows it to fill in the details . From his writing style , you can tell C.S. Lewis is from another era . Compare the Magician 's Nephew , to say the first page of a modern day fantasy bestseller such as The Sword of Shannara , by Terry Brooks , and this becomes apparent . The Magician 's Nephew is a book that is story driven , and the story takes place is various world that leave you wanting more detail instead of bogging itself down by placing 6 adjectives upon every tree , as is the case in much modern fantasy . 2 children , Polly and Digory take a journey that includes many memorable stops , and end upmeeting Aslan and watching the birth of Narnia . You will love this book . You will read it in a day . You will want to read the next , and the next . I consider the Magician 's Nephew to be one of the most memorable books I have read in a long time . It 's amazing what a good story can do , that hefty adjectives can never do .

5 #### this box set is awesome . the books are good and there is alought of mouments that make it so you ca nt put the book down . it was worth the buy . i also recomend wolf brother , spirit walker , harry potter series , the high king , captin underpants series , and all good books .
5 #### Anyone Ages 8 to 80 will enjoy this series even though the books are technically classified as children 's literature . This series is fantasy at its finest and combines intriguing stories , compassionate characters and rich , multi - level symbolism guaranteed to stimulate the mind . I believe this is one of those series best read in both childhood and adulthood to experience the full effect through both perspectives of naivete and wisdom . If you 're ever wondering what to buy that niece , nephew , grandchild , godchild or any other child Ages 8 - 12 for a birthday or holiday , this is it .
5 #### The executors of the Lewis literary estate are systematically removing all aspects of classical Greek and Roman literature from the works of Lewis . In the poetry they have rewritten them . In this set of books they have changed the order . Classical epics , like Virgil 's Aeneid , always start in the middle of the story as originally did this set of books .
5 #### I have always loved the books , and my hubby is an audio book fan . I got these for him on a whim and he really enjoyed them ! I bought this at Amazon.com from an Awesome Deal I found on DailyTool.com .
4 #### This is an amazingly fun and hopeful set of books ! I still love them even at my age - do n't ask I 'm not telling but my well worn and much loved childhood box set still sets in my library ! ;) My one star ding is for the publisher and the book order . If this is your or your child 's first exposure to these books I recommend they be read in published order not chronological order , at least where the two books " The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe " ( published 1st ) and " The Magician 's Nephew " ( published 6th ) are concerned . The reason is simple , secrets that are revealed in " The Magician 's Nephew " lose their coolness factor if you discover them before you read the story of " The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe " . There is a big difference between the joy ( and fun ) of discovering new details about old friends ( those you thought were so familiar ) and learning about people and things you have never met and do n't care about .
4 #### My eldest niece , a budding bibliophile , asked for the Chronicles of Narnia for Christmas last year . She shares a house with two adults , two sisters , and one chew - happy puppy . Although she may later choose to collect the individual stories in separate books , this one - volume format allowed her to read each story without the hassle of lost and/or destroyed individual books . The only drawback is the cover , a movie tie - in , which is a bit cheesy . Recommended format for young Narnia fans !
4 #### For years , my friend Chris told me how great the Chronicles of Narnia were and I told him how great Harry Potter is ; Narnia never quite interested me until Chris , friends , and I went to see the movie of " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe " which was released this past winter . It was amazing and made me want to read the books . I decided to read them in a ' timeline ' order of events , as opposed to the way they were originally published , so I read " The Magician 's Nephew " first . " The Magician 's Nephew " is refreshing , easily - read , flowing , and surprisingly GREAT . I still say Harry Potter is by far # 1 , but The Chronicles of Narnia proves to be a very worthy collection to stand on my bookshelf with other fantasies . The language of the book is generally simplistic yet very real ; the characters are believable to the point where you genuinely care for them and what happens to them , and the plot ( while there is not much of a climax ) is enthralling due to the beautifully described scenery that the characters see on their adventure . This is without a doubt a great , great book . I recommend .
5 #### It is a great book to have instead of all the single books of the set . It makes reading it in the order that the author wanted it to be read and that makes it better as well .
5 #### I read this book with my Grandsons , seven and nine . We took turns reading aloud . The various adventures provide moral lessons for discussion but the story still moves fast enough to stay interesting . I find it refreshing to have entertainment for the children that has no political overtones , no crude implications about flatulence or other bodily functions , and does n't try to sell them anything . This book is a classic with class .
5 #### Since the movie came out I have been interested on reading the books . I guess everybody knows that all these stories are great so the important thing of this review is how good is this edition . I 've seen several editions of each book and I decided to buy this one because it contains all the books in just one edition . When i got the book I was very pleased with it not only because the stories are great , but also because the quality of the printing is wonderful . The paper in which the whole book is printed is high quality and the cover of the book is beautiful . I think this edition deserves five stars no less .
5 #### I was never aware of the Chronicles of Narnia when I was younger , nor did the title come up in my teen years in private school . But , and its a big but , reading them now in my 70 's , I found them fascinating and very enjoyable . In fact , I am in my third reading of the series . They have a special meaning to me as a Christian , and I find something special in each book . I would recommend them to children and adults together . They would be especially good for parents to read to their children , or to any children .
5 #### These stories are delightful ! C.S. Lewis has written them on several levels , fun for children but with spiritual truth that appeals to adults . I highly recommend this book .
1 #### Why do modern marketers and editors believe they know better than the author as pertaining to the order this series should be read ? Forget these modern sets and go look for an older original set that has n't messed with the author 's order of titles . The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe is the first book ! 1/2 the fun of reading these for the first time is figuring out that the timeline is fluid and goes back and forth , both in Narnia and in our world . I adore this series and was going to buy a new set for my young son , but have found an old used set instead because i could not find a modern one that was reodered and messed with .
5 #### I want to agree with the review above by C. N. White ; it is " right on . " Read the books in the original order , starting with The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe . C. S. Lewis was a great writer and a brilliant theologian , whose writings are read by Christians all over the world and in many different denominations , even in Eastern Orthodoxy . These books are definitely Christian in content and attitude , but C. S. never seeks to force - feed Christian truth . Commendably , he dramatizes ; he offers examples . I was impressed , when I first read them years ago at how well Lewis portrayed Christ as Aslan , how he captured Him so genuinely and accurately -- that is not an easy task ! The books , too , are elegant lessons in Christian living . C. S. was not so much a theologian in the classic sense ( that is , writing a book of systematic theology with all its categories , soteriology , ecclesiology , eschatology , etc . ) but more in a biblically sound " adverturesomeness . " He absorbed Christian truth till it nearly ran in his veins and then helped us see the implications of it all : " the great dance . " I read these books long ago , I read them to my daughters , and now I 'm reading them to my grandaughter ( 4 ) , who has seen the recent wonderful movie . May I add that these books are facinating and fun reads even if you are not Christian . They do not disappoint .
5 #### My Son who 's in the 5th grade love 's this collections . It has nice pictures to go onlong with the story . Letter sizing is a good size as well .
5 #### I bought this attractive book for my grandchildren . The oldest age 10 has read 4 of the stories . The youngest age 6 says she s read 13 pages . The art work is great and and it is a quality bound book that can last generations . My oldest grandson told his sister , " we have to take care of this book and not write in it " . I told a lady at work about it and she got it for her child who took it to school each day . The book is large and heavy but evidently she was proud of her Chronicles of Narnia . This would be a great book to read too your children too . A nice alternative or addition to the Harry Potter books .
4 #### The Last Battle was somewhat bittersweet . Knowing this is the last book in the Chronicles of Narnia , the reader wants to be assured that all the loose ends are wrapped up . Mostly they are . There are , however , a few things that are dissatisfying about the book . The storyline begins with two new characters who are the catalyst for the final events . The beginning is a bit frustrating because the end of Narnia is nigh , and it seems like there should be more familiar Narnians involved in the story . The reader later learns that one of the main characters of the series is no longer " a friend to Narnia . " This development was a surprise and had not been alluded to in any other chronicles . Clearly the second half was Lewis 's favorite part of the book because the final events are over , and Lewis just lets his thoughts on the subject of heaven flow . It 's a must read as the finale of the series . It is a good book , but it 's not the best Chronicle of Narnia .
4 #### The Magician 's nephew is the first or the sixth book in the Chronicles of Narnia depending on the published order or the chronological order respectively . I read the books in the published order because I wanted to see how Lewis evolved as an author . Lewis 's style did not appear to change throughout the series , and I think the reader will connect with the characters more easily if this book is read first . The story itself is interesting . Digory and Polly are sent out of this world by Digory 's rather pathetic Uncle Andrew in an experiment . In the ensuing adventure the children accidentally bring Jadis ( the white witch ) out of her world and into their own . Lewis reminds readers that sin often has unforseen consequences , but also that what is intended for evil can ultimately be used for good . He also touches on issues such as taking the easy way out of a situation or doing what is right . The story may be written for children , but some of Lewis 's thoughts are really for mature readers . The Magician 's Nephew is a relatively quick read and definitely the starting point for the Chronicles of Narnia .
5 #### While this was n't the first book written in the series it is officially the first book and tells you how Narnia began , how the lamp post in the Lion , Witch and the Wardrobe got there in the first place and background on the witch as well . Digory ( I agree with Polly , this IS a funny name ! ) and his neighbour Polly stumble into Digory 's Uncle Andrew 's study quite by accident one wet afternoon while trying to explore their row of houses via the attics . Uncle Andrew is a scary figure and frightens them , especially when Polly puts on a beautiful ring he gives her and vanishes into thin air ! Digory goes to get her but they unwittingly return with the witch , who wreaks havoc in their world before they are able to get her back again . They go to Narnia , which has n't yet begun but while there Aslan the lion creates Narnia . This really is just the beginning , the book is an important part of the series and I enjoyed reading it . Highly recommended .

5 #### Though all of the books in the Chronicles of Narnia are great in their own right , this one is by far the best . Full of imagination , it filled me with a sense of awe , as a child and an adult .
5 #### We are most pleased with the books that we have listened to so far . Each one has a different narrator and they are all excellent and the story well told . They are a unique story , with talking animals so a challenge for the story - teller is there with each book . We would recommend these books to anyone who enjoys C.S. Lewis and his use of sybolism to teach the justice and " rightness " of existing in a world with differences among all of us .
5 #### Chronologically the first in CS Lewis 's Narnia series , this novel tells how two children , one of whom would grow up to be the Professor in " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " ( I * knew * he was aware of Narnia ! ) , are sent to a dying world where they accidentally resurrect the evil witch Jadis . Bent on conquest , Jadis follows the children back to London , where she causes much havoc before they all travel to an empty dimension . Here they witness the lion Aslan singing the land of Narnia into existence . I enjoyed this book even more than " Lion . " The early parts of the story are full of wonder and adventure . Once the characters travel to Narnia , the prose is lovely and dream - like as Aslan creates his world . The boy Digory 's Uncle Andrew , a comically sinister villain , is very well - written and will provide adults who read this book to their children with several chuckles that will go right over the heads of the kids . There is also a touching subplot concerning Digory 's sick mother . An excellent novel .
5 #### If you are American and purchased the Chronicles of Narnia in one of those paperback slipcover sets in the 70s or 80s , you are reading a version that was toned down a bit , had a couple of names changed , and was boxed in publication date order . This new set has the charming line drawings of the original with color added by the original artist , is arrayed with the stories in the order the author preferred them be read , and is the original , vivid British edition . This handsome volume is not only well crafted , but includes a thoughtful touch : an attached ribbon bookmark to help you keep your place without hurting your investment . Highly recommended .
5 #### This set is very well done . I think it captures the power of the " Stone Table " scene better than the movie did . I was a little disappointed with the voice of Aslan , but overall it is excellent .
5 #### The Chronicles are a beautiful classic to have in your bookcase . Not just for kids , and great to re - read .
5 #### I never read these stories as a child and am so sorry I missed them as a youngster . I 'm now 65 , and I could n't put the book down . C. S Lewis tells stories that children and grownups alike can get lost in . The parallel to Jesus and Heaven is awesome . Good triumphs over evil again and again . 5 Plus Stars for this collection !
4 #### I did not realize I was ordering only the first two books in the Narnia series . I found the set attractive and used the same illustrations etc . as the original . But when I got the set , I thought I was getting the full set of all the volumns , not just the first two . Bill
5 #### All the books in the series were great fun .
5 #### After seeing the movie I got all the Narnia books and its like another Harry Potter series Great
4 #### I bought the series for my 13 - year old daughter , she loves them . I started reading the first one , it is fun , though not as much as Harry Potter ! ! !
5 #### I first read " The Chronicles of Narnia " when I was about 14 years old . Several decades have gone by since then but I found my imagination still readily fell into the fantastic wonders of Narnia on CD .
5 #### I read the Chronicles of Narnia to my children when their grandmother recommended the series . Now my children are reading these books aloud to their own little ones . These are timeless stories of right and wrong , repentance and change , excitement and fantasy . I heartily recommend these books to everyone , every age : read them to yourself or read them aloud to someone you love .
5 #### Reading the set to my daughter . She is really into it and it really holds her attention . Although there is controversy about the order in which to read the books , we are going in the order the editor has them and it flows well . Would highly recommend this set . I plan to order the biblical truths companion to get that author 's insight .
5 #### One must first consider that these are children 's books and were written as such . In that context these are amazing books , a must read for any child or even adult .
4 #### I enjoyed this book , but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it were a stand - alone tale and not the first book in an epic series . You see , I had already read The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe so I knew what this book was supposed to set up . And while the story it tells is fascinating , funny and quite intriguing , it ultimately does not provide the smoothest set - up going into Book II . For instance , it tells us that Aslan set up a protection for the Land of Narnia , but it never tells us how Jadis the White Witch manages to break this protection down , or how the prophesy for the four thrones at Cair Paravel got set up or why Aslan waited so long to save his land from evil . Speaking of evil , another problem is that Jadis as she appears in Book II is a lot more threatening than she is in this book . I realize that she 's supposed to be disoriented , but she still does not come off as the wicked white witch who will later terrorize and imperil so many people . She comes off merely as rude and rather trying . But it 's supposed to be a children 's book , so I realize I 'm likely looking to get too many things out of it . Overall , I enjoyed the book . I simply found it a little too lightweight and too light on answers to give it the full five - star treatment .
2 #### I never read these stories in my youth and maybe that 's why I was n't too impressed with them . Yeah , they are " classics " I guess , but I still found them very uneven . I liked The Horse and His Boy , Prince Caspian , The Voyage of The Dawn Treader best . They were very entertaining and no so preachy as the others . I thought The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe to be a very empty story . It just ended . Bang . The Silver Chair was not too bad , but uneven . I did n't care for The Last Battle or The Magician 's Nephew at all . WAY too religious for me . I ca n't say I recommend these books .
5 #### I really hate to seem dense , but is the only reason that this is called an ' adult ' box set because there are no pictures ? I need to know , because I plan on buying the set for my grandson . Either way , I rate this set as excellent , because the stories have been favorites in my family for many years . I love them still !
5 #### I am a life - long C.S. Lewis fan . In my opinion , no children 's author was more talented at telling a great story , while at the same time building in several levels of meaning . The youngest of children might not intellectually understand all the messages at first - but the most important thing is that it does n't stop them from enjoying a fantastic story . And I think , on some level , everyone intuitively understands the meaningful mythological themes that Lewis presents in The Chronicles of Narnia . These books have been a true inspiration to me , and have a cherished spot in my library .

5 #### This is my favorite book in the Narnia series . As a child , I was delighted that this book gave the origins of the wardrobe and the lamp - post that were so important in " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . " I love the character of Uncle Andrew , and the scene when he refuses to believe in the magic of Narnia is absolutely hilarious . This marvelous episode also features one of my all - time favorite quotes from literature : " The trouble about trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you very often succeed . "
5 #### I have just started reading book one and I am almost done . Once you get used to the Old English you can really flow with the book . I ca n't wait to finish the whole series . My children are reading them as well .
5 #### A wonderful book , which has been enjoyed by all of our family for many years .
5 #### Excellent service - books arrived in excellent shape and in a timely manner .
5 #### Simply amazing . Never - ending thrills chapter after chapter . It will drive you and your imagination right along ! Remember what you 're reading though - that there 's a message for you from Jesus Christ while you 're reading this masterpiece .
2 #### I purchased this set for my grandsons . Being familiar with this author 's work and having read the books long ago , I recommend them to anyone with children . Sandra Robertson
5 #### I suspect that many readers will approach this book under the circumstances as I did ; that is , AFTER they have already read its sequel , The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe . Readers may also approach it with a similar dreaded suspicion that Lewis must have fallen short on this one , only because The Lion would have been a high watermark to rise to ( ala , the complaints one hears about the Star Wars prequels ) . Not to worry . This book rises to the occasion on practically all points : early to mid - century English charm , simple and non - sensical fantasy settings , clear morality lessons , young heroes , and Judeo - Christian analagoues that only an infidel would refuse to recognize . The overall theme of the book is creation and man 's spoilation of it ( with the help of Evil ) . What The Lion was to the Book of John , The Magician 's Nephew is to the Book of Genesis . Many will see some of the fantastic creatures in the book , like " river - gods " and nymphs , and view them as pagan elements . I saw something different , in that Aslan had the power to create what he wished and to impart the characteristics that pleased him . Only Aslan is self - existent , and thus only Aslan is supernatural ; everything else is natural and subject to the natural boundaries that he chooses to set . I read this aloud to my young kids . As with The Lion , they begged for " one more chapter " every night , and even their young minds recognized the type of Creator in this book .
4 #### Like the other six Narnia books , Prince Caspian is a well told tale that is definitely worth reading . The overriding theme investigates how widespread knowledge of an original fact can become legend , then myth , and finally be forgotten all together . There is also another small subtext that I find just as interesting as the larger theme - especially in light of the author 's own story . Lewis had a great love of pagan myth . He relates in " Surprised by Joy " that in pagan Norse myth he had an early taste of the Joy that ultimately led to his conversion . In some respects a regenerate pagan himself , it is not too surprising then to find Lewis often redeeming the pagan more broadly in his fiction . In the case of Prince Caspian , this is accomplished by the introduction of Greco - Roman deities and demigods working on the side of Aslan and the good . It is an approach that would not likely be utilized by the contemporary Christian author , but Lewis does it with his usual deft touch and leaves the reader glimpsing perhaps a bit more clearly just how completely a fallen world is being and will be reclaimed by a risen Lord . A good read , 4 stars , and certainly recommended .
3 #### In this magical tale of witch craft magic and fighting , The ancient kings and queens of Narnia Peter , Edmund , Susan , and Lucy find there selves back in Narnia in a strange beach after there await for the train . It had been a year since they had ruled narnia , thou took no time to retrace there memories of there grand era . Although one year in the human world is thousands of years in Narnia . Coming back to a castle in ruins . Thou not knowing it is there very own . A new enemy has risen in Narnia which is now called New Narnia . The old Narnians have been run out and the time of deep magic has come . This means a time for war . Aslan and the magical creatures are back in a war ready to take back Narnia once and for all . The new king Caspian lead his new troupes into battle . The Old Narnians have been in hiding for the new Son of Adam king that forcibly took over Narnia for his new Kingdom and passed it down . Now Caspian must fight his uncle , the King , with the old Narnians to take back there land . This book is great for anyone who loves magic and talking creatures . This book is part of a series and is the 4th book . I recommend this book for middle school kids and up .
5 #### I think publishing the books in chronological order is a neat idea ! The copyright dates are clearly listed in the front of the anthology for anyone who wants to read them in the original release order . Wonderful books for all ages !
1 #### Unlike the other Narnia books it seems the children ca n't take two steps without requiring divine intervention . time and again one of the characters ties to do something completely crazy such as willingly casting a spell which will destroy Narnia ( for personal gain ) untill Aslan appears in some form to change their minds . I enjoyed all of the other books in the series ( would rate them as a 4 - 5 ) , with the exception of the Last battle which having peeked ahead i decided not to finish , as to me it would have been a most depressing end to a great series .
3 #### These are children 's books and read as such . If you discovered them late in life , as I did , you may be frustrated by the writing style and simplistic imagery . Do not expect them to have the cross - over appeal of Lord of the Rings , His Dark Materials , or even Harry Potter . I 'm sure they 're wonderful for children , but adults may not enjoy them as much .
5 #### Lewis did n't write the Narnia books in chronological order when he first wrote them . I read them in the order that Lewis wrote them with THE LION , THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE being first and THE MAGICIAN 'S NEPHEW being the next to the last . The " historical " Narnian chronology starts with THE MAGICIAN 'S NEPHEW , but to be honest , it really does n't matter . ( Just so you read THE LAST BATTLE last . ) Reading this book ( written for children of all ages , including grown ones ! ) will do many good things for you . The most important thing is that it will make you love God more , love His Son Jesus more , and understand the Gospel better . I first read THE LION , THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE when I was 29 years old and I openly wept over various parts of the book as well as rejoiced over the triumphant ending . You will want to read the book many times , as new insights about Jesus will come out each time . It is hard to believe that a book so geared to the younger reader could have so many rich insightsinto life in general and the Christian life in particular -- but it does . Read it to your children , your grandchildren , your nephews and nieces -- and read it for yourself . You 'll never regret it .
5 #### This is a memorable group of stories for children .
5 #### Since I missed reading this in my " younger days " it is a complete pleasure to read a wonderfully written fantasy ! In today 's world we can all use a Narnia to aid in our escape from reality ! Treat yourself - - - Go ahead , You Deserve it !
5 #### The actual book was well constructed and journeyed with me all over California and Mexico . Being paperback it was a lot easier to read while travelling . The writing is similar to The Hobbit . A great fantasy adventure that is worth reading several times . This is a must read if you enjoyed Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit . C.S. Lewis really nailed the environments of these books ( the names of the talking animals are also great ) . I really enjoyed reading this series ( in order ) and look forward to reading them to my son when he comes of age .
3 #### As I go through and reread these novels , I am remembering how I felt when I originally read them . Even when I initially picked up the books to reread I remembered that Prince Caspian was not my favorite of the Narnia books but I hoped to see something in it that I had n't before . I did but that only added to my ambivalence rather than building up my appreciation . The subtle sexism is less subtle in this novel than in The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . Not offensively so but undeniably there . Of course , given when it was written it is not unreasonable to expect there to be some sexism . Just disappointing , I suppose .
5 #### While the Narnia books are based on Christian cosmology , whatver your religious beliefs , these books promote ethics that should be important to everyone : love , kindness , and doing the right thing . Also , there is a healthy dose of more ancient belif systems in them . For example , in " The Magician 's Nephew , " Aslan brings into Narnia all sorts of Pagan creatures , including some called " gods , " and these are all good beings who belong there ! " The Magician 's Nephew " starts off this wonderful series . If you 've only seen the new movie , start with this one . You 'll learn who the professor is and what he has to do with Narnia . You 'll get to see how Narnia was created by Aslan himself , and how the White Witch came into the picture . One of the coolest things was how the lamppost came to exist in Narnia , and how the wardrobe of the second book came to be built , and contained enough magic to send four children between worlds . I am a young adult fantasy author myself , and I think this is a fantastic book . While written for children , it 's an awesome experience for adults as well . It 's easy to see why Lewis was one of the early masters of the fantasy genre . ( My novel , < a href = http://www.amazon.com / gp / product/1411637208/>Amber in the Over World</a > , is available here on Amazon . )
1 #### C.S. Lewis ' epic 7 novel series of a magical land of witches , talking animals , and enchanted wardrobes are collected in this edition . Beginning with the first novel , " The Magician 's Nephew " , which recounts the birth of Narnia and how the uncle of the famous Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy , came to be in possession of that mysterious wardrobe , up through the closing tale , " The Last Battle " . Adventure and magic are everywhere in this collection of timeless stories . I was read these books as a child and unfortunately for me , this was not a series I should have revisited . I severely disliked all 7 of these books . I found Lewis ' writing style to be downright annoying and , honestly , quite poor . The Christian mythology that is supposed to be cleverly hidden in these stories , is n't really hidden or clever at all . I found it to be heavy - handed and cumbersome . I was also appauled by how this series ended . All of the children and their parents are killed in a horrible accident , but it 's OK , because now they all get to live in Narnia forever . What ? This is supposed to be a children 's story , and I find that disturbing . I can not honestly say I would recommend these books to anyone .
5 #### I will not bother writing a review of the text in these books . I think an average rating of 4.5 stars with over 700 reviews speaks well enough of them . But there are many different box sets available to purchase . This review is on one of those sets . The set I purchased is from HarperTrophy . It is called " The Chronicles of Narnia Box Set : Full - Color Collector 's Edition ( Paperback ) " - ISBN : 0064409392 . This is a beautiful set . The individual books ( and the entire set ) are surprisingly heavy . The pages are stiff , well cut and easy to turn ; the printing is sharp , clear and comfortable to read ; the covers are very sturdy . All in all , a very substantial box set . But the real prize is the many pictures . When I ordered it , I thought the pictures they were advertising were the cover images . That 's just part of it . There are dozens of color sketches throughout the books - some are small images , some full page . They are beautifully done and provide a wonderful enhancement to the text . The only complaint would be that they have numbered the books in chronological order instead of publishing order , which is the best way to read them . The original dates of publication are printed inside the front covers . It is easy to rearrange the books in order : 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 3 , 1 , 7 . All things considered , I would highly recommend this box set .
5 #### Somehow having missed these novels in my childhood , I found this to be the perfect introduction into the world of Narnia . In this publication , all seven novels are presented in story order , not in chronological publication date . While many feel that this is not the proper way to read the books , I felt that it added to the whole idea of the " Chronicles " of Narnia , in that each novel built on the next and when you did encounter characters from the past , you already knew their backstory and it all made sense . A wonderful way to be introduced into the legacy that is Narnia .
5 #### This is a wonderful series of books that , like Harry Potter , both children and adults can enjoy . I 've also seen the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it . To the reviewer who wrote about hidden subliminal messages , get over it . Why ca n't a book be enjoyed for the delightful story it is instead of being dissected in to something it was never meant to be ? This is a wonderful story of fantasy about 4 siblings entering the world of Narnia and finding out that they have more courage and determination than they thought they had . All of the characters are a delight , from Lucy to Peter to the talking animals . I loved the beavers and Mr. Tumnus . The story moves at a good pace , never dragging it 's heels , so the reader is swept into the story . My child is just starting to read the series and loves them . I 'm thinking of re - reading them myself and have no doubt if I do , I will enjoy them just as much as the first time . Read the series for the pure enjoyment that it will bring to you . You wo n't be disappointed !
5 #### I 'm not going to comment on the actual books contained in this all in one volume , but rather on the quality of the hardback edition itself . Often these all in one volumes are printed on poor quality paper , and have poor bindings - happily this is very much not the case here . The paper used has a silky feel , and you feel confident that the quality binding will keep the book intact for many years . Considering it 's full retail price is about $ 30 , the $ 17 price tag is great , adding to the value of this edition . If you are looking for a collector edition quality version of these novels , you wo n't go far wrong . The only better version I 've come across is at Eastern Press , who usually charge at least $ 40 per book ( sometimes as much as $ 60 ) - but their books are only for the most anal of collectors . I only mention them for those that have been disappointed with collector editions of other great fantasy novels , such as Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings , and The Hobbit - as well as an awesome version of the Altas of Middle Earth , or Ursula Le Guin 's Earthsea series .
5 #### Imagine Lewis and Tolkien at their Inklings gatherings reading first portions of their now famous fantasy series , Narnia and Lord of the Rings . Tolkien reportedly was n't too keen on Lewis publishing his . Lewis prevailed and you 'd be keen too in reading these if you have n't and especially to the kids around you . They abound in a macro view based fantasy of good vs. evil , revolving around " lion Aslan " and sons and daughters of Adam , set in mystical land of Narnia . Enter a Witch , a Magician Uncle and you have all that is fascinating for the young mind to be captivated forever . The book always exceeds Hollywood 's attempts to depict , so even if you 're kids have seen first install , this written version is so much better to my taste and I 'll wager their 's as well . A reread as I 'm doing now is wonderful , it 'll bring back those fine memories . Lewis is fine writer and better than average lay theologian so coupled here together in order of the seven that he preferred , setup by the Magician 's Nephew , which by the way would have been the first flick I would have done , not The Lion , Witch , and Wardrobe . Outstanding chapter illustrations from original . Excellent value .
4 #### This is one of the best cover pieces for a Narnia book , certainly on par with Lion and Horse . I was so enthralled with the books cover that I actually read it , and the content itself was pretty good too , which just goes to show that a correlation does exist between cover art quality and literature quality . I ca n't stress to potential readers how much I enjoyed this book 's cover art ; I may even look at the covers of other C.S. Lewis books .
5 #### As several others have already commented , reading the series by publication date is , in my opinion , the only way to do it . Unfortunately this package does n't present them in this way , but that is easy to fix . Lion should definitely be read first , and Battle last . Buy this package ! You wo n't be sorry you did .
5 #### the chronicles of narnia is one of the most original , refreshing , and clever fantasy 's of our time . sort of like LOTR 's little brother , the books work on all levels from danger , humor , and the pictures work well . i have heard of many people complaning about what order they should go in and i 'm on the when they were writen side . however , you could always read them in the writen order or you could read it in numbered order if you already read them . the order the books should go in is 1 ) the lion , the witch , and the wardrobe 2 ) prince caspian 3 ) voyage of the dawn treader 4 ) the silver chair 5 ) the horse and his boy 6 ) the magicians nephew 7 ) the last battle . i urge you to read them in this order but if not fine . the storys mostly center on the pevensie children except for magicians nephew and the horse and his boy . tough people say that its a christian book , i personally ca nt seem to identify the christianty in the books but maybe there hidden in the magic of the book . so read these great books .
2 #### I re - read this along with the rest of the series after having read them several times as a kid . They 're definitely for kids , but still fun to read as an adult especially being able to remember reading them as a kid . This is by far the worst book in the series . It starts out well enough , with a pretty good story and some pretty good characters , including the new king , and some good animals . But by the end , it degenerates into a lot of feel good religous nonesense that just does n't live up to the rest of the series . Having said that , it 's still a must read to close out the series , but thankfully it 's pretty short . If you 're reading this series for the first time , be sure to read it in the correct order ( starting with The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe ) instead of the stupid order they are currently marketed in , as they will be much more enjoyable .
5 #### I re - read this along with the rest of the series after having read them several times as a kid . They 're definitely for kids , but still fun to read as an adult especially being able to remember reading them as a kid . This is probably my favorite book in the series , as you get to see the origins of Narnia , and all it 's inhabitants . Also , finding out how the lampost got there , and how the wardrobe became a portal to it is all very interesting . The new characters introduced are also very good in this book . I imagine that this one would suffer dramatically , though , if read first , as it is now marketed . Most of the enjoyment in it comes from seeing the genesis of things you 're already familiar with from other books . If you 're reading this series for the first time , be sure to read it in the correct order ( starting with The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe ) instead of the stupid order they are currently marketed in , as they will be much more enjoyable .
5 #### I re - read this along with the rest of the series after having read them several times as a kid . They 're definitely for kids , but still fun to read as an adult especially being able to remember reading them as a kid . This book packs a lot of action an adventure into a pretty short story . You get to see a lot more of the world of Narnia , which is a lot of fun . This is one of the best books in the series , sandwiched in between two of the least exciting . If you 're reading this series for the first time , be sure to read it in the correct order ( starting with The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe ) instead of the stupid order they are currently marketed in , as they will be much more enjoyable .
5 #### This is the last book of one of the best loved series ever . C.S. Lewis was able to take Bible themes and turn them into a children 's fantasy story , which is no small task . The comparison to the antichrist , Revelation , and Aslan 's role as Christ is done so wonderfully that I think he was unmatched as a writer . This is my second favorite of the series , my favorite being The Magician 's Nephew , where the Narnian creation story is told . I would HIGHLY recommend everyone to read this . Although I read these books first at the age of 11 , I continue to read them today at 41 . They are for any age .
5 #### I had forgotten how good these books were . It has been well over two decades since I first read these books . I have not seen the recent film but I have taken the chance to re - read some of these and I can report that these books are just as good as ever . In many ways , they are even better for older readers who can see the spirtuality more clearly than many children . Kids , of course , mostly see these as old - fashioned adventure stories . I am thrilled to have had the chance to re - read these and I highly recomend them .
5 #### This set is hands down both my favorite fantasy series and my favorite children 's book series . I 've read them to myself , for my own enjoyment , and I 've read all seven books out loud to my kids . Reading them out loud is a great experience . At the end of a chapter , when I had intended to quit , the kids would beg me to keep reading ! Every one of the kids , from 5 to 15 , were spellbound . I strongly feel , however , that the books should be read in the order they were written , and as Lewis intended them to be read . That is : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ; Prince Caspian ; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ; The Silver Chair ; The Horse and His Boy ; The Magician 's Nephew ; The Last Battle . Many people are only familiar with the first book because of the just - released movie ( which was good , but not great ) . I also found The Voyage of the " Dawn Treader " , The Horse and His Boy , and other books in the series to be just as delightful , with equally enchanting characters . There are excerpts from several of the books that I find simply and profoundly unforgettable . And last , but not least , the Christian symbolism is refreshing , and at times deeply moving . Fantastic set . If you have n't read it , hesitate no longer !
3 #### This book , the last written in the series , but first chronologically , does a good job of going back to show where the white witch originally came from and how she got to Narnia . It 's imaginitive and moves along at a brisk pace . What it does not do is enthrall . It 's short and easy to read but I never continued reading becuse I felt like I had to know what was going to happen next . It 's decently written , although not with an abundance of style , and I finished it only because of its brevity . I enjoyed it , but it never completely grabbed my attention .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia are near perfect books . Entertaining , imaginative , and thought provoking storytelling of the struggle between good and evil with a sweeping gandeur and epic scale as Peter , Susan , Lucy , Edmund , and the graceful lion king Aslan protect Narnia from the evil White Witch Queen and her minions . I 've been reading and re - reading these books ever since I was young and old enough to pick up a book . And now buying the box set for the next generation of Narnia lovers , and discussing the stories I 've always loved with them as they read them , it does enhance the process of discovery about the magical world of Narnia as I see the same wonder in their eyes that I felt the first time I read the books . Wonderful reading for adults and kids . A true classic . Another book I 've enjoyed : The alien invasion adventure " Gaak " by Darryl Hughes . Four " Goonies " like kids take on adolesence and kooky aliens in order to save the world . Too funny . It 's a wonderful adventure for scifi fans of all ages .
4 #### I love these books . I 've read them over and over again from the age of 13 and continue to read them now when I 'm in my 30s . The only reason I would n't give this book 5 stars is that this book is really thick and a little cumbersome . I prefer the collection of individual books and would recommend those instead . After all , you can only read one at a time .
5 #### I read these books when I was in junior high , and they are something I have never forgotten . As others have said , they printed this set in chronological order which certainly distracts from the entire story line . I purchased them for my 8 year old and he loves the books . I find they are a great alternative to the Harry Potter books for the younger crowd . Be sure to read them in the order as stated by others here : 1 ) The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe , 2 ) Prince Caspian , 3)The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , 4 ) The Silver Chair , 5 ) The Horse and His Boy , 6 ) The Magician 's Nephew , and 7 ) The Last Battle .
5 #### To suggest that there is one right order for reading the books is , I think , foolish -- and the published order has the least support . To begin with , The books were not written in the order that they were published : Silver Chair was written after Horse and his Boy but published before it -- and there is no evidence that the publishing order was dictated by the author . Further , Lewis started ( and abandoned ) The Magician 's Nephew right after Wardrobe suggesting that he thought ( at the time ) that it was an essential part of the series . More critically , Lewis did not plan an order -- as he himself said , he thought that each book was the last . Any order will have it 's own particular magic and it would be hard to rate one order over the other . In addition , different readers will enjoy different orders : while some readers will get the biggest kick out of the chronological order others will prefer starting with the " big bang " of the Wardrobe and get the backstory later in the process . Personally , I read them first in the order they were published . In retrospect , I wish that I had read The Magician 's Nephew first ( or , at least , earlier ) because ( again , personally ) I prefer an orderly exposition . If I were recommending an order to someone , I would suggest the order the author tackled them , with The Magician 's Nephew second in the series .
5 #### C.S. Lewis wrote the books for children , but even as an adult I love them ! The stories seem to take you back in time and make you feel like a child again . The stories themselves are beautiful and well written , leading you to believe that C.S. Lewis saw these things happening . I highly suggest that you read these books , and if you have already , then I suggest you read them again !
5 #### First , since it seems to be a big deal , with regard to the order : 1 . CS Lewis himself expressed a preference to have the books ordered by their chronological order , relative to their order within Narnian Time as this set does . 2 . If you do n't like the order .... read them in any order you like . Next question ? ;) That out of the way , this is the way you want to buy the Chronicles in paperback form . DO NOT buy the single volume of all books in one cover , in the paper back form ! The binding will not stand up to repeated reads and children will find it overwhelming . If you want the 1 volume set , and it 's equally a fine book , then pay the extra and get the Hard Cover . While not an allegory , in the strictist sense of the word , Lewis ' Chronicles of Narnia are certainly allegorical in nature and very representative and illustrative of Christian Theology . That feature is greatly prized by parents who want to teach as well as entertain . Rest assured however , that the book and characters themselves are sufficient to entertain and still excellent even if the allegorical element is not what you are looking for . Classic ! Timeless ! Well worth the time , effort and cost to own .
5 #### ... as judgment day comes upon those of Narnia . This is perhaps one of my favorites of the series simply because of the linear plot line with a fluid story , one in which Lewis takes everything into consideration ( as much as you would for a children 's book ) . The dark hour did indeed come upon Tirian and those faithful of Narnia , and the book climaxes , for the first time , with The Last Battle with the Calormenes . We see Tash ( or Lucifer ) come into the world and find that he is the opposite of Aslan ( God or Jesus ) . Finally , judgment day comes upon the Narnians as they look into Aslan 's face and are judged accordingly . As with the bible , some who you thought were evil ( a dwarf who shot a Talking Horse who was coming to Tirian 's aid ) is found among those granted entrance to the True Narnia . This book takes some unconventional turns a few times , which to me makes this so much better to read . This is the best of the series , with The Silver Chair and The Horse and His Boy close seconds , and I would recommend to anyone , no matter your age .
3 #### The Magician 's Nephew is an interesting addition to the Chronicles of Narnia , one that was probably needed . It is interesting because it does n't really fit into Narnia until towards the end , but we do see the White Witch and how she came about to be . The Magician 's Nephew has a very biblical feel . Where The Chronicles of Narnia has a very Christian feeling throughout , this one seems to have it even more so . The correlation of Noah 's Ark with the animals , even so far as to have Aslan chose two of each animal . The tree of knowledge is , in another form , within , as well as the fruit that it bares . Additionally , Eve , a woman , ate the apple in the bible , so what do you know ? A woman ate the fruit this time . Finally , Aslan creates Narnia in a matter of moments , closely correlating to God 's creation of Earth . All in all , a decent book , although it mimics the bible too closely to be one that stands out more than the others of the series . So I would recommend reading it simply to fill in and complete the story , but this is not one of my favorites .
5 #### This , the third book written in the Narnian Chronicles , presents to us a splendid voyage starring Lucy , Edmond , and the new visitor from our realm , Eustace Scrubb , a bratty bully who eventually turns into a likable hero . Lewis draws upon his vast imagination to bring us dufflepods , magicians , star people , sea sepents , and the edge of the Narnian world . It is a truly splendid book which excites the imagination and leaves one longing to be on a voyage across the sea . My only complaint about this version is that they kept the original text about the black island , when Lewis rewrote it and specifically said that he preferred the new version , and I wish that they had listened to him , for it is much better .
5 #### This , the second book written in the Chronicles of Narnia , is C. S. Lewis attempt to allegorize the reformation of Christianity , and he pulls it of splendidly . Narnia has been over run by the Telmarines , who do not believe in magic , talking animals , dryads , Aslan , etc . Prince Caspian , the son of King Miraz , has heard tales of the old Narnia growing up , and believes that those things really exist . The rest of the tale describes how the old Narnia is reawakened and defeats the reigning conquerers . This is a picture of how distorted beliefs enter the Church , and someone will come along ( like Caspian ) , realize the problem , and set to reforming Christianity . Now , the actual book is not nearly so boring as the way I described it . All of what I described is entwined in a magical tale of magic , glory , and believable yet extraordinary people and animals . To the best of my knowledge , only C. S. Lewis is able to talk of such a subject and make it so interesting and fascinating , hiding the real subject deep in a labarynth of powerful allegory . It is very possible that you should miss the whole allegorical meaning if you are not looking for it , so great a job he has done of hiding it , yet it is there , waiting to be uncovered if we look deep enough below the magical surface .
5 #### I am so gratified to see this classic myth penned by C.S. Lewis is now a blockbuster film . The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe is so ripe with Christian metaphor and symbol , one could call it a novel length " parable . " Certian movie reviewers wish to distance this fairy tale from the Christian faith , and they are certainly welcome to try . All of you who read this masterpiece will know otherwise . Jeff Messenger , author of the novel " The Shroud of Torrington . "
5 #### Quoting from the copyright page : For the first time this book is available with full - color complete interior illustrations by Pauline Baynes . Wow , all I was looking for was the Puffin B&W complete illustrations ! Peeking into the book I see blank spaces where illustrations ought to be , but it says * some * illustrations are not shown , so I feel sure they are there & complete . If there are actual numbers on these , I ca n't see them in the picture , though this looks like one & two , so chronological rather than publishing sequence .
4 #### This edition has " each chapter ... graced by one " Pauline Baynes illustration . Why not use ALL of the original illustrations from the Puffin / Penguin editions ? Also , it is in chronological rather than published order .
5 #### I first read this book when I was in middle school and LOVED it . The story has adventure , moral , action and a overall great story . This book is a lot like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings and fans of either or both of those will lover this . I would highly recommend this book for kids who like to read and for adults who like fantasy . I have since re - read the whole series and enjoyed it even more . It really does have a wonderful story that is Christian inspired , but not overtly religious so the people who are n't looking for that will certainly not be bothered by it . So , good luck with your shopping , and please vote for my review because I am in a competition with some others to see who can be the best reviewer among us , I want to win . Lastly , if you are a fan of fantasy or have read this review , I do n't mean to write this for you , I mean this review for someone who has stumbled across this book on Amazon , and is perhaps looking for a good book or present for themselves or someone else . Take care !
5 #### Clive Staples Lewis wrote these magnificent books for children . I first heard them read aloud to me at school , and have read and re - read them several times since ( most recently a year ago , aged 31 ) , each time finding them better than the last . Of interest to me is that CS Lewis was not only an author , but an Oxford scholar and theologian -well known in Christian circles . Many think he wrote the chronicles of Narnia as an introduction for children to the Bible . For example , Jesus represented by Aslan the lion . Whether you take the biblical perspective or read these as pure fantasy , they are wonderful , very descriptive and not just for children .
5 #### Between ages 10 and 14 or so , I kept track of the number of times I 'd read The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe on the backside of the back cover -- my hash - marks total 63 readings . The book was -that- good ! The rest of the series is great , too , of course , it 's just that the introduction really got my attention ! As good as the movie is , the book really is better , and I wholeheartedly recommend that you read the entire series .

3 #### I must say , I ca n't help myself . I tend to disagree with most of the reviewers here . Although Lewis writes the same , bringing in some moral tales and adventures that teach as well as entertain , this one fell short of the entertainment side . It seemed that he was stabbing in the dark too much , that he was grasping for straws , throwing in every possible thing that could happen on a voyage to strange lands . Where The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian were tales of strange adventures , they were more focused and linear which allowed you to become involved with the story , whereas this one jumps around a lot , going through many mini adventures over and over again . It felt , actually , as though it were a compilation of short stories all thrown together to make a book . Although I still enjoyed some of it , it was n't as good as the others , leading to a more disjointed book that is harder to become involved with . Although I would still have to recommend , I would definitely say that this is not one of my favorites of the series .
5 #### Brilliantly written books , without a boring minute Always changing to keep your attention . Peter , Edmund , Susan , and Lucy go from ordinary school children to legendary kings and queens of a far away land forever remembered centuries later . Do n't wait for the movie before reading these classic tales . You will enjoy all of these books regardless of your age . Each time you will get more and different things out of the series .
5 #### This is a great group of books that are not only a good fantisy , but a wonderful example of the life of Christ . A must - read for everybody !
5 #### This 528 - page opus is the edition I have longed for since I discovered the wardrobe as a teen . Though some chasten the publishers for organizing this volume in chronological order , I find that decision a splendid way to arrange a one - volume set . The order , by the way is : 1 . The Magician 's Nephew ; 2 . The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe ; 3 . The Horse and His Boy ; 4 . Prince Caspian ; 5 . The Voyage of the Dawn Treader ; 6 . The Silver Chair ; 7 . The Last Battle . Several aspects of this edition make this a wonderful read for families . Pauline Baynes ' much - loved illustrations have been made even more memorable by colorization . The introduction by step - son Douglas Gresham adds a personal and historical flare . For a one - volume gift edition , you can do no better . Reviewer : Bob Kellemen , Ph . D. , is the author of " Beyond the Suffering : Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , " " Soul Physicians " and " Spiritual Friends . "
4 #### Lewis did it again , creating a wonderful tale for both young and old alike . It is the simplicity of the way he writes , even though we know how complex Lewis can be , that is always appealing to the younger fairy tale readers , but also , surprisingly , the older readers as well . With Prince Caspian we find another good and noble king , a leader that others will follow . It is good to see the tides changed in this the second book of the series as the talking animals are forced into hiding and the Old Narnia is all but gone . As well , in this book , Lewis hints at some tantalizing possibilities for the rest of the series . No matter your age , read this book and series and let yourself be drawn into a fun and simple read that makes you become involved with the characters .
4 #### This book did n't have the same novelty , and it seemed to be paced a little slower than the firt book in the series , but it was still very good . It gives a lot more insight into the world of Narnia , and more information on the surrounding nations and people . If you liked the first book , you 'll like this one as well , though it lacks some of the wonder . But if you 're reading the series for the first time , make sure to read them in the correct order , with this book being second following The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe , no matter how they 're labeled .
4 #### the cronicles af narnia are classics . sadly , they get harder to read as you continue on ... i would reccommend reading each one through twice to get the full understanding because they are hard reads . i assume nothing more challenging than lord of the rings which i heard get really boring towards the middles .
5 #### According to the Wikipedia article on Narnia , although Lewis himself thought the internal order ( American publication)was better than the order in which the seven books were published in England , he did not think it mattered that much . As Lewis said:" .. perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them . I 'm not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published . "
5 #### As the review written above , yeah make sure they are in the right order . But these books are classics enjoyable for both kids and adults . Also seems like they bring it out just in time for personally one of the best books " The lion , witch and the wardrobe " Personally my favorite of the series is the " Last Battle " all of the books are instant classics in fantasy and literature .
5 #### Parents who remember Narnia fondly can now share the magic with their own kids , just in time for Christmas and the movies . " Narnia " is full of lovable characters as well as valuable lessons ( especially the noble sacrifices of Aslan ) that surely no parent can object to . A wonderful gift for Christmas stockings !
5 #### I first read The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe when I was seven , and my mom bought me the boxed set . I loved them then , and recently decided to reread them before the movie comes out in December . These are wonderful books that can be enjoyed for face value as a child and for their deeper meanings as an adult .
5 #### How could anyone improve on the Chronicles of Narnia ? C.S. Lewis is first ; Tolkein is second . No one else is even in the same game . This series is intended for children , but really , much of it is wasted on the young . Read the books to your kids -- or any kid you can shanghai -- they'll love them , but you 'll love them more . I hope the movies will be worthy of the books .
5 #### Ca n't go without this set - especially now that the movies are coming out . Great and easy reads ! Great for bedtime story to read to your children ! Highly recommend this set !
4 #### Let me start by saying that I loved these stories as a child . I read " The Lion , the With and the Wardrobe " in fourth grade as a part of class . I was reluctant to read it and had no interest ( school kids are like that ) but I was sucked into the story very quickly . I had my parents buy me the boxed set and I believe I ended up reading 5 of the 7 books . I absolutely love this story . After at least 40 minutes of Googling , I finally found out what the difference between the " adult " version and the regular version is . Apparently the " adult " version includes some essay material about the literature and each book contains a synopsis of information you 'd need to know from the other books to read the one you 're holding . Other than that , only the packaging is different . The stories all remain the same . I only wish Amazon.com would have provided me this information and saved me the time .

5 #### This vibrant collection of timeless literature is a must read for all children .. No doubt , Walden will have made a masterpiece film ... all the more reason to read your classics and let your imagination envision them prior to seeing how a master captured it and brought it to life . This was always one of my all time favorite stories and I know your children will love it as much as I did growing up . This book was one of the core reasons that I opted to write children 's literature ... As an author of children 's books , I treasure the magic that reading brings to children . This is about as important a tool as any that you will ever arm your children with . Take a shot on these books ... you will not be disappointed .

3 #### In preparation for the new film coming out I sat down this week and re - read the entire Narnia set . When I read the books originally I was just coming off Tolkien and thought that the Narnia books were mostly condescending . The authors voice talks down to children in a way that Tolkien did not and as a child I found that mostly insulting and never finished the series . As an adult I can better appreciate what Lewis was trying to do , and the books are mostly inoffensive fluff . But his world lacks the depth of Tolkien or even modern authors such as David and Leigh Eddings . In the end you have a stellar piece of children 's literature that never rises above the level of children 's literature . On the whole it ends up being a lesser work than Tolkien or even the Oz books by L. Frank Baum .
5 #### Finally got the whole story .... I'd only read the first one when I was a kid .... Great read !
5 #### Prepare to be swept away into an unforgetable place . I read the series when I was a kid then I read them again as an adult . I m excited to see the movie , but skeptical that it will live up to the book .
5 #### It amazes me every time C.S.L. is mentioned in class how many students have read more of his books than any other author I can think of -- though it seems JKR 's Harry Potter series is gaining very quickly on this . Admitedly my community is very conservative and so are most of the students that attend my university , but it is a great indicator of just how influential this member of the Inkblots has been . Since it is also very clear that JRRT has been influential -- at least very influential through the new movies , it seems that this small group of literary geniuses have had great effect on the world . For those of my students who like to write themselves it seems they most appreciate the very texture of the way words are used . Certainly the overall narrative is important as are the values taught . But there is something about the color and feel of the words in the mouth and mind that make these books , and this author simply fantastic .
5 #### Fabulous box set of books . This would make the perfect gift companion to a set of movie tickets ! We all know the storyline , so please forgive me if my review is rather short . This set is beautifully illustrated and well packaged . I 've had my set for over four years and it 's still in great shape . I would also like to add that I agree with those who suggest you read these in their original order . I 've read them through both ways and I prefer the original order hands down . There are certain aspects to the storyline which will make this particular order of reading more enjoyable . 1 ) The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe 2 ) Prince Caspian 3)The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 4 ) The Silver Chair 5 ) The Horse and His Boy 6 ) The Magician 's Nephew 7 ) The Last Battle Cris Cunningham for Amazon.com
5 #### This is a tale of good vs evil .. and will make a fine movie .. its a great book for adults !
5 #### These books are just stunningly beautiful works . They are the kind of childhood fantasy and adventure stories that everyone could afford to get lost in , children and adults alike . There is a subtle moral code and guidance at the core of the books but it is not offensively driven , it is instead educational , highlights responsibility and is barely perceptable . The works do not shirk from presenting the warfare at their core , with honest and frank detail of the emotional cost . Every childhood would be enriched by this box set and it would be a Christmas gift which is endlessly giving , I wore my own copies ragged as a child ! The books are beautiful nostalgic of an old fashioned kind of English childhood too , this in itself is immensley comforting to read but the unfolding fantasy is richly exciting , engaging and compelling . If you have struggled to get children interested in reading then you really should start here , you will struggle instead to prise them away from the books ! Intelligent , amazing and essential reading .
4 #### Prince Caspian is a return visit to Narnia . We return with Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy . The book is a great adventure . Although , the story is not as thrilling as The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , it is a good read . Get a copy and prop your feet up . It is a sweet return trip to Narnia .
5 #### This has always been my favorite Narnia book . I was a Narnia freak all through high school . I checked all the books out from the library and read them again and again . Lucy and Edmond are stuck staying at their obnocious cousin 's house . As they are hiding in lucy 's bedroom from their cousin , Eugene ( the annoying relative ) wanders in and begins , well , annoying them . but the longer they sit and endure their cousin 's company the more they begin to realize . .. the picture on the wall of the ship is moving . the ship , with its magnificent dragon head , begins to toss on the ocean 's churning waves . as the children watch , they are splashed with sea water until , suddenly , they find themselves in the very ocean itself , struggling to stay above the surface in the shadow of the Dawn Treader . once aboard the ship , they meet their old friend Prince Caspian , who is on a fantastic quest you will not want to miss . Enter the world of fairies , dragons , magic books , speaking stars , magic pools and -- best of all -- talking lions . you 'll have fun . i guarantee .
5 #### I 've been a Narnia fan for decades . I had always read the books in published order . This was my first reading in chronological order , and I enjoyed it very much ; it added a new freshness to a familiar story . The one - volume book is gorgeous . It has two - column pages that remind me of Coriakin 's magic book . Pauline Baynes came back after almost fifty years ( ! ) and hand - colored her original illustrations . Lewis always said he wanted Arthur Rackham to make colored illustrations for the Narnia books ; these are just as wonderful as those would have been .
5 #### This is the last book in the NARNIA series . It 's about the end of the world , and everyone dies at the end . This is why most of the reviews you read here are negative . But do n't let that fool you ! C.S. Lewis does some of his best writing here , describing the evil Ape , Shift , and his false prophet ways , which are based on the Book of Revelations . The way Shift mixes heresy and lies with political treason makes for electrifying suspense and sustained intrigue for readers of all ages . One of the things that make the earlier books so smug and tiresome is the way the " good " people always triumph over the evil . In this book , for once you get a real picture of evil and good being mixed together . Some Calormenes turn out to be good . Some Narnians turn out to be bad . Lewis drops the usual smug , white - man 's burden stuff , and lets the " darkies " ( that 's what he actually calls the Calormenes ) win won for a change . Susan did not make it into heaven with the rest of the Pevensie children , but I like to think she grew up to be a swinging hippy chick and had sex with Sidney Poitier . Or with Jimi Hendrix at Monterey . If you know what I mean .
4 #### I know there is much debate about the order in which the Narnia books should be read , and as a child I grew up right in the middle of the upheaval of these books being re - ordered , for a better chronological story line . I believe , after re - reading this novel now , at 22 , this was a wise decision . The basis for The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe starts at the very end of this book . Chiefly , The Magician 's Nephew deals with the adventures of Polly and Digory as they are thrown into not one , but three Other Worlds , so to speak . Through magic rings formed by magic dust they journey to The Wood Between the Worlds , the rocky , barren world of Charn , which puts into play the character of Jadis the White Witch , and eventually they witness the birth of Narnia . This book leaves you yearning to read the rest of the series , and for those of you who are interested , I plan on reviewing the other six books as I re - read them . Also , I really feel these books constitute less of a religious allegory than others seem to think . They can be seen as just an adventure series .
4 #### The Narnia Chronicles are great , fun , a pleassure to read . But the box and the covers of each book are pretty tacky . I loved the old traditional covers .
5 #### Part GULLIVER 'S TRAVELS , part VOYAGE TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH , and totally THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA , the creativity of C. S. Lewis never ceases to amaze me . I am amazed at the way he continually weaves new and different themes through his stories , while remaining faithful to the universe of his creation . I have now read the first five of these books aloud to my daughter . It has become a highlight of our evenings . Neither of us are bored and I do not get tired of reading . Each book rapidly becomes my favorite of the series . This one is no exception . There can be little doubt that this is a classic that can stand the test of time .
4 #### First of all . Read the books starting with " Lion . " This not only provides the initial " Wonderland " experience of Narnia , it also shows Lewis 's brilliance in writing the " prequel " of the " Magician 's Nephew . " Secondly , recognize that Lewis did n't design this as an allegory . He said that the Christian elements just came along with the writing . Yes , the Narnia books provide an understanding of Christianity , but in a true allegory , all events , characters , and settings represent something else . Even though Aslan represents Christ , other characters are n't symbolic of other things in heaven and earth . Overall I gave this a four star because as strong as " Lion " is , having Father Christmas pop in for a visit does n't work . I 'm assuming they 'll take that out of the film because in the book it strikes the reader like an bad note in a moving song . Another weak spot in the series is the " Horse and the Boy . " It 's okay , but not as strong as the rest . However , " Magician 's Nephew " and " The Last Battle " are wonderful evocations of creation and the yet - to - come new creation . Overall , highly recommended , and some of the books are definite 5 's , but overall a 4 .
5 #### Books arrived in excellent condition and are a great value for the money .
5 #### We read the first couple of these books when I was about 12 years old , but I could n't wait and finished them on my own . I have only one thing to say . AMAZING ! ! ! These books have since been re - read by my brother and me many , many times . Words can not describe the true beauty of the world Lewis creates , the down - home fun of his writing style , or the chills Christians and non - Christians alike will recieve upon encountering the Great Lion . Lewis will transport you to the land of Narnia , where creatures talk , witches cast hundred - year winter spells , and goblins , ettins , efreets , wooses , and minators are real . Plot is constantly interjected with The Narrator , presumably Lewis , who keeps the story feeling like somthing Lewis is telling you in front of his fire with a cup of tea at your elbow . Yes , there is a lot of Christian symbolism , and some will want to enjoy the books as merely fantasy . BUT NOT ME ! I can not get enough of the rich , tear - jerking pictures of our faith encapsulated in Aslan . Find him here by knowing him there . My brother and I are SO STOKED FOR THE MOVIE ! ! ! But hey , you got ta read the books first , right?If you have n't stepped into Narnia yet , do yourself a favor ; buy these books , and become as hoplessly addicted as half the world will be after December 9th !
5 #### This handsome and handy volume ( with the original wonderful illustrations by Pauline Baynes ) contains the complete books of the tales of Narnia in the order which Professor Lewis preferred . Much hullabaloo has been made about the story order . In fact , Lewis was n't dogmatic about it . Read them in any order you choose . " The Magicians ' Nephew " was written later to provide some literary backfill for what was , by then , a fairy tale tradition . While it 's informative and a good story on its own , it 's not required to enjoy " The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe , " the first story Lewis actually wrote . Read this one at least before seeing the soon - to - be - released motion picture bearing its name . Without spoiling your journey through Lewis ' world , I can say that Prof. Lewis teaches about love . That 's the fundamental thread running through his work . And not the sort of sappy , weak love that conjurs up pastel paintings and quiet , but a love that demands something from the giver and the givee . A love that can also be rejected . Lewis was certainly allegorizing what he believed to be religious truths , but his stories strike at the core of what it is to be the human that hopes for something bigger than himself , something worth sacrificing for . And for being the sort of human worth being sacrificed for .
4 #### I just ca n't get enough of Lewis and Tolkien . This particular series is one I grew up with . When I received my new set , it took me seven days to read all seven books . The reason I gave only four stars was because I wish the set was n't movie - related . The yellow dot advertising the coming release of " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " on each cover is not particularly attractive .
5 #### I read these when I was child , and I loved them then . I still love them now . The allegory in these books is powerful , and the story is exciting and beautiful . This collection is a must for every family 's library , to be read and re - read for generations to come .
5 #### No doubt , the series contains some of the best books ever written . However , that is not what I 'm arguing . C. S. Lewis actually wrote all 7 stories BEFORE he published them . He published them in a different order so as to create intrest in his stories and market them better . Take the TV show Lost on ABC for example . The do not show the story in chronological order ; they repeatedly flashback to before the plane crash so as to create questions while answering only a few at a time . I 'm not comparing the two stories together ( Lewis would win any day ) , but to say that they printed them with The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe first to create questions as well as a great story . Later books answered some of those questions while creating more until they were all answered by the close of the series . Scholastic first decided to print them in chronological order because that 's way C. S. Lewis wrote them . HarperTrophy followed suit in this edition .
4 #### I bought this series in anticipation of the movie coming out in December . As a child , I remember reading the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe but none of the others . I just started and finished the first in the series , The Magician 's Nephew and was sucked in at the very beginning and I 'm excited to get on with the next books but I have a feeling the series is going to want me to wish the story never ended . This book , about magical rings transporting people to other worlds , is a fast and easy read but I highly recommend it for ALL ages . And if you 've read it when you were younger , I suggest reading it again . I fell asleep last night thinking of the far away place that these children went to . Not many books are able to do that ! !
5 #### Great edition of the Narnia colelction , I bought it to start reading the stories with my daughter
5 #### The chapters of the book where Aslan sings and starts the creation of Narnia are beautiful . He creates the animals and gives some the ability to speak . We meet the first King and Queen of Narnia . These are my favorite parts of a good book .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia is probably one of the best written and most charming multi - volume fantasies written in the 20th century , and it has become a classic , attracting a near - cult following comparable to fans of Star Trek , the Lord of the Rings and J. K. Rowlings ' Harry Potter books . This is such a good series of books that they are eminently suited to adults , who can appreciate the books ' allusions that are lost on the young . C. S. Lewis ' Christian background comes out in the Christian elements of Aslan 's creation of Narnia , his sacrifice at the big stone table , his leadership against the forces of evil , and his triumph at the Last Battle , as Aslan the lion is a Christ figure . Altogether excellent reading for anyone . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book ... I love that the books are all in one place and the book is bound well . For those who travel a lot this is a hefty book to lug around but the artwork , great binding and extra essay by Lewis make it a wonderful addition to my collection !
5 #### I do n't know why , but my daughter did n't care as much for this book as for the other tales of Narnia . During one particularly intense passage she almost stopped reading it . However , my nephew and other guys I talked to found this to be their favorite book of the series . This action packed book certainly has a lot of adventure , swordplay , and suspense . This book also has more explicit Christian themes than some of the other tales from the Narnia series . After centuries of absence the land of Narnia forgets Aslan and disbelieves the old legends . In this book Aslan returns and sets things straight . The themes in this work are so strong that many might forget the quality of the work and judge it merely on their personal like or dislike of Christianity . This book presents an interesting perspective . In many tales of magic a character summons up a being or person from another time and place . This story is told from the perspective of the beings who were summoned up ! Lewis ' personal title for the book was something like " Drawn Back to Narnia " , but this title was rejected . P.S. Do n't jump ahead to the conclusion , but the last page sets up a change and new possible theme that will need to be fleshed out in a later book .
5 #### I loved reading these books . I love listening to them . I am satisfied with the product quality and faithfulness to the original . I would recommend this product to someone who has loved reading these books and someone who is new to these wonderful books . Enjoy !
4 #### I purchased this set for my 10 yr old grandson and just had to read them first . Am so glad I did . The books kept me enthralled one after the other . I can not wait for my grandson to read them now so that we can share the fun . These books stretch the imagination and they have under - lying morals and good attitudes as well . I highly recommend them to all .
5 #### Seven books by C.S. Lewis all in one book . Great for young readers and those who like to dream .
2 #### I 'm a big fantasy reader . Over the years , I have conquered all or most of Lord of the Rings , Harry Potter , Redwall ( Though it 's been years since I 've finished one of those books ) , the whole Pyrdain thing , and Eragon . Not to mention that one of my all - time favorite games is Final Fantasy VII and I used to be an obsessed Magic player . Call me a dork , but it 's true . Anyway , this is some really overrated , boring stuff . Granted , I liked the Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , but hated the rest . I do n't even know why I suffered through this . The worst book is , by far , Prince Capisan . Here 's my reading of two chapters : " The children were walking and decided to sit down . ' I 'm hungry ' , said one . ' I want food ' . So they walked , by putting one foot in front of the other , through the grass , which was colored green and under the sky that was blue . Another child saw his reflection in the water . ' Hey , ' he said , ' That 's me ! Now how am I in the water ? ' So then they stumbled across an old stone building made of old stones ... " Do you get my gist ? Many people will reccomend this , but I am not one of them .
5 #### This is a wonderful set for the whole family . We have enjoyed each book , read by different people , very much . Where we live , we must drive quite often , so the children and I are enjoying each story and the various readers , who lend their talents to each tale .
5 #### Yes , I grew up reading these books when the series still began with the exquiste " The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe , " and I still love the original ordering . However , there is a strong consensus in the publishing industry that the chronological order is what Lewis himself preferred and that this order has merits all its own . In 1957 Lewis wrote a letter to an American boy in which he wrote , " I think I agree with your order [ i.e. , chronological ] for reading the books more than with your mother 's . The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks . " Give this order a chance and you may find yourself delighted and surprised . These books are so beautiful it would be difficult for them to be ruined by any choice of sequencing . Lewis was , after all , a reader of medieval literature , in which chronological order was the accepted fashion for structuring a narrative . He seemed to find the variation found within that structure endlessly amazing .
5 #### The fact that so many years after publishing these books are number 41 on Amazon is a testament to their ranking as one of the top , if not the top childrens series of all time . Wonderfully written , these books are loved by people everywhere from my 3 year - old sister to 70 year - old adults . I do n't think it is necessary to go into detail about the books , because others have done that , and most already know the basics . I highly recommend them , and I think you ought to buy them before the movie comes out in December ( hopefully they have n't screwed up the plot too badly ) . There is a debate about whether the magicians nephew should be the first in the series or not , but I ask , does it really matter ? Read it whenever you want , you will still get the same satisfaction from the series .
5 #### C S Lewis said " .. a children 's story which is enjoyed only by children only by children is a bad children 's story . " I first read The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe in my 20s , and thereafter devoured the other six tales of Narnia . Every time I reread one --and I have read each of them many times since -- I find something new . I was delighted to be able to read them to my own children who , as they got older , could read the books to themselves . These stories are classics and in my opinion the best children 's books written by a modern writer . They were written by Lewis during a very dark time in history -- World War II -- and the faith and hope they contain must have provided a refuge and a beacon for him during that period . These are tales full of adventure and wonder , populated with unforgettable and very human characters , each working out his or her destiny in a world of witches , goblins , talking animals , tree - nymphs and centaurs . I envy anyone approaching them for the first time .
5 #### The reading of a book is really a performance , and this set includes many great ones . A look at the list of readers will tell you all you need to know about the quality . They do justice to a great story .
5 #### The book got to me very fast and it was in pristine condition . It was an amazing deal for such a great collection . Thanks for the great book that I will treasure for years to come and hopefully read to my future children some day
5 #### Just like the other books in the Chronicles of Narnia , I could n't put this one down ... the thing you have to understand is that this book takes place BEFORE the Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe , though I guess it was published after and is listed later in my set of books ... however , I reccomend that you read them in the order they were published ... here 's why ... if you read the Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe first , you will find out about all of these neat things and people and then you can read this one and find out where they came from and the history behind it ... indeed you will read about the very creation of Narnia in this book ... it 's much more fun this way , IMO ... anyway , the book is about chance meetings between creatures from different worlds , due to a boy 's uncle discovering a method for traversing the barriers between said worlds . Despite the strong Christian overtones throughout the series , Lewis does manage to paint an interesting and creative account of the creation and destruction of worlds ... I was especially interested to find out who the witch from the Lion , witch , wardrobe was and where she came from ... also you find out neat little things like why the wardrobe was magical and why there was a lampost in Narnia ...
5 #### I just re - read these as an adult , and I love them even more than I did as a child . It is a priceless masterwork ! The alagorical teachings in it are extremely well thought out and written , as are the characters and story . One of the ( many ) triamphs of this book is that it is great literature for Christian and non - Christian alike -- it appeals very well on both levels . In my opinion , one of the best fantasy series ever written . He and his friend , Tolkien , have pretty much dominated the genre !
5 #### This is a great Narnia collection . The books are illustrated with full color pictures and bound with thick bright paper that has a nice feel to it . There seems to be an ongoing debate about the correct order to read these books , and this edition notes on the inside cover that CS Lewis intended for the books to be read in the order presented by this collection .
5 #### I read this when I was about 7 . It was excellent . Now I plan to read book two sometime this year . Though , I do n't rememeber much of this book . I tried finishing book two but I could n't and now I will to finish reading Narnia . This book was excellent .
5 #### I am 14 and I bought this and I absolutlely love it ! ! It 's so much than a book . it draws you into a world that Clyde calls ' narnia ' . I love it and kids will enjoy this wild ride
5 #### The stories are spectacular , C.S. Lewis shows off with this series , it is wonderfull for kids and adults as well . It has been based in many precepts from the Bible , if you want to take advantage of that I recommend A Family Guide to Narnia : Biblical Truths in C.S. Lewis 's the Chronicles of Narnia
5 #### This is a FANTASTIC Audio production . The actors reading the books do a superb job : to the point that at times I do n't believe it is the same person reading the different parts . They put such enthusiasm and character in to the voices and the readings that it makes the book come alive . If I have to mention a criticism it would be this : I tried listening to this on a stereo system but the volume variations in the readers intonation is too much . At times I had to turn the volume on the stereo way up to hear the softer parts of the recital and then it would be too loud . Listening to this on headphones is the way to go ! < a href= " [ ... ] " >
5 #### This classic collection of books by C.S. Lewis , known as " The Chronicles Of Narnia " is one hell of a read . Do n't let the length put you off by any means , IT 'S THAT GOOD . 700 + pages of PURE ENJOYMENT . The first movie based on this enchanting series , with " The Lion , The Witch , And The Wardrobe " as the subtitle ( the full title being " The Chronicles Of Narnia : The Lion , The Witch , And The Wardrobe " ) is coming out December 9 , 2005 and is produced by Walt Disney Pictures / Walden Media , whose previous collaboration , " Around The World In 80 Days " was a huge hit . I guess they 'll make movies of the other books based on the success of the first installment . I do n't know if they 'll incorporate " The Magician 's Nephew , " chronologically the first one in the series , not in order of publication - and the way Professor Lewis wanted them to be read ; see the small print on the page after the title and before the " Table Of Contents " , ( Will somebody please correct me if I 'm wrong ? ) into the first movie or make a film out of that book all by itself . I recommend reading the books first before seeing the film . Rated G.
3 #### Some people might think that my opinion here is biased , but I 'm going to write it anyway . I 'm a hardcore fantasy reader and so naturally I HAD to read the CoN. I found that it was n't as amazing as I would have liked . First of all if you are used to long quests and epic battles , the CoN really throw you off . Quests sometimes happen in merely a page or two and the battles are mild to moderate . The characters usually have mildly interesting backgrounds , and most of the places that could have brought a lot of depth to the story are cut short . I do n't want to ramble too much but the general idea is that the CoN are not for readers who really love series like the Lord of the Rings , DragonLance , or The Death Gate cycle . If you are into short , cute fantasy adventures , then the CoN are great for you .
5 #### It has taken me , a serious reader , nearly six decades to discover this book in a series of C.S. Lewis , and I loved it from the beginning . I am now reading other works by this author . I had purchased the illustrated book of this title , for younger children , recently and my five year old grandson was immediately enthralled when his mother read it to him ( he now knows this book from memory ! ) This prompted me to read the adult version . The writing is so witty and understandable ; I now understand why the entire series by this author is so popular , even after all these years . One of the reviews suggests it should be read at least three times in one 's life , beginning at age five . I agree . There are so many reviews detailing the content of this book of good and evil , of young children finding themselves in another world and learning how to cope ; I can not add much to them except to say , just take the plunge , read the book , and I guarantee you will thoroughly enjoy the adventure .
4 #### When peter Susen Edmund And Lucy travel back to Narnia they find them selfs In A thick wood as they travel deeper into the brush they find an old ruin of A castle wich turns out to be The remains of Cair Parvle ( not sure if I spelled that right)They find all of there old things and meet A dwarf who tells them about Prince caspian And what happened when they left soon they find there way to Aslans how and help Prince Caspian fight against his evil uncle . I thought it was A bit sad because everything is gone and dark and humans are in most of Narnia Not talking animals in the end its more happy though . Oh yeah I 'm sorry I said Susie in my last reveiw I ment susen .
5 #### I love these books . I have loved them since I was about five , and my mother read them to me . While I have never owned THIS particular set , I know that the books themselves far outshadow anything else I have ever read . The Narnia books are classics , NO MATTER WHAT ORDER THEY'RE PUT IN . I understand that the issue of order is a sensitive point for some people , and I respect that , but I do n't understand why someone would give a series only 1 star , simply because of the numbers on the cover . And yes , I also respect the opinions that the Narnia series are racist and sexist , but I disagree with them . The female characters are not secondary to the male ones in any way . In fact , Lucy often makes her brothers look like idiots . The Calormens are dark skinned , yes , and some of them are the villians of the stories , but the greatest villian in the series , the White Witch , is not dark , but extremely PALE . And it is never claimed that all the Caloremens are evil . Individuals among them show different traits . Some show bravery , loyalty , and honor , while others are treacherous . Anyway , I love these books , and always will . While , on occasion , I may call something else my ' favorite book ' , I know that the Narnian series will always outshine anything else I ever read .
4 #### These books are great for the brainy reader because some of the things could be very confusing ! ! These stories are written by a true author who writes from the heart ! !
4 #### I read this book because I saw it in the library and I felt like reading a fantasy . Its very short , I read it in a few hours , but its packed with adventure and magic , quite a charming tale . I would definitely recommend it to children as well as adults . I just have one question , why was the servant girl having such a great day ? ! ? !
3 #### This is the fifth ( chronologically ) Chronicle of Narnia ( after The Magician 's Nephew ; The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ; The Horse and His Boy ; Prince Caspian , and before The Silver Chair ; The Last Battle ) . This book takes Edmund and Lucy Pevensie , along with their annoying bully of a cousin Eustace , once again to the land of Narnia , more precisely on the Great Eastern Ocean , on Prince Caspian 's ship , the Dawn Treader . Caspian and Reepicheep the valiant talking mouse , are indeed on a quest to the Lone Islands , where they hope to find the seven lords Caspian 's tyrannic uncle Miraz sent into exile . On this trip , the children will meet dragons and merpeople , as well as strange one - legged creatures called the Dufflepuds . Lucy will again be very brave , and Eustace will learn to become a better person . Together they wil travel to the End of the World , in search of Aslan 's country . I 'm sorry I do n't have many more comments to add since the previous volumes . I liked this book , but I ca n't say whether it 's better than the others or not . I just was n't captivated by the story , except maybe in a chapter or two . The overly talkative Reepicheep tended to get on my nerves , and although the passage with the boat treading the sea of lilies was quite enchanting , the ending was too allegorical for me . Gosh am I getting to old ?
5 #### The Magicians Nephew is a grand story that tells of the creation of Narny , why there is a witch and the story of Digory and Polly . It explains allot that seems a bitt odd like the lamp post in later stories , who Aslan is and how Narnia was created . jadis the witch is later the witch in the lion , the witch and the wardrobe and I must say that I really like this story as the description is stupendous and the charachters are well done indeed . I also simply love the illustrations and I found the story to be just as well done as the of authors such as Tolkien , and Lewis Carroll . I can not wait to read the next book in the Narnia series .
5 #### Every time I read these books I get more out of them . They are wonderful for young readers . Fantastic imaginary lands , brave boys and girls , and cautions about bad behavior . But they are wonderful for adults also . I recommend reading them in an order other than numbered . I ALWAYS recommend to those who have not read them before to read the Lion , Witch and Wardrobe first and then the others in whatever order you decide . Enter the Wardrobe first and then come further up and further in .
4 #### Please note that this is ONE large hardcover book containing the 7 Narnia novels , not a box set ( as shown in the " search inside this book . " ) It is a beautiful shelf book , but at almost 5 pounds not something you will be carrying around to read . That said , The Chronicles of Narnia are wonderful stories , enchanting for children and enjoyable , thought - provoking stories for adults . The C. S. Lewis fantasies remain as some of my favorite stories ever . Enjoy !
3 #### I was looking for a high - quality edition of the Chronicles of Narnia for my daughter . I thought this new boxed set looked really attractive with the colored illustrations and quality paper . Why did the publisher have to ruin it with the big , stupid yellow circles screaming about a " major motion picture " on the box and on the cover of each book ? Marketing people truly have no taste or aesthetic sense .
5 #### The reviews on this book do it justice . You now know MOST of what you need to know to decide whether to purchase this book . My only addition is the suggestion that adult readers purchase THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA to read to children a chapter at a time . I started doing this for my daughter 's bedtime story . Now she shuts the TV off at 9:00 and hunts me down to read her a chapter . IF the thought of tackling 7 books seems daunting , begin with THE LION , THE WITCH , AND THE WARDROBE . It is easy to read and can easily stand alone . Oh , by the way , we started this practice of a chapter a night when she was a child and we still do it now that she is in high school . It certainly beats TV , and it sparks conversations that many parents only dream of .
5 #### Well , first I was in the ballet of " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . " Then I thought " Well scince I 'm in it , I 'll need to study my characters . " so I went and bought the book . I relly liked it . So after I was done with the preformances , I went and bought the whole set . It includes all seven books consisting : " The Magician 's nephew " , " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " , " The horse and his boy " , " Prince Caspian " , " The voyage of the dawn Treader " , " The Silver Chair " and " The Last Battle . " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe is my favorite out of all the books . I recomend these books for everyone , C.S. Lewis is a wonderful author . They are coming out with " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " in theaters on December 9th and I am very excited for it !
5 #### This is " The Chronicles of Narnia " like you 've never read or seen them before -- all in one hardbound set , in the chronological order Lewis preferred that they be read . To top it off , it 's beautifully illustrated . " The Chronicles " are C. S. Lewis ' beloved children 's fantasy series loved also by adults . In them , Lewis chronicles the battle between good and evil , God and the Devil , Aslan the Lion ( the Christ Figure ) and the White Witch ( the Satan Figure ) . Lewis ' turn of a phrase is worth the price of the book with gems describing evil 's hold on Narnia as " always Winter but never Christmas " and Aslan 's description of his " resurrection " as " magic from before the dawn of time . " The stories are beautifully told and captivating in and of themselves . Add to that the subtle allegories , images , and parables of good versus evil , and you have a book that will capture your children 's imagination and perhaps change their lives forever -- for the better . Buy it now , before everyone else does , because come December 2005 , " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " will be released as a big screen Hollywood epic with the same mass marketing , incredible story telling , and awesome special effects of the " Lord of the Rings " trilogy . Reviewer : Dr. Robert W. Kellemen is the author of " Soul Physicians : A Theology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , " " Spiritual Friends : A Methodology of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , " and the forthcoming " Sacred Companions : A History of Soul Care and Spiritual Direction . "
5 #### One of those little Amazon quirks , if I 'm buying an audio CD of a book that 's been around for decades I would expect a review of the performance of the reader and not reviews of the book itself . Branagh does a great job with this first ( chronologically story wise ) Narnia book . He 's got an affable way about him and I hope he continues to do the remainder of the series .
5 #### For a book that by its very nature is forced to cover much more exposition for the Narnia Chronicles than the other books , C.S. Lewis ' The Magician 's Nephew is delightful in its own right . Originally , it explained much that had delightfully gone before , although now tha if is it being sold as first in the series , it sets the stage for much that goes after . Either way , the book manages to be quite funny , touching , a little scary while still explaining much of the magic found in the Narnia books , particularly the first one actually written and published , The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe . C. S. Lewis handles all the various themes in the book with a light touch and keeps the adventure moving along swiftly . Along with The Last Battle , it is among the most obviously Christian of the books but it still keeps a tight grip on itself as first and foremost an entertaining fantasy story for children .
5 #### Been a fan of Narnia forever , and decided to read the books in ' order ' ( although it can be debated what the right order is exactly ) . I liked almost everything in this book . The meeting og Digory and Polly , the strange passageway between their houses , the ' mad ' uncle Andrew and his aspirations to become a magician , his magic rings and the making of Narnia by strong and brave Aslan , the lion . I was also in awe of the description of the doomed kingdom Charns , where the evil queen / witch Jadis ruled . Looking much forward to read the rest .
5 #### I read this collection in its entirety aloud over our first homeschooling year with my 5th grader . She loved it ! It is a great book for readig aloud to older children , because of the great prose and amazing fantasy story - telling . It has interesting little illustrations throughout the book , but not too much to detract from the story . You have to use your imagination with Narnia ! Every child should have these fabulous stories read to them ( not too young , though . )
5 #### As a child , my dad would read this to me and my brother every night before we went to sleep . We loved it and made it through the books many times . Later , I went back and read them and was blown away by how deep they are . Kids will love the books for the story , but adults will also enjoy the religious symbolism in the book . I guess that is why my Dad could stand to read it to us night after night . These books are fantastic - every one of them has its great moments . Also , if you like these , you might also look at Lewis 's lesser - known space trilogy ( " Out of the Silent Planet " , " Perelandra " and " That Hideous Strength " ) . These do n't get nearly the acclaim that the Narnia books do , but are very good in their own right . The three books are kind of a progression , but do n't need to be read in order . Also , the first book is science fiction , the second fantasy and the third a mix of sci - fi , fantasy and horror . If you only read one of the three , read " Perelandra " .
5 #### I had never heard about ` The Chronicles of Narnia ' till some days ago . As I was browsing through Amazon.com Books section , I noticed this wonderful series , and after reading a brief review , immediately purchased the whole set . " The Magician 's Nephew " is the first book in the book , and a wonderful start to the series . The story starts off with Digory and Polly , two children who decide to peek into an abandoned house next to Digory 's house . When they accidentally stumble into someone else 's room , their adventure into another world begins . The story of ` The Magician 's Nephew ' is filled with magic and excitement that will make a person of any age interested in it right from the start . C. S. Lewis uses simple words that makes reading the story simple and keeps the reader engrossed in it . The story is fast - paced without a dull moment , and indirectly delivers a profound message in the end that is very thought - provoking . I am off to read the next book of the series , " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " where I can enter a world where horses can fly , where animals can talk , where life is born and where the excitement never ends . Read this book today and enter the world of Narnia , where you will soon forget about all your worries .
5 #### I truly enjoyed reading this series when I was a teenager . To dwell and soar through these books took me to another world -- Narnia . I was with the characters through it all and experienced everything they experienced . I still have the set in my book collection . When I am feeling I need to go back to a child - like state for a time ; I will reach for one of these books and go to my other world away from the problems of this world ! They have great moral and hidden truths within these pages so beware ... you might learn a thing or two with this set .
5 #### This complete collection of the Chronicles of Narnia includes all the stories put together in the order in which C. S. Lewis meant them to be read instead of the order in which they were published . For example The Magician 's Nephew was written several years after The Chronicles of Narnia was started but was meant to be read first . In this collection it is placed first as Mr. Lewis meant it to be read . In addition it includes a short essay from C. S. Lewis on the subject of Writing for Children . This is a massive work of almost 800 pages . Most readers will be at least somewhat familiar with The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe as it has been in several smaller children 's books and even some television specials , but it is only the beginning of the Chronicles of Narnia . The complete chronicles include The Magician 's Nephew , The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe , The Horse and His Boy , Prince Caspian , The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , The Silver Chair , and The Last Battle . This is a high quality hardbound book that will survive the typical abuse of children when reading it . If you liked The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe you will love the complete collection . The Chronicles of Narnia , one of the all - time classics of children literature , is a highly recommended read and this publication of it should be considered for all public libraries and private collections .
4 #### The suggested age range of readers for this series is 9 to 12 years . I just read it at 35 and I found it stimulating and inspirational . The stories and characters are allegorical , but just because there is a message there does n't mean it is n't entertaining . I enjoyed the imagery , the introspection , the dialogue , the settings , all of it . A truely great read .
5 #### In this , the last book in the Chronicles of Narnia series , Lewis again uses a compelling story to speak deep truths about the end of the world , God 's judgment , the decision each of us must make at the end of time , and the dangers of false religion and false prophets . My five year old son , with whom I 've been reading the series , was again transfixed by Lewis 's evocative telling of the falling of eternal night on Narnia . At the end , we were both in tears but joyful , and he wanted to start again on the first book , so that 's what we did .
5 #### I read " The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe " as a child and was thrilled to see the adult edition hardcover in stores ! I returned to the land of Narnia and found more enjoyment in the pages than when I had first read them so long ago . I had a better appreciation for the imagery and references to religion than when I was just a kid . Lewis weaves such an intricately detailed web throughout all seven tales , which are all conveniently encased in this one edition . The stories are also organized into what is said to be Lewis ' preferred order . ' The Chronicles of Narnia ' are , in my opinion , among the best works of fiction of our time . Lewis ' extraordinary talent is able enthrall both children and adults alike . I would recommend ' The Chronicles of Narnia ' to anyone -- child and adult -- who wishes to escape to a fantastic world where beasts talk , dwarves and mythical creatures run about , children can be great kings , queens and warriors , and the truly good ultimately prevail .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia was the book series my 5th grade class voted all - time favorite . Captivating and imaginative as a children 's book series , but thoughtful and meaningful for all ages . This book series starting with the Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe and explores themes of magic , saving the world , and having faith in yourself in order to overcome doubt and insecurity years before the Harry Potter phenomenon . A classic in this religious - like fantasy genre , this is a stable fiction series mainly for children , but applies to any age . Along this line of genre , also recommended are the Gifted Girls Series by Victoria London and the Wrinkle in Time books by Madeleine L ' Engel . Fill your purpose - driven child 's library with these wonderful children 's books .
5 #### Reading The Magician 's Nephew to my five year old son , we encountered the same kind of wonder that we enjoyed with the first in the Narnia series , The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . The strength of this book is the portrayal , even more developed than in the previous Narnia works , of Aslan the Great Lion as the ultimate good , the Creator , the Song Made Flesh , the God who became a Beast for our sakes ... you get the idea . Lewis seems to have tapped into something true and beautiful , especially in the narrative of how Aslan brought Narnia into being , and also how He deals with human sin and tragedy . Spellbinding for the 46 year old , moving and beneficial for the five year old . Highly , highly recommended .
5 #### " The Chronicles of Narnia " is a series of seven short books that take place mostly in a mystic relm named " Narnia " . Most books involve a small group of young children from our world traveling to Narnia and back . Narnia is a land with talking animals , kings and queens , fauns , an evil sorceress , swords and bows , sailing ships , giants , dragons , and other mystic creatures . There are mystic creatures everywhere but relatively little magic , all things considered . The books contain an occasional picture , at the beginning of each chapter , and are intended for independent readers of ages perhaps 9 to 15 . Stories are fast paced adventure stores that contain very little violence . I read these books over & over again when I was young and enjoyed them all greatly . The first book has decidedly Christian overtones -- not openly discussed or presented , but similarity to the story of Jesus is pretty obvious . The other six books do n't have religous themes . All books gently encourage good behavior by examining the problems associated with fear , greed , jealousy , bullying , and so forth . Each book depicts children making mistakes and learning from those mistakes , in a gentle manner that is fun and inoffensive . I warmly recommend " The Chronicles of Narnia " for any young reader .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with this , no matter how old or young you are ! These are are a wonderful set of 7 books . Each tale with draw you into it 's world and make you feel like you are actually there , experiencing the adventure along with the charcters . I picked up the first book and could n't put the box down until I had finished the entire series . I looked forward at the end of each book to reading the next one . The only disappointment is that the series ended !
5 #### This book is a true adventure for any child , even a child at heart . I was sorry to read that the author died when I was 2 , but now that I know about these books the author will live on forever for me . The Magician 's Nephew includes magic , mystery , adventure , and everything else that could keep a child glued to the pages of a book . I give this book 5 stars and recommend it to all kids , young and old :)
5 #### I ate this set up when I was young ; I was always looking for the extraordinary in the mundane and a world just behind the closet door was cool . Years later I enjoyed other C. S. Lewis books ( That Hideous Strength was amazing . ) I do wonder if these books hold up at all as fun reading ; I had yet to read JRR , and JK Rowling was many years away . Harry Potter seems to supply the same precept ; ordinary kid finds wonder and magic just out of sight . Also I became the complete atheist I am today within a few years of reading these so do n't fret about any " christian indoctrination . " We can make up our own minds - well most of us .
4 #### In the third book of the Narnia series , CS Lewis takes on progressive education , consistent with the themes found in his The Abolition of Man . Of course , this is but secondary to his main purpose of portraying spiritual struggle and redemption . My five year old son , to whom I 'm reading the whole series , was rapt through most of it , thanks to Lewis 's vivid imagery . At the end , when the children learn that they have to leave Narnia and never come back but that Aslan is present in their world under another name , I stopped and asked my son " And what is that name for Aslan in our world ? " He smiled and said , " Jesus . " Good lad .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia are books that I began reading as a child , and I to read and re - read them as an adult . They are among the best children 's books ever written . Of the Chronicles , this is my absolute favorite ( with Voyage of the Dawn Treader a close second ) .
4 #### Prince Caspian , the second in CS Lewis 's Chronicles of Narnia , was more difficult to read ( at least to my five year old ) than the first book in the series , The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , largely because in the second installment Lewis indulges too much his passion for pagan folklore and legend . So you have a lot of water nymphs , tree spirits , fauns , satyrs , and dryads about . Somehow it 's all supposed to work in an allegorical Christian context . I think it does , but I 'm in my 40s . My son needed relief , so I skipped parts and stopped to explain others . It still held his attention , because even at its most allegorical , Lewis 's writing is captivating even for small children . Looking forward to the next book ....
5 #### The Chronicles are truly great literary accomplishments , rivaling Tolkien 's Lord of the Ring . There is something in here for everyone . For religious , there is the wealth of religious imagery and links , while for non - religious , there is a whole new world to explore , full of adventure , honor , and imagination .
5 #### Everything about these stories is amazing . The richness of C.S. Lewis ' descriptions makes this book have a life of it 's own . The characters are fully three dimensional , from courageous Lucy , the evil White Witch , and wise Aslan . The book has Judeo - Christian overtones , but they are subtly woven in to the stories . I mention this only because I do not like to be beaten over the head with good vs. evil and thought other readers might be concerned . The book is a fantasy , but not in a Dungeons & Dragon 's sense . It is instead one of the loveliest sets of fairie tales written . Ostensibly for children it can be read and enjoyed by adults as well . Five stars does not begin to approach it 's excellence .
5 #### My son got these for Christmas . He loved them . He has read the whole set and we even got the CDs and listened to them on our last road trip . The stories are wonderful . You really ca n't get much better than this . Even this 30 - something Mom could n't wait to read the next book .
5 #### Anybody coming to this page probably knows who great these timeless stories are . If C.S. Lewis had come along 50 years later we would be watching these great movies on the screen along with Potter and Lord of the Rings . These books are easily as entertaining as those books are . The reason for my review is to applaud the quality of the books in this set themselves . I have a old set of mismatched books from back when I bought them one at a time while reading them the first time ( too many years ago to want to remember ) . I bought this set to prepare to read to the kids and grandkids . I 'm happy to report that this set is so well made that I 'm sure it will be around for decades . The books are attractive , durable and the type if very easy to read . The publisher could have justified a much higher price . If you love the books - this is a set for you to enjoy for years !
4 #### This is a great bit of literature , whether it 's an allegory or not . Milton 's Paradise Lost refers back ; it 's a classic . This book is rich in metaphor and symbolism . The storyline is fantastic in nature ; kids who find a whole other world . All seven books amount to a full size book today , really . It 's not that much different in size from Harry Potter . This is a great story , well told , with characters that you truly are interested in and care about . You wo n't feel like it 's too Christian ( I 'm NOT one ) and you wo n't feel like it 's too secular . It 's just a story that flows and swells and is fun to read .
4 #### As a child who grew up listening to the Chronicles of Narnia , it has been a pleasure all over again to introduce them to my children . We bought the CD to listen to in the car . My kids loved this one especially since it was set on a ship . We vacationed at the ocean this year so it was very timely . They ask to hear it over and over again . In a video age it is nice to offer my children an alternative , a real oppportunity to excerise their imaginations ! Planning on collecting all 7 books on CD .
5 #### ... after Lord of the Rings , and easily the best children 's series ever written . ' Nuff said !
2 #### You said it , neilicus107 . That the publisher would reorder these books according to their boneheaded idea of chronology is an outrage . It 's no different from taking all the flashback parts from a book or a film and putting it at the beginning . I 'm glad that I still have my old Penguin edition , and will be giving that to my nephew instead .
5 #### This is truly one of the best series . If your having a hard time getting your child to read . After they 've finished reading Harry Potter . Try to introduce them to the Narnia collection . It is just as wonderful and vivid like Harry Potter . It 's different of course . However , it 's wonderful because the characters are so crisp . The story lines are creative and you honestly never get bored .
2 #### This book goes noware but down . The begging is good and then in the middle goes down ward . It 's o.k . at times but fore die hard fantasy fans like Harry Potter stay away .
4 #### Ever read Jeremiah ? The scripture is literally written as though scraps of paper were gathered and taped together without regard to order . This is designed much the same , which is what happens when one gets away from the silly constraints of cause and effect . As long as certain stories are after each other ( Prince Caspian / Dawn Treader and Silver Chair / Final Battle ) , it makes sense regardless . Actually , suspense is n't everything in a story , and it actually makes sense if you use the later part to provide background that would come otherwise only after reading several of these . For some odd reason , it makes as much sense this way .
5 #### This story chronicles the beginning of all the other stories . The writing style for this book and wording makes this novel enjoyable even to young adults .
5 #### The Last Battle by C.S. Lewis is the last book of a seven book series entitled The Chronicles of Narnia . I enjoyed reading this book very much . It was full of adventure and it kept the reader in suspense throughout the whole book . This book also has great imagery . It takes the reader feel as if he or she is actually with the characters in the book . This book would be a fantastic choice for a few different people . Anyone who enjoys reading adventure stories will enjoy this book . It is also great for kids because it has a lot of life lessons in it . This book would also appeal to anybody who enjoys a few fictional elements .
4 #### C.S. Lewis 's The Magician 's Nephew is a fast paced fantasy that takes place in multiple worlds . By magic , a young child , Digory , is transported to a different universe . He encounters many evils and must overcome great peril . Being courageous and fearless along the way , he meets new friends and animals to help him . There are also elements that help relate the story to life 's relationships and lessons . If you are one who enjoys an adventure that is out of this world 's constraints than read this book . It features a younger kid 's adventure and may relate to a younger audience better , but older people can appreciate it as well . If talking animals intrigue you , you might like this book . If you ca n't stand things out of the ordinary this book is definitely not for you .
5 #### This delightful edition of the Chronicles of Narnia benefits from the seven tales being in their correct logical sequence , as well as from the most famous , enchanting illustrations of Pauline Baynes , who depicts everything from the Elysian magical presence of fauns and dryads to the ghastly apparition of Tash , with great skill and sensitivity . I first read this as a youngster , and it grabbed my imagination in a way that no other book ( with the possible exception of Lord of the Rings ) has done since . Now , revisiting the land of Narnia over a quarter of a century later , was like an unexpected joyous meeting with a long lost friend . Children will be captivated with the adventures and more mature readers will appreciate the hidden depths , as well as forgetting their troubles by being transported back to happier , more carefree days . A genuinely magnificent work that gets into your dreams and never truly leaves you .
5 #### I am partial to The Chronicles of Narnia as to no other books because they were my favorite books as a child . I read and re - read them to the point that I wore out two sets of these books ! Now that I have children of my own , I bought this beautiful , one - volume edition of the Narnia series as a gift to myself and my family . Quite apart from the literary value of these masterpieces , the book itself is wonderful : it 's printed on quality paper with the same artwork I remember from my old , worn - out sets , but much improved with beautiful colors . This edition of the book looks as magical as the stories feel ! Without any reservations , I recommend this edition to anyone who wants to share in the magic and possibility of Narnia .
5 #### C.S. Lewis is a master at spinning a tale of intrigue for young people . This book was so much fun to read . I love writing ; this book made me love it even more . As an author who loves to create alternate worlds for readers to explore , I can learn so much from C.S. Lewis . Digory and Polly embark on an adventure leading them to other worlds - new and old - in a novel that may have been written for children , but holds up well for adults ... at least this adult thinks so . I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun journey .
5 #### The series is a masterpiece of children 's literature that invites every adult to return to a simpler time , when the joy of wonder was real . Given their importance , these books should be read in the original order , period . ( that is , " The Magician 's Nephew " comes just before " The Last Battle " , not first ) By changing the order , the current copyright owner spoils the charm of discovering the origins of key plot elements and arrogantly presumes to meddle with this great author 's delightful work . Ownership of a copyright does not imply the right to change history or alter in any way a major work that has found a sacred place in the hearts of millions and will continue to speak to readers young and old for generations to come . In this case , because the author is no longer alive to protect his work , copyright should be stewardship , protection and trust ... values found in Narnia , and here with us , so long as we remember our own journey into the warddrobe .
4 #### I love this collector 's edition box set for the quality paper , the charming , but homey , and now colored ! original illustrations , and of course , the well - remembered stories . But I am disturbed by the numbering of the books in Narnia - chronological order instead of publication order - or whatever the order was that I knew as a kid . How can " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " not be first ? ! The mind boggles . It is on such small landmarks that we steer our little ships of faith , and ... I regret this shakeup . I 'll never know whether it makes any difference to the first - time Narnia reader , but I feel like it must - the author 's increasing sophistication and changing priorities must come through . Argh ! I hate this theft of history !
5 #### I was 6 when I first read these and I have been reading them for the past 42 years since then - these are truly life enhancing friends for life that every child should read at least once a year and that their parents ought to read with them . For those of us who share CS Lewis 's deep Christian faith they are also the most wonderful modern allegory possible of the many ups and downs of the Christian life . So everyone should read these and enjoy them , whether on the level of breathtaking story skill or for the glorious picture of the Christian life that they give . Christopher Catherwood , Evangelical writer ( author of CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE , Zondervan , 2003 ) and childhood correspondent with CS Lewis
5 #### These are wonderful books . They should NOT , as suggested above , be read three times in life , however ! I have read them dozens of times and they get better each time . The chronicles of Narnia combines profoundly Christian values and implications with beautiful , witty and exciting stories by a great thinker , writer , scholar , teacher and man . Children 's books do n't get much , or any , better than this . Those who love these works , by the way , may find them discussed in detail ( and may join the discussion ) at the website " Into the Wardrobe " , dedicated to CS Lewis . For those interested in the same general area of literature I would also recommend the recent " Return of the Heroes,@ by hal GP Colebatch .
5 #### King Tirian of Narnia is thrilled to hear the rumors that , after a couple hundred years of silence , Aslan has returned to the country . But when he goes to investigate himself , he discovers that no one is allowed to see the Lion . In fact , an ape is speaking for Him . The new pronouncements are just as puzzling , including the enslavement of the talking animals . What is going on ? His few allies include Eustace and Jill from our own world . But can they defeat this new evil ? This book is different from others in the series because the story starts in Narnia and then brings the characters from our world into theirs . But the differences do n't stop there . This is a stirring conclusion of a great series . The symbolism is strong , and I find this book one of the most interesting of the series from that standpoint . The story is probably one of the fastest in the series , with so much intrigue and fighting going on , it 's hard to put down , even on a reread . The ending leaves me with a feeling of euphoria mixed with just a little bit of melancholy because the series is over . While the order the other books in the series are read does n't matter as much , this one must be read at the end to fully appreciate it . It 's a wonderful ending to a wonderful series . Do n't miss it .
5 #### This set is an amazing set of fairy tale literature . I loved it as a kid hearing my dad read it to us and I love it as an adult who draws on the spiritual parallels C.S. Lewis weaves so expertly . I recommend it to anyone and everyone who can read . Just be careful -- you 'll want more when you 're finished . Just a few comments on the chronological order debate : Who cares ? You 're the reader . Read the set in ANY order you want . I doubt you would get any lesser / greater pleasure from whichever form you chose . Why argue one way or the other ? He happened to write them " out of order " but who 's to say his intent was to have us read them that way ? I have it on good authority that Lewis was FOR boxing the set in its chronological order . However , I do n't think Lewis would care either way how anyone chose to read the books . The original purpose for writing the books was pure enjoyment , so bottom line : enjoy the books -- in any order you wish .
5 #### C.S.Lewis had said that " No book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally ( and often far more ) worth reading at the age of fifty . " This is so true about Narnia . I was n't lucky to get my hands on this series when I was a kid , but I can imagine how it would absolutely fascinate a child , and how that child would then re - discover the books as an adult , seeing them in a totally different light . I have heard many people say that they had such experience . I highly recommend these books to everyone . It is never too late to fall in love with Narnia .
5 #### The third book in the Narnia series , like with the expanding Harry Potter series , shows our heroes maturing as they return once again to Narnia to help Caspian find the seven lords of Narnia . I never bought into the whole Christian allegory . It 's there , but I never felt it was beaten over the head of the reader the way some people feel . The story drags on occcasion , but when it picks up speed , it 's a great ride . If you enjoy Harry Potter , read this series which is much an inspiration as J.R.R. Tolkien .
5 #### The last book in a series of 7 . The final book starts as an ape , Swift , and his rather faitful but blockheaded donkey , Puzzle , find a lion . Ape then takes the skin and puts it on Puzzle , created a false Aslan . From here , Swift tells all of Narnia rather strange and disastrous deeds by saying Aslan speaks these deeds to Swift and Swift orders Narnians to do it(if you missed the Christian allegories , you 're really not paying attention)and it 's up to Tirian , the current king of Narnia and the heroes from the last 2 , Jill and Eustace , to stop him and the war it starts . The ending seems almost tragic from a point . Some questions are unanswered . For example , the very ending will have you wondering was everybody involved in that or just certain ones ? And why is Susan , one of the main characters from 2 books , not allowed back in Narnia ? The other 6 I read liking them afterwards , when I read Last Battle , I finished all 16 chapters in one sitting , rather than 2 - 4 for the other 6 . It 's a fairly engrossing book and a fitting end to one of the best fantasy series written
5 #### Book 5 in a series of 7 . Edmund and Lucy(Peter and Susan do n't return in this one ) are joined by a rather irritating cousin , Eustace , as they travel into Narnia by a painting . There , they must help King Caspian find his exiled ancestors . There they sail to various islands and its perils , such as the invisible people , an island where water turns everything to gold and where dreams come true . At the end , they reach the end of the world where one of the travellers must go into Aslan 's country . While it 's told very episode - like like you would see on tv , it 's a delightful read and has some great characters
5 #### Book 4 in a series of 7 . The story begins as the main heroes from Lion , Witch and the Wardrobe(Peter , Edmund , Susan and Lucy ) are transported back to Narnia from a rail station . Seems that Narnia is being ruled under the rather tyrannical Lord Miraz . Miraz 's nephew , and rightful ruler of the Throne , Caspian , must get help from some friends to overcome Miraz . All in all , I found this a better book then Horse and His Boy
5 #### This is the prequel to the beloved classic , " the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe " and is in chronological order , Book 1 of 7 . The story begins with Digory and Polly , 2 british children who sneak into their Uncle 's house . There , Andrew makes Polly vanish by using magical rings prompting Digory to go rescue her . There , they run into Empress Jadis , a very militant queen who is intent on ruling worlds . They then get transported to the land of Narnia , with talking animals and a somewhat god - like lion named Aslan . Although this was written later then LW and the W , this is the introduction to the Narnia saga and a great read .
5 #### Three years after Prince Caspian ( of the 4th Narnian Chronicle ' Prince Caspian ' ) was crowned King of Narnia he set out on a voyage to discover and if possible , recover , the seven missing Lords who left Narnia years earlier by order of his wicked Uncle Miraz . The only thing that is lacking though , it the presences of their royal majesties , Queen Lucy and King Edmund . However , that will soon change . In England , Edmund and Lucy are unavoidably required to visit their Aunt , Uncle and cousin Eustace Clarence Scrubb for the duration of 16 weeks while Peter visits the Professor , and Susan tours the US with her parents . In a reverie of Narnia they happen to enter into the magical world as they had previously done several times before , and Edmund , Lucy , and Eustace are thrust into one of the most amazing adventures ever . The journey on board the majestic Dawn Treader takes them to the Eastern Islands , to the Silver Sea , and then further than any Narnian ( or human ) had ever been , toward the End of the World where Aslan 's country lies . There are so many more wonderful experiences and descriptions in this book that are possible to name . Yet , for example there are the hilarious Dufflepuds and their absurd antics , the valiant Reepicheep , the mysterious Ramandu and his daughter , and of course , the beautiful green and gold Dawn Treader . :) The Dawn Treader is so full of adventure that you will long to read it again and again .
5 #### When Caspian became king , he made a pledge to track down the seven friends of his father that had been sent to explore the unknown waters beyond the Lone Islands . After establishing peace , he sets off and is aided in his quest by Edmund , Lucy , and their cousin Eustace , who arrive from England via a magic picture . Bravely sailing into the unknown ( occasionally prodded by the mouse Reepicheep ) , they encounter dragons , sea creatures , magic , and lots of danger . Will they be able to find the seven Lords ? I love this book in the series , probably partially because it is set at sea . The story is episodic in nature , but the quest and information found along the way keep things moving forward . And there is plenty of action and adventure to keep anyone entertained . Lewis really used his imagination to create some of the locals where the boat stops , and it 's fun seeing what he came up with . I especially love the Dufflepuds , although I 'm glad I never have had a conversation with them . As with any series , there are little things you 'll pick up on if you read them in order . However , it 's not strictly necessarily . Anyone looking for a fantasy adventure will love this book .
5 #### I really like the Narnia series , but I have to say , this book is not my favorite . This Harper Audio CD version is very well read though and makes it quite enjoyable . I bought it for my daughter , age 4 , and the longer stretches without exciting action make it less than attention holding for her . She has done better with " The Lion , Witch and the Wardrobe , and " The Horse and His Boy " . You should note , there are a couple , what I would assume are " britishisms " , that might not be what you want your kid to hear . The magician uncle says several times of the witch that she is a " damned fine woman " . If you were reading it aloud , you 'd just skip that , but it is there . The reading is very well done . Actually , I did have one complaint . I 'm trying to remember which book it was , but I think it was this one where the author had a very thin , not very lion - like voice for Aslan . Call it personal preference , but I think a lion should have a grand , kingly voice ! Other than that though it was very good / well done . So far , " The Horse and His Boy " is my favorite , so you might consider that one as well .
5 #### Chronologically , this is the first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series ( though it was the sixth published ) . This story features two children , Polly and Digore ( who will grow up to be the Professor the children stay with in The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe ) , who are the first to travel to the land of Narnia . First , however , they travel to another world , and there free an enchantress which then runs loose in Narnia . This book tells the story of the creation of Narnia , as Aslan ( a Christ - figure ) sings a song which brings about all forms of life . Allegorically ( Lewis said this series was not an allegory , but it still has symbolic and allegorical meanings ) , there is a ` fall ' of Narnia , which is effected by Digore when he brings the sorceress to Narnia . There is also Digore 's uncle , Andrew , who is so hard - hearted that Aslan 's speech is to him just growling and roaring . He can not understand Aslan because he does not want to ( Lewis thought this was the problem with many who did not accept Christianity ) . Besides providing the history of Narnia with a beginning , this book explains a great deal more about the other world . The origins of the lamppost , the wardrobe , and Professor Kirke from The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe are explained . This serves to enrich the land of Narnia , and provide a history for that great land . This book , along with the rest of the Chronicles , is a classic in children 's literature .
4 #### I have to admit that this is my first time reading the Chronicles of Narnia , so I 'm starting with the renumbered series . " The Magician 's Nephew " is the story of Digory and Polly , a boy and girl thrust from their London neighborhood into the Wood Between the Worlds by way of magic rings developed by Digory 's Uncle Andrew . Digory accidentally wakes the evil Queen Jadis and the children bring her back to London , where she begins to wreak havoc before they can get her back into the Wood . They also bring Uncle Andrew , a cabby and a horse named Strawberry . They go to another world and witness a type of genesis , as a new world is born , called Narnia , with the lion Aslan as its king . Digory must go on a quest for a silver apple and return with it to Narnia . I wo n't spoil the rest . The story begins as a fantastical fairy tale , and even though it 's a children 's book , there is a lot of depth for grown up children . As the land of Narnia unfolds , there are a lot of biblical currents , such as Aslan the creator , Jadis the temptress and the silver apples as the focal point of healing and knowledge . It 's a fun story , rich in dialogue and description , but well - paced and orchestrated and worth repeated reading .
5 #### You ca n't read these books just once , you just ca n't ! No matter what age you are ! I have loved these books since I was in sixth grade , and I bought the whole set just to read them over and over , which I still do regularly now . I get this yearning feeling wishing it were all true , so that I could go there someday . The way the author writes it makes it so real , the stories feel like they could go on forever ! I 've seen the earlier videos on TV a long time ago , but I really wish that someone could make them into movies one day , it would be so great !
5 #### I have enjoyed these books since I was a young girl . These books have great moral lessons and excite a child 's creativity . While reviews of the Harry Potter books say they 're almost as good as Chronicles of Narnia - why get those books when you can have the original . Chronicles of Narnia introduce children to the lion Aslan . Aslan is capable of loving , forgiving but is also very just . He 's not a " tame lion " . These books whisper the love and forgiveness of God . They take a child through the depths of despair and into great hope and rejoicing . I have used " Lion , Witch and the Wardrobe " as a devotional in different Christian camps . These books are an ABSOLUTE MUST .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia has long been a staple of literature that people truly enjoy to read . These are wonderfully written stories together in a beautiful book for your coffee table . The pictures amongst the stories are enchanting . The only thing I have against this book is that " Magician 's Nephew " is first , when it should start with " The Lion the Whitch and the Wardrobe " . If I had read the " Magician 's Nephew " first , I might never have loved the series quite as much . Not to say it is bad , but it is more of history of a place you have already been than an introduction to the world . Everyone should read this series .
5 #### One of the most beloved stories of all times . It 's sort of hard to forget a talking Lion named Aslan and a spoiled boy named Edmund . This is all great fun to read and to escape the hars of reality from time to time . Soon you will fine you 're self floating around the pages and trying to get back to reality .
1 #### ... The stories are classics as always - but this printing is on below the bar paper and covering material - esp at the asking price ...
5 #### My mother convinced me to read " The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe " when I was about 6 or 7 years old . She did n't have to convince me to read the rest of the series . It had hooked me . I 've read " The Chronicles of Narnia " through several times since then and have enjoyed them more and more with each reading . The stories are filled with colorful characters , including Professor Kirke ( " Bless me , what do they teach them at these schools " ) , his crazy uncle Andrew , Eustace Scrubb , the Pevensie children , and of course Aslan . These books are a wonderful fantasy series , not only for children , but adults as well . The underlying Christian message behind the Narnia series only added to my enjoyment of the books , as did Lewis 's occasional witty jab at political correctness ( especially in " The Voyage of the Dawn Treader " and " The Silver Chair " ) .
5 #### There has been much debate among Lewis aficiandos about the proper order of books in the Chronicles of Narnia . Should this be the first book , or should one start with " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " ? Basically , it boils down to this : when you read the Bible for the first time , should you start in Genesis , or in the New Testament ? If you would start in Genesis , start here in the Chronicles . Because here you read about the glorious creation of the land of Narnia . Other reviewers have outlined the plot of " The Magician 's Nephew " . Needless to say , this is a wonderful story for children and adults alike . Theologically - aware adults will have a field day here , as Aslan the Lion , the Christ figure of the series , here acts as creator . The passages concerning the creation of Narnia are breathtakingly wonderful . The talking animals are portayed in a lighthearted way as they adapt to a new world . The mundane and ordinary are given a vibrancy in this virgin land . Lewis ' writing style is thoroughly delightful , and will be a joy for anyone who picks up this book . Others may disagree , but I say start with this book , where Narnia begins , in " The Magician 's Nephew " .
5 #### I am currently taking a class on C.S. Lewis in college , and what a wonderful experience it was to get to read this for the class . The Magician 's Nephew works on multiple levels to entertain and enlighten the reader . The Magician 's Nephew is about the birth of Narnia . In the story , Polly and Digory get sent into parallel worlds by their evil Uncle . This begins their adventures in which they meet and evil enchantress , view the creation of a new world , and witness the glory of Aslan . This novel is the beginning tale of the Narnia series telling of its founding by Aslan . The story is a quick - moving adventure with a lot of excitement and humor that anyone can enjoy . Also underneath the story there is so much Christian insight as here , Lewis retells the fall of man . The Magician 's Nephew is a rollicking beginning to the series and even manages to be intellectually pleasing .
5 #### I read this series in grade school . It was my favorite fantasy world until I read about Middle - earth . I think the fantasy realm of Narnia is a great series for younger kids . This is a great series to sit down and read to your kids or younger siblings . This series is a great buy . I give it 5 out of 5 stars .
4 #### A cunning ape puts a lion skin on a donkey and passes him off as the great lion Aslan . Even by the standards of fairy tale I found this not believable . A " world within a world within a world " fantasy ( the top example of which is Little Big by John Crowley ) .
5 #### When I first read The Chronicles of Narnia I was sad to discover that I could have read them some 12 years before during my childhood . I wish that I had had the benefit of having my imagination shaped by these books . Since my first reading , I have read them at least another ten times . They never disappoint . It does n't matter now that I know what will happen next . There is still more to learn by seeing HOW it is done . And as one 's experience grows throughout one 's life , the stories become all the richer and more deeply meaningful . I do agree with other reviewers in objecting to placing the books in chronological order . It makes as much sense as eating the foods on one 's plate in alphabetical order . There is NOTHING in The Magician 's Nephew the lack of which will impair one 's enjoyment or understanding of The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . Reading TMN in the original order will allow one the pleasure of saying later , " Oh , so THAT 'S how that happened . " But reading it first puts one in danger of being merely an observer or a condescending know - it - all ( sort of like Edmund ) rather than a co - discoverer of Narnia ( and of Aslan ) with Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy . Readers should enter and experience the world of Narnia for the first time with Lucy and learn to love it along with her .
2 #### ( please note that this review concerns only the new publications ) The Chronicles of Narnia are perfect books . They are wonderful for children and adults , and can be read again and again . C. S. Lewis was a brilliant author and theologian , and was competent in what he was doing . I have been reading these books since I was young enough to pick up a book , and I was horrified when I found out they were reprinting them in chronological order ! Why have the publishers decided to tamper with the order ? reading these books in chronological order spoils all of the surprise and magic out of the first visit to Narnia ( in The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe ) , because we already know what 's going on . You 're not supposed to know about the lightpole or who the professor is yet ! Things do n't always need to be put in chronological order . If you 're going to read them , please read them in the correct order : 1 ) The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe , 2 ) Prince Caspian , 3)The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , 4 ) The Silver Chair , 5 ) The Horse and His Boy , 6 ) The Magician 's Nephew , and 7 ) The Last Battle
4 #### I read the Chronicles of Narnia a little over a year ago and my only regret is having not read them when I was a child . The chronicles take you through the birth and death of a world called Narnia . The book explores it 's religous development in a way that children can relate to . The only complaint I have of the book is that I do not feel adults get as much out of reading it as children do . This ; however , could be said of all Lewis 's books . Lewis was truly a gifted author , he had the ability to see through the eyes of child . While I do n't feel adults get the effect that kids do it is , nonetheless , a masterpiece .
3 #### I 've LOVED the Chronicles of Narnia since I was a very young child . Now , at age 32 ( and counting ) , I still go back and read the Chronicles every year or two , just to re - experience the enchantment of Narnia . There 's always something new to discover . My rating of this product , however , is based on the quality of this particular boxed set because when I purchased this set for my sister , I was rather disappointed . Although I love the Chris Van Alsburg cover illustrations , and I was pleased to see so many of Pauline Baynes 's illustrations in the pages of the books , the reproductions are poor . Basically , the typeface and the illustrations in the text look like they 've been photocopied a few too many times , so the quality of the lines is not smooth and clean . Moreover , the bindings are rather cheap and flimsy . Caveat emptor .
5 #### Lewis ' work is deep and has many levels , but what makes it a masterpiece is the fact that the books only reveal the deeper levels when the reader is ready for them . Because of that , children find this just as enjoyable a read as adults . There is a story within a story . A deep philosophical treatise disguised as a children 's story . I first read these books as a child , and enjoyed them as a fantasy story . As an adult I read them again , and saw so much more that I had completely missed as a child . Then I read an analysis of the books and went back to them a third time , finally getting the deep spiritual message of the story Lewis was telling . The story is ultimately an allegory of the christian experience , though so masterfully told that 99.9 % of readers would never make the connection . Here is a book that young and old , christian and non - christian will find equally entertaining and engaging . It entertains you and gives you something to think about - is n't that what great literature is all about ?
5 #### The books of The Chronicles of Narnia are some of my all - time favorites . That is why I was fearful in approaching The Last Battle for the first time . Too often the end of such a wonderful literary journey comes as a letdown . Rarely do final books in a series deliver the goods . Never fear -- this one does . All the things that made me love Narnia find their noble ending -- and a new beginning -- in The Last Battle . Lewis , in his subtle yet cataclysmic way , ties together the series ' loose ends ( with the exception of one ) quite nicely . The various peoples of Narnia come to their own end . The dwarves in the stable and the story of the Calormene Emeth are two of the " deepest " parts of all the Narnian books . Without being a spoiler , I 'd like to throw my two cents worth into the debate about what Lewis meant theologically by the story of Emeth : my view is that , in some ways , all of our journeys are like Emeth 's journey . The Last Battle , like all great books , leaves me thirsting for something beyond my pale experience . It lays down the call for all of us to go Higher Up and Deeper In . I give The Last Battle my highest recommendation .
5 #### This edition is a beautiful book . It is large , heavy , filled with with full - color illustrations on high quality glossy paper . It even has a built - in ribbon book - mark . This tome is well worth the list price . The Chronicles of Narnia provide a path to opening the imagination and introducing ' chapter books ' to young children , who may not be able to read it for themselves yet . For those with a Christian back - ground , it is easy to recognize the symbolism contained in the story . However , the stories stand on their own as an imaginative portrayal of a fantasy world .
5 #### I first read this series as a young child -- I picked it up in the library and read them all straight through . While as an adult I 've read the reviews about what a " Christian " series this is , as a child reading them without an adult 's interpretation , there were no obvious parallels to the Bible / Christianity . So , if you have a fear of that -- don't worry ! Like most fantasy , however , there is a great force of GOOD , a great force of EVIL , and human characters caught up in the struggle between the two in a strange land full of fantastic creatures and magic . ( Hmmmm , sounds a lot like the plot of the Lord of the Rings trilogy too ! ) I highly recommend this book to any child who is interested in fantasy , or any adult trying to get a child interested in reading .
5 #### The Prince Caspian has always been my favourite book of the Narnia series . This is where Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy ( The Pevensies ) together again , entering the world of Narnia . The story takes place after a year of their first Narnia encounter . They were called back to Narnia due to the disasters in the land . Where the name of Aslan has forgotten , and the Narnia crown is in the wrong hand . The Pevensies helps Prince Caspian and the forest creatures to fight against the army of Telmarine , and ... I do n't want to spoil anymore of the story . Overall the ending is excellent and every chapter of the book is breathtaking . I read this book during my last week of finals in University , and it did goods to be or else I could 've die from studying and working . If you 've read the previous books of Narnia , do n't stop until you get to the Prince Caspian , of course , do nt ' even stop there ! ! Never stop reading the Chronicle of Narnia , it is a classic wonder in every reader 's heart .
5 #### I was introduced to the writings of C.S. Lewis through the Chronicles of Narnia , which my mother gave to me when I was eight . I devoured them within a couple of weeks . Since then , my old set has become so dog - eared and worn out that I 'm considering buying a new one . C.S. Lewis blows me away with the depth of his insight into human character and relationship with God . The Chronicles are beautiful fairy tales , but all set within the context of a God - created world where Aslan reigns as a loving , self - sacrificing , and terrible savior . The characters are flawed , but extremely lovable . The richness of description of the world of Narnia make you feel that you know the place personally and that it is real . With action and adventure in each book , every one of them has something to say . Lewis writes in a gentle , sensible voice , and avoids moralizing or preaching . The " allegorical " elements of the books never overshadow the story and adventure and the lovable characters . There 's not much more that I can say except to recommend these books highly . Read them ! Read them now !
5 #### Steve Brown , renowned speaker and seminary professor , once said that if you have n't read the Chronicles of Narnia , consider yourself uneducated ( or was it unread ) ? I am happy to announce that I have now completed my education and it was a joy to complete . My wife and I read these with our kids on trips , after dinner and wherever we could find time . It took a couple of years get through them but now I am sorry there are n't more . I miss the kids , I miss Aslan , and I especially miss Reepicheep , the mouse - he was a true warrior and a gentleman . It is hard to describe just how wonderful these books are - they helped a guy in his mid - thirties rekindle his imagination , they are funny , they are profound , and for those of us who are Christians , they give tremendous analogies to the gospel message . Read them all , you wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### Are these books for children or adults ? Lewis originally wrote them for kids , but I 'm an adult and I read them regularly ! They are true classics , marvellously written and essential reading for any age . The Harper Collins one - volume edition ( ISBN 0060281375 ) is the best I 've found . It is a sturdy hardback , well - bound with good paper . The illustrations are marvellous ! They are n't large and obtrusive - they do n't overwhelm the text . But they truly capture the magical , mystical feel of the stories . I was taken by surprise when I first read this edition - the books are in a different order than I was used to . I 'd previously read them in order of authorship , while this edition places them in chronological order . I believe I like it this way better , now that I 've gotten used to it . The price is actually quite low for the quality of the book , too . Of all the editions I 've seen of this must - have collection , it is the best one I 've found . If you want to buy the Chronicles of Narnia , buy the Harper Collins one - volume edition !
5 #### Third in the series ( as they were originally written ) , " The Voyage of the Dawn Treader " is one of my favorite books in the Narnia series . Edmund and Lucy return to Narnia ( Peter and Susan are now too old to come back ) and they bring an unwelcome ( and unwilling ) guest . Eustace , their cousin , plays a bratty child who ca n't think of anything but leaving Narnia , until he undergoes a remarkable change ( you 'll have to read to find out ! ) . The three children join King Caspian at the beginning of an ocean voyage to explore the seas to the East of Narnia , and experience an exciting series of dangers and marvels . This book has many similarities to the adventures of Ulysses in " The Odyssey " by Homer , under different circumstances . And once again , Reepicheep proves to be the fearlessly brave mouse whose actions give him much greater credit than his size .
5 #### Returning to Narnia for their second time , the children Peter , Susan , Edmund , and Lucy are surprised to find that things have drastically changed in their absence . A wild overgrown forest and castle ruins greet them where they formerly reigned , and men have conquered Narnia , overthrowing the animals . As Lewis continues their adventure he introduces a few new characters that will be key figures in the following books . Among these is the most lovable and humorous character in the Chronicles of Narnia series ... Reepicheep the mouse ! Brave with his rapier , the mighty mouse brings a smile to your face everytime he enters the scene . The young Prince Caspian is also introduced and to be seen more later in the series , although his role is rather limited in the bulk of this book . Lewis continues with the underlying Christian themes , in this book the main one being the following of Aslan by faith ( just as we are called to follow Christ by faith ) . While not the best of the Narnia books , " Prince Caspian " is important for its plot building and has some good fun and action .
5 #### This series is delightful and inspiring and worth reading many times again and again in one lifetime !
5 #### You do n't need to be religious to appreciate the magic and wonder that is Narnia . The religious symbolism is , at times , a distraction from the excellent storytelling ( we are occasionally beaten bloody with the Aslan - as - Jesus bit ) , but overall , the stories are well - written and bear the mark of a master 's hand . Taken on their own , the novels are as easy to approach and enjoy as the " Wrinkle in Time " and " Lord of the Rings " series , though written for a younger age group . The novels do not occur chronologically , but the general story involves Aslan creating Narnia , which is then taken over by a witch from another world . Aslan 's power brings 4 Earth children to Narnia to liberate it from the witch , after which Adventures Occur . The children return to Earth and then make periodic trips to Narnia , along with other Earth children on occasion . Eventually there is a huge war and Aslan destroys Narnia and recreates it as paradise . As I said , there 's definite religious overtones here , but do n't let that stop you from trying the series if you have n't already . Do n't even let being a grown - up stop you from enjoying it -- I re - read the whole series about once a year . It is beautifully written and worth the effort -- one of those cultural tapestry things that everybody just ought to have read .
5 #### I first read these in elementary school , and I 've reread them this past year , after graduating from college , and they still grab me . These books are fantastic reading - not too heavy , and yet so profound . They 're also great for reading with / to younger folks . My parents read it to me for my bedtime stories for a while . I can see this working in elementary classrooms . they 're a bit easier than Tolkien 's Fellowship of the Ring , but they 're just good to read .
5 #### I read the Chronicles of Narnia for the first time when I was in the sixth grade . I loved them . They were simple , had very nice endings , the characters were not only children my age , but in most books girls , and , above all , they made me feel both happy and safe . Now , many years later , I ordered this edition , which has beautiful colour pictures , and contains the seven books ( in a different order ) and decided to read them again . This time around I think I grasped how DEEP the meaning of these books really is , and understood why they make me feel so good ! ... Reading them again was like eating my favourite ice cream flavour ... These are books for any age , beautifully written , with extraordinary characters , interesting sotries , and with a fantasy world that comes to life immediatly in your mind , and specially in your heart .
5 #### I love this compilation of the Narnia books ... though I must warn folks that this is not the book for a casual reader -- this thing 's HEAVY . If you want a complete edition of the Chronicles of Narnia though , I do n't think there 's a better one than this . The artwork , from the cover to the glossy heavyweight pages ( and in color too ! ) is wonderful , and is from the ( I think ) original illustrator of the Narnia books , Pauline Baynes . The only complaint I have is that the books are in the " new " order ( with the Magician 's Nephew first , etc ) rather than the original chronology ( which placed Lion first and Nephew right before Last Battle ) . Maybe it 's just cause I was raised on them in the " old " chronology , but I still think the old ordering of the books was the best . Oh well , to each their own . If you 've worn your paperbacks to their imminent demise and need a copy that can stand up to use , this is the one to have . Or , if you just want a beautifully done single volume that is of enough quality to be passed on to the next generation , this is still the one to have .
4 #### When I was a kid , this was a truly magical series . It 's lost some of its luster , but I think I can see the appeal . They are still delightful adventure stories and real page turners . Where it loses its luster is in the Christian allegories . In my younger days , these went right over my head . Now , the rivets are showing a little more than I 'm comfortable with , but it 's still easy enough to gloss over those bits and focus on the storytelling parts . The characters are strong , and the fantasy aura still entrancing . I noticed this time how much natural history Lewis throws in : he 's always referring to constellations , trees , flowers , and other elements of the Narnian natural world . It definitely adds to the realism of the stories . I was somewhat surprised at my revised opinions of the individual books . If you 'd asked me a week ago what my favorites were , I would have said Lion , Dawn Treader , and Horse , with The Magician 's Nephew , The Last Battle , and The Silver Chair as the weakest . Now , I would put Prince Caspian and Horse at the top , possibly still with Dawn Treader , but move Lion down a notch and Magician 's Nephew and The Silver Chair each up a notch .
5 #### The Narnia Chronicles have been compared to the mega - hit Harry Potter books , though C.S. Lewis wrote them not only as enjoyable children 's fiction but as a way to introduce Christian thought . C.S. Lewis was an Oxford scholar , an agnostic who became convinced that there WAS a god , and then became a Christian . Yet he infuses his beliefs gently into the Narnia books , and if you object to Christianity , you 'd probably totally miss it in these books . If you object , in contrast , to Harry Potter , but want a good alternative , these books are just the ticket . The stories are written with delightful visual appeal , great imagination , and with that English tongue - in - cheek humor that makes it fun for adults to read these out loud and enjoy the jokes on two levels . These are true fairy tales and as such , never fail to please children year after year . The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , in particular , is high adventure , with dragons , dwarves , a mighty Mouse , and a ship adventure , and it 's my special favorite . The books emphasize the values of learning to struggle against temptation , of developing good and likeable character and the pain of growing up and having to leave the magical world of childhood behind . The books also hint at a need for spiritual growth If you have n't read these , you are in for a treat . If you have n't read them to your kids , well , get a move on !
5 #### These are such an amazing series of books , I almost do n't know where to start . The tales are magical , the characters rich , and the stories so layered that any generation can enjoy them . I remember reading them when I was very young - and being excited when the cartoon of " The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe " came on tv each winter . 15 + years later I took a college course on them and loved them even more ! Similar to Harry Potter , the tales are about 4 " normal " children who stumble into an alternate world filled with ... well , lions and witches . To this day , the name Aslan brings a smile to my face ! My only recommendation is to read them in the order they were written - which is ( oddly ) NOT chronological order to the timeline of Narnia itself , and not the order provided in this collection . I do n't suppose it makes all that much difference , and it certainly does n't make the stories less enjoyable , nor cause me to lower my rating . I just think you owe it to youself to be drawn into the world the way C.S. Lewis intended ( and was drawn into it himself ) . I honestly think this is a must have for any library - young or old - and have bought several sets for loved ones , and to replace the much loved and worn copies of my own !
5 #### People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children , is written in a style that is accessible to children , or told in a narrative voice that is speaking as to children to be a " children 's book " and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults . When they do so , they miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available . This book falls into that category , as do the rest of the books in the Narnia series , " The Hobbit " , by J.R.R. Tolkein , and " Alice in Wonderland " and " Through the Looking Glass " by Lewis Carroll , among many others . Furthermore , not only is this book one of the most enjoyable reading experiences available , it is also one of the most thought - provoking . All of the Narnia books are thinly - veiled allegories for Christian philosophy ; the lessons that this book has to teach -- that not every action that is done in the name of God is done by his will , that it is the responsibility of every thinking adult to judge for themselves whether the person invoking the name of God is doing God 's will , and that it is critical not to accept the judgement of others if what is being demanded in the name of God seems to be evil -- are lessons that everyone , young and old , needs to be reminded of on a regular basis .
5 #### Several years ago , we unplugged our TV and started regularly reading to our kids . This has been one of the best parenting decisions we 've ever made ! We 've read through all seven of the NARNIA books several times , including reading them aloud to our children . Lewis 's tales unfold wonderfully when read aloud . The chapters are of readable length , and even early elementary age children will enjoy sitting with parents who read these stories aloud to their children . I encourage you to turn off the TV this week and read aloud to your kids . Your children 's imagination sparked by Lewis ' delightful writing will create an even more detailed and wonderful world than any movie screen or TV show . Encourage their imagination to fill the big screen of their minds with Narnian tales , beginning the Lucy 's first steps through the Wardrobe . Meet Aslan and ride with the children upon the back of the Lion ! These marvelous tales have always been my favorite adventure stories . For two other books filled with creative ideas for parents , look into " The Family Cloister " and " The Christian Family Toolbox " , by David Robinson , both available through Amazon.com .
4 #### This is so far the best Chronicles of Narnia Book I have read yet . I am currently reading the 6th and still have the 7th to go but " The voyage of the Dawn Treader " seems to be the best . The story features a new character the children 's cousin Eustace . He gives the book a little more life than the others . Also the imagination put into this book seems to bring this book more to life . If you only read one in the series I would choose this one , but I really recommend reading them all .
4 #### Pretty good book . I enjoyed it very much .. It talks about the forming of a place called Narnia ( The Land of Youth ) and how it formed .. I especially loved the charecter of Aslan and the understanding he had and his personality . I REALLY disliked Jade .. The EVIL Queen . She really kind of ticked me off by her evil and her cruelness .
5 #### ( ... ) These books I first heard of from my sister , Tara . Then , My 3rd grade teacher , Mr. Kelly , also recommended them to me , I had read more books in 3rd grade than most people have read in their Senior year of high school . I read The Lion , The Witch , and The wardrobe first , and I was totally mesmerized , and hooked like a magnet . I read them all over a second time that same year . The thing I ca n't understand is how some of those"Grown - ups " as they are known , do n't seem to think that they have much purpose for children . Sure , in 3rd grade , I did n't understand the Christian views inside them then , but about two years later , in 5th , I sure did . ( ... ) You , If you 've read my review on the " His Dark Materials " series by Philip Pullman , know what I think about a childs strength in this world , and obviously it 's more than a small tidbit . These books to me are as good as Harry Potter , and anyone who loves those should love these . You 'll understand when you finish The Last Battle . :-)
5 #### In this fourth book in the Narnia series , Peter , Susan , Edmund and Lucy are pulled back into Narnia by a Prince in dire straits . Prince Caspian is in need of help because his uncle is trying to kill him and steal his spot as the rightful king of Narnia . The Prince and his warriors are confronted with a question of faith . When he asked for help by blowing the ancient horn of Queen Susan , would that help come ? Could the hold on until it came ? Should the turn to less noble resourses that might work but would impinge on their integrity ? Would Aslan answer the call and come back to Narnia ? Was Aslan dead ? This book , like the rest , is a page turner . You should buy the whole series .
5 #### I do n't have kids yet , but I got this set for when I do . I want them to feel the sense of wonder and magic that I did the several times I read each book as a youth . I freely admit to trying to reach Narnia through my closet " wardrobe " as a boy . I never was able to physically , but mentally I was there with all the wonderful characters . Truly classics that sparked my imagination and ones that I enjoyed re - reading and gleaned new things from every time . REVIEW UPDATE : Well , I have kids now , and I stand by my earlier posting . When they are old enough , I definitely want them to read these books . :) UPDATE # 2 ( 01/16/2012 ): Well , my son is 11 now and a perfect age to start reading this , but if it does n't have a robot or lightsaber in it , then it 's hard to get him to even look at it . I 'll keep at him though . My daughter is 7 and a voracious reader , so I 'm sure that in a year or two she 'll be ready to read the whole series .
5 #### This is one of those books that make you wonder how an authors mind works . This book sets up the whold Chronicles of Narnia series . The Magicians nephew is Digby ( later Professor Kirke in The Lion , The Whitch , and The Wardrobe ) who becomes the first human ( along with his cohort Polly ) to travel to Narnia , and other worlds . We get to see how Narnia was in its ideal state , before the White Witch entered and wreked havoc on the ideal land . This book also shows us the " structure " of the Narnia fantasy lands . It shows us the difference between good and evil , bravery and cowardice , benevolence and destructiveness . Read this one first , then move on to the rest of the Narnia books . As far as age is concerned , this is great for adults or older children . I have read The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe aloud to my 4 - year old . He enjoyed about one chapter a day , but could n't sit for any longer . He has the World of Narnia book called " The Wood between the Worlds " which is based on this book , so he knew the characters ( with pictures ) coming in . I plan to read this whole series to him in a year or two .
5 #### What can I say about this book ? Except that if I could I would give it more than 5 stars . This is one of the best series ever read . Lewis did a masterful job at creating the stories in the series . Like all fantasy he used familar elements . the storeis take place in a magical world called Narnia . In this world are magical creatures with special abilities and powers . Lewis put such detail and vivid descriptions of this world into the series that Narnia becomes real . Not only that , m but the characters themselves are real . The characters are multi - deminsional and you grow to love the children in the stories . Howeevr , the greatest thing about this series is its ability to reach all age levels . For young children this is simply a wondefful tale of adventure for 4 yopung children . However , for older readers we see something more . Lewis is known for his theological critisims . And when you read these stories the divine undertones become very apparent . I read these stories both as a young child and as an adult . What I learned is that with each new reading something new is discovered . I Love this series . I think that this series is a must have in any children 's library .
5 #### I am eight . Mom is posting this review . I liked the book becuase it had a lot of adventures in it . It has a boy with a flying horse , too . The boy 's name is Digory . That 's a funny name for a boy . The Queen of Charn was scary .
5 #### ... and that 's no easy task ! I ca n't tell you what this book is about . All I can tell you is that it kept my daughter entertained for a couple of hours . She then read it over again a few days later . Can I give this more than 5 stars ? ! !
3 #### I first read " The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe " when I was a child . I loved the book , and soon read the others in the series . I also watched the BBC television series . I still adore this series of books . However , when I was a child I remember being more frightened by Aslan than by many of the bad or evil characters . I could not understand how he could be both " terrible and good " , and many times he seemed to me to be harsh and fearsome . I know lots of children do n't feel this way , but I think some of the more sensitive children may not quite understand Aslan 's role as the Savior . Most children do not have the ability to reconcile perfect goodness with behavior that may seem terrifying or ambivalent - children 's ideas about good and evil are very black and white . I also remember being somewhat traumatized by the sacrifice of Aslan upon the stone altar . I had nightmares about it . I really believe this is a wonderful series of books ; but I also think they should be read by older kids ( 12 - 15 ) who have a more sophisticated understanding of the theological concepts involved .
5 #### I would not read if these stories did n't exist , I would not write if these stories did n't exist , I would not appreciate literature the way that I do if these stories did n't exist . These seven adventures , written by a master of tales , inspired every imaginative process in my brain and brought out every emotion in my being . The Chronicles of Narnia present a seemingly never - ending epic of immense proportions that bring forth various situations from victory to catastrophe , mystery to explaination , and life to death . We follow the wondrous journeys of four young children through the enchanting land of Narnia , a land you will never forget . Various supporting characters grace the pages , from Father Time , to Aslan the Lion , and even Reepicheep the Mouse , each giving beautiful insight and wonderful understanding . Never will you forget what takes place in these stories . I highly ... HIGHLY recommend these books for anyone who feels the need to be enchanted . If you read them as a Biblical allegory or not ( and I did n't ) , these stories will do nothing less than touch your life .
3 #### I like fantasy . I have Grimm and Anderson in hardback , love the Oz books , memorized page after page of Lewis Caroll as a child , and have read Tolkien far , far too many times . My Inner Child is well read . However , this is a series that has never held my interest . As a child I read Lion , Witch and Wardrobe ; was underwhelmed , and did not read the rest until I was grown . People obviously have strong feelings about these stories , almost four hundred reviews as a write this , over 350 with five stars . I reread the whole book , and I still do n't get it . All children 's literature contains an element of socialization , instructing the reader on what is proper and improper behavior . Lewis lays this on thick , with all the subtlety of a medieval Morality Play . If Lewis were not known for writing Christian Apologetics the moral relativism in these stories would bring them under as much attack as Harry Potter ( heroic characters lie and steal ) . Character development is non - existent , and they are n't even well written ( voice varies , without apparent pattern , from Third Person Observer to Third Person Limited Omniscience with odd and distracting First Person interjections ) . Nonetheless , I was happy to find the whole series in a single volume , and it has been placed on the bookshelf in my guest room . Maybe someone will enjoy it more than I do .
5 #### What can I say about this series that has n't already been said ? I discovered it when I was a child , devoured the entire series , and was really sad when it ended . I have to say that I ca n't wait for my daughter to be old enough to read , so she can enjoy them . I try and re - read this series yearly , it 's that fabulous . Really , you will not be disappointed . If you like Harry Potter , then pick up this series . This volume has the entire seven books in one format . It 's too easy ! Really , buy this book ! Thanks for reading ! ~Pandora
4 #### This set continues the Chronicles of Narnia in the excellent BBC radio drama adaptations by Brian Sibbley . This particular production is weakened by the changing of the actors from the " Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe . " Perhaps the lapse of time meant they had to get a new Peter and Edmund ( Lucy sounds the same ) , but the problem is that Peter sounds significantly younger than the actor playing Prince Caspian , and this ruptures the suspension of disbelief , as in the book , Peter is supposed to come off as the older king , patron to the younger Caspian . But while Caspian has a deep and resonant voice , " older " Peter is still a squeaky voiced kid ( with a much higher pitch than Peter in TLTWATW ) . He never manages to sound sufficiently grand . It 's really too bad because the rest of the show is wonderful . BTW the same problem with the change of actors dogs the subsequent BBC production of " The Voyage of the Dawn Treader , " where Edmund , supposedly Capsian 's age , sounds about five years younger . As the listener , you keep wondering why the obviously teenaged Caspian is taking orders from the grade school kid .
5 #### Well ....... What an excellent presentation of an excellent novel . The Chronicles are my favorite books and always will be . Seeing an ad for this I sought out to buy iot right away and it has impressed me . Closely following the book this audio version of Prince Caspian is as vivid a presentation as any movie . I reccomend this to all narnia fans . Also the other three radio drama presentations are recommended . A worthy purchase !
5 #### If you 've read some of The Silmarillion by Tolkien and the book of Genesis , then you 'll have a fairly good idea of what The Magician 's Nephew will cover . It sets the groundwork for the following books . Basically , it describes ( in this order)how the Witch was awakened , how the Lion was found , how the land of Narnia and surrounding territories were created , and lastly , explains how the wardrobe came to be . But the adventures in this book are not limited to these . The reader will embark on a journey with the main characters Digory and Polly . . . and sometimes Uncle Andrew will come along , and many other unexpected persons . Not all of the story takes place away from our world , though . There are a few parts that take place during the present - day and age . And , obviously , those parts are not near as fascinating as when you get to read about the Wood Between the Worlds or Narnia itself . The excellent illustrations go along faithfully with the narrative , making the reading experience much more visual and enjoyable . In all regards , this book is -- as Uncle Andrew would have said in his English accent--"A dem fine book , sir , a dem fine book . "
5 #### People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children , is written in a style accessible to children , or told in a narrative voice that is speaking as to children to be a " children 's story " , and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults . When they do so , they miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available . This book falls into that category , as do the rest of the books in this series , just as do " The Hobbit " , by J.R.R. Tolkein , " Peter Pan " , by James Barrie , and " Alice In Wonderland " and " Through The Looking Glass " by Lewis Carroll , among others . This book is , if anything , even more enjoyable than " The Lion , The Witch , And The Wardrobe " , " The Magician 's Nephew " , and " The Horse And His Boy " , the other books in the series that I 've read so far . It is a delightful tale of magic and wonder , highly recommended to anyone who has n't misplaced their sense of play . Not for the boring and banality - riddled .
5 #### the Narnia Chronicles is one of the greatest escapes of all time . Strangely , I did n't read all these books until I was in my twenties . I had read The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe when I was younger , but I guess I just never got into it , back then . Now I love fantasy novels , and there 's an extra level of appreciation as an adult with the Narnia series , since you have a better understanding of C.S. Lewis ' background as a Christian scholar ( for the record , I 'm not Christian , and found this aspect fascinating ) . It also makes you think twice when you see a random squirrel scamper by .
5 #### As I child , the room in my house was next to a dark closet containing a large water heater and I would daydream about passages and hidden worlds that lay behind that water heater . Later , when I came upon The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , I eagerly read about one of those hidden worlds , tucked just beyond the neglected places and never forgot it . Now as a father , I ca n't wait for my kids to grow old enough to find the same -- hmmm , perhaps I 'll build a wardrobe that does have a secret back room , and leave these Chronicles and other stories there to be discovered . 5 stars for the story , but it is more of a children 's story -- it does n't give you the feeling of a deep vast history behind the worlds in the way that Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit does . Still , even if you 're not reading this to a kid , it would make a perfect airline read , or an afternoon 's escape .
5 #### I absolutely loved these books when I first read them in 4th grade . When I read them again in college , they brought me to tears as I suddenly saw the analogies I completely missed the first time around . These are wonderful , lyrical fantasies that are a delight to any lover of good tales , full of heart - rending truisms that very few people seem to understand anymore .
4 #### These books have always been to me a classic staple of the Fantasy Genre , they should be ranked with Tolkien as a must read for fantasy readers everywhere . Their links to the realworld make them perfect for younger readers to embrace the sword and sorcery type worlds And their parallels to christianity help establish fundamental morals of right and wrong to be applied into the real world . My only problem with this particular set is that they rearranged the order the books were to be read . The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe should always be the first read before opening the next 6 . I was proud to share this series with my 10 year old daughter who absolutely loved The Lion ... and I can not wait for her to join Aslan , Prince Caspian , Puddleglum and the others of Narnia 's fabled lands .
5 #### If a simple children 's book can explain the essence of a uniiversal religion , the Narnia Chronicles , does the job . If you 're looking for something special to read your kids , this is it . But if you 're looking for a simple fable with the meaning of life , this is it as well . Lewis will take you on a wonderful journey through the enchanted land of Narnia , with an exceptional tale about its past , present and future . Meet characters you are sure to fall in love with , and ofcourse , Aslan . Different religions depict God in different ways , all which somehow are contradictory to one another . With Aslan though , whether you 're a Hindu like me , or a Muslim , or a Christian , it will somehow all make sense ! If you think that a children 's book could not possibly hold such a deep symbolic meaning , read it , just to try to prove me wrong . Oh yeah , do not read it in the way mentioned in the boxed set . Read it as Lewis intended you to , in the order they were written .
4 #### This is the first story in C S Lewis ` Narnian series ( for children , but appreciated by adults , as well . ) However , like many others , I was introduced first to THE LION , THE WITCH , AND THE WARDROBE . Having read and re - read them in one order then the reverse , I recommend that , especially in this day and age , the latter be read first . Narnia is introduced earlier in the second story : Narnia-- land of talking creatures , mythical and actual , is what grabs the reader and takes us in through a whimsically mundane choice of a portal , the wardrobe . That said and done , Polly and Diggory`s adventure is quite a tale . The plot concerns whether and how the children can get back to their ( and our ) land , despite the queen`s powerful magic-- great enough to have destroyed an entire world-- and heal Diggory`s ailing mother . They tumble out of their world and into others via Uncle Andrew`s unpredictable and uncertain prowess in magic , to witness the numbing death of Charn and the wondrous dawning of Narnia , created through the lion Aslan`s song , and inspired by Genesis . The childish selfishness of both Diggory`s uncle and the awful Queen Jadis is at once sad and comical . In fact , THE MAGICIAN`S NEPHEW is overall more humorous , examining foibles in people , as well as animals . Also , if you read this book , you will be satisfied with the answer to that question nagging at the back of your mind ( as it did to me for years , )
5 #### I first entered Narnia in the fourth grade , when my teacher read us " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " and set out immediately to purchase the complete set . Narnia is a truly magical world , rich with characters that you will fall in love with and stories you will never forget . When I read the last book , I cried , because I knew I could never return . The stories contain in the Chronicles of Narnia , are some of the most beautiful , enchanting books you will ever read . They are imaginative and take the reader on a trip of dreams and fancies that resemble something we all have at some point . Narnia first got me interested in fantasy and I can not think of a better way to enter the world of make - believe .
5 #### Whether you are looking for a fascinating story to intrege a reluctant reader , a marvoulous family read - aloud , or a thought provoking parable , you can not make a better choice than Narnia . I just bought my almost 9 year old his own set for his birthday , and was absolutely horrified that the publisher changed the order ! ! I showed my picky child the order the are * supposed * to be in by showing him the copyright dates , and he is reading them in the right order , but for those of you who do not know , C.S. Lewis published them in the order from simplist * story * to the story with the most profound philosophy . There is a reason the Magicians Nephew is near the end , and why the Horse and his Boy are 5th . The new illustrations are wonderful , and it is truely a treat to have a set that is n't dog - eared from years of abuse , but * please * , when you print the next run , * please * put them back in order ! ! !
5 #### I have not picked up these books to read for at least ten years and I can still " feel " the reality which C.S. Lewis created . The thing I remember most about this series is that it is almost sad in the end . Not because evil won , or any of the main characters died , but because the adventure ended when the final page was turned . The Narnia series can be enjoyed by all ages and maybe appreciated even a little bit more the older one becomes . The reader is invited to join a grand adventure of many exciting and unusual happenings that that brings you to tears and back to triumph , over and over again . Each book in this series has it 's own begining and end , but all are tied together , the circle being completed with The Last Battle . Take a trip through the wardrobe , and see what is on the other side .
5 #### I agree with these other folks who wish that publishers would honor the original order of these books . I am now beginning to read them to my five year old twins and find that the stories are capturing their young attentions and imagination just fine , even without reading them in so - called " chronological " order . Certainly C.S. Lewis was a great and gifted writer and we should leave it to him to know best . It may only be as an adult that you can really understand and appreciate the true chronology of these books , but unless they are presented to us originally in the author 's order , we will be robbed the wonderful joy at discovering some of the deepest meanings about these stories . Is this not part of what makes them so timeless and makes C. S. Lewis such a gifted writer ?
5 #### This is a great book . One of the best in the Narnia series a.k.a . the best series ever written . HOWEVER this is NOT book 1 . Book 1 is The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe . It was written first , and was meant to be read first . So everyone who is just whistling in the wind about this being book 1 . Stop it ! You 're just displaying your ignorance , and anyone who knows anything about Narnia will no longer take you seriously . ?
5 #### I always find something wonderful everytime I read a book of Chronicles of Narnia . One day , it 's sound of falling snow where Mr. Tumnus led Lucy to his house , and the other day , full of colors of blue ocean which a picture on the wall turns into , and so on . Not only children but also grown - ups can easily travel in the world of Narnia , because there are a lot of skillful guides who have been showing a lot of dreamer around . Try it !
5 #### I read this series when I was a young kid , & now I am reading it again when I am almost 30 . There is a beauty in the writing which is hard for me to express in words- you have to read it to find out . Even though this series is categorized as being for the 12 year old reader , I believe that is only because that is when the average child will be able to understand and appreciate it . In my opinion , this series is meant for anyone who can read and understand it regardless of age . It is a gem of a book and reveals the meaning of life without being pendantic and hard to understand . The only other fantasy / science - fiction books I would put in its class for quality and wonderful prose are The Amber Chronicles by Roger Zelazny , The Hyperion series by Dan Simmons , The Elric Saga by Michael Moorcock , Magician by Raymond Fiest , The Farthest Shore by Ursula Leguine , Dune by Frank Herbert , & finally The Lord of the Rings by Tolkien .
5 #### These books are among the very few that a child simply MUST read ( or have read to him / her ) . Rich , engrossing , " wonder"-full . The books work on many levels , incorporating and revealing the philosophy and theology of the brilliant C.S. Lewis . Yet readers who care nothing for theology will find plenty to enjoy in the characters and story . As a child I read and reread these stories ; read them again in college ; again as a young adult ; now I read them to my children . Pure magic . A must for every library .
5 #### When I first read the Narnia Chronicles in elementary school , this was my favorite by far . When I re - read the books a couple years ago , it was still my favorite - it 's full of adventure and wonder and is really quite a beautiful book . I ca n't think of my childhood without remembering the Narnia Chronicles , especially The Voyage of the Dawn Treader .
4 #### I started reading the series in 7th grade . The 1st book took me 2 days . These are short books , but their filled with wonderful stories and a great plot . The entire series should take you about 3 weeks . Great series !
4 #### Have you ever wondered what might be beyond an ordinary wardrobe ? In the book , The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe , four children , named Peter Susan , Edmund , and Lucymove into an old professors house for the summer . One day they decide to play a game of hide and go seek and Lucy hides in the wardrobe . Having no idea that it is magic , Lucy just climb into the wardrobe . Lucy soon finds herself in a winter wonderland . In this place called , Narnia , Lucy meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus . Lucy is told that the White Witch wants to capture humans and turn them into stone . Later Lucy returns into the real world . She tells everyone about her adventures in Narnia but everyone thinks she is kidding . Soon everyone finds out Narnia . They meet a beaver and then the beaver tells them the White Witch has caught Mr. Tumnus . They have to meet a lion named Aslan to set him free . Later they meet him and they make a plan to kill the queen . They go to the queens 's castle and kill the queen 's army . Ladies and gentlemen , I invite and encourage you to read the book The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe .
4 #### The magician 's nephew is the first book of the Narnia series , the prequel to " The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe " , and tells how the magic land of Narnia came into being , why the evil Witch is there , how - in a place without electricity - the street lantern always shines , and how the wardrobe became the doorway between our world and Narnia . Lewis wrote it in 1955 , after he had finished the other Narnia books , except the last one : The Great Battle ( 1956 ) . The book tells how two kids are sent to another world , by a weaked and coward magician , because he wants to experiment with magic rings , that he doen't really understand . On their travels they encouter a evil witch , which they unfortunately bring back with them to their own unmagical world , and even more sadly to the new magical world of Narnia , where she will be the cause of much sorrow in the later Narnia books . Lewis uses a language that can be understood by kids , in such a way that it enchants grown - ups as well . Perhaps it takes some time , before this first book really gathers speed , but when it does , the magic of Narnia and Aslan is very powerfull , pulling the reader inside the book . The pictures made by Pauline Baynes are wonderfully supportive .
5 #### The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the greatest series ever written . When I first picked up " The Magician 's Nephew " , I thought that the series would be a bore and just bad . Boy how I was wrong . " The Magician 's Nephew " was a great introductory to this great series . All of the books were carefully thought out and came out a true masterpiece . I beleive that the new order which C.S. Lewis wanted the books to published in after he died was a great order . I just think that some fans did not like this becasue it was in chronological order . Everybody is different so you may read them however you please . The series will always have it 's same beauty in any order . I feel that the most powerful and most enjoyful book of the series is " The Last Battle . " The original when first published did not include this . Therefore you are very lucky to be able to enjoy this fabulous addition . So , that 's basically it . The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the greatest series ever written . Whether you are an old Narnian or a brand new fan , you will definitley enjoy this series of beautiful novels . When reading the series be sure not skip one book as they are all so good . Buy this series and enjoy . HAPPY READING !
5 #### You 'll turn the pages so fast your hand might catch fire . My dad would read these books to me and my sister before our bedtimes as kids , but we only got as far as The Horse And His Boy . 10 years later , I picked up the books again and was shocked to find that I completed the whole series in a matter of 7 days . The books are timeless and are perfect for child and adult alike .
4 #### Lewis is truly in his realm in the fantasy world of Narnia . You 'll be amazed at how the wonder you experienced as a child will carry over into adulthood , as some of the more complicated symbolism becomes clearer and more powerful . Some may question the ordering of the stories in chronological order , but if this is not to your liking ( and it is not to mine ) , then just be sure to check the dates and read them in the order published , starting with " The Lion , the With and the Wardrobe " . And in addition to the great story , the illustrations are especially powerful and will further enjoyment of the youngest readers in your family .
5 #### If you have never read the seven books that make up THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA , you have missed a universe of wonder , awe , danger , magic and , of course , good and evil . But here is your chance to begin an unforgettable journey ( I absolutely remember how it was when I first read these books as a child ) with a beautiful , elegant one - volume collection . At over 500 pages , it 's no pocket novel , but the publishers and illustrator have done a first - rate job on this edition . And , of course , the stories are masterpieces and always will be . Even if you HAVE read the stories , this collection has its own spell of beauty ; and what a great edition to use to read to kids ! I highly recommend it .
5 #### I was first told about these books when I was in my early teens . Although I expected that I might be to old of them , I was strongly encouraged to give them a try . I am now reading them for a second time , and they are still just as magical ! The Chronicles series reaches a high quality level that many children 's series today simply do not reach . Although they are extremely entertaining page turners , they also stress the concepts of right and wrong in a way that is not preachy , but magical ! The series actually starts with " The Magician 's Nephew " . This and the other books are full of magic , puzzles , moral lessons , and adventures ! This book sets the stage and gives the reader the necessary background for the series , but it in itself is an entertaining story . To name a favorite book in this series would be impossible , like picking a favorite child ! Each is magical in its own way . Unlike some series , " The Last Battle " as a final book provides a somewhat surprising yet basically satisfying ending to the series . Although you are sad the series is done , you feel rewarded for having read it ! These books promote values that all children should learn ! This series is an exciting gift for any child , or child at heart ! If you missed these books in your childhood , do n't hesitate to pick them up now .
5 #### C.S. Lewis proves that there are no limits to imagination . The characters , landscapes and stories he created touched me deeply as a child and continue to resonate as I grow older . One of the great treats of living on planet Earth . My only advice , other than getting these ASAP , is to read The Magician 's Nephew sixth instead of first , like it was ordered in the original set . The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe is a much easier read , especially for children , and a better entry into this magical land . The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and A Horse and His Boy are my personal favorites .
5 #### These children 's books are written with enough allegorical and metaphorical sophistiation to provide fullfilling reading for even the smartest of grownups ! ! If you have kids , by all means , you 'll enjoy reading them aloud , and you 'll be feeding their hearts and brains the kind of message that helps them be healthy and good . But if you do n't ? You need no excuse to read these fantasy classics with your bifocals .
5 #### All I can say is that you will never be sorry that you read these books . You will long to revisit the land of Narnia again and again ( and maybe even strive to put a little of Narnia 's magic into our own world ) .
5 #### I think this is the best Narnia book in the whole series because it was never boring and it had a wonderful ending . It is about an ape and a donkey finding a lion's - skin and use it to look like Aslan to have power over the Narnian population . It was not the donkey 's fault , though , because the Ape was so convincing that the donkey just kept on going with the plan . It is kind of eerie though the way the book was written to be like the book of Revelation , and I was surprised that Susan is n't one of the Seven Friends of Narnia . She could not possibly just outgrow Narnia and think it was just a silly game she and her siblings used to play . In the story the old Narnia ends and a new , much better Narnia begins . To add , I think it is better for the Harper Collins series of the Narnia books to be read in the order the publishers want them to be , because I followed the old and correct order that other Narnia readers said was the original order , and it mixed the stories up and confused me .
5 #### You can read the books chronologically by date of publication or by the timeline of the stories themselves . In " CS Lewis : Letters to Children " a letter is included in which a child asks Lewis what the proper order is in which to read the books . CS Lewis gives some explanation about how the books were not published in chronological order , but he recommends reading them in chronological order that being the order listed in the book description above . So it seems clear that reading them either way is just as good and will not decrease the pleasure in reading these amazing books . I originally read them in the order in which they were published , that is The Lion , the With , and the Wardrobe first and The Magician 's Nephew 4th or so . I enjoyed the books just as much that way . I highly recommend that everyone read these books in either order . Also , if you can obtain a copy of " CS Lewis : Letters to Children " I highly recommend it . It gives a greater insight into the man who wrote these books .
5 #### I am not going to dispute that this is a great book because it is , but it is NOT Book One of the Chronicles of Narnia . Reading this First SPOILS the mystery of the Wardrobe in " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " . If you want to read the books in the correct order it is as follows : 1 . The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe 2 . Prince Caspian 3 . The Voyage of the Dawn Dreader 4 . The Silver Chair 5 . The Horse and His Boy 6 . The Magician 's Nephew 7 . The Last Battle DO Read this book , just please read it at the right time .
5 #### I credit this series with the start of a life long love affair with books . I read these as a child and reread them still . I would hope that everyone reads these books and I buy them for gifts for the children in my life . They have a religious touch that is not in your face , just a good will win in the end . Beautifully written and I will always cherish them .
5 #### These books were given to me as a gift by my Aunt about 26 years ago . I remember reading them and enjoying them as fairy tales , and only years later realizing there was also an underlying theology tale being told by a great writer . Any way you read them they are a wonderfully entertaining story in a world that you love more than your own : Children , theology students , Fantasy role playing game players , all will like these books . As a child these books were unparalleled in their creativity and imagination . How C.S. Lewis was able to write so well for children when he had none of his own is astounding . My only disappointment so many years ago is when I finished the last , and realized there were no more to read .
5 #### Well , we started our son on this ..... and from time to time still read it to him . I got them for my husband to read to my son when he was less than a year old , and now that he 's almost four , he 's going to really start to understand the magic , mystic and wonder of the whole collection , and hopefully enjoy it as much as my husband and I enjoy reading it !
5 #### You can hardly raise literate children without The Chronicles of Narnia . It would be like growing up and never hearing of the land of Oz . These books are absolutely beautiful . In fact , they 're one reason adults need children and grandchildren , nieces and nephews -- to give themselves an excuse to read books that are called " children 's books . " No matter what you 're outlook on life is ( or your age ) , you 'll love these creative tales of an imaginative land .
5 #### I read through the entire Narnia series a long time ago , with the exception of " The Last Battle " - I now see I was missing a large part of the story . Where do I begin ? The book goes beyond comprehension , and brings a new light to allegorical fantasy . I think it especially good that C.S. Lewis injected allegory into children 's literature , a thing that seems seldom done these days . This story is a delightful layout of the Book of Revelation in Narnian terms , with the final battle ( meaning the end of Narnia as we have known it ) , and the renewal and creation of a brand new world , without pain or suffering : the heaven of Narnia . No family or home should be without these great books . While their influence is obviously Christian , secular sections of society can also enjoy them since the author never talks about God or Christ directly , but uses imaginary creatures and words to replicate them into the world he created . With wonderful pros C.S. Lewis has communicated his feelings perfectly to the reader , both Christian and non . Overall I would definitely rate " The Last Battle " as one of the best in the Narnia series . It still amazes me that these books are 50 years old and so timeless - here , here to C.S. Lewis !
5 #### As previously stated , please read the books in the originalpublished order , a more enjoyable experience for sure . Here are mythoughts on this wonderful series . I had never heard of Narnia till about two years ago . A friend of mine told me about them and for the next two weeks she read " The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe " to me over the phone . I was twenty - two years old at the time and I could n't help but be excited when it was time for the next chapter . I 'm two years older now and I own my own set . The Chronicles of Narnia are some of the best books I 've ever read . On any level . There 's something in Narnia for everyone , from a child to an adult these books can enrich and bring joy to a rather ordinary existence . This set along with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings sweep me off to magical lands and fantastic adventures . Sometimes it 's like I never want to come back .... thank you C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien .
4 #### Lucy and Edmund return to Narnia and find themselves on the Dawn Treader , a true sailing vessel for a magical children 's story , traveling with Prince Caspian on a quest to find the end of the world . However , when the children are returned to their favorite land , they bring along their cousin , the sour and demanding Eustace Scrubb . Through many adventures at sea and during ports of call , Eustace makes the rather predictable transformation into an alright chap , but do n't mistake the predictability of this end for cheap or sloppy story telling on Lewis 's part . Eustace 's transformation can be interpreted as the transformation of the unbeliever to a Christian , and the symbolism of his physical change is rich and compelling for adults and engaging and magical for children . Our dear , brave friend Reepacheep is back , too , and shows his continuing bravery in a heartwarming ending that causes readers to feel great admiration for the little mouse with big courage . The richest part of the novel is the well described climax in which the story takes on a mythical nature and our friends come close to the line between heaven and earth . It 's a lovely book , and as usual for the series , can be enjoyed on theological levels , but it loses nothing if the reader picks it up as pure fantasy for someone looking for a great tale !
5 #### C.S. Lewis creates a magical world of centaurs , witches , kings , queens , fauns , etc . so real you wish you could find your own secret passage to Narnia . Each book in this series stands alone as it 's own story , but once you read one , you will want to read all of The Chronicles of Narnia . The characters come to life and their adventures , although fantastic , are likened to every day struggles of the real world . A beautiful religious message of eternal life offered through Christianity is woven into the stories , but is not overpowering or pushy . Christians will delight in the parallels and non - Christians will savor the books for their entertaining fiction .
4 #### O.K. The Chronicles of Narnia are children 's books , but they do n't have to be considered that way . If you are a Christian , you 'll actually find Lewis rewrote the bible in a simple and more cheerful way , disguising Christ as Aslan and showing Israel as the land of Narnia , though this was not Lewis ' original intention , nor does he mention this fact in the books . Even if you 're an adult , its not hard to give way to the magic that surrounds these books . These simple stories are easy to follow , portray people we can all relate to , and are entertaining . Whether you are reading these book at the age of seven or reading these to your children at bed - time , you 'll easily become hooked on the writings of one of the world 's greatest modern Christian thinkers .
5 #### I wrote a thesis in college on certain children 's books , and I still consider the Narnia Chronicles to be the best children 's books ever written ... partly because the enjoyment of reading them never dies away . I have read the series numerous times , and each time , another layer or bit of truth becomes clear to me . Aslan and his followers tend to impart more Truth to me than some parts of " religion " do . No one should go through life without reading at least The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe . And once you read that , you 'll not be able to stop until you finish the series . If , however , you could only read two Narnia books , I would suggest that The Last Battle be your second , especially if you are afraid of the End of the World or are struggling with the idea of Hell . Lewis has an interesting and creative approach to these two ideas .
5 #### This is by far the best Narnia bood there is . It has everything you want in a book and I FINALLY figured out [ after reading the first four books ] who Aslan is in our own world . In this astounding journey , Lucy and Edmund are brought to Narnia with their nasty cousin Eustace . Prince Caspain is on a voyage to find the seven lords who were sent to sea by his evil uncle Miraz . They journey through the Lone Islands and find many more unknown islands . This is my absolute favorite because of the beautiful descriptions of places . Buy this wonderful and magnificent book so you can have the pleasure of reading it .
5 #### This story is again about the Pevensies . They return to Narnia to find themselves in a land of war and unrest . King Miraz has taken the throne and persecutes anyone who follows the old Narnian ways . Prince Caspain is getting together an army of old Narnians to fight the evil Miraz . Read this book to find out more .
5 #### These wonderful books will appeal to children of all ages and backgrounds . They will especially appeal to those kids who are reading the Harry Potter series now , with the myth and wonder of Aslan and his magical world , Narnia . ( I wo n't synopsize the plots , you can see those in the reviews above . ) I read these books over and over as a child , and still read them occasionally as an adult . They are terrific for older children to read on their own , or to be read to younger children . As a child I was unaware of the allegorical aspects of the books , and that can either be stressed or not , as a parent chooses . I too would recommend that the books be read in the order they were published , since The Lion , The Witch , and the Wardrobe is such a great introduction to the four children , Aslan , and Narnia . These books will take your children into another world , filled with magical talking creatures , one which will be with them all their lives . Do n't hesitate to buy this series , for yourself or your children !
5 #### This is one of the most absorbing and beautiful book I have ever read in my entire life . C.S. Lewis is an amazing children 's book writer . I wish he had written many more books , but I love them all . This particular book is the beginning of the comings and goings between Narnia . During a yucky and cold summer , two children named Digory and Polly become good friends . They are exploring a secret passage when Digory 's mad uncle gives them a horrible yet amazing gift . They are crystaline rings which will transport you into a different world . They go on many incredible adventures and return to London with a horrible queen . In attemps to make her leave , they take her to a new land being born where they meet all kinds of extraordinary creatures .
5 #### All I can do is echo the other 269 people that have reviewed this wonderful collection of books by C.S. Lewis . The Chronicles of Narnia are an excellent way to get children interested in reading and helps them develop imagination . I read this collection over and over again as a child and young adult , and I hope my son gets the same enjoyment out of them as I did . This is a must read for any person 's library especially if you love fantasy and Christian symbolism told in a fantasy / adventure sort of way .
5 #### A lot of people argue about whether The Magician 's Nephew is book one or book six in the Narnia series . Either way , ( I read it second - after The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and have now reread it after finishing the series ) it is an excellent book . It is the genesis of all the adventures in Narnia ; and is a masterpiece ! A little boy named Digory and his friend Polly are sent to a place between the worlds by Digory 's mad - scientist / magician uncle Andrew . From there they awaken an ancient evil , witness the death of one world and the birth of another . In telling the story , C.S. Lewis writes with both wit and skill . His grasp on human nature is both insightful and entertaining . This book serves as a parable for our own creation and fall . It is a book I recommend to people of all ages .
5 #### You really should n't . It needs to be read after the others and before The Last Battle . I read them all in a very strange order . ( 1 . Lion , Witch , Wardrobe 2 . Horse and His Boy 3 . Voyage of Dawn Treader 4 . Prince Caspian 5 . Magician 's Nephew 6 . Silver Chair 7 . Last Battle ) It was just the order I found them at the store in . Anyway , this is in my opinion the best of them all . It is so involving and the whole Wood Between the Worlds concept is amazing . The starting of Narnia and everything . Seeing who the White Witch really was . It was all very interesting . The story is very involving and the plot and storyline is great !
5 #### Across the Great Eastern Sea , the Dawn Treader sails to strange islands hundreds of miles away from home . The younger two of teh Four Pevensies ( Edmund and Lucy ) return to Narnia with their snotty cousin , Eustace who learns a lesson or two along the way . Prince Caspian ( X ) returns with the crew of the Dawn Treader , seeking to reach the End of the World . This is such a hard - to - put - down book ! You never know what kind of place they 'll reach next ! There 's always something new in this book ! The crew faces horrible dangers that you 'll never want to miss out on . One of the best Narnia books !
5 #### I first discovered Narnia when I saw the animated movie , The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe as a child . Then I read the whole series around age 13 . I loved every book and have read them several times . I am currently reading them to my 11 year old child and we are on the last book . I even went and bought my child a set of the older editions that are numbered in the order they were written . I am a little disappointed with the renumbering of the books . The first book , Lion , Witch , and Wardrobe , is essentially the main building block for the rest of the series and By reading them in chonilogical order instead of the order written , you do n't get the same character base or even the same sense of Narnia . Especially in the case of Aslan . So much on Aslan 's personallity and character was shown the The Lion , Witch , Wardrobe that you are left a little short until you get to that book with the new numbering . Anyway , children of all ages will enjoy this boxed set no matter what it 's numbering order and I highly recommend it to any and all .
5 #### In this gathering of the Narnia books you will find the marvelous literature by C.S. Lewis in a very nice edition . Full of magic and emotions it is a must for fantasy readers and it helps to understand many of the fiction books of the last decades . A treasure full of values for children and magic visions for grown ups . also recomended : StarDust - Neil Gaiman Harry Potter - J.K. Rowling
5 #### Hi , Of course , i know Narnia chronicles to be wondrous books but my message will call for help - please , do n't delete it ! I live in the former USSR territory where few or none Christian books are available . At present I write my bachelor 's work about the Chronicles and some time ago I lost access to them in original ( English ) - the library closed . Yet , to finish my work and to defend I need them very , VERY much . Is there any willing Christian who could send me the complect of the Chronicles ? i ask you from all my heart , please , be helpful , for I do n't know anymore , what to do . Please , help , if you are Christians . I am already very thankful . Yours truly Barbala My email address - brr81@hotmail.com My defense of BA is planned in June . Please , please , SOMEBODY !
5 #### Pretend that once upon a time you are flung into another world with your best friend where you meet a magic lion and encounter an evil witch before you return to your home in London . That is how it is for Digroy and Polly , the first Son of Adam and Daughter of Eve to come into the now newborn world of Narnia . There Digory is given a quest to go to an enchanted apple orchard to bring Aslan the Lion an enchanted apple . But in the apple orchard , after dismounting a flying horse and leaving Polly to wait for him ( for it was a special place , and you are only to go in on appointed business ) , he meets none other but the Witch Jadis of Charm herself , who temps him to steal away with her and be forever full of youth and never die . While it tells of Narnia 's begining , it also tells of the begining of our world -- the story of Adam and Eve , if you look closely within Chapter 13 . Younger ones can still enjoy this tale . For they know only the simple pleasures of it , not the background that I have just now realized and am penning ( or rather typing ) in this review . A supurb book with wonderful background and yet a still enjoyable charming little tale that will make you beg for more . Also Reccomended : The Other Chronicles of Narnia
5 #### PRINCE CASPIAN : THE RETURN TO NARNIA picks up just where THE LION , THE WITCH , AND THE WARDROBE leaves off -- even though it covers events hundreds of years later ! It has been hundreds of years since the Prenseives ( Kings and Queens Peter , Susan , Edmud , and Lucy ) came into Narnia and helped Aslan , the noble Lion , rid Narnia of the White Witch . Now , as they return to the enchanted land , it is not a return of the Witch they have to deal with , but a new problem for their land , and that is as follows : In the many years since they have been gone from Narnia , a false and unjust king has taken the throne , and all the magical beings , enchanted talking trees , and other magicfilled friends of Lucy and her family have disappeared from vision , and Narnia is now as England is for the Prensieves -- a man 's country ! Now it is up to the High King Peter and the other Prensieves to aid Narnia once more by putting the rightful king -- Caspian The Tenth -- on the throne and restoring the magic in their wonderful land . All in all , the plot is as best as ever , the charecters as charming as in all the other books , and the events more suprising than ever before ! PRINCE CASPIAN makes a supurb forth Narnian adventure , ( and it is ) just as entertaining if you read it apart from the other CHRONICLES OF NARNIA by the wonderfully creative C.S. Lewis .

5 #### The contents of this story were amusing ( funny ! ) , interesting , " dreamy " and amazing ! It was a great story , and I actually felt sad coming to the end of the book ... not because I did n't have any other books to read at the moment , but because the adventures of Polly and Digory were ending ...
5 #### Prince Caspian By : C.S. Lewis Report By : Cashew Brown This book is about 4 kids that get sent to a magical place called Narnia . Narnia is a place of magic , mystery , and talking animals . They came across a dwarf that was about to be murdered . They rescued the dwarf from a long , painful death from drowning . The dwarf , thankful for his life , told the children a long story about Prince Caspian . He told of a boy that was heir to the throne of Narnia . He ran away from his castle and got knocked out and woke up in a small cave with two dwarfs and a talking raccoon . They told all of the magical creatures that lived in the area . They all had a meeting and declared war on the castle . The dwarf , having finished his story , led them to the mainland . They got lost in a large forest for several days . When they finally got out they went straight to Prince Caspian . They had a discussion and finally agreed on a duel with the king . Caspian had the duel the next day . Caspian had a hard battle but won . Then the four kids were sent back home . I liked this book because I love anything to do with fantasy . Ever since I could read I would always try to get only fantasy books to read . That is why I like this book . I give this book 5 stars .
5 #### IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MAGICAL STORY , HERE 'S YOUR SERIES ! The order the plubisher put them in after Lewis wrote them is as follows , although I 'm not sure I spelled everything correctly : # 1 THE MIGACIAN 'S NEPHEW # 2 THE LION , THE WITCH , AND THE WARDROBE # 3 THE HORSE AND HIS BOY # 4 PRINCE CASPAN # 5 THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER # 6 THE SILVER CHAIR # 7 THE LAST BATTLE The star charecter of the books , I can tell , is easily Aslan , and his bravery in LION was stunning ! NARNIA is a true favorite , a treasure , and a classic . Please Note : Personally , I believe the easiest way to read them all is by buying THE COMPLETE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA ( a 500 + page book including the full text of ALL SEVEN Narnia novels ) , or by buying the boxed set ( either in hardcover of paperback . ) Any way you read them , make sure you will be there for the entire Time of The World of Narnia . You 'll surely enjoy it , trust me ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Please Also Read These Other Reccomended Series and/or Books : MARY POPPINS SERIES by P.L.

5 #### Reviewer : A reader from Franklin , Tn January 24 , 2000 Okay , words can not describe how much these books mean to me . These 7 books are what started my love for reading . I read them when I was in 5th grade , and I was one of those kids who loathed reading . But when I discovered these classics , I beame an avid reader . These seven tales take you on a wonderous trip throughout the land of Narnia . You follow the lives of a handful of children , and the magical adventures they play out in Narnia . They are guided by the wisdom af Aslan the lion . He takes the children on a number of amazing adventures that change their lives . Again , I really ca n't explain how influential these books have been on my life . My personal favorite is _ The Voyage of the Dawn Treader _ . I truly cherish these tales , and you will to when you read them .
4 #### The Magician 's nephew was a great book . It make you fell enchanted in the magical land of Narnia . This book was especially thrilling when Digery was riding a winged horse . `
5 #### I could enumerate the many high points of all of C.S. Lewis'swriting , but why ? The other reviewers have done so . I would , however , like to point out : THIS IS NOT BOOK ONE ! Some silly publisher got the idea that publishing the Chronicles of Narnia in chronological order would somehow help readers . Wrong ! This story has a hundred times more meaning if you read it as book six , where it 's supposed to be . The others are okay in the new order ( " The Horse and His Boy " was originally book five , but you can read it anywhere after " Lion " and still be okay ) , but you take away a lot of the special - ness of finding out how everything fits together if you read this first . Once again , THE MAGICIAN 'S NEPHEW IS BOOK 6 ! DO NOT READ IT FIRST ! Now I 've made my point . Thank you for tolerating the capital letters . :-)
4 #### THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA were the most wonderful and important books I read as a child . I am still upset by this set HarperCollins has published in the last few years that has re - ordered the seven volumes chronologically based on the historical line in the novels . This is apparently according to Lewis 's wishes , if so , Lewis was wrong ! The best part of the series was reading " The Magician 's Nephew " sixth and discovering with a beautiful and never - replicated surprise about all the things that happened before " The Lion , The Witch and The Wardrobe . " ( See several reviews below that already say this better . ) By all means buy these books for your children , godchildren , nieces and nephews , but PLEASE , specify that the FIRST time they read them that they read them in the original order : LWW , PC , VDT , SC , HHB , MN , LB . They will reread them for the rest of their lives , in every possible order , but something great and beautiful and unsurpassed will be stolen from them if they read The Magician 's Nephew first .
5 #### I just saw this book in a toy store the other day and could n't help picking it up and browsing thru it . I have always loved the Chronicles since I received a boxed set at age 8 from a favorite aunt . Like other reviewers , I feel that the books are meant to be read in the order they were published , not chronologically . But the illustrations in this edition more than make up for that - especially the maps ! And I must add here that Amazon 's price is a BARGAIN at $ 35.00 . This is a beautifully , colorfully illustrated book of stories that belong in all children 's libraries .
5 #### I first read these books as a box set when I was in grade 2 or 3 . The Narnia series became my favourite series then and still are among my favourite books of all time . I ca n't believe J.R.R. Tolkien told his friend C.S. Lewis not to publish these masterpieces . I 'm glad Lewis did n't take the advice to heart . I reccomend these books to anyone .
4 #### This third volume of the Narnia Chronicles is a wonderful story of exploration and adventure . Reading it gives one a vivid feeling of being at sea , far from home and so very alone . Lewis evokes an intense sense of risk and purpose on the part of the crew of the Dawn Treader . There are of course deeper themes not far under the surface of things here , but on the simple level of a rich and entertaining children 's story , this is exquisite work .
5 #### If you 've not read 'em , read 'em . If you have read 'em , read 'em again . Probably the best children 's books out there , and that 's saying a lot . " The Chronicles of Narnia " are exciting , entertaining , great fun , and have enough suspense to be engaging the whole way through . Do n't worry too badly about the book order ; Either way , it 'll make sense when you 're done . My father read these to me when I was little , and I plan to do the same for my kids someday . " The Chronicles of Narnia " are classics for a very good reason .
5 #### I also read this series as a child and it sparked my imagination . Lewis does a masterful job of drawing you in to his world and leaves a lasting impression in your mind . I read them nearly 20 years ago , and I can still recall the title of all seven books , and the plots of every adventure . Simply wonderful ! Now I want to read them all over again ....
5 #### This , in my opinion , is one of the greatest series of books ever written . Even if you discard every aspect of Christian allegory the books are still well told , creative works . When one adds in the Christian allegory it becomes an even deeper book with more meaning . Classics !
5 #### For the first time , I have completed the entire 7 book series . And I found each volume to be just as charming as the next . I especially love the way the 7th volume ended and I clouded up a bit . Any " true " lover of books and fantasy owes it to themselves to read the full series head to tail .
5 #### This book is the last volume in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series . The last King of Narnia fights a hopeless battle against evil yet finds glory . He discovers that reality and Narnia itself are mere " Shadow - Lands " which only mimic a truer place . A beautiful and spiritual novel , it should always be read last in the sequence of Narnia stories .
5 #### This children 's book in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series takes place about three years Narnia - time ( or , one year Earth - time ) after the events described in " Prince Caspian " ( this book was the third to be published and , in my opinion , should be the third read in the series ) . Prince Caspian and his friends sail into the unknown East to find seven missing noblemen . The expedition evolves in a journey of discovery ( even , personal discovery ) . The boy Eustace , a cousin to Lucy and Edmund , must learn to see his own flaws and to painfully lose all of his " encrusted " character imperfections and vices . In response to Henry from Canberra , Australia ( of April 3 , 1999 ) , I did n't think Lewis was preaching ; he does not overdo the " Christianity thing " ( of course , that was his point ) . And , to drown a hero like Reepicheep ? ? ? Can you imagine what the responses would have been from young readers ? In addition , I seriously doubt that such a death would fit into Lewis ' allegory and the ultimate fate of Reepicheep .
5 #### This is the second volume published in the allegorical Chronicles of Narnia series ( and , in my opinion , the second to be read even though it is not the second in the internal time sequence in the series ) . The four children return to Narnia a year later to discover that centuries have passed in Narnia . The talking animals are in hiding and an evil king has usurped the throne . The children aid the young Prince Caspian to obtain the throne and lead the talking animals back to their proper place : once more , a battle between good and evil .
5 #### Lucy , Peter Susan and Edward are going to school and suddenly they are in a ruined place . At first they do n't know where they are . And then it all comes back to them that they are in Narnia . Then they meet a little guy . He 's a dwarf . They hear his story about King Caspian . They want to help , but there 's just one problem ... how do they get to Aslan 's Hoe ? the rest of the story tells about their adventures as they find their way to Prince Caspian and to save old Narnia . I liked this story , but at times I got lost . If you do n't read the stories before this one you will probably get lost in the names and places . So I recommend this book , but read the others before you read The Chronicles of Narnia .
4 #### The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of 7 books written by C.S. Lewis . They tell stories about a mysterious land called Narnia and tne kings , queens , animals , and other people who have lived there throughout time . Each book has an exciting story line that is easy to read and follow . I like the Chronicles of Narnia because each book is telling a story of adventure , mystery and excitement ! I think they are a good line of stories for anyone to read from ages 8 to 98 ! The only thing that is confusing about them is the British accent . So if you are looking for a line of stories to read on a rainy day , check out these books !
3 #### The allegory presented by Lewis of God ( represented by Aslan the Lion ) and Satan ( represented by " The White Witch " ) is somewhat manipulative . Many of the justifications that it uses in asserting Christianity are the very things that atheists and agnostic disagree with . For example , in one section , Lucy is the only one of the four children who can see Aslan . As a result , the other children have to follow her on Blind Faith . Well , blind faith here is necessary because we accept the faith after knowing the truth . In Christianity , we are expected to have blind faith without knowing the truth . Read this book to your child pr enjoy it as an allegory as an adult , but be sure to talk about it with your children also .
5 #### I remember as a child having mixed feelings about this book . I found it a little hard to get through , because it seemed to introduce so many characters which were not in earlier books and which did n't really captivate me . However , it was worth it to get to the glorious ending . I remember feeling so glad that C. S. Lewis let the story end the way it did , which is certainly not the way most " children 's " stories end . I felt that he really respected children to not write down to them . Because of this book 's powerful message , I think it deserves 5 stars even with its minor flaws .
5 #### I loved this books ! THEY are about human trevals to Narnai . Great book for people over 9 .
5 #### THIS SHOULD BE AT LEAST RATED AN 11 . I wrote a 10 page paper on biblical imagery in 3 of the 7 books . Although imagery is present in 6 of the 7 , The Magician 's Nephew , The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , as well as the Last Battle all have signinficant imagery . Every one should read this book . All ages . Write me if there are any questions .
5 #### When I was a kid , I loved these books , I was delighted to find these here , as I still have my original copies from childhood . For those who love the artwork , target has the whole line ! !
5 #### As in all the Brambly Hedge stories , a sweet story combined with exquisite watercolor illustrations makes this a perfect read - aloud story for the very young -- although older children and adults are certainly not immune from its charm ! Those who have an interest in the fiber arts will especially appreciate the plot , as spinning , weaving -and especially dyeing- play an intregal part in this adventure . The adventure itself is gently humorous and nicely evocative of the beauty and hardship of mountain terrains . My 3 - yr - old daughter finds it a great inspiration , slinging on her backpack to pretend she is like the young mouse Wilfred Toadflax , intrepid explorer ...
5 #### William Dalrymple has a great writing style and a deep apetite for understanding the historical and cultural context . He neither takes the clinical distant approach to his subjects neither does he use a patronizing attitude to India . If you have been to Delhi , the book will be a great reading ; if are planning to go there , it should be required reading . You will enjoy your trip so much more . Even if you do n't go to Delhi , it is just a wonderful reading . Olivia has done a great job in her illustrations .
5 #### A really wonderful book about the city of Delhi . Dalrymple and his wife go to spend a year living in Delhi ( how did they afford this ? ) , and he uses this arrangement as a way of chronicling the present day status of the city and delving deep into its history . He 's done a very nice job of moving back and forth between present and past , managing to keep all his meetings and interviews with various experts quite interesting . The only part which lost my interest was an extended look into Sufi mysticism , but I just skimmed it and moved along . Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in India , and especially to anyone planning a trip to Delhi .
5 #### dalrymple is simply one of the best travelogue writers today as he lives , breathes , imbibes the culture & history of the places he travels to . in this book , he takes you to the delhi ( india ) of old , a once beautiful and cultured city and revisits the historical , political and cultural forces that shaped it . dalrymple does all this with a keen eye and a sympathetic ear for the inhabitants of the new delhi . he shows an unusual understanding for the people who once lived there and who live there now , their aspirations & fears . even more remarkable is the fact that , the empathy dalrymple feels comes through while he successfully avoids sounding patronizing in his depiction of old & new delhi . all in all a fabulous and very enjoyable travelogue , historical account and sympathetic tale from a man who truly belongs without having been born or raised there .....
5 #### Fascinating , I learned a lot about Delhi ( and India ) . The author is a very good story teller .
5 #### I love this author ! Descriptive elements and characters that have a genuine character and an authentic voice . Extremely readable and informative !
5 #### I heard the author speak , once , about Afghanistan and his knowledge of the Middle East amazed me . India represents an incredible culture dating back 3000 years . The author loves India and I learned much . I shall read this again !
5 #### I loved this book . It is scholarly and at the same time funny . I will read other books by him .
4 #### A loving and respectful history of a great city and it 's history - well told in a mix of the past and present .
4 #### If you think you know Dehli well , then read this as I am sure you will learn something new . It 's a great read and will sure to set you searching and I found it went a long way to explain what is so different about Dehli , compared to other Indian cities .
5 #### If you want to read a history / travelogue / story of Delhi then this is the book to read . Having been to Delhi twice now I can that William Dalrymple has captured not only the facts of Dehli but also the spirit of the city also .
5 #### A great overview of the history and cultural underpinnings that have created modern New Delhi . Dalrymple weaves his contemporary experiences of living in Delhi for a year to the history of the British Raj and Mogul empire . He visited many forgotten historical sites in old Delhi . I 've recently moved to New Delhi on a diplomatic assignment . This book provided useful background information even though it was published over 10 years ago .
5 #### This an outstanding book that explores both modern and historic Delhi . Dalrymaple does a brilliant job of taking a personal narrative and using to to insightfully investigate Delhi and sifts through the layers of culture that build the city and shaped it . I read it prior to my first vacation to India and loved it . I strongly recommend it for those who are interested in India or Delhi .
5 #### A most interesting story of a Scottish writer in the India of the 1980 's . An insight into the post - independence atmosphere in India and its present society .
5 #### Dalrymple is one of my favorite authors . The book is well researched and moves quickly . He captures the essence of Indian life as it speeds through history to the present in Delhi and its environs .
4 #### I read this book while traveling to Delhi and it was a wonderful read . It was short and light , but did a great job of weaving the past and present in a story in about the same way that Delhi itself blends past and present . I 'd recommend for anyone from the West travelling to Delhi for the first time !
5 #### Another important read on New Delhi , India . Arrived in good condition , and a swift delivery . Thank you
5 #### took me back to all the monuments I saw in Delhi . no longer just a building but now I got story along with it .
2 #### This is more a history book than a portait of contemporary Delhi . William and Olivia , his mate , quickly become dull . The interesting characters mentiond in the synopsis are never fleshed out . Most are introduced by way of very brief interviews . I expected more than a very superficial rendition of what are probably fascinating people and an complex city .
5 #### After a visit to Delhi , I read this book and greatly enjoyed it -- it added to my visit considerably .
4 #### This is a wonderful " documentary " book . So well written with humour and insight about the history of Delhi . The author 's clearly extensive research has certainly paid off in a fascinating account covering a wide range of aspects . My only criticism is that I found it too long . I , too , began to feel a bit jaded at the end of the sweltering Dehi summer !
5 #### A fascinating account of the city of Delhi . Not dry at all , actually a page turner
3 #### So - so . Interesting about this guy 's life . Not anything that I thought about when I was n't reading it , though .
5 #### Dalrymple is an author who works on a big scale , covering , many years , event centuries and portraying a wide variety of characters and cultures in his work . This book records not just the year that the author and his wife spent living in Delhi , but the experiences of natives and new arrivals ; those who came to to Delhi , and who were sent away in the 1947 Partition and much of the history of this ancient , holy city . Written in 1993 , the book does not feel date , although I am not really current on developments in India . I picked this up after being very impressed with The Last Mughal and The Return of the King by the same author . City of Djinns is a hybrid book , a blend of travel , history and memoir that will be enjoyed by anyone with an interest in modern India .
3 #### I 'm trying to learn more about India and thought that reading this work on Delhi would provide unique insights . I thought the approach was interesting , but while reading I continuously felt that I was missing something . Dalrymple segues between topics almost conversationally , but I kept losing the historical timelines . Sometimes I needed to know much more , and often , much less . The book does give a sense that Indians are very generous with their time , and patient , too .
4 #### I liked this read because I enjoyed all the historical , cultural , spiritual & even architectural insights . Not a real " page turner " but kept me interested with a steady diet of fascinating stories .
5 #### Dalrymple does an amazing job of describing India and the Delhi in particular - it 's somewhat difficult to describe what goes on in India without sounding like a bit of a buffoon or ugly Westerner but Dalrymple paints a pretty accurate picture without sounding condescending . I liked this enough to read other books on India he has written .
5 #### I read this book when it was first published ; I was living in New Delhi at the time . Dalrymple 's writing astounded me , especially for one so young as he was then . I 've thought of the book many times in the past 15 or so years , and when I learned one of my friends plans to travel to N.D. in the coming spring , I knew I had to gift her with this book . She will love it as much as I do , I predict . The layers of the city are peeled back through Dalrymple 's sensitive approach to history and culture , and the reader is transported to places and times that are long gone , as well as those that are contemporary . Walking through the streets of New Delhi and Old , the reader feels as though the City has come alive in some other dimension . Voices speak from the past , and some of those voices have lessons to share .
5 #### This is n't a guide book . Or a clever fiction that if fun to read because it takes place where you happen to be traveling . This is an deep dive into some hidden aspects of an ancient and fascinating city . Much of which is barely visible in this very modern city , but is still important - essential even - to understanding Delhi . I was lucky enough to read this book while living in Delhi for a year myself . Certain aspects of the city the book covers , like the eunuchs , and part - British Indians are largely faded from the landscape .. many only there if you look hard enough like Dalrymple does . Even if you do n't experience them directly , they give context to certain areas of the city ... places you might pass over without a second glance take on a whole different perspective . If nothing else stood out from the books , the writers take on the riots after Indira Gandhi 's death are worth the read . The subtle undercurrents of tension in India can often be lost on the casual observer . But if you want to understand this complex city , it 's worth learning the harshest parts . Often history glosses over the dark parts , but this book dives right in . After all , the Djinn 's are the ghosts that make the city what it is . Do n't get stuck on the modern veneer , take this book with you and explore the rich and complicated history of Delhi .
5 #### This a travel journal to both modern India and back in time in Indian history . Both are woven together in a thoughtful personal narrative that combines wisdom and humor .
5 #### This account of life in Delhi reveals so much more than the usual history books do . The author writes from the standpoint of the residents of Delhi over the years . their culture and religion and is frank about the prejudices of the British and their destructive cruelty . With his other book , the history of the 1857 " Mutiny , " or Uprising , as he calls it , we have new essential reading for students of British India
4 #### If u like history and the city of Delhi , it might be time well spent reading this book . Quite enjoyable .
3 #### I enjoyed this novel . If you have a passing interest in India 's fascinating history , you will find it a light but interesting read . Or if you wish to visit the sub - continent and Delhi , it will illuminate your understanding of this complex city . Dalrymple tells the story of a city that has been ruled by Mughals , Sikhs , Hindus , the British and more recently regained its independence . I read it swiftly . Pleasant narrator / author , who added depth to the history , by plumping out past historical figures and including current day Delhi - wallahs in their daily life . I would recommend this novel .
5 #### Book arrived on time and i began reading it immediately ! ! It is well written and is very interesting . Anyone curious about India and its people and the city of Djinns would enjoy it . I have n't been fortunate enough to visit India but feel better prepared ! I have enjoy the people immensely by working with them for years in my business . Thank you MEDIASTODAY .YAHOO for sending a book in EXCELLENT condition and promptly ! Carolyn Jenkins
4 #### Fascinating vivid historical descriptions of India ...... I found it riveting at first but it became somewhat dry and repetitive as you passed beyond the first third .
4 #### Started reading this before my trip to Delhi . Glad that I did n't finish it as I 'm really enjoying reflecting on my trip after the fact .
5 #### City of Djinns : A Year in Delhi was a total delight to read . I loved how it was like each page was a dicovery of a new tidbit , a new treasure of insight . The humor was also a delightful surprise . Has awakened a thirst to read more about colonial and modern India . Very highly recommended ! :D
5 #### I seldom read contemporary travel books , but found this to be a fascinating read , in large part due to the author 's device of bringing the past to life by alternating between the present and the past . In effect , this is two books in one , the first a wonderful exploration of modern Dehli , the second a history of India . The excursion to the past start in the recent past , and move backwards in time as the book progresses . It might sound a bit odd to replay history in a counter - chronological fashion , but it works beautifully by establishing a personal connection with the past through living people early in the book . I love the descriptions of the many people he gets to know in contemporary Dehli . As the book progresses and one is eventually transported to events of past millennia , the author succeeds in maintaining that connection by showing us that the history of India , even the ancient history , is present in the everyday life of the country today . I lived in India some years ago and never realized how much I missed . Now I can not wait to return .
5 #### I have been born and brought up in Delhi , and after reading the book , i realised how less I knew before about my city and how much I know now the book has been read . It is written in a witty and funny manner , and you could n't ask for more from a writter . Good work Mr. William D. I have read almost all his titles and this by far is my favourite . Icing on the cake , it 's available in Kindle edition ! ! Go for it ! ! It 's worth every cent .
4 #### This is a superb book on Delhi 's history without the textbook type narrative that usually is associated with books like these . Appreciating Delhi is difficult for most non - Delhi wallahs for the ostentatious ways and too aggressive nature of its modern day denizens .. but having read this book is like lifting the screen to see a much more beautiful and unbelievably long past of the city ; to date a city 's history till that long back is truly an amazing feat shown by Dalrymple here . Dalrymple gives comprehensive and unbiased accounts from the city 's birth to it present day status , toggling between anecdotes of his own experiences in the city . In doing so , he succeeds in bringing out the secret lives of the eunuchs , passionate pigeon fights in Old Delhi , the wild rule of William Fraser in the jungles of Mehrauli , the frivolous codes of the decorum practiced in Mughal period , the popularity of the Sufi saints and their powers and much more to help you envisage the rich heritage of the city .
5 #### I know I will never be able to visit India , so my " trip " comes from books . Dalrymple is a great tour guide . He took me places that I would n't have been able to visit even if I flew to Delhi today . The people he met and described were as fascinating as the places he explored . This book is a combination of history , tourism , mini - biography , human interest , archeology and anthropology . The mix was well balanced and Dalrymple 's writing ability made the entire book entertaining as well as educational . Please do not let the age of this book dissuade you from reading it . Dalrymple 's take on Delhi will still be worth the read for as long as people read . My only gripe ( worth a tenth of a star ) was with the only map . Though nicely drawn by his wife , it was nearly useless . A more inclusive map would have added a tremendous amount to my enjoyment .
5 #### I lived in Delhi for just under a year in the eighties , and if I had had this book then , it would have been a completely different experience for me . I walked by so much history in puraani delhi , and understood little of its significance . When I return to Delhi , this book will light my way into Mughal , British and Sufi Delhi . I agree with another reviewer that Dalrymple says relatively little about Hindu Delhi , but I think Delhi is one of the most historically cosmopolitan of cities in a subcontinent that is often painted as Hindu in broad strokes . I hope no reader takes as disrespect when I say that Hindu India gets plenty of attention ; I am glad that Dalrymple focused on what cultural roads are less traveled . He does tell , and beautifully so , the story of the role of Delhi 's ancestral settlement in the Mahabharata . What I loved most about the book was its portrayal of the vibrant Sufi community in India ; the life of a Sufi dargah ; the Qawwali singers . Learning about Sufi Delhi was a great and valuable revelation to me .
1 #### I did n't finish this book . I usually love this kind of book . I got tired of all the Indian Jargon . Yes , it has a glossary , but many of the words were n't even there . There were references to things never explained . It was like I came in on a movie in the middle . The narrative was just not enough to keep going .
5 #### Really this book is a history of Delhi , starting with modern times and progressing backwards to the very origins of the city . Dalrymple tells the story through his own visits to various sites and people in the city and interjects modern stories that add color to the city and its history . There is large emphasis on architecture , which show up in some of Dalrymple 's other writings , but is especially appropriate for Delhi with its long history of grand architectural projects and civic planning , and its current collection of Moghul , Raj and modern buildings . But in the end , it is Dalrymple 's handling of the characters , his severe Sikh landlady and her eccentric husband with his romantic interest in Dalrymple 's wife ; the old - maid sisters living in their dusty mansion like antique relics of the Raj ; the Anglo - English retired railway engineer , and the secretive eunuchs , that make this book really come alive . On a darker , more journalistic and wide - ranging note ... "The Age of Kali " is an excellent companion or just worth reading on its own .
5 #### Excellent book ! ! There is a touch of Khushwant singh 's prose history narrative ( check out Khushwant Singh 's Delhi ) . Good quality and such books become a lifelong collection to be read again and again .
5 #### Delhi is a city of many flavors . Some can be tasted , some viewed , some just felt and still others which are just to be believed ...... just taken for granted . This little book by Dalrymple brings to life a new flavor on almost every leaf . One moment you will have your heart racing finding yourself in the midst of a mehfil at the pinnacle of Delhi 's literary history and a page later you will suddenly be transported to dereliction of today 's old Delhi , description of mouth watering delicacies from Dara Shikoh 's wedding is contrasted by thirst and hunger of Daulatabad death march . The book is remarkably lucid and continuous yet it webs off to touch an aspect of Delhi 's life and pulse , leaping off once in a while , only to loop back again to complete a full circle . Alternating between past and present , like day and night , the author spans over 3000 years of Delhi 's history and history of its peoples in an ingeniously funny and at the same time poignant way . Dalrymple is a genius of pen and perception and City of Djinns is simply a superlative work of art .
5 #### An entertaining and sometimes insightful series of sketches about ex - pat life in Delhi . A good gift for someone traveling that way , fun to read in the city . I 'd also recommend Rohinton Mistry 's _ A Fine Balance _ if you 're going to India -- for the perverse reason that it is so overwhelmingly depressing that it nearly adequately prepares first - time visitors for the experience . Incidentally , Mistry 's book is also interesting on Indian history , and a beautifully well - written and plotted novel . Two very different books , but a good pairing for visitors -- armchair or otherwise .
4 #### Whether you plan to visit Delhi , have been blessed to have been there , or just want to read an informative , good traveler 's ( note : not tourist ) tale , then City of Djinns should be on your list of books to read . William Dalrymple paints a picture full of humor and fascinating detail , mixed with love and frustration . Which is what Delhi is : fascinating , frustrating , fun , and full of incredible people . Delhi is multi - layered and not easily explained . Delhi has to be experienced . Yet , Dalrymple brings to life a lot of the feeling of this magnificent city . More importantly for me , he brings to life part of its history , details history books leave out , alley ways that deserve to be explored . As a traveler blessed to return to Delhi fairly often , I have found the details of Dalrymple 's book adding value to my visits - by knowing which alley ways might just be explored .
5 #### This book concerns the year Dalrymple spends in Delhi , attempting to uncover the secrets and hidden past of this once - great city . Dalrymple skillfully weaves the accounts of his daily life with the history of Delhi . One moment , you are reading about a harrowing taxi - cab ride , and the next page , an account of Shah Jehan 's life begins . Few writers can change the pace so suddenly and get away with it , but Dalrymple is able to segue into and out of topics effortlessly . The pacing and tone of the book is great , and he injects enough humor to keep the reader chuckling from time to time . An overall great read . This book is definitely one you should read if you are at all interested in India .
4 #### After Dalrymple 's amazing first book " In Xanadu " , " City of Djinns " is a very worthy follow - up . It deals not with a journey but with the author living in Delhi for and extended period of time . William and his wife Olivia live in an apartment in Delhi with a Sikh lady and her crazy husband . Together and separately , they explore the various strands of the city . Like " In Xanadu " , Dalrymple combines erudite historical investigation with a humorous account of life today . The historical aspect of the book is very complicated . Delhi has an ancient Hindu history , a Muslim Mughal one , a Punjabi / Urdu one , the Partition phase and its modern story . In this book , Dalrymple tries his hand at digging through a bit of them all . From the violence of the Gandhi assasination riots to the extravagances of the Mughal court , he leaves nothing unturned . His warm and clever perspective shines light on a city where so many cultures and ways of life come side by side , from the modern secularised Sikhs ( like Balvinder , their taxi driver ) to the huge hermaphrodite community in the city . A highly informative and entertaining book .
5 #### Dalrymple is fast becoming a superstar in travel writing . Read City of Djinns and you will understand why . His style is authorative , yet not pompous . His anecdotes are funny without being offensive to local sensitivities . Everything he writes will bring back images and feelings amongst those who have travelled around the old decaying Mughal city . What a beautiful place it must have been in its heyday some 300 years ago . He does n't come at you from any pre - disposed angle . He just tells you what happened during the Moghul , British and then the India days from the view point of every day people . And unlike many a British writer , he does n't shy away from taking the arrogant colonialists to task for their blatant mistreatment of one of history 's richest cultures . The decline of the Moghul empire comes across as equally pathetic . The racial hatred that has followed partition is also laid bare in the most frightening detail - a sea of Muslims and Sikhs sent to inhabit each other 's territory with no chance of ever going home . This is travel writing that is frustratingly good - and often very , very funny to those who grew up in either India or the UK . If only I could tell stories as good as this . Five Stars .
5 #### " City of Djinns " is by far the best travel book I 've ever read . It transcends the genre . It was given me by an historically minded Delhi - wallah , and he could n't have offered a better volume . Mr. Dalrymple not only spent a year in Delhi , he spent centuries in the history of the 7 Delhis that have been built and lost . This is not a " go here , see this " sort of travel book . It is a " discover the wonder " book . Modern Delhi is a mess of a city , but Mr. Dalrymple takes us deeply beyond the mess into the wonder that exists and the magic that was . The incredible political and family history of Shah Jehan the founder of Delhi ( Shahjehanabad)is the " Godfather " story of family members who would stop at nothing to win the empire . There is a severed head in this story that makes the horse 's head in " The Godfather " look like child 's play . This small portion of " City of Djinns " is worth the price of admission . I 've spent a few months in Delhi , and this book would have made a better introduction than any of the usual guidebooks , as it is , it will make my return to the " City of Djinns " all the richer .
5 #### A truly marvelous book for anyone who loves India , whether they have been there in the flesh or in spirit . Dalrymple is simply one of the best writers around when it comes to creating a tapestry that has inner and outer journey so beautifully interwoven .
5 #### I like his books b / c they combine cutting edge techno - concepts into a thriller you ca n't put dowm . This is another great example of the same .
4 #### Quite gripping tale of a possible near - future where nano - technology runs amok !
4 #### Not a bad story . Its actually a fathomable concept and storyline . Michael Crichton did an excellent job blending high tech with suspense .
4 #### I read Jurassic Park and was astounded by how incredibly boring it was . The movie really blew it out of the water in comparison to the book 's flat dialogue , cardboard ( and extremely dumb ) characters , and just general look of urgency . But my sister recommended Prey to me , citing it as one of her favorite books of all time , and I can see why ! ! This was REALLY an edge of your seat type story . Just as the " swarm " evolves constantly , so does the plot and the human characters ' efforts to fight it- well , if they really ARE trying to fight it ... Trying not to give anything away , but I thought that the way the story brought in zombies was amazing . It was totally unexpected and brilliant . There is a lot of scientific explanation throughout the story , but not an overload of information at all . Imo it made things that much scarier and compelling because it all makes SENSE ... Read it , it 'll keep you guessing .
5 #### My favorite book from one of my favorite authors . This book came out a while ago , but it feels like it could have been written yesterday . Highly recommended .
4 #### Another well written Crichton thriller ! Read most of it on a flight from Los Angeles to Dallas and the time flew by .
5 #### That no one in the real world ever comes up with this plan . Another read from Crichton . I would recommend to anyone who reads .
1 #### I feel very bad about writing a negative report on a work by such a well - known and successful author . I watch many of the films made from his books , which I have never read until now . I loved those movies , each unique in topic and plotline . Because of that I decided to read his books . I chose Prey because a friend of mine was reading it . I simple could not get past the first 50 pages . In fact , I wanted to abandon it by page 10 , but I pressed on because I felt that I was at fault . Such a famous writer simply could not be the one to blame . At any rate , I finally gave up . Part of the reason was the dragging on of the description of a blas family life . However , I found the bad writing disturbing . In my view the English was pedestrian . I am fully aware that I maybe the quirky one in this case , but that is how I feel .
5 #### This is one of my favorites by this author . It 's not a long read , but it has you emerged from start to finish . He uses techno - jargon in a way that is instantly believable and understandable to the average layman , or at least enough to accept what it means to the story .
4 #### Occasionally a bit slow due to technical - speak , but engaging and creepy .
3 #### Good book . Very technical . Not an easy read . Need to pay close attention when reading . But this is the way Crichton wrote most of his books .
5 #### Love this book . Great food for thought . Great plot . Great character development . Very BELIEVEABLE . Next phase in technology . A little too scary too thing of what 's next in new technologies . This book keeps you gripping your seat timbre end with its twists and turns .
5 #### Another thriller from Crichton who seems to be on the forefront of futuristic technology that is really happening in the labs and being tested in the field . Very scary stuff which keeps you glued to each page . Love his work .
5 #### " Prey " is one of those books that can give one the creeps . Crighton at his best .
5 #### I m 11 and I thought that this book was probably the greatest book I ve ever read it was amazing to be honest michael crichton is awesome . My favorite author definitely
5 #### This is an amazing read ! Loved the science and technology throughout . Very interesting and even believable . I definitely recommend this book !
5 #### Arrived as expected and excellent shape . Have n't started reading yet but look forward to it .
5 #### Was n't sure I would like this book . It it drew me right in . Remember Orwell 's 1984 , Big Brother Is Watching ? And we all know how easily people can watch us today . Our technology is exploding exponentially in computers , programming , virtual reality , the bio technical sciences with transplants , artificial limbs , etc . This could happen . A good read .
5 #### Keeps you up all night till you finish this one . I have read several by this author and he always keeps you guessing , and he keeps the pace moving very quickly . He is certainly never boring .
5 #### Crichton never fails to take me on a fabulous ride . As always , science turns life into chaos when you are reading a Crichton novel .
5 #### This book delivered . The author has a way of making you understand the technical side of science otherwise I could n't have been able to read this book . With that said the storyline was fantastic and well written . I gave this book the rating I did because it was hard to put down and I finished it in 2 days .
5 #### This book is what showed me the great imagination of Crichton . It is suspenseful and kept me on the edge of my seat while reading . If you came looking for spoilers . Shame on you . Read the book .
4 #### I 'm always impressed with how Crichton was both an excellent teacher and storyteller . This was a very good book . I highly recommend it .
4 #### The premise upon which this story is based is horrific . The story moves quickly to an uncertain ending , leaving a good opportunity for additional tales .
3 #### A typical science fiction thriller that is somewhat predictable . When the villain is nanotechnology , you really miss the raptors ! However , Michael Crichton 's descriptive writing makes this book an easy read and encourages a good imagery of the story .
4 #### The pleasing thing about this book is , the quick solution that the main character found for each problem . Literally thinking on the feet ! Overall a good read !
5 #### I 'm never disappointed with Michael Crichton 's writing . Well thought out conditions which will result in a disaster . The pace moves quickly then picks up moving to consequences that you did n't project . Excellent !
5 #### I was actually late for a meeting because I could not put this book down . I listened to it in one setting . There were just too many possible endings . Chriton 's bedt book yet .
5 #### Crichton has done it again . Prey was intelligently written ; full of science that was easy to understand even for those not knowledgeable in the area . Just like Jurassic Park , or maybe even more so , this book was a page turner for me and I found myself staying up late to read more and find out what happened . The concept of this book is chilling . Nanoparticles and biological warefare are a scary thought . Way scarier than dinosaurs ! Prey had it all : science , likable characters , action , villains , real life problems , adversity , heroism , and intelligence . Some of the characters where frustrating at times , but I think that was Crichton 's intention . It was a good read !
5 #### Thrilling from start to finish , just as you 'd come to expect from Crichton . Brilliant but with explanations that are laid out in common language without making you feel like you 're being talked to down to .
4 #### Always a good storyline plausible plot and topical in this day of artificial intelligence will be dreaming of prey tonight
5 #### Absolutely loved the book . Writing at its best , what an imagination . This book kept me interested from beginning to end . Leonardus G. Rougoor , author of " Waiting in the Shadows "
5 #### I LOVED this audiobook ! Michael Crighton is clearly a talented writer . This story had me on the edge of my seat !
4 #### Like other Crichton novels , I flew through this adventure while contemplating advances in technology . The next time I see a gnat , I 'm going to remember this book . :)
3 #### It 's a well written book as are all of his . Some of the scientific jargon was a little confusing to people in my book club . It did lead to a great discussion about how far in the future could this be taking place . I believe it 's already here . I was disappointed in the ending . Thought it a bit abrupt .
2 #### This book spends so much time on technical stuff that it makes it boring ! Way to long with way to little story line . Gets better in the last 1/4 of the book but its really hard to get through the first half .
5 #### An interesting book involving the development of technology , the people who develop it , and the ways in which it can go horribly wrong .
5 #### This one was a real page - turner . I could n't put it down . Lots of suspense , intrigue , and action . I think I read it in one day .
3 #### I read Micro and really enjoyed it . You can tell the author was trying to recapture that same success . It just did n't work . Characters were working dad in a bind after being laid off . Wife distant , which means she must be doing something wrong . Whiny kids that say the same four lines at least 27 times in the book . Seriously , the kid says , " That 's not fair " at least 40 times . Other characters die and you could really care less . All that being said I still wanted to read it and find out what happened .
5 #### What an amazing book this is . Must read for anyone working in software or learning about AI . This book made me buy a book on artificail intelligence and start learning the conecepts . Crichton has proved once more that he is unbeatable .
4 #### A very enjoyable story , a little slow in places but the author will catch you off guard as the story progresses .
3 #### The beginning of this book started off as a page turner but by mid book there were a few boring spots . It would make a decent movie . It definitely would be a better visual ( yet scary ) story then the written pages of a book .
5 #### Suspense and lots of drama I loved it could not put it down great read a must for nights when not able to sleep .
4 #### I enjoyed very much Michael Chrichtons Prey . While the dangers of nanotechnology are plausible at least in general ( one may quibble with some specifics in the book ) , the part that resonated most with me was the characterization of the protagonist and his wife . As it often happens to couples where both spouses have demanding careers , they have drifted apart . The husband , Jack Forman , a software engineer finds himself temporarily unemployed and taking care of the children . What starts out as a banal domestic setting takes a dark turn when he starts suspecting his wife of hiding things from him . Initially he suspects infidelity , but the truth is an even greater danger . The book is written in the first person , which helps ( at least the male ) readers identify with the protagonist and his thoughts , emotions , and concerns . The drama may be a bit formulaic with the hubris of the protagonists wife leading to her downfall , but I nevertheless enjoyed the book very much . Once the pace picks up the book becomes a classic thriller , and I liked that part too , but what I most liked was Jack Forman 's attempts to grapple with the changes in his spouse and make sense of the situation .
1 #### Regarding the story itself , I literally could not put it down . The concept is frightening and I hope nothing like it ever becomes reality . The extensive research revealed by the bibliography at the end makes it a terrible possibility ! However , there was absolutely no reason to have such excessive use of vulgarity . To use the " F " word throughout , perhaps to capture a select audience is unacceptable . Because of this , I will never read anything written by Michael Crichton again !
3 #### This was not one of Michael Crichton 's best efforts . It was interesting but was just a little too far fetched .
4 #### Good combination of science and horror . I think the writing is good and keeps you on the edge of your seat . Sometimes there 's a ramble for a sentence too long on science but still very engaging and thoughtful .
5 #### Michael Crichton always has a good story involving science . This was another fast moving story .
5 #### Great book , really makes you think , Amazon had the best price and great service .
3 #### Not up to the Michael Crichton of Andromeda Strain days . This is a O.K. story but a bit of a grind in spots . To me , the ending seemed like the author was just trying to find a way to quit writing the story . It is a worthwhile read . Just do n't expect too much out of it .
5 #### I read it and it was one of the best things I 've read so far this year . Then I read some of the reviews . I suppose Crichton did get very , very technical in this book , but that was my favorite thing about it . The exact type of science he was discussing is one of my favorite types of science .
2 #### book just went on and on- premise is interesting but it felt like the same plot point happening over and over . had to read for a class but ended up skimming through last 100 pages-- which i rarely do
5 #### I really enjoyed this book . The main characters were really good , the secondary ones not so much which made their deaths on the book not so meaningful . The science and technology aspect of the book wer .awesome though !
5 #### Michael Crichton is very good at combining fiction with real - life science . This book is no exception . Nanotech is a relative new science in which giant strides have been made during the past couple of decades . It is obvious this book was written as a warning in regards to not taking proper precautions when advancing this field of science . It would make an interesting movie .
5 #### People should read Michael Crichton 's books , they are fiction but they have truth in them too .
3 #### Not my favorite Cricton . Still finished but not his best .
5 #### Friends : I looked up the programming languages that control the swarms of nano robots that are mentioned in this book and these languages do exist and we can use them on our projects . We live on a 1640 acre Ranch in the remote Sangre de Cristo mountain range of Colorado . Swarms of nano robots could be used to control noxious weeds in our pastures as long as they do n't choose humans as their Prey . Google my name to Learn more ..... Arthur von Boennighausen
4 #### This book was not the typical type of story I normally read but I found myself not able to put the book down . I had to know what would happen next .
3 #### I doubt that Michel Crechton wrote this book . It is not of his quality .
5 #### Read this book and then look up what NASA is doing with tiny satellites --- really thought provoking . I read this and enjoyed it but thought it very improbable until I found we are doing a similar technology with small " cube " satellites that communicate with each other to convey more information . These are not as sophisticated as the scenario in the book but a first step ? ? ?
5 #### Once again Michael bats it out of the park ! This was a great ride and scary because this could actually happen !
5 #### An excellent suspenseful tale from start to finish . You wo n't want to stop reading .
4 #### Once I got into the idea I had a hard time putting the book down . On to the next story .
5 #### This is a fast paced story--- scary to think that mankind uses technology and changes nature more and more without really knowing the consequences , and a story like this could be a possibility .
4 #### Really suspenseful with the steady character formation and build to the action that he does so well , I could n't stop reading even thou8gh I was petrified !
5 #### I had this for a while and did n't really want to read it , I decided . Then I found it on audio cassette and played one side . I kept going until 3/4 of the story and a cassette kept tangling . I dug out the book and finished it- I had to know what happened . This is a really good Sci . Fi about scientists who develop nano - particles and in the process of trying to sell them to the military it turns out they do n't perform as needed . So , they try to fix them and the result is a cooperating , evolving group of particles that learn to feed on living things and invade humans . They feed on them and mimic them and become very intelligent . The person responsible is a woman whose husband is hired once it 's been learned that these swarms are out of control . The problem is , no one realizes how out of control .
5 #### Crichton always tells a good story . One can get bogged down in the technical background but if you 're familiar with thinking about nanobots , AI and corporate greed then you 'll feel right at home . Interesting with relevance to our near future and as always with the good always comes the bad .
5 #### I started this book at 1:19P.M. on Tuesday September 8th , and I finished around 2 P.M. Wednesday , September 9th . It is that good !
1 #### I felt I was trudging through mud way before I got near the end . The whole book seemed to drag , but I hung in there because i 've always liked Crichton 's books in the past . Maybe the science and technology was just too unbelievable and seemingly illogical for my brain , but I 'm sorry to say I found reading this book to be boring and tedious . The ending did n't make up for the slow pace throughout .
3 #### I really enjoyed the start of the story and think the topic of the book is incredibly important . However , the last quarter of the book is a real let - down as Crichton went way overboard in the possibilities he envisioned and what could have been an immensely important novel comes crashing down in never - never land .
5 #### Great story and worth the read . Makes you stop and think about what scientist might be working on in secret labs .
5 #### Gripping tale of adventure and suspense , a page turner . My husband saw only the top of my head for hours with an occasional Mmmm as response to his comments as I could not put it down . For those who love good writing- Enjoy .
5 #### Again , this author gives you a great mystery ! The characters are great . The storyline holds your attention and again , you have a problem putting the book down ! Loved it
3 #### It had good moments but wanted it to end already .
4 #### The story was great and the writer kept it moving very well . I just was not that interested in the science behind the story so those sections were a bit boring to me which is why 4 instead of 5 stars .
4 #### TThis was written over ten years ago but it has the feel of today . A computer programmer is out of work and keeping house while his wife , an up and coming computer specialist , works . When she starts behaving strangely , he suspects she 's having an affair . Worse , he fears she 's beginning to document things he says and does in preparation for an ' alienation of affection ' suit that will take his children away from him during a divorce . Then he 's offered a contract job for the company she works for . It seems her company bought his program from the company that fired him . They are experiencing problems with it and want him to fix it . He 's afraid he 'll be the fall guy -- again -- if the kinks ca n't be worked out and is hesitant . Then his wife has an accident and things go screwy . It seems the only way he can find out what 's going on is to take the contract work . From then on , it 's a nail biter . I 'm not a scientific person , so I do n't know about the IT part of this . But it kept me hooked till the last page . Good read !
4 #### Not one of his best , but , still pretty good . I would have saved the wife as an ending . Worth $ .99 though .
5 #### A typical Crichton novel , which is to say that this book is a very satisfying work of literature .
3 #### Lots of tech talk ... not enough personal interaction . The entire book was dedicated to solving one problem without enough character development . How did the male lead go from wimpy Mr Mom to bad ass swarm killer ? An ok read but was n't all that scary
4 #### For those of us who like something different and imaginative to read , Crichton always seems to fill the bill . This book was no exception . It gets into some techno / scientific subject matter here and there , but not to the point where I felt like skipping pages , and I think it was necessary for the story - so we could have just a little understanding of how the premise of the story might be possible . It left me wishing for more from Michael Crichton .
5 #### I 've read four of Crichton 's books so far - Micro , Congo , Jurassic Park , and Prey . Prey is easily the best of those . The central character is instantly relatable , and extremely likable . The backstory is well set , and the story flows beautifully . And when you finally get to the swarm , the book gets insanely good . In fact , it 's the only of his books that does n't feel like there are any extraneous events ; everything is necessary . The plot only ever picks up speed until it 's riveting finale , and the research by Crichton is so good I 'm afraid it could be accomplished in real life by some rogue company ! If you have n't , read this NOW .
4 #### Captivating . Will hold your interest all the way to the end ! A very good summer read that is fast moving .
5 #### Is there anything written by Crichton that is not excellent ? This is a fabulous story with deep characters easy to relate too . Always some aspect of knowledge base I 'm not familiar with which I think is what makes his novels so appealing . Well worth your time .
3 #### FRIGHTENING POSSIBILITIES OF THE MERGER OF NANO - SCIENCE AND HUMAN NATURE .
5 #### Crichton knows how to keep the story going and me on the edge of my seat and unwilling to put the book down . Interesting characters and a really strange premise for the story . Very entertaining .
4 #### I canteen to get enough of his writing . Every time I start a new book I wonder i I am smart enough to follow along . He makes you think and question things you THOUGHT you knew . This book was exciting and gripping .
4 #### The first part about the marital difficulties was a little too long . The action part was very good and kept me reading to find out what was happening . The May crises overcome really kept leading me on . Congratulations Michael !
3 #### Fast pace and a quick read , but , somewhat derivative . Greg Bear was here in 1985 's Blood Music . Some scenes echo Frank Herbert 's 1973 Hellstrom 's Hive . I 'm still glad I read it .
3 #### I skipped over the technical stuff , so I do n't know if it was accurate or not . The story would have been good without it .
5 #### Like all of his writings very hard to put down . Very good plot development .
4 #### Interesting , thought - provoking and scary . This is along the lines of Heinlein .... predicting events that can actually ( and may ) happen . Brrrrr .
5 #### I loved the book and gave it 5 stars because it was great . I loved it . It was intelligent and made me think . There were some real heart pounding sections .
4 #### Enjoyed it although I did n't understand much of the scientific stuff .
5 #### I am down to the last 20 or 30 pages and I ca n't wait to see how this ends . Very interesting book . I love the whole concept of the plot . Highly recommend it . A great read .
1 #### author is too caught up in letting us know he knows somethng about science ; he goes on and on ; time spent reading Prey was wasted ; first and last Crichton novel I will read .
2 #### Have read other Crighton books and enjoyed them , but now In my 80 's , this was way to advanced for someone that grew up when electronics were hard wired . Truly appreciate the many conveniences that I now use , although would be hard pressed to explain how they work . If the ending is what happens , maybe we are going to far .
5 #### Michael Chrichton has a way of keeping me on the edge of my seat , and even though this particular book was written some time ago , it stands the test of time in the scientific world , if not in the rapid development of technology . In fact , only days after reading this , I ran across articles on nanotechnology . Crichton also challenges me in all of his novels ( sad he is gone ) because I often end up looking up the concepts he presents , in this case , the whole concept of swarm behavior . Terrifying at times ... and you ca n't help but wonder if some scientist is making the same kind of mistake today .
4 #### I really enjoyed the way the book kept me I interested . Michael Crichton is a good writer . Anyone can tell he puts a lot of work in the accuracy in detail
4 #### I bit hard to believe , but as long as you remember that it is fiction , it is a good story .
5 #### Michael Crichton satisfies again with another ' feasible ' thriller . Once again the question is posited - " instead of , " Can we ? " we should be asking ourselves , " Should we ? " "
5 #### Hollywood should be writing the screenplay now . I read this book more than 10 years ago to be correct I listened to it on CD . It kept me in my vehicle and on the edge of my seat for days . Tense and suspenseful this is one of Crichton 's best ever . I read to leave this reality for a while to be scared , thrilled or terrified by the story . It worked ; it still works .
5 #### Wonderful read . Skirted reality just enough that you could say " Well , maybe that could happen "
4 #### Interesting premise . Extremely well told . Took some time to understand what was going on but then the story took off . Very enjoyable .
1 #### I rarely abandon a book without finishing it . I made an exception in this case . The gratuitous profanity made it easy for me to quit reading within the first few pages .
3 #### Crichton has written several great books . This is not one of them . The characters are just not compelling enough to carry the story though .
5 #### If you like science fiction you will like this book . The premise is believable and may some day come to pass . I liked the characters and the story line .
5 #### This is the kind of sci - fi I love . Lots of science and enough fiction to create a really intense story .
3 #### The book was interesting and suspenseful except far too technical for me . I 'm sure someone that understands computer programming etc . Would find it fascinating .
2 #### I found it to be too technical . I guess some people like that but I skipped a lot of pages because of the technical speak . the story line was good which is what drew me to the book but it was too long winded in many places .
5 #### Crichton at his best fast moving Suspenseful full of technological science most of us unaware of Recommended for fast read
3 #### The book had a great story line with lots of mystery and technical jargon . If it had n't been for the vulgar language , I would have given it five stars . A good writer does n't have to use the F word so much as was in this book to have a great story .
4 #### If a person is not familiar with the science behind the plot of this book , it may make the story difficult to follow . If a reader does have a background in science , however , the plot brings to mind many questions regarding the likelihood of what the book suggests is possible .
4 #### I always enjoy Crichton books . He 's a great writer . The first person aspect of this book made it particularly engaging . Unlike some of his other books , I struggled with the building of the nanobots . The science behind this was just a little too stretched for me to buy into the story .
5 #### As I expected this novel was fantastic . Also as expected from this author it is a warning . A warning of what could happen if this technology is not carefully monitored by a committee with no financial or academic interest in the outcome . Nanotechnology can bring many benefits both in medicine and invention , but it has a dark side . Michael Crichton has given us a fictional example of one way unmonitored research could result in horrors that would wreak devastation upon humanity . If you like speculative fiction that it based upon scientific possibilities , you will love this book .
2 #### too much technical terms for a reader with only a high school education .
3 #### not up to Chrichton standards . Too lengthy , boring , scanned the last half , did read the last chapter , but no surprises . ,
1 #### How disappointing , the book has a premise with so much potential . It starts out very interesting and engaging , but falls off a believability cliff on Day 6 . Without any spoilers , the events that transpire between the evening of Day 5 and morning of Day 6 are simply ridiculous . I stopped reading it was so bad .
4 #### A very fast - paced and engaging thriller . Crichton combines the science of nanotechnology , our latest understanding of biological adaptation / evolution , and a liberal dose of observed behavioral patterns in both predators and hive animals . What comes out is a man vs. nature adventure story that entertains but also makes you think . There is some retread of the same ideas that were explored in Jurassic Park . Once again , man uses his limited knowledge of science to create a life form he does not understand and can not control . Once again , evolution moves faster than we can keep up . As usual , Crichton focuses on action and science , not characterization . Still , this is probably his best novel since Rising Sun .
4 #### Typical Chrichton - and that 's not a bad thing - with interesting insights into technology and medical science .
5 #### This is Michael Crichton ! Fast paced , intense , and makes you think !
3 #### Could this really happen ? Well reading this book we think why not . Sometimes a little too much nonunderstandable explanations and that 's why i only put 3 stars instead of 4 . But it reads quickly and is a good distracting read .
3 #### The plot was good ; characters well developed . My problem with this book was that it was far too technical . I really did n't want to know THAT much about nanotechnology . I ended up skipping a lot of the technical stuff . If you 're into science , you would probably like this book
4 #### A well written techno thriller that kept me glued to my Kindle . But in some areas , a bit too much technology detail that strayed me from the plot . Time to buy some magnets for my home ?
3 #### The plot was interesting , but too much information for me . I 'm more of a murder and intrigue kind of guy . I recommend this book for science fiction fans .
5 #### Engaging book ; one of Crichton 's best so far . I liked how the story evolved and how he tied together loose ends after the climax . It made sense ( as much as a science fiction thriller can ! ) . Good read .
4 #### I thoroughly enjoyed this book . Michael Crichton is an excellent writer in long standing . This book was quite interesting to me because I was in IT and a biology major . There were times he delved too much into the scientific aspect of the story but over all the plot was interesting and moved quickly .
5 #### All of Michael Crichton 's books are fantastic . I always learn so much about a particular subject and his ability to explain complex subjects to the layperson is amazing . I always understand extremely complicated molecular science when he breaks it down . Always a treat to read Crichton .
4 #### Kept me on the edge of my seat till the end .
4 #### Love the premise of the book and it 's definitely a page turner . I especially appreciate the first person narrative where sometimes we as the reader are ahead of the protag ; others times we 're not . It 's fun . The science and technology behind is it exciting ! I would update the techno gadgets to reflect the current age ( i.e. , flip phone , etc . ) . The only lacking piece was that many times the antagonist could VERY EASILY regroup as a worthy , unstoppable opponent but does n't for convenience ' sake . I wo n't spoil here ... but you 'll catch what I mean when you read it . Still , a great read while basking in my lounge chair in Cancun , so no complaints .
5 #### Spine tingling . Could n't put it down . It made me late for work . I would highly recommend reading this book .
4 #### This is a well written , fast paced story of technology gone in an unexpected direction . I did n't enjoy very as much as other stories by this author . No real happy ending here and knowing that Mr. Crichton does his homework makes me a bit leary as how easy it is to take an idea and have it misused .
5 #### Pure science and science fiction are an unbeatable combination Recommended to anybody interested in biology and science and the future .
3 #### Interesting story line , but writing is not that great . Not much character development
5 #### I was looking for a casual read to pass a little time , boy , did I make a mistake . I got so hooked on this story about a technology with which I 'd only briefly had an encounter , that I could n't stop reading . The worse thing for me about this book is that it 's finished !
4 #### It was a bit technical for my brain , but I enjoyed it all the same .
5 #### An unsettling and mesmerizing tale . It seems all too real and actually possible in the 21st century . Rather scary to consider . May cost you some sleep but we 'll . Worth it .
4 #### Good storyline . A little heavy on the technical but it does contribute to the story . Fast exciting read .
4 #### Very exciting and imaginative book . Crichton does it again . A good read .
4 #### Good , fast - paced read . Like most of Dr. Crichton 's writing very enjoyable and logical .
5 #### Wow .. kept me on the edge of my seat . Could n't put it down ! Highly recommended . Do n't pass this one up .
2 #### I was disappointed in how the story evolved . It was a fun read with the parts about the family but it spent too much time with technical details that could have been essential to the plot if , if , we cared for this type of information . I thought I was interested until it just dragged on , then I lost interest as the climax was so short
3 #### It was a way to pass the time while the kids were playing . Not earth shattering , soul searching material but entertaining enough .
5 #### I really enjoyed this book ! Could n't put it down , spent several late nights reading it . Makes you wonder about nanotechnology that may go too far .
4 #### Crichton was a great storyteller and this one is no different ... and you might learn something about biotechnology if you are n't careful ! :)
5 #### Wanted to read every chance I got . Good to the very end and I was not able to guess it either . Probably will read more of his books in the near future .
4 #### If you enjoy doomsday science and implausible heroes you will enjoy this read . If you fear a swarm of killer bees you may squirm a " little " , but you will keep reading .
3 #### I have enjoyed some of the other works by Michael Crichton , however I thought Prey seemed to get bogged down for about the first third of the book with Jack Forman dealing with being out of work and dealing with his children 's problems . The story then started to get exciting , however there were many interludes while the author , through Jack Forman , had to go through many technical explainations .
4 #### I did enjoy this book a lot . I could have personally done without all the profanity which came from one character mostly but overall I was able to ignore that and enjoy the book . Was a little disappointed with how fast it ended but I am glad I read it . Very fast page turner for sure .
4 #### Definitely an " edge of the seat " story until about half way through . Once I had an understanding of what was going on , the story was still very good but I was n't holding my breath .
5 #### Excellent story that was believable and very well written . I enjoyed the factual interludes used to keep the reader up to speed on the technology .
1 #### This book is very hard to put down once you start reading it . It is very well written and easy to understand and very very exciting .
4 #### It was fast - reading . I 've read many Michael Chrichton books . This is a good read , but not one of his best .
5 #### I was pulled into the story and found this novel difficult to put down . Fast paced and new territory as far as I was concerned Could something like this story happen ? . Wow ! What a concept . . An all around gret read .
5 #### Did n't take long for this book to become a real pageturner . The technology , whether real or just possible , is really scary . Crichton did again what he does so well !
3 #### 3.5 stars . The plot was intriguing and kept me reading ( Crichton is obviously a great writer ) , but I wish there had n't been so much language ( much use of the f word and several others ) . If you do n't mind that , then it 's worth a read . I was happy to see there was plenty of suspense without a lot of gore , and no sexual scenes . This guy is at the top of his game for a reason !
4 #### This is a good book for anyone with imagination and questions as to the possibility of modern and future technology . Could our never ending appetite for new ideas and research actually be a cause for concern for the future ?
4 #### This book was great in a scary way . It was easy for me to follow even though I have limited computer skills . Could n't put it down .
3 #### Interesting reading . A little too detailed for my taste .
5 #### I was intrigued and shocked to read that something like that could happen or already has happened . Really had me thinking about the future .
3 #### Creighton is interesting as usual but as usual pays homage to the gods of science .
2 #### Not even the science used to prop up the story can overcome the basic farfetched premise . Jurassic Park it ai n't .
4 #### I love Michael Crichton 's style . He has an imagination unlike anyone else plus anyone familiar with computers will be able to relate to most of the plot . This story grabs your attention and will not let you go from start to finish .
5 #### This is such a great read . If you like suspense , mysteries , and truly thought provoking ideas ..... you are going to live this book . I could not putt the book down ! Michael Crichton does such a novel subject of nano tech and weaves a story that will have you on the edge of your seat . I do n't want to reveal or spoil details from the book because I 'd rob you of the pleasure of finding out the plot and twists that Michael Crichton has in store for you . I will say that I was scared at times when reading the book because science is a field that is still so vast and this whole nano tech really is really just mind blowing . The characters are well defined . I hated a couple of them but that just goes to show that Michael Crichton did a great job in his character details and truly did his job as a story teller . Buy the book ! ! You wo n't regret it ! ! !
5 #### I could not read this fast enough ! I really hope this turns into a movie ! A real page turner ! It captured my attention from the first page ! Two thumbs up !
5 #### It starts out at a normal pace and then keeps escalating til your on a freight train that feels out of control . It was no less than you would expect from a gifted author , but it will leave you hoping that it wo n't happen in real life , although it 's absolutely possible .
5 #### Sounds improbable does n't it ? Kinda recalls cloning to mind . Chrichton 's usual wonderful story style keeps the reader riveted ! Causes one to ponder . . . .
3 #### A little too much tech talk for me . Just too much . Expected ending . Not up to par for Crichton .
5 #### I read this book in a day , what a page - turner ! ! Well - formed , distinct characters , storytelling at its best . I am a Crichton fan now . Highly recommended .
5 #### A riveting story . could n't put it down . Almost really believable , it was really developed in a masterful way . Makes you think .
5 #### I do n't generally like sci - fi novels , but this story got me hooked from the get - go . How did you even think up a picture taking , shape shifting herd of nano - bots ? You are a genius , Michael Crichton . This book is well worth your time .
4 #### It was a bit to technical for the average reader . Story was good though . Very interesting subject matter . Like his book s.
5 #### Very believable and realistic science fiction that is probably already here . Science is progressing so rapidly that we could destroy ourselves in our quest for profit at the expense of a liveable planet .
5 #### Gripping novel all the way through . This is up to Michael 's best ( and that 's great ) . This is the only book I have read in many years that caused a shudder up my spine when I finished it . ( I 'm 71 , and have read many of the great ones )
4 #### A disturbing theory of nano technology . A fastening if scary idea of things to come using a new science . A fun read !
5 #### I have n't read a Michael Crichton novel in a while so I had forgotten what a good storyteller he is ! Anyone who enjoys learning some interesting technology facts woven into a suspenseful action novel will enjoy this . It 's an easy read even with all the scientific byline .
4 #### This book will send you running for the Deet . Actually , Deet wo n't work . It would be better to try to stop the development of self - learning machines , particularly nano - machines , from getting out of hand .
3 #### Interesting story plot , but lots of profanity . Written in the first person . Long lectures about evolution throughout .
4 #### Just about everything that I would say about this book on CD has been said in other reviews , and I refuse to say anything to spoil the story . When there are new stories in the news weekly about something new that was discovered after we thought we had " heard just about everything " and then this kind of story comes along , you tend to want to see what the hype is . I found this book to have a big intrigue , but yet , questions that I would have liked answered . I just thought that for me , anyway , this was a bit too far - fetched and that anyone who was in these threatening situations would seek out others who they KNEW were not going to turn on them , and ask for help . I know the story is far more complicated than this , but I just did n't believe in these scenarios be realistic enough to make this book be one of my favorites . Just my opinion and that of my husband as well . Have enjoyed many other Michael Crichton novels , but not as much with this one . Too many questions that we would have like answered .
5 #### You ca n't leave the book is in just one word intoxicating , you will be hooked from the beginning to the end .
5 #### Interesting blend of possible science and non - science . Moves fast and reads easily .
4 #### This was hard to put down . Kept my interest up all the way . I have a real dislike for flying insects so i was concerned about my sleeping .
5 #### Great book , could hardly put it down after beginning . Highly recommend this . The only other book I 've read by Michael Crichton is Congo , but I will read others .
3 #### This book has an abrupt shift in style midway through , and readers seem to favor one or the other forms of the book . The first part of the book is a suspenseful mystery , where out - of - work tech expert Jack , minding house and kids , while his V.P. wife is bringing home bacon , is becoming suspicious about said wife 's activity , perhaps suspecting her of an affair . Hence the mystery / suspense . The second part of the book is an action adventure Jurassic Park romp with nanotechnology . Technology has once again escaped human control , and going after its creators . I confess , I like the first part better , and found that part of the book hard to put down . When it got to the technology awry part , I felt like I had read that story before , and skimmed it a little . Not that it was n't entertaining , it just was too similar in theme to Jurassic Park . I took a second star off for the ending . There was a certain lack of believability and huge discrepancies in the abilities of the nanos . Also some plot holes that I do n't think needed nanotechnology to get through . That being said , if you do n't over think this , it 's a good rollicking comic book of a novel , and great to pass an icy shut - in sort of afternoon .
5 #### As usual , Crichton has produced a masterpiece . His stories are wonderful as movies , but as they are written they are works of art for your imagination . He has never let me down , and I highly recommend this one to anyone looking for an easy yet intelligent and fascinating read ... no mental koolaid here folks , just pure entertainment . If you have n't read his other books , but have seen the movies , do yourself a huge favor and read tham .
5 #### This book is another Michael Crichton masterpiece . I was somewhat skeptic in the beginning because it 's the first book of his that I 've read that is written in the first - person , and it takes some time to get to the " techno thriller"-centric storyline , but it is definitely a nail biter that will hold you captive until the very last page , and had already become one of my favorite books that I 've read several times . It 's also a book that gets better each time you read it .
3 #### Nanotechnology is the new kind of " scary monster " in this rendition . It is written on a smaller , more personal scale than Jurassic Park and also more technology oriented and technical . Not a bad read , but not a great one either .
4 #### As usual , Creighton takes us on a taut adventure , laced with science ( some of it believable)and the wholly enjoyable trip . Even if it is science leaves some questions in the reader 's mind , his characters are believable and nicely differentiated . It 's a good read .
5 #### This story was a much appreciated , and needed , departure for Crichton 's writing style . He did not load the narrative down with an over abundance of techno - babble . Rather he focused more on his characters and the complexity of their relationships . There was more than enough techy ornamentation to satisfy the sci - fi nerd in me , but the story was much more engaging . It was reminiscent of the Jurassic Park novels in that aspect . Admittedly , the basic plot line was very Jurassic Park ... new advanced technology goes haywire and gets terribly out of control . It had enough differences , however , to stand on its own . It was a very good read .
5 #### Good solid Crichton book , If you like his books you 'll like it .
4 #### From the start I could n't put this book down . It is a great read in typical Crichton style . Time for another .
4 #### In Michael Crichton 's thriller Prey , Jack Forman is an out of work software engineer whose wife works in the nanoscience and technology industry . Jack is beginning to worry about his wife who 's been acting strangely and whom he suspects is having an affair . As he tries to find out what she 's up to when she 's at work , he learns that she 's been working on a project to create nano particles that can work together to complete a task . It all begins to unravel when it becomes clear that the scientists have lost control of the nano particles which have begun to turn on them . Jack is recruited to try to capture the nano particles that have escaped and which are reproducing in the Nevada desert , but he has to go up against some of the scientists who do n't want to stop the nano particles . Prey is one of the earliest books in popular fiction to address the development of nanoscience engineering and technology . It 's a little bit on the alarmist side , but is nevertheless an engaging work of science fiction .
3 #### I have loved everything I 've read by Michael Crichton . Prey was well - written and unique , but the subject matter was n't exactly my taste or area of expertise . Still a good read !
5 #### It took a bit to get into it ... but then I did n't want to put it down
5 #### Fantastic plot . The growth of the main character while he uncovers the danger before him , like all Crichton books , you feel the hero 's torment . And Crichton as usual does a fantatsic job of explaining the science in an easy way that the reader feels he 's right there with the hero . Sub - plots and twists abound- loved the novel .
5 #### Everything he wrote was amazing and fanciful . Good read !
5 #### I love the concept Crichton revisits again and again in his novels , that mangoes not understand nature very well . His ease with the technical and psychological reasons for this concept always makes his novels a fast read and this one is no exception .
5 #### Great read . I must admit after years Stuck on James Patterson , Stephen King and Dean Koontz this is my first Crichton book . It was a difficult book to put down . There will be many Crichton books in the near future .
5 #### I 'm always amazed at how a good fiction writer can write a believable ( sometimes just barely ) , story to keep the reader enthralled right up to the end . I ca n't do it , but I sure admire a writer like Michael Chricton who can . This is a top notch story .
2 #### You can skip two thirds of this book and still know the ending . Just ok . State of fear a greater book by far
3 #### Interesting subject that kept me reading , but not my favorite Michael Chrichton .
5 #### Like everything the Crichton writes . This one is a little techie in the beginning but is an engaging and suspenseful tail that was hard to put down .
5 #### Lots of action and suspense . One of his better books . Good one to read if you like science type thrillers .
4 #### As with everything Chrichton writes , the story is heavy on science -- this time about nanoparticles . He makes the science plausible , but does n't overwhelm the reader with it . He deals with the humans who do the research , and the political , economic , and potential medical pandemic when the control test escapes the laboratory . Again , Chrichton includes children who are exposed to the danger , and the adults who protect them . An excellent read . His overuse of the " f " word is off - putting . I am sure molecular scientists know better words that that to express frustration and fear , but that seems to be the only one Chrichton knows .
4 #### Jack and Julia 's marriage appears to be falling apart . And , Julia seems to be having an affair . Jack , the unemployed , house husband must deal with sibling rivalry and a newborn while trying to find a job . Mr. Crichton draws you into the story as the action gets more intense and danger is everywhere . Lots of technical jargon , real and imaginary , but worth the effort to understand what is going on . A little predictable with what is happening to Julia , but still interesting . The conclusion is somewhat expected , but overall a good read . A solid 3.5
3 #### Crichton has a good premise and interesting characters . But his repeated long drawn out explanations of the physics of the ' prey ' particles really bog the story down .
5 #### Fast paced and thought provoking . One great read if you are a Michael Crichton fan . Takes you on a journey that may not be too far off in the future with the pace of this day and age . Got this at Amazon for my Kindle wonderful company and love my new paper white Kindle .
4 #### I quite enjoyed this storyline . It was a little frustrating at times which is what you want when you are reading . You want to feel invested in the story . Very good . Would be a good movie !
3 #### I thought that the book was very good . It definitely kept my interest . The way the swarms developed so quickly was unbelievable .
2 #### Michael Chrichton is an MD turned author with a message that can be found in all of his books .. "If we are not careful , our medical , & physical technologies will one day run over us , and kill us all .. This theme can be found to thread its way subtly thru all of his novels .. It is found here , but his effort is in my view mediocre .. It does n't compare with the awe , grandure , and shock of the same in Jurassic Park - truly a masterpiece .. ,To me , this was sort of a simple minded tale to take with you on an airplane trip , or cruise .. I guess I like to be reminded of my lowly status on the chain of animal ethics , with a little more believability in the pages . It is a quick and entertaining read , with a bit of horror tossed into the mix .. It amazes me however how well Chrichton , reminds us that we are slowly killing us all off , and will be blamed totally for our own mass extinction .. If you like the author however , the paperback is money well spent ...
5 #### This read was a book I could not put down . A very scary , frightening read . If this really could happen , what would we do , what could we do ? Read this , and pray that the PREY is n't real . Fantastic read . Michael Crichton has done it again .
4 #### The fact that the technology that is explained in the book is possible , gives a kick in the nerves and proves the point that how close humans can really get self destruction ...
4 #### It makes you wonder what the future holds in this area of science . Something that could easily get out of hand .... SCARY !
5 #### Fun read . If you have a chance to read any book by Crichton , though , I would say DO IT ! I have n't met one I did n't like ...
5 #### Needed the cassettes to replace one my player tore up from the library . This story is really COOL . Michael Crichton is an extraordinary writer of science fiction , heavy on the science . But do n't let that scare you from reading or listening to his novels .
2 #### The plot had me into it for a while . Mike does well in that area and then throws some good science in there and adds his own twist on top of that . I just did n't find that twist to be logical or believable enough to keep me into the story
4 #### maybe overly technical at times , but an enjoyable techno - thriller . a re - read for me . I will read it again on a couple of years .
5 #### I find this book most amazing , it really informs the reader about the advances in technology to the point that it is frightening .
3 #### This book is okay , but it is not what I would consider one of CR 's best . Did n't like the end .
5 #### Yet another masterpiece , dangerous - I virtually " swallowed " the book within 24 hours . Intelligent , new topic , reading the book is like watching one of the best thrillers on TV . Do n't miss this book
5 #### this is a great book it got me turned on to the author Michael Crichton who wrote the book Jurassic park and its sequel the list world
4 #### This is another of his novels that brings into focus little known things about little known things . It is a technology that continues to show more promise in so many fields . It has areas of effectiveness in the military .. medical .. protection fields . I know that there will be more uses discovered .
5 #### If you like to be scared silly , then this book is one of two that will accomplish that . The other is Micro .... another Crichton book . Your will love them .
5 #### I read all of Michael Crichton books , and this one is my all time favorite . Crichton was such an amazing story teller and all his book were great , but this time the characters seem to leap off the page and demand you to keep reading . Crichton 's ability to make us hate a character , and then immediately feel sorrow for them is what makes this one of his best books .
5 #### Although I did n't understand the science behind it , I have to say this was an excellent novel & quite frightening ! Who knows who 's experimenting with what out there ? Stuff like this could be happening in our world - scares the crap out of me . Do n't start unless you have the time to read it all ! Very fast paced from start to finish !
1 #### A swarm of human - created nanobots becomes self aware and is able coordinate and form more complex organisms and / or interface with already existing organisms ( such as humans ) . No one can deny that Crichton has a knack for engaging story telling but the premise is out to lunch here and it grew increasingly far fetched as it went on . Unfortunate because one of the things he is known for is believability . If you can suspend belief on this one you may enjoy it more than I.
4 #### Prey was another fantastic book by Michael Crichton ! When I started reading it I was n't sure what to expect and of course Crichton provides you with excellent background information on his subject . Once I got into it I could not put it down in wanting to find out what is going to happen next . The cool thing about Crichton 's books too is that they are educational too . All his concepts are based on actual technology that could and I believe will eventually exist .
5 #### I disagree with the naysayers . I think this was one of Crichton 's better efforts . It was certainly better than Next , a book I also recently read . One aspect that added power to the story is the fact that this nano - technology is actually advancing and may produce such nano machines within our lifetimes . It is genuinely scary to contemplate what could happen if these machines were to merge in some manner and begin sharing predatory information . This is not completely unrealistic in view of the fact that the military would without doubt take a hard look at nano machines as methods of undercover attack during time of war . All that would be required would be for some of these machines to go a bit haywire and begin attacking humans indiscriminately . Compared to Crichton 's Next , I thought this was more fearfully realistic . This is a keeper .
4 #### This book makes you think about technology , human nature and most importantly consequences of making rash decisions . Every person in corporate world should read this .
4 #### I 'm an avid fan of Crichton . After 8 of his books I 'm quite familiar with his formula ( a specially selected group of scientists exploit the exciting aspects of a new high technology before a disaster strikes i.e. Sphere , Jurassic Park , Timeline , etc . ) Yet , this novel is just as thought provoking , if not more so ! This is the first one I 've read that makes computer science / algorithms the main tech ( heck , there 's even a snippet of source code ) , although it is heavily mixed in with evolutionary biology , and the result is astonishing but believable because it is applicable for the layperson . We live in a world of artificial intelligence and algorithms - social media , stock market automated trading , etc . They are designed to learn . It 's not hard to imagine what craziness could happen to these systems if they behaved , well , exactly as designed ! This is not just a high concept , there is a lot of action - what a visually striking movie this would be ! I am stuck with an image of a [ SPOILER : billions of microscopic robots patterned to look like a human face flung to the far corners of a room , so that the room is textured with an animated human ] . Read it as action , academia gone awry , a cautionary tale of ethics or all three - the book will stick with you .
5 #### This is my all time favorite movie . I think I 've read it 5 times and will keep on reading it . Why has n't Steven Spielberg made a movie from this book . It will keep you reading ..... not wanting to put it down .... till the last page .
3 #### I never bought the nanoswarms as a realistic villain , and Crichton is a little too matter - of - fact about the life - altering outcome of the third act . A bit plodding and bogged down with the scientific mumbo jumbo , and not enough effort put into building out characters worth caring about . Not one of his best by a long shot .
4 #### This book was great . It 's definitely worth your money . Through the whole book , Crichton keeps you guessing , solving the mystery right along with the main character . Bravo !
4 #### I think the first - person narration really helps in this kind of thing , because its a technology - run - amok thriller , and clearly this is a technology Crichton had genuine worries about . And in my humble opinion , he was right to be worried . The developments in this novel are still quite a ways off , but having read it , you have to be worried about the long - term consequences when we finally do start monkeying around with things at the nano level . Also , there are parts of the book that stick with you , like the scene where we finally get to hear a few desperate words from oh , lets just say once of the principal characters whom we have n't REALLY heard from until that scene ( Sorry to be cryptic , just do n't wanna do spoilers ) . Its scary where its supposed to be scary , and Cichton never talks down to the reader , which I like . In fact I learned several interesting facts about predator - prey interaction , along with the nano stuff . Its not a perfect book , Crichtons always been more of a craftsman that an artist , but hey , that s more good enough for me .
5 #### One of my favorite Crichton books . The author 's knowledge of the subject matter is very impressive . This book will keep you on the edge of your seat . A real page turner !
3 #### Prey is a science fiction drama that answers the question " What would happen if a self - sufficient , violent AI went rouge ? " Crichton 's story answers while delivering a plot that keeps you busy in a bold , engaging style . I found it to be a fun read to finish in one or two sittings . In addition you can consider some of the cool implications of distributed computing and nanotechnology while you read . However if you 're looking for a story that challenges your observational skills or tests your philosophical inclinations , back off . This book is basically just action . The characters are simplistic and the only thing I was worried about was who would survive ( other than the narrator ) . On the other hand , not all novels are about in - depth characterization , so if you liked other Crichton or Clancy books , pick this up and prepare to enjoy . If you 're going on a long airline flight this is also a good choice . Have fun ! Cross - posted at Librarything and dragonldy.blogspot.com
5 #### Great science fiction . Could n't get enough of it . Creative story and interesting characters . Do n't want to ruin the story ... saying that it 's a science fiction is more than you need to know . Go for it .
5 #### After reading the intro , I did n't know what to expect and a bit worried I would n't like where it was going . But it pulls you in and keeps that interest until the last page . Enjoyable !
4 #### I read this book really fast because the thought of this not being curtailed freaked me out . They are using similar procedures now believe it or not . This is a great , fast , disturbing read .
4 #### Michael Crichton always had the uncanny ability to take a technology that seems on its face to be a remarkably amazing breakthrough and then turn it sinister . In his novel Prey , that technology is nanocomputers , and the results are quite terrifying . Crichton writes about the science and technology like an expert , and unfolds the novel with suspense , intrigue , and thrills like only a master storyteller can .
4 #### Another Scary story by the master of make believe , with just a shread of possibility . I liked the fast movement of the story and the way I pictured the layout in my mind . I could all but hear the sound of the swarms and the danger of the characters in the warehouse .
4 #### Michael Crichton does it again . I know , from writing [ ... ] , that it is one thing to understand a complex topic ... it is another to be able to explain it to those unfamiliar with it and do so while weaving a story from it . Bravo !
5 #### It has been a long time since I picked up a Michael Crichton book and this one is fantastic ! ! ! ! It kept me reading into the long hours each night . I recommend it to anyone ! ! Interesting concepts .... but you have to like science to like this book . Its very technical
4 #### What is so scary is that the story line is not all that far fetched . It takes you from everyday to creepy in the blink of an eye .
4 #### Crichton always entertains and Prey is no different . Never trust corporate lackeys to do a smart thing . Smart is often not thoughtful .
5 #### Great read ! ! Michael Crichton is among the list of my favorite authors , I have several of his books because he always has an excellent plot and story line .
1 #### I hate to speak ill of the deceased Michael Crichton , but this book was terrible . Dr. Crichton spends way too much time on the trials and tribulations of whiny househusband Jack Foreman . The middle of the book gets somewhat interesting if you can overlook the fact that a team of programmers suddenly become action heroes and kick ass and take names . Lead by the aforementioned Jack Foreman . I had finally made it to the last disk , and some of the ridiculous dialog made me finally just give up . I only regret there is no rating below one star .
5 #### Highly recommended and a very quick and interesting read . Typical Crichton thriller . Ca n't put it down . Definitely five stars . A good overview of emerging technologies .
4 #### This is not the most mentally stimulating read ever - I was not very attached to the characters and it did n't blow my mind . However , it is an excellent way to pass time on an airplane or the beach . I 'd much rather read this than watch tv . I did n't regret the purchase .
4 #### In the usual brilliant Crichton way , he demonstrates one very possible way for the human race to create it 's own extinction .
3 #### I read this novel because my son read it and like it . The plot is clever , and has some interesting science , but the writing style is labored and not very elegant
2 #### I love Michael Crichton books . I mean , who does n't right ? This book is not up to par at all compared to his other works . I felt like this book had an excellent premise and could have gone the distance . The beginning was very good and I thought it had promise . All of a sudden , when you get about half way through chapter two , you come to realize your error . This book is just cheesy . If I wanted to watch b flicks on the Syfy channel I would be doing that instead of reading a book . It is hard to believe this is out of the same mind that brought us such books as Jurassic Park and Congo . I might have to start reading the book previews before buying if this becomes a pattern . UGH .
5 #### Read it before when it first came out and was hard to get . Wanted my own copy and it still reads as good .
5 #### loved it . Could n't put it down . He ties the whole book together so thrilling and exciting . Look forward to his nect book .
4 #### Exciting and suspenseful . Too bad it turned into a horror flick with the grossness of the dead bodies . That part when the hero got his foot stuck in the chest of his teammate was especially hokey . The entire hive felt like it was out of a alien - like horror movie . I was kind of frustrated that it took them so long to figure out that the virus could defeat the e. coli assemblers . The plot dragged on and on as they tried to fight it with conventional weapons , blowing up things , etc . I had already figured out that Julia was colonized by the particles . I also do n't like the loose end about the cause of the accident . Perhaps the real Julia wanted out , but the particle man caused her to crash . A bit slow at the beginning , but picked up after the rabbit died .
5 #### PREY is a great book ~ action packed and my son loved reading it . It was a selected summer reading for his school . I stand corrected when I previously gave the book 1 star ~ the book itself is a 5 STAR BOOK . The 1 star rating which I still stand by is for Amazon ~ " The slight mark or stamp that may be present on the edges of a bargain book 's pages is an industry 's identification that it is an overstocked book and is not to be sold at the full price . Bargain books are not used , previously - read , defective , or inferior in any way . "~ quote from Amazon . I bought this book for my son & it had the mark on the edge which did n't bother me . HOWEVER , there was a credit card receipt from someone else 's purchase in it so it was NOT NEW & obviously PREVIOUSLY READ . Very disappointed .
2 #### I really like Michael Crichton , and have loved many of his books , especially Jurassic Park and Congo . This offering was not that good . I give it three stars because , like all his books , it is well written . He does n't do a very good job on the subject matter though , nanotechnology . I would have thought a writer of his caliber would have done more research on the subject before he committed himself to a novel , but obviously he did n't . If you want to read Crichton then read something else . You will come away from this book not really wanting to read any more of him , and that would be a shame .
4 #### I do n't see why there are so many bad reviews . This book is awesome and very action packed ! The reason I gave it four stars was , because it was kind of gross ( enough to be rated R ) and there was a lot of use of the F - word . Other than that , good book !
5 #### This is one of Crichton 's better books . First person narrator ( which is not my favorite ) , but superlative pacing , and definitely an example of one of those stories that you feel as though you HAVE to keep reading .
5 #### This is possibly the best novel he has written , I have read all Crichton 's books and this stands out as one of the best in terms of his blend of fact , fiction and cutting edge technology , hung on a frame of a genuinely good story . So sad this great man has passed away .
4 #### Enjoyable . The plot to begin with had captivated me , but let it be said that the plot was what kept this book afloat . I liked Jack as the main character , but many of the other characters were a little 2 dimensional . Besides Mae and Ricky , I felt no real compassion for the other characters . But the story about dangerous nano particles was interesting . Let it be said that this is no Andromeda Strain , Jurassic Park , or Timeline . It does captivate , but it is not his finest of works , but it is a lot better than most authors . Enjoy !
5 #### Imagine an enemy so small you ca n't see one of them but that has the ability to work together with other devices of its own kind as a team . The enemy then slowly evolves , increases intelligence , is able to replicate and improve on its original design . Over a period of time it improves itself so much that it is a threat to all life forms . Now imagine that you helped create it and you know it has escaped your laboratory and processing plant . Out of the imagination of one of the best Sci - Fi writers of our time , Michael Crichton , comes a story where mankind 's quest for knowledge and the use of nanotechnology to build nanorobots may spell the doom of all life . Michael includes genetic engineering and AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) to make a predator swarm of nanorobots that attack their creators and simply want to survive . This is a good book and I was highly interested in its thought provoking concepts of maybe we can move science too far before we are ready to control the results . Maybe we are no longer the top predator in the world and we are the prey ! I recommend this book .
5 #### This book , like all of Crichton 's great works , makes one question humanity 's future as science continues to make amazing , though sometimes scary , advancements . Will man make machines that are so smart that they will turn on us ? You may not enjoy it as much if you do n't have at least a passing interest in science and medicine , as some of the explanatory " scientific " passages are quite lengthy and detailed . But I found this to be another of Crichton 's very enjoyable , fast - paced thrillers !
1 #### So much exposition , so little patience . This book annoyed me . I borrowed this book from my brother , expecting another Jurassic Park . Instead , I got some sort of diary . It seems forced , and dry , I did n't like the book at all .
4 #### Very thrilling . The author does a great job of grabbing you from the start . Some of the science can stretch believability but it 's well worth it to give Crichton the benefit of the doubt and follow him on this journey .
5 #### Scary , but very lovable ebook ; proud to have it in my FIRES library .
3 #### CD / abridged / Science Fiction : This book takes place over the course of a few days . The what if scenario in this one is nano - particles gaining intelligence and trying to take over humanity . I felt the book was weak and had several shortcomings . After just finishing Timeline , which was engrossing , I say borrow it from a library . The narrator does a fine job , but the whole story was missing something .
5 #### Although I have seen many Michael Crichton movies and loved the series ER this is the first book of his I have read . There was LOTS of action . Lots of details . Some of the information was too detailed for me . Nevertheless , it was interesting . I could see this as a movie or made - for - TV movie . All in All it was OK .
4 #### I was n't sure what to expect when I grabbed a copy of Prey . But once I started I could hardly put it down . Crichton built suspense throughout the novel used things that were more obvious to the reader than the characters to help build that suspense . A well crafted voyage on what nanotechnology out of control could look like , and an ending that is very well played .
4 #### Give Michael Crichton his due . He was one of the sharpest observers of contemporary life , and he was fascinated by new techonology . He was often the first to write about cutting - edge subjects . And the first half of this novel is excellent in its portrayal of a man whose marriage is falling apart . His devotion to his children and his love for his wife / fear of losing her are poignantly depicted . The ending does get a little predictable , and he should have come back to that initial intimate portrayal of a family in trouble and woven it into the plot at the end , but Crichton was a unique story - teller , and I always find something to admire in his books .
5 #### Prey is my favorite Michael Crichton novel so far and I would be very happily surprised if any of the books by him that I have not yet read can top this one . It is firmly in the techno - thriller genre but has many elements of good old horror as well . The plot is very original and unpredictable and goes out with a surprising bang unlike most of his books in my opinion . I still think about the swirling clouds of nano particles acting like insects . Some of the scenes where they force themselves inside people are horrifying to me because I find insects terrifying . The book goes through several crazy changes that Crichton effortless guides through with his usual flawless explanations of the nearly possible . I loved the characters and the slow build up of strangeness in the beginning which rapidly speeds up into what feels like a non - stop climax in the plot . Even the ending satisfied me because it brings us full circle back to the brief and chilling introduction . Prey is excellent and I love every bit of it . It is the only Crichton novel I have read more than once and I enjoy and respect it more each time I do .
2 #### I feel as though I should start off by saying that I really like Michael Crichton . A few days ago , I borrowed this book up from a friend because I had a feeling power was going to go out ( thanks hurricane Irene ! ) and I needed a good read to keep myself entertained . I am so sorry that I chose this book . Part of what bothered me was the style of writing . It seemed as though a complete oaf was speaking ! Every sentence was : I did this . Then I said . I went . I know . I .. I .. I ! ! ! I WAS GOING CRAZY WITH THAT ! And of course there were paragraphs where I did n't understand half of the words because I am not knowledgeable in nano technology ... but those paragraphs I could handle . It was the dull sentences with lack of word choice that made me cringe . And just so everyone knows , I 'm love all types of novels . Some of my favorite have been light reads , so being deep is not a requirement . But writing in a captivating manner is . Aside from the style of writing , the story did n't really hold my attention . At times I was totally into what was happening , and then the topic would change and my attention would go with it . It was really unfortunate because I soooo wanted to like this book ! Overall- my suggestion is to spare yourselves and NOT get it .
2 #### Yes , I read this book , and while reading it , I had to look at the cover several times to make sure it was actually Michael Crichton who wrote it . Ok , his name 's on the cover and he is given credit for writing it . But I have to really wonder . I mean , this story was so bad and stupid , it was really way below his standards . While reading it I really kept saying to myself , " he must have bought this story from someone and put his name on it " or something to that effect . This story just came across as pure crap . Something I might expect from a 9th grader for a science fiction class . One of the things I usually like about Michael Crichton 's writing is the plausibility of what he talks about . Jurassic Park is a good example of this . Yeah , I know its a stretch that somewhere out there is a team of scientists looking to clone dinosaurs , but the science is there to do cloning . So that 's what makes it plausible to believe . But Prey was just stupid , corny garbage . Frankly , I"m surprised he was willing to put his own name on this . Do n't waste your time on this , its really bad writing and not a very interesting story .
4 #### I always feel smarter after reading Michael Crichton 's work . Maybe that 's more of a statement about me but I like to think it applies more to Crichton 's ability to deftly weave high tech science into a horror story . That 's what this book really is . It also plays well as a family drama for a large part of the book . The protagonist , Jack , at times seemed too flawless but overall he was likeable . I would recommend this book is you do n't have problems with techno - babble !
4 #### I love books that look at where technology could possibly take us ( If you have any good recommendations , send them to me ) . This was a great story and Michael 's research was impeccable . As an engineer with a keen interest in technology , I was impressed with how plausible the premise was . Of course , there were some stretches but still , everything mentioned seems realistic enough to make this tale thrilling but still , cautionary . Some reviewers have said that the ending seemed rushed . I agree . I think it was to balance out all the technical information needed in the beginning to lay the foundation . Still , I enjoyed it thoroughly . A good read .
3 #### Anther story about out of control technology . I read this book in just a couple days . A hard to put down book , but in the end I only gave it 3 stars . Like most of Crichton 's books I think it will make an alright movie ( I 'll watch it ) . I would put this book in my " fluff " category . It may not be " great " literature , but sometimes one needs a little fluff .
1 #### I 'm not an expert in nanotechnology , but obviously neither is the author . It 's fine to exaggerate the science in fiction , but Crichton introduces this as plausible in the real world . I do n't think so . His pseudoscientific explanations are BORING and slow down the pace of an already very slow moving story . The characters are unrealistic , bombastic and stupid simpletons . The plot line is a compilation of many finer works . The dialog is bad . This is just a real disappointment . Do not waste your time .
5 #### Admittedly , it has been a while since I have read this book ( about 4 years ) , but that just testifies that it left a lasting impression on me . For me , it was the science in the book that intrigued me . The detail Crichton goes through to explain how the nano particles work was absolutely fascinating ! I would not let the science aspect of this book deter any readers , though . It is a great action book that will keep you in suspense from start to finish .
4 #### This was my first Michael Crichton book , and I 'm about to buy another . It held my attention throughout ; in fact , I read the last two thirds of it in one sitting . I 'm only giving it four stars , though , because of one recurring flaw . I 'm a stickler for realistic dialog . A commonly used phrase in English is " Oh yeah ? " , but in this book , all the characters say " Oh yes ? " instead . Who says " Oh yes ? " ? No one I 've ever known , that 's for sure . It 's like some idiot editor decided to do a blanket search for the word " yeah " and replace it with " yes " in every instance . Now that I think about it , I do n't think the word " yeah " appeared anywhere in the book . Very unrealistic , and very annoying . I feel certain this was indeed an editorial blunder , because the rest of the dialog seemed fine to me . Other than that one thing , it was a fun , enthralling read .
2 #### Prey is definitely not one of Michael Crichton 's better works . The science is there but the fiction makes it a bit ridiculous . Only a few days for a bunch of nano - particles to evolve into full symbiotic pirates on human bodies ? Give me a break . If that happened in three days then ants would rule the world from giant ant cities ruled by massive distributed intelligence beings . Crichton does n't convince us that 20 lines of code in a nano - particle is better than an ant .
5 #### I love Michael Crichton 's books , so I was excited to read this one . It did not disappoint . It 's all about nano technology that is continuously evolving . It 's a classic Crichton , big company makes things that take over . One thing I love about his books , including Prey , is that not only are they action packed , but he also takes the time for character development . I felt like I was side by side with his characters . This one is told by the main character Jack , from his point of view , and I felt like I was studying and fighting along side him . I 'm surprised that this has n't been made into a movie . Above all , get the popcorn cause this is a fun and exciting read .
2 #### People are taken over by nanobots . Then it 's up to the hero to outwit the nanobots ( which should n't be difficult since they blow away in a stiff breeze ) . And that 's about it , folks . The plot of Prey is recycled from the endless " people are taken over by aliens " stories that have been around forever . The characters are stock : Crichton does n't bring them alive , and if they were alive , you would n't want to know them because they 're so dull . A couple of action scenes -- characters battling swarms of nanobots -- are lively , but the rest of the prose is flat . Crichton had some interesting ideas about nanobots but lacked the originality to do sufficiently interesting things with them to make the story worthwhile . The novel might be okay -- just okay -- as a fast beach read , but there are better options . I would give it 2 1/2 stars if Amazon made that option available .
4 #### I read this book this past summer on vacation . I liked it . The content is pure Crichton in it 's detailed description of the science and technology behind the story . I found it to be a " page turner " . It was a fast read , I finished it in about a week , and it made for great summer vacation reading .
4 #### " Prey " tells a story of nanotechnology run amuck . It is wildly entertaining but not quite as good as " Jurassic Park " in my humble opinion .
3 #### Pretty engaging but the ending felt very contrived . It could have been much better .
3 #### I had only read one other Crichton novel , Sphere , which I did not enjoy very much , but I thought I 'd give MC another chance . While I enjoyed Prey much more , it was far from thrilling . It was entertaining and chock full of well - researched info , but the snails pace was a downer . Jacks adventures in house hubbying was not why I was reading the book . Also , his ignorance of his wifes behavior was totally unbelievable . It was clear what was going on to the reader , but no matter how burdened Jack was by his domestic demands , he could surely have put two and two together . I overlooked this recurring flaw and pressed on , and was relieved as the plot eventually picked up some steam and ended well . The main thing I got from this book is that I will never read Crichton again . I 'll just watch the movies .
5 #### This is Critchon 's best book since Jurasic Park . The beginning is really interesting as it follows a house dad who struggles to find trust in his wife who works all the time . As a father to a young child , the scene where the baby gets the rash was rather disturbing because he described it so well ( i started dreaming that happened to my kid ) . When the main character enters the work force , that is where the action really picks up . In this book , they fight an enemy that seems unstoppable . This book was excellent . My only gripe is that it wrapped up quickly in the end . It also did n't show a lot of after math , which always disappoints me .
4 #### I liked this book , altho I felt he did too much explaining of concepts involved in nanotechnology . He managed to work it in well enough , and I do n't know how he could have told the story without it , but it was a bit to chew . The story is cliched , yet there are certainly unthinking corporate people who make bad decisions about dangerous technology . I could have done without all the domestic detail , the sister babysitting , the kids duking it out . Still , a fast read and recommended for a plane ride or beach weekend .
3 #### I did get the book as promised by it was very slow in showing up . I was informed that it was mailed but still took over three weeks to show up . Seems slow even my US government standards for snail mail .

( That would be for over 40 years . ) I 've read many of his books and have never been disappointed . I would n't say the same about the related movies . Do n't base a decision to buy his books based on the movies . In most of the movies , the stories have been altered too much . I hope this review will give potential readers some insight without giving away the story . Enjoy !

5 #### Like all of Micheal Crichton 's books this was a very good read . I was so sad when he passed away a few years ago . Stephen LeGare Plano Texas Insurance Agent
4 #### As some people know , Cracker Barrel Restaurant that is all along American hiways have audio books to loan . A refundable down payment minus $ 4.00 rental fee and you have an audio book for the length of your trip that you turn in at the end , or exchange for another along your trip . I have never listened to one . " Prey " is my first . It was so interesting and kept me awkake , entertained , and engrossed , that I would tell my husband not to stop for even bathroom breaks ! I did n't want to stop , I wanted to keep on listening ! He even enjoyed it . I have ordered " One Second Later " audio for the Spring break trip . I read the book and found it totally awesome and for me life changing . My husband does n't like to read . So , I am hoping he 'll find it as good as I did .
3 #### I 'd never read any of Michael CRICHTON novels so this was my first . I was pleasantly surprised . Though it was a bit slow to start with , it picked up the pace and kept me reading . I thoroughly enjoyed the subject matter and would recommend it to any reader , particularly sci - fi readers . Enjoy .
4 #### I do n't know much about nanotechnology . I have no way of knowing if this book was even remotely in the realm of possible . I would imagine it was , since Michael Crichton was always very good about that . I enjoyed this book much more than I thought I would . When a book focuses on a topic I am completely clueless about , I worry that I 'm not going to be able to follow the plot even if the topic is dumbed down for me . I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could enjoy the thriller without constantly having to wonder what the hell they were talking about .
4 #### What makes a book great IMO is when the story keeps you so completely hooked , you are unable to put it down until you 've finally finished it in the wee hours of the morning . Prey met that criteria for me . Sure it was n't perfect . The store became increasingly implausible and fantastic , some of the characters nothing but props , and I sure did n't like how they got " rid " of his wife so he could end up with the Luan ( or whatever her name was ) - hence 4 , rather than 5 stars . Nevertheless , a fantastic read . I highly recommend it .
4 #### I thoroughly enjoyed this novel . As in his usual style , Crichton blends technology with a sci - fi thriller . In Prey , the subject is nanotechnology . Jack Forman is the protagonist who used to program computers to problem solve by mimicking nature at its most efficient ( e.g. swarming bees ) . Jack has been called in to help out his wife ( who works at a research lab ) on a top - secret project . He discovers the lab has created self - replicating nanotechnology . The swarm of microscopic machines have escaped the lab and now seem intent on killing everyone they encounter .
2 #### I had been looking forward to reading " Prey . " Crichton was such a master at the futuristic thriller that I was hoping for a good read . Unfortunately , after 200 pages , I could n't go any further . The characters were not interesting and the premise was unbelievable -- even for Crichton . The storyline was completely predictable from the beginning and I completely lost interest . Crichton has produced some fine novels such as Andromeda Strain , Timeline , The Great Train Robbery , and State of Fear . " Prey " is not one of them .
5 #### I started listening to this audiobook on a six hour car trip . I found myself so engrossed in the story that I was actually looking forward to the return trip ! When I came home , I was thinking up errands that I needed to run so I could listen to it in the car . I have never gotten so engrossed in an audiobook before . The story was suspenseful and exciting . It has inspired me to get more audiobooks of Michael Crichton 's works . The only downside was the scientific portions of the book slowed the story down . The author would stop to inform about nanotechnology or things related to it and a lot of it was unnecessary for the story and caused it to drag a bit . Other than that , I thoroughly enjoyed this audiobook !
2 #### Sorely disappointing . I want to say that I like Crichton , but this was just a joke . The idea is fascinating , but it 's executed in an insanely predictable way . I think that Crichton is just re - writing the same novel over and OVER again : Protagonist is trapped in a secure facility . Means to safety is outside that facility in an unprotected building . WATCH OUT . Oh , it 's all okay . Whew . I 'm glad that 's finished . Spare yourself .
4 #### Crichton mixes science fact with science fiction to create an irresistible book that keeps you up at night to finish reading the entire book . Character development is somewhat weak but the science facts woven into the fiction will pull you in and not let go until you have reached the end . It 's one thrilling read !
5 #### Michael Crichton is re - visiting some old stomping grounds in this one . The 1970s sci - fi movie classic&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Westworld / dp/0792839714 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Westworld</a>&nbsp;was written and directed by Crichton and it features technology run amok and set loose on a killing spree.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Jurassic - Park / dp/0345370775 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Jurassic Park</a>&nbsp;features the dangers of tampering with the gene pool with an ensuing killing spree . Prey , in many ways , is a combination of the two - the dangers of nanotechnology , specifically the dangers of using bacteria in combination with tiny , tiny bits of technology to create something new . The problem is , of course , the same problem that he pointed out in " Westworld " and " Jurassic Park " : Things never turn out the way you think they will . Is this a Pulitzer Prize winner ? Hardly . But , it is a creepy thriller with some good points about science , the dangers of unintended consequences and some good thrills and chills . I enjoyed this one thoroughly .
2 #### While the science and the ' this could happen ' ethos is a lot of fun , the book 's start is astoundingly mysogynystic . His protagonist goes on AT LENGTH describing the normal day hundreds of millions of mothers world wide endure as if it 's something novel . His male character whines about taking care of kids , how his wife does n't call home when she 's late , how it 's hard to run into former pals who still make a paycheck . Honestly , no female author could ever have gotten such tripe published , but because our protagonist is a male , this is fodder for narrative . My husband and I howled at the beginning , and simply skipped entire chapters to get to the part he 's good at : telling a scary story using potentially real science . But the guy sure was ticked off at some woman when he wrote this thing .
1 #### For the third straight book from Michael Crichton that I 've been disappointed . He really needs to re - read his earlier novels to capture that magic again . This book was predictable and the characters were so flaw that it was hard to root for them instead you rooted against them . It reminded me a lot of a book I just finished , Mount Dragon , but that one was a lot better . I 've been a fan of Crichton for a long time and hopes he get his act together . To sum it up , this was plain awful and if you need a good Crichton fix , read Congo , Jurassic Park , or Sphere . Maybe next time , the real Michael Crichton will stand up .
3 #### Prey is set mainly in the Nevada desert . At a research lab , an experiment with limited intelligence , nano technology , has gone wrong . Some of the nano particles have escaped into the atmosphere , and are starting to learn , adapt and multiply outside of the laboratory environment . As they become more intelligent , they start to become a threat to the scientists inside their facility . I found this book slow moving at first . We are introduced to the main character , Jack Forman , an unemployed IT expert , and his family . His wife works at the research lab , in the desert , but the first part of the book deals mainly with Jack , and the increasingly strange behaviour of his wife . I suppose this is good from the character building point of view . Once , he visits the research lab , however , the book starts to get going , and the suspense starts to build , as they realise the enormity of the problem that they have on their hands , and the novel becomes a race against time , to destroy the nano particles . Overall , a fairly good read , with a few twists , reasonably good characterisation , but , also , very ' technical ' in places .
5 #### Crichton does a fabulous job of portraying how our human ignorance can lead us down a path of no turning back . How much do we really know about how computer technology works ? What explains the strange anomolies that appear in computer code ? " Prey " shows us just one hypothetical example of what could happen . It also makes you wonder how long before science fiction turns into science .
5 #### Whoa ! What a wild tale ! Thank goodness it 's only fiction . Still , I think the cautionary part of this narrative is that stuff like this happens all the time , with very few people knowing about it , and dire consequences affecting everyone can result . This is a very thought - provoking book . Crichton is at his finest as a storyteller .
3 #### Crichton tells a moderately good story , but this book needs editing . The text is too wordy , yet there is little character development . The dialogue is unnatural . Scientific information about nanotechnology is blended into tales of dishonest , scheming employers ; medical risks and technology - gone - wrong , and extramarital affairs . Crichton should correct his many grammatical errors , or hire an editor to do so .
5 #### This is one of M.C. 's very best in terms of a page - turner . I literally could n't put this book down because the story was so engaging and the plot was arranged so smoothly . The idea is very interesting ... nanotech beings becoming slef - aware and acting live a swarm . I would recommend this as the first Crichton book for new readers that want to try this author out .
2 #### Like other reviewers , I think his vision of an army of rapidly evolving nano - robots is unique and rather frightening if it came to pass . The book starts out strong and draws in the reader . However , much of the book 's buildup read like the Andromeda Strain and the conclusions at the end were over the top and ultimately not believable .
4 #### Prey is an entertaining book by Michael Crichton that continues his genre of science fiction , made popular earlier with his wildly successful book " Jurassic Park " . He specializes in taking complex scientific theories and discussing the concepts to make them understandable to the layman . Mr. Crichton melds this simplistic explanation of the science with a plausible scenario of science gone wild to write engaging science terror novels . In this book , Mr. Crichton tackles the concepts of nanotechnology , bioengineering , and distributed computer processing . This page turner keeps you enthralled with what happens next in this story of a few days in Jack Forman 's life . Jack , the main character , is recently unemployed and he suspects his wife of having an affair at her high - tech company . The combination of the science and the emotional attachment to Jack , will keep you reading this book until the very last page . This is a perfect book for people looking for a light read of some very heavy scientific concepts . However , die - hard Crichton fans will be left wanting for more .
4 #### A very good technological thriller and cautionary tale by Michael Crichton , dealing with the so called grey goo scenario ( though it is never named as such in the book if I remember correctly ) , the hypothetical situation involving molecular nanoparticles going out of control and self replicating in a way that consumes all living matter on Earth . The novel is set on California during the recent future . When an unemployed software engineer 's daughter gets a severe rash , he slowly starts to suspect this has something to do with his wife , who works for a mysterious nanotech company in Nevada . I do n't want to add more , lest take some surprise away from the reader . As in some other of his recent best sellers , there are scientific footnotes at the end of the book , where he tries to justify his frightening scenario as realistic .
2 #### It 's been quite a while since I 've read a book this bad from an author so well known . I remember reading " Lost World " when I was a teenager and I recall enjoying it , ( though it was about mercenary hunters chasing dinosaurs ... can't miss ) but I never realized how bad of a writer Mr. Crichton truly is . He 's an imaginative guy , and his stories typically follow the tight - knit formula of a summer blockbuster movie ... but the prose itself is disasterous . Hey , how bad could it really be , though ? I read this one from front to back . It begins strong --- I would tell anyone that the first half of the book is a solid read , but the writer quickly loses control of his story and it soon devolves into a cheesy action movie - slash - invasion of the bodysnatchers crapfest . It 's going to be hard to ever pick up a Chrichton book again , though I would hate for people to judge Stephen King if they accidentally picked up " From A Buick 8 " . You may like his work , which I 'm certainly in no position to say that he does n't have some good stuff out there ( this may very well be Crichton 's " Buick 8 " ) but you can not tell me with a straight face that " Prey " is a good book .
3 #### Nanocloud nasty . A science company working on nanotechnology has a problem , because of some corner cutting and the other usual corporate dodginess despite some critical advice they have a nano - organism released into the wild , and it is not a big fan of the humans that created it . A horror novel situation from there pretty much as they try and stop it and stay alive . 2.5 out of 5
3 #### a soso sci fi book . ending is something to look forward to till you find out what it is
5 #### This novel is well worth the reading / listening time ! I learned a great deal and highly recommend it .
5 #### Prey is a great book . Especially , I am pretty knowledgeable in multi - robot systems and recent research , and although there 's some exaggeration in the book , it 's very well - written and interesting .
4 #### Michael Crichton was born in Chicago , Illinois on October 23 , 1942 . He was educated at Harvard University . He has written many page - turning suspense novels , many containing cutting edge technology and all of them are extremely well researched . He is probably best known as the author of ` Jurassic Park ' but has had several best selling novels since then . Jurassic Park was published in 1980 . Difficult to believe I know . Out in the middle of the Nevada desert there is trouble brewing . Trouble that is a serious threat to the whole human race . An experiment has gone terribly wrong . A cloud of nano particles , to all intents and purposes micro robots has escaped from a laboratory . The cloud is able to sustain itself and in its own way it has intelligence . This intelligence increases as it learns from experience . The cloud is evolving quickly and as time passes it become even more deadly . So far every attempt to destroy it has failed . This could be the worst thing the human race has ever had to face . . .
3 #### I really admire Michael Crichton , who is able to tell exciting suspense stories while at the same time educating the reader about science , history , and a wide variety of other subjects . At his peak , he has written some truly great novels , such as THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY , SPHERE and JURASSIC PARK . PREY is a good suspense novel , but not a great one . This novel deals with the dangers of nanotechnology , but I did n't really find the storyline particularly believable . Essentially , you have to believe that a monster has been created by nantechnology that possesses miraculous powers that border on the ludicrous . In the end , I did n't buy the concept , which made this novel less enjoyable . Crichton also puts more emphasis on fast pacing in PREY , at the expense of good characterization . As a result , many of the characters are stereotypes and you barely get to know them . The only exception is the lead character , who is likable enough that I cared about him a lot . Unfortunately , the ending does n't provide the reader much closure with regards to his fate , which I found highly annoying . In short , PREY is fast - paced and fun , but it 's not his best work . I personally would n't recommend it to first time Crichton readers .
4 #### Every once and a while Dr. Crichton preaches ; very good and important " sermons , " I might add . " Rising Sun " was a sermon warning us of the dangers of Japan 's influence on American life ; " State of Fear " warned us against jumping on the " global warming " bandwagon just because it is " politically correct . " In " Prey " he warns us against technology more advanced than our social ethics . Good " sermons " all !
4 #### I liked it better than Airframe , Timeline . But Prey is one of my all time favourite novels . I liked it on par with Jurassic Park , COngo . I read it when it was released , and now it 's been years . I plan to read it again and I am sure I will enjoy it again . It 's educational too . While Timeline teaches you teleportation , Prey tells you about nanotechnology . Prey is a must read , BUY IT ! His next two novels State Of Fear and Next , though educational are not real thrillers . read them too but Prey is better than these two . Please Mr. Crichton , we like to be educated but we like it to be packed with thrills too , so continue with novels like Prey . I ca nt wait to find out what Crichton 's next novel is going to be on .
2 #### It seems this book begins the decline in Crichton novels . It 's not a very good SciFi adventure . I 've read a few of his books and have enjoyed them in the past , but based on this one 's merits and looking at State of Fear and Next , I doubt if I 'll ever read a Crichton book again .
1 #### This is the worst Crichton book I 've read . I 'm a big fan of his books normally , but this one really sucked . Buy sphere if you have n't read it ... that 's a good book . Timeline was n't bad either ...
2 #### The story was pacy and it was thrilling in parts . However , it became very predictable and I could easily stay a step ahead of the story without even trying much . I was disappointed .
3 #### I 'm torn with this one . I 'm normally drawn to the darker thrillers and novels with an unreliable narrator but I found it difficult to gel with this novel . The subject matter is dark , gritty and violent but ultimately it is a thriller about guilt and redemption . Grey herself was an interesting character , I liked her sense of containment and detachment but I did n't like her particularly or the choices she had made . My major issue was the lack of real characterisation with any of the characters with the exception of Madame Strawberry , the owner of the club in Japan where Grey works . I have n't read this author before and I did like the " idea " of the story and the setting but it was a bit of a miss with this reader .
5 #### I 've read most of .Mo Hayders previous books but this one is much different from her mysteries , to say the least . The research that went into this is astonishing , the characters unforgettable and the story one that will resonate with me for a very long time .
5 #### Very graphic , but intriguing story . Mo Hayder 's writing is captivating .
5 #### 6 + rocket ship to the top of my all time favorite book list , stars . If ever there were a book that i could describe as life - changing ... it would be this one . Is it for everyone ? Absolutely not . There are sections of this book that are brutal . That are intensely hard to read . And there are themes throughout the book that might be triggers for some people . But , for me this was easily one of the most beautifully written books i have ever come across in my life . I literally ran out of my trusty small post its due to all the sections I marked . I am still trying to process my thoughts after finishing this several hours ago , but i do hope at some point to be able to come back and write a proper review to try and express just how much this book effected me . These characters and this story will stay with me for the rest of my life . And i feel fortunate to have decided to take a chance on a book so far outside my comfort zone .
3 #### This book is nicely written ... the prose is a pleasure to read ... however I just kept thinking " get on with it " . The suspense builds to such a level , but the narrative is simply too slow in its exposition , development and resolution , that the book is frustrating to read . I confess to speed reading it in the end .
5 #### Fabulous! ... very interesting story written in double narrative form ..... couldn't put it down ! I have been delving through the Mo Hayder catalog and after reading Skin , I was n't really looking forward to the next Hayder piece ... but I was wrong , thankfully ! This book is a gem !
5 #### Mo Hayder is one of the finest contemporary writers . Her books take you squirming and screaming to places you have never been . With a literary style , her damaged , but persevering , characters explore the depths of evil . The Devil of Nanking is an excellent novel . If it 's possible , the book is even more gruesome than The Birdman and The Treatment . But this is an author who tackles the most difficult subjects . The Devil of Nanking is a fast - paced thriller into the exotic lands of Tokyo in the 1990s and Nanking during World War II .
5 #### Prey is the fastest moving , most interesting and most terrifying of all the Crichton thrillers I 've read , and I 've about read them all . Crichton has an ability to stay on the cutting edge of science while spinning a highly readable tale .
4 #### Prey is a classic Crichton thriller in that it takes cutting - edge science which the majority of the public knows little about , mixes it with taut action sequences and scientists too willing to step way past any ethical boundaries , and creates a foreboding sense of fear for the future of mankind . Almost as much a horror tale as a science fiction piece , Prey has a coherent narrative and a chilling sense of dread about it that makes it a better read than Crichton 's Next ( somewhat scattered and over the top ) or Timeline ( not relevant enough to the average reader to be that scary ) . In some ways it harkens back to and updates mood and the plot of Andromeda Strain . The topic , nano - particles and swarm intelligence , has a futurist cachet , but still relates well to the average reader 's experience and fears and , of course , makes Prey a less controversial read than Crichton 's State of Fear ( dealing with global warming ) . While not quite at the level of Jurassic Park , Prey is a page - flipping techno - thriller which both frightens and educates . Donald J. Bingle , Author of Forced Conversion .
4 #### This is another tautly written fast paced thriller from Michael Crichton . Jack Foreman had been a respected computer programmer until he had been unjustly fired six months earlier . Jack 's wife Julia was now the sole breadwinner and Jack was taking care of the children and looking for another job . When Jack was offered a position with wife 's firm he took the position despite some reservations . Within hours of taking the job Jack was regretting that he ignored those reservations . The threat in this thriller comes not from dinosaurs ( Jurassic Park ) or outer space ( Andromeda Strain ) but from nanotechnology , incredibly small machines with the capability of causing extremely large problems . As with Jurassic Park , Prey deals with the issue of scientific discoveries exceeding our ability to control them . As with all of Crichton 's work this novel draws the reader into the action quickly , making the reader reluctant to put it down without finding out what will happen next . The characters are rather one dimensional , the situations are improbable , the ending far fetched but it is fun .
5 #### Awesome . One of the best books ever on all that nano - technology futuristic stuff .
2 #### Prey is to a novel what the " wild swarm " Ricky was to the real Ricky : It presents a suggestion of a real book , but lacks the features , the characteristics of the real thing ... and it disperses on the ground at the slightest breeze . Like the worst of the bodice - ripper genre , Prey 's hero , Jack , makes the stupidest decisions - or makes no decision at all - when presented with behaviors that would alarm anyone else ... all to make the plot move forward where Crichton wants it to go . And when the communication lines were ripped out by the nano - Ricky and nano - Julia , I kept wondering whatever happened to Jack 's cell phone ? You know , the one he 'd just used the day before to talk to his kids , and that worked just fine out in the desert ? Nevertheless , I kept reading to the end because Crichton 's discussion about programming based on the natural world was fascinating . For that it gets a 2 rather than a 1 .
4 #### This book starts kind of boring . Many people might 've put it down . But the way he writes it ... Makes the reading interesting . It just got better and better as you read it . I kinda like this book . Well , the microtechnology described in this book might actually be invented someday , but not today . Maybe in 2020 ? Anyway , these little swarms could be used for military to kill off enemy bases pretty fast ! But then , it went out of control , so I guess that 's a risk that people have to think about : SECURITY .
2 #### I read Jurrasic Park with great enthusiasm . I 'm no scientific genius but I could easily follow the science in the plot , which made the book very enjoyable . Not so with this one . The science in the beginning seems like it could be comprehensible to a knowledgable person . However as the novel goes on , it begins to wheel completely out of control , and in the concluding sections just gives way to slam - bang action . Mr Crichton seems to have no consideration for the familiarity of the reader with the scientific aspect of this story . A dissapointment to me .
4 #### Grey is a troubled young woman who has become focused on a legend of a torture that allegedly happened in Nanking in 1937 during the massacre by the Japanese . Now , she 's in Tokyo trying to meet with a professor that has information about the incident she has obsessed over for the past 9 years , including film footage . This professor has his own obsession however ; an elixir that is said to give the drinker eternal life . He refuses to provide Grey with what she wants unless she uses her position in a hostess club to get closer to the elderly Yakuza boss who possesses this elixir and discover its ingredients from him . I started this book with some trepidation , as it looked really creepy and scary , but it 's more of a thriller / crime novel that a horror novel . I liked the mix of the historical with the present , two very different kinds of threats and disturbing events but connected in many ways . Grey was an interesting character who developed over the time of the novel into someone strong and not just to be pitied . This book is not a lighthearted read , and there are gruesome scenes but overall I thought the story also wove elements of forgiveness and personal growth throughout which left me feeling not altogether depressed at the end . Recommended for crime and thriller fans , and also for anyone interested in this dark time in Japanese history .
4 #### A haunting and powerful story on a topic rarely treated . Japan has n't done much yet to own to the atrocities committed by its troops in China in the 1937 invasion . Mo Hayder 's choice of a very individual approach through 2 vulnerable characters makes the horror both almost bearable and yet that much more terrible to behold .
3 #### It was n't what I expected from Mo Hayder because it seemed very brutal and almost impossible to conceive such a plot theme . I was disappointed for the first time and I am sorry because I enjoyed the other novels . I studied Chinese history at university so believed I would relate to the setting .
5 #### Excellent read ! ! ! ! One of her very best written works . Educational regarding the aftermath of World War 11 in Japan . This is fiction with real life in Japan and its culture . The girl whom the story revolves around is a college student from England seeking answers to heart rendering questions that are the background for the entire book . Hayder brings all the characters brilliantly alive for you with her vivid portrayal . I could not put this book down . Mesmerizing is my one word description !
5 #### What would a person do to be immortal ? This is the story of a man who became a Devil , The Devil of Nanking . It is the story of the Japanese invasion of China & the massacre they carried out in the capital of Nanking . It is the story of a young girl locked away in an asylum in England . She was told that she made up a story , that she could never have read a certain book in her parents home . This is a powerful story about the lengths human beings will go to survive & to know truth . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I did n't expect this novel from Mo Hayder , whose Jack Cafferty novels I have definitely enjoyed . But this was a story that , for whatever reason , she seemed to feel really drawn to . I 've read nonfiction accounts of Japanese atrocities against China during WWII . All are horrendous , none are as gripping as this story .
3 #### This novel is about nano - technology and a group that creates nano - robots that can perform actions as a whole , unfortunately they turn on their owners and thus the thriller part of this book . As a whole , I love most all of Crichton 's work , and while I enjoyed this one I think it was lacking a lot . First , how many novels / movies have a plot where a robot is given artificial intelligence and then turns on the owner ? ? ? The only thing that makes this one unique is that it is nano - robots that work as a team and evolve . Second , I love reading Crichton novels because while entertaining , I also feel that I learn something new each time . In Prey , he glossed over the technical stuff way too much by barely going into distributed processing and nanotechnology . Now he may have done lots of research for this novel but it did n't show this time . It was still an entertaining book that I finished in just two days because of its addictive nature but coming from Crichton I expected better .
4 #### borders between believable and unbelievable . But as usual Crichton excels at his fort ' technology gone wrong ' tales
5 #### As an Aritificial Intelligence major , I spent my last year studying swarm intelligence which Crichton obviously spent time studying as well . He nails it . But not only does he get the science right , he does n't make learning swarm intelligence as boring as the text books . We should make it part of the curriculum . I got bored for 20 pages when he rants about the scientific details of swarms , but other than those few pages , the book moves along with interesting characters and great dialogue . Infidelity , family pressure , schizophrenia , nano - bugs , and government scandals ... what more could you ask for in a cheap paperback ? It 's an easy read and wo n't bog you down with big words and complex sentence structure , exactly what you need to relax and enjoy a well - written story .
5 #### A fast moving and exciting story about the dangers of technology . I really could n't read it fast enough . The characters were ' real ' and the plot had just the right amount of technology ( not being a technical kind of girl ) However ... if you are a technophobe then stay well clear ... the plot will terrify you ! ! :-o
4 #### Prey is the best of the later Crichton 's . Yes , as some have indicated , it 's formulaic , right down to the " start up " venture capitalized company . But , it 's just darned fun , anyway . And I like the home father spin ( an extension perhaps of Disclosure , but this time a house husband instead of male employee sexually molested by a woman ) and the first person treatment ( unusual for Crichton ) . It all adds up to a fun novel . I do n't buy the technology , or rather the " ultimate extension " of the technology , ( certainly nanotechnology is here to stay ) , and it 's another variation on Frankenstein , but getting past all that , it 's fun reading , clever at times , more character - driven than any other Crichton novel , and on the whole a buzz ( pun intended ) . I ca n't imagine anyone really coming away saying they were bored or uninterested . It 's just too easy to have fun with . So , if it 's formula , it 's a formula that works , from the man who invented the formula . And , it 's better to read a new -- and , as always , clever -- Crichton novel than to re - read an old favorite . Yes , it 's familiar , but it 's different enough to be enjoyable and fast - paced enough to be a quick read . I can see a movie in its future , almost certainly .
2 #### Crichton uses his standard formula again in this novel : a startup company develops a new buzz - word technology which goes out of control . In this case the buzz - word is nanotechnology , which could be interesting , but not with this execution . The novel 's beginning is it 's best part . The protagonist is a family man who is looking for a new tech job in Silicon Valley , when he begins to notice weird occurences surrounding his wife and kids . Unfortunately the novel suddenly changes tracks , and most of the interesting early sections of the book are forgotten . For the latter 2/3 of the novel the reader is treated to detailed yet ridiculous situations involving the biotech organisms in the middle of the desert . This is one of Chrichton 's worst .
3 #### Unfortunately , Crichton 's books fall into 2 categories . ( 1 ) A brilliant lesson in the chosen field ( eg . nanotechnology , creating dinosaurs)and a gripping read . Or ( 2 ) a brilliant lesson in the chosen field in the absence of a real plot . Unfortunately ' Prey ' falls into the latter category . I wo n't rehash the plot , but basically this novel suffers from information over - kill at the expense of character development and the formulation of events . Crichton 's ability to cram so much difficult information into a book is simply astounding . And that he can make it so easily digestible to a wide audience is even more remarkable . However , I was left with the feeling that I had just read an interesting text book rather than a work of fiction . Not bad , but he has done better .
5 #### Just as " Eaters of the Dead " is more fantasy than sci - fi , " Prey " is almost part mystery . Crichton lays out the clues for his readers and allows them to match wits with his protagonist , Jack Forman . I did figure out some of the outcome long before Jack did , but the novel was still incredibly fast - paced and engrossing . Unlike some of Crichton 's other novels , which portrayed situations I do not see myself falling into , " Prey " was downright frightening . Highly recommended .
4 #### After reading a Michael Crichton novel I feel like I have an MBA or a degree in Science . Whether it 's dinosaurs , business or nanotechnology , Crichton explains and educates in understandable terms that make you feel smarter about a subject when he is done explaining . And the subject in Prey is indeed nanotechnology . Further , Crichton is quite simply an excellent novelist . He 's not only the brightest author that I read , he is one of the absolute best at weaving a story that keeps you turning pages at a rapid pace . Prey is the story of what happens when man - made micro organisms get out of control and become self aware ... kind of like SkyNet in the Terminator series , but on a much ... literally ... smaller level . An expert programmer must fix computer code that he developed and was incorporated into micro - organisms . He has 24 hours to get it fixed before a potentially planet - changing event results . If you 've read any of Crichton 's other fiction stuff you know what you 're in for : a suspenseful ride through some kind of intricate system gone wrong . And you also know that you will find it difficult to put the book down . Add it to your cart .
5 #### Just finished reading this book . Compared with the last fiction novel I read - Baldacci 's The Winner - this is a far , far better written and researched book . " Prey " holds your interest , has a good plot , and the pace is well maintained . The details at times may bore those uninterested in the minutaue , but the technical gore is kept to a minimum . The pace at which the bio - engineered nanoparticles evolve is a bit too fast to be entirely plausible , or the level of sophistication that they become capable of within a few weeks , but is well presented to make it at least a little bit plausible . Also , the stay - at - home father routine of Jack Forman is presented in excruciating detail , especially in the first few pages of the book , but this also is a minor quibble with the book . All in all , a full five stars .
5 #### One of Mo Hayder 's best ! Unique story and extremely well - told . Hayder 's characters are fascinating and " real . " Compassionate version of a horrific historical event , combined with contemporary insights . A thriller in every sense of the word .
5 #### A wild , transcontinental romp spanning several decades to expose the horrors of the past . Good Characters , and disturbing true horrors pull you in and keep you interested ...... and an ending scene that you will NEVER forget !
5 #### I am sooooo hooked on books by Mo Hayder ! Each one is really creepy but in different ways . This one was a real surprise and you never knew what it was all about until the end . Oh my ! What an ending ! Most satisfying but as usual -- something way out of the ordinary and totally unexpected . You will love this --
3 #### A gritty , cringe - worthy nightmare , this book should have a WARNING stamp on its cover about the graphic images it contains . I have always wondered why they do n't do that with books . This is a fictional novel based on the Nanking massacre and it goes back and forth between the experiences of a Chinese man caught in Nanking at the time ( 1937 ) and a British girl in modern - day Japan looking for a kind of snuff film from 1937 . I felt the author could 've said enough in half the pages , without going into the narrator 's back story ( which seemed full of gratuitous sexual detail ) or the guy she ends up meeting in Japan . Considering the horrible stuff going on already in the flashbacks in Nanking , I do n't see why Hayden had to cram more of the same in the present - day narration . The Nanking situation takes a back seat to the story of the troubled girl and it 's not what I was expecting .
5 #### I have heard about the " rape of Nanking " but this book of historical fiction gives one a vivid picture of the atrocities and waste of life that happened here when the Japanese invaded China during WWII .
3 #### I wish Amazon would allow a " plus star " rating , since I would give The Devil of Nanking a 3 + . This unusual novel is flawed in a few places , perhaps due to a quick editing schedule and some " slips " of writerly logic . Nevertheless , this is a terrific read , full of off - beat characters and beguiling , creepy locales . " Mama Strawberry , " who fancies herself the Asian Marilyn Monroe , is stunningly rendered , as is Miss Ogawa , the monstrous nurse . Nanking is a place where cultures and questionable revisionism collide , mixed with a sinister blend of erotic secrets and international intrigue . Throw in a big , moldering house with unexplored rooms and a lush , walled garden of tangled foliage for good measure . We are kept on edge throughout the narrative , wondering when we will fall into the darkness . The second half of the book is more accomplished than the first , with fewer sentences that " break the mood . " However , stages must be set for the story to be told , and this tale is well worth your time . The Devil of Nanking is entertaining , elucidating , and evocative .
5 #### There is a rare description of the massacre of Nanking during the Japanese invasion of China during WWII . This story is a gut wrenching thriller , not for the faint hearted . I could not put it down . I will be reading more by Mo Hayder .
5 #### This story by Michael Crichton was done very well . Like all of his other " techno - thriller " books , this is certainly a page turner . As a matter of fact I finished it in 4 hours . This is my first Crichton book and it did encourage me to read more of his works . The plot of this book revolves around the computer programmer Jack Foreman . After Jack is fired from his past job , he takes the responsibilities of a stay at home dad . After being out of work for 6 months , he recieves a call from his former employer asking him to consult the firm again on his program " PREDPREY " . This program programs nanoparticles to use predator instints in order to achieve a goal . Meanwhile , Jack 's wife , Julia , has been acting strangly . Her company ends up using Jack 's program for its nanoparticles and needs help . Jack looks at this a chance to see what is causing his wife problems . The problem is that tiny particles have exscaped the building that was storing them and are in the process of taking over the Nevada Desert Ecosystem . Jack must find a way to get these nanoparticles back under his control .
5 #### Michael Crichton does and amazing job with this book . His mix of suspense and science draws you in and wo n't let you go . This book is extremely well researched and an exciting read . I absoultely loved this book and I recommend it to any Michael Crichton fan .
2 #### Prey . Yep , it 's a page - turner and perfectly enjoyable way to put your brain on hold for a few hours and enjoy the ride , Just as long as you do n't waste too much money on it . ( I got my copy at a thrift store . ) The flipside is that it 's nonsensical ... You 'll need not only to suspend your disbelief , but put it on ice and lock it in a safe - deposit box as well ! The plausibility factor is more like fantasy than science - fiction . For one thing , the clues for the " surprise " ending are so blantantly obvious ( at the beginning ! ) that the main character seems like a moron for not noticing that the people around him are n't what they seem to be . Secondly , Crichton ( to his credit ) tries to give the main character depth in showing his marital , personal and family problems . Unfortunately , he 's less successful than George Lucas was in portraying young love in " Attack of the Clones . " The protagonist 's reactions , dialogue , and emotions are way out - of - sync for what 's going on . No regret at the ending ? Michael , Michael , Michael ! Thirdly , the alternation between technological fill - ins and action / dialogue is a little rough . Prey is more reminescent of Sphere than Crichton 's superior works such as The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park . Still entertaining , but not memorable , thrilling , or deeply satisfying .
3 #### Very good idea , lots of creativity . Unfortunately the book got lost into the technical creativity . Characters lack depth , many ideas are not pushed far enough . An OK book that will teach you nothing about nanotech .
4 #### this is a horror story set on 2 levels : the vicious depravities of some modern - day tokyo gangsters , and the 1937 nanking massacres by imperial japanese army troops . the modern story is quite silly ; the nanking story , not . both are very scary . yet the horror itself is written with an oddly delicate hand . tokyo was the star turn for me , having lived there most of my adult life . for a change , this has got everything right ! accents & atmospheres , people & places , crazy as they are there are no false notes . even the haunted house manages to be credible . i read this for tokyo and i was delighted . my focus was narrow , but it is a serious book . i would recommend it in the interests of history , and because it is beautifully written .
5 #### I could n't put this book down . It was shocking but at the same time so interesting . I 'll be looking for more books by this author . He is easy to read and the subject matter was so different than I had expected .
5 #### As an American , I never knew about the massacre of Nan King . It was not taught or even touched upon in our schools , as if the event never happened . It was baffling to me when I googled it and found the information about this . Since then I have studied it , and compared it to our histories of the 2nd World War . We in America tend to gloss over much that happened before our involvement in the war , and count the only reason for declaring war against the Japanese is the perfidiousness of Pearl Harbor . However we wished to assimilate and normalize our guilt over the dropping of nuclear weapons on Japan , ignoring the behavior of Japanese troops in Nan King ( and later THEIR governments ' removal of the matter from their history books ) can never be the answer . We must look clearly at the past , or we will repeat it again and again . As a novel this is , I believe , one of Mo Hayder 's best . Weaving in and out of history it brings you close to the horrors of the Yakuda , and the power that these gangsters have over everyday life in Japan . And it interweaves one person 's great loss with anothers .
5 #### One of the best books I read all year . I enjoy books where I learn quite a bit about history while enjoying an exciting story . The main character , Grey , was compelling and the author wrote in such a way that she gave just enough to keep one interested in reading on . Great twists and turns . Highly recommended .
1 #### Big time . I read Birdman and really liked it . Devil is a major disappointment . I felt NOTHING for the characters . Grey is totally unlikable , vague and totally implausible . The rest of the characters pretty much the same . The story line is boring and sooo s l o w. Save your money and do n't waste your time on this one . It is like .. who cares ?
3 #### For me , the really LONG narratives of places and issues that existed between China and Japan at the time were not all that necessary . The actual story that was told could have easily been reduced by 100 pages or more and the novel would have lost nothing of significance . Characters were not well developed enough for me to care about them or their outcomes . I just wanted to get to the end before falling asleep . I would n't read another such novel .
2 #### when pop novelists like crichton , iles , and clancy toss in dialog between the sexes , their failures as complete novelists are revealed . crichton can command all the techno mumbo - jumbo , but when the characters actually need to speak with one another , it becomes laughable . the recipe is the same .... always a cute , young coed helping out the middle - aged expert in his field . the flirtations are obvious , but out of respect for one another , they reject all notions of consummation . had this pile of words included a graphic romp in the rack , another star would have been earned .
5 #### There are good writers , and then there are incredible writers that you hope are writing books until they 're one - hundred because you ca n't get enough of them . Crichton is one incredible writer ! I 'm so happy a friend gave me a copy of ' Jurrasic Park ' and got me started on the Michael Crichton addiction . His fictional novels have enough fact and scientific tones that you 're sucked in to the world on the pages . Prey is an edge of your seat , what if type of read that makes you realize that the possibilities for fiction turning into fact may only be a few scientific advancements away ... Chrissy K. McVay author of ' Souls of the North Wind '
5 #### I did not put this book down until it was finished . 21 hours , to be exact . Outstanding .
2 #### Michael Crichton is one of the best popular writers today . I do n't think that 's debatable . That fact makes Prey all the more disappointing . In it , Crichton relies too heavily on his page - turning style of writing ( similar to Harlan Coben ) and abandons what made him a must - read - a plot people believe . Maybe he 's a victim of his success . Regardless , the characters here are shallow and undeveloped and the " horrifying " nanobots are really more of a joke than a threat . Anyone could predict the end if they 're paying attention in the first couple of chapters . Unfortunately , you have to read 350 or so pages to confirm that assumption .
2 #### I 'm not sure about you , but I 've read enough suspense novels to fill all of my book shelves . And this book is not as good as most of them . And to top it off , Crichton attempts to educate us on nanotechnology and AI subroutines throughout the book . If I wanted to read a book on nanobots , I 'd go buy a book on it . Similarly with AI . Basically , this is your standard , technology runs amok book . Well written but predictable as white snow in January . Yawn ....
4 #### An ambitious novel , about 80 % convincing . Somewhat sensationalized , but ultimately intelligent and gripping . Very different from Hayder 's other books , for better or worse .
5 #### This was easily a 5 star book for me . I purchased it around 10 p.m. and read through the night , gorging myself on it and finishing up around 6 a.m. The one caveat that I would give is that if you are not a fan of dark subject matters you wo n't like this as much as I did . The book is dark but terribly well written and while I see some other reviewers claiming it is slower paced , I did not find that to be true at all . I 'll spare the graphic details in my review since they 've been covered in so many others . What I will say is that I only recently discovered Mo Hayder and I am in love . I started with Poppet and then backtracked and read the rest of the Caffery series . I saved the stand alone novels for last and I saved The Devil of Nanking for the final book of hers that I read . It seemed by description to be one that I would enjoy least so I held it until last but this could n't be further from the truth . In fact , I find it difficult to order these books at all . I love a good series so the Caffery books might edge out as favorites in general but I enjoyed her three stand alone books equally and for different reasons . Now I 'm only sad that I have to wait for new titles . I highly recommend this author .
1 #### Mo Hayder has the ability to write brilliant , shocking books , one almost excuses her excess as the story line is so good . In the Devil of Nanking - the book is sick for sick sake - not worth reading
4 #### A suspenseful and gripping unfolding , rather like the undoing of an complex origami animal ... adding to the western canon of Asian insight
4 #### I have read the Cafferty series by this author and was expecting a police procedural / mystery along the same lines . Though disturbingly dark , the historical research seemed quite thorough , the characters were very engaging and the suspense made it difficult to put down . I 'd love to see the author write more novels like this one .
5 #### Just finished " The Devil of Nanking " and wanted to share just how incredible this book is . Not in a way classics are , but in a way I was reading it on the beach and when my husband touched my shoulder , I came back to reality and realised my hands are shaking . I was n't startled , I was horrified . So , is ignorance same as evil ?
5 #### I could n't put this book down . It 's haunting , very well written . and will shake you long after you 've finished it .
4 #### The Devil of Nanking draws you in with innocence , makes you aghast with disbelief and saddened with our frailty Well written
5 #### From the first sentence , I was hooked . Greysan is such a disturbed character and as the reasons for her oddness unfold , it is hard not to care about her . I had never read about the raping of Nanking and was shocked by the evil that man in capable of inflicting on man . Yet , I do n't doubt the reality of it . I think what I appreciated most was that the author softened the Nanking story by moving from past to present frequently and effectively . It helped me feel less slapped in the face with the realities of Nanking . Mo Hayder creates some very dark characters in a very effective way . I look forward to reading more books by this author .
4 #### This was a difficult book to read . Very dark , filled with evil and gore . I tend to read books in clusters of topics . I have focused on WWII , and the times surrounding it , to get a better understanding of this last century , where we came from . Mixed in with this I have read several books of historical literature about murders in the Orient , including " People Who Eat Darkness " and " Murder in Peking " . While reading about WWII I found out about the horrors perpetrated in the capital city of Nanking by the Japanese Imperial Army when they took it in 1937 . I was completely ignorant of this history ! This brought me to this book , which is fiction , but revolves around the unspeakable evils wrought in that defenseless city , intertwining it with current events which arise out of those acts . Very interesting book ! Hard to read , but hard to put down as well . A bit too much gory violence for me , but I would recommend it for history buffs who also like historical fiction . It leaves you shaking your head , but will not soon leave your thoughts .
2 #### You may turn the pages , but you will not care about either the robotlike heroine or hero in this mechanical dance of a novel . The hero , if you can call him that , is more concerned with the price of diapers and feeding the baby than he is that his wife has become a stranger who slaps the baby . When the story finally progresses from shopping and changing diapers to fighting the little monsters , the plot loses all originality and becomes a cut and paste from other books and film . Sad . That this is what passes for popular bestselling fiction is a good reason not to read it .
1 #### Found this Hardcover version on bargain section of Borders in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , grabbed it without a second thought , brought it to the hotel and started reading the first few pages ... Forget about Jurassic Park , Congo , etc . This novel starts extremely slow , and it continued to be very slow for a very long time . Though the nanotechnology issue is intriguing with Crichton 's usual finese in researched information back up , it can not salvage from this sinking Titanic plot . There are a few sections which are interestingly written , but mostly mundane and boring . I have fallen asleep many times reading just a chapter from this novel . I always pace myself to finish reading a book to the very end , since I am not to judge it until it is totally depleted . Well , this novel is not for me .
3 #### Here we have another one of Michael Crichton 's outings into the world of technology gone awry . It probably is n't too much of a stretch to say that if you have read one of Crichton 's last several novels , you have essentially read them all . As with many of his books , we have here an essentially neutral technology creating havoc when over - reaching corporate and military types fiddle with it , a protagonist trying to warn of the dangers who is of course ignored until the situation is entirely out of hand , the requisite harrowing escapes , etc . That being said , this book is also like most of his others in that it is a fun , light read , and worth the few bucks and few hours one will invest in it .
3 #### I liked this book because it was a fast easy read , even with the technical jargon . If you have n't read any of Crichton 's books , he formats his writing in each chapter by writing a few sections of the story , then he will write a section about the technical background in the story . I think this story is similar to a lot of his books , in the sense that the characters are trying to esape by getting off an island ( or in this case a buidling ) , and that Crichton uses the same " nature / technology runs amok theme . " I really liked the first 3/4ths of the book , then the last 1/4 was just ... I do n't know , what 's the word ... cheesy . I do n't know if Crichton had a deadline to meet , but the ending felt rushed . The whole " invasion of the body snatchers " part of the book has been done before , why oh why did Crichton thought it would be good for this book ?
5 #### I bought a copy of this book after I read a library copy , that 's how much I liked it . I will definitely be reading this again ! The writing is excellent . Mo Hayder really knows how to draw a reader in to the story , and this is a story that I 'm guessing most Americans do n't really know much about .
5 #### A very dark , but good read . Knowing that the premise for this tale comes from real life , makes it even more chilling . I would recommend this book to those that can take a look at that darker side , and not turn away .
5 #### Excellent book . Even if only a quarter of what was written about the atrocities that happened to the Chinese at the hands of the Japaneses is true it was a great history lesson that should never be forgotten .
4 #### I chose this book because I had some idea of what happened in Nanking and was curious about how it would be presented . It was difficult to read about the things that happened but you got a sense of families and what happened to them during this terrible time . It is hard to me to realize that life that that described can happen
5 #### Once in a while , if we 're very lucky , we 'll come across an author whose story is so captivating , so enthralling , whose writing is so thrilling , it 's impossible to stop reading . We might even find ourselves wishing we could climb inside the story and be part of it , getting to know the characters personally and travel with them on their journey . Mo Hayder is one of those authors and this is yet one more of her stories that will make you feel that way . Someone described Mo Hayder as " easily today 's best writer of visceral and elemental horror . " I would say without any qualification , that 's an absolute UNDERSTATEMENT .
3 #### The historic narrative was very interesting , but the parallel modern narrative was kind of illogical . Maybe some people do live the way the main character did in the story , but I doubt it .
5 #### This book is a great read for those not faint of heart -- or tummy . As the progresses , so does the gore . It is n't gratuitous -- the story demands the details , but it is bloody . The characters are very well written , fully fleshed out , as is the plot . I highly recommend it .
3 #### Another gripping thriller that just does n't cut it . I recommend it though ; it 's like one of those TV shows you watch as a guilty pleasure because it so mindless . Enjoy .
5 #### Wow , what a great book . It was suspenseful from the first page through the last page . The scary part is wondering what is really true about nanotechnolgy as told in the book compared to reality . Michael Crichton unabridged is the only way to go , love the book and waiting for the next book to listen ( state of fear ) .
5 #### This was a great story . I loved the visual that was drawn up in the words so that we could envision this creature coming after us . It was fantastic .
3 #### As a great Crichton fan , I was looking forward to this new novel ( as I much as I am looking forward to the one coming out in November ) . It seemed so very much on the pulse of the newest and hippest technology today : nanotechnology . It seemed as promising and " fresh " as Timeline . Unfortunately ... it turned out not to keep any of those promises . First , it takes half to book to get actually thrilling and tense . We spend too much time in the family life of the characters . Then the suspence starts and pick up slowly . By the time they hit the cave , there are only a few pages left and you wish the book would have been longer . So all in all , OK but could do a whole lot better .
4 #### Although the material is quite dark and disturbing , I found myself enthralled with the characters and plot . The story is told from the point of view of two people who could not be more different , but share similar dark secrets . Not for the faint of heart .
5 #### Read this one in 2 sittings . Lots of questions and lots of answers . How a group of people with nothing in common become a family . Starting with the takeover of Nanking to modern times . Twisted ending but worth the time .
3 #### I was very impressed with the author 's gift for creating such an ominous setting here . Both the past and present narratives were equally chilling as well as haunting . I enjoyed the historical aspects as well , but overall the style was a little darker than I prefer . It 's still a well - written novel and very much so worth reading , however .
5 #### This story will haunt you when you are finished reading it . Excellently written , It leaves you feeling like it was a disturbing dream you had .
5 #### Wow , I would normally never go for this kind of book , but I am so glad I did ! What a great story , so incredibly well written . Keeps you on the edge , never knowing what to expect next . A must read ! It was so worth it !
4 #### The ending was not as satisfying as the rest of the book , but the book as a whole is excellent . As usual for this author , I would suggest the book only for mature readers because the subject matter involves extreme brutality . However , the author manages to instill the fear without illuminating all the grisly details .
5 #### WOW . Very good book . Science and suspense . A must read
4 #### ... if you enjoy a good solid Crichton novel . Prey has all the staples of Crichton 's best work . A good setting , great scientific background , and a quick pace . Of course it also suffers the other typical problems with Crichton novels ... weak characters , and the familiar prose of problem - hypothesis - scientific explanation - new problem ( and repeat ) . The story focuses on nanotechnology ( microscopic robots ) and how they are let loose from a laboratory into the environment . Naturally they begin to " prey " on anything they view as a threat and it 's up to our computer - programming hero to come in and save the day . The book reads like it could someday be a big screen movie . Overall I had fun with this book , not as good as Jurassic Park but better than Congo .
5 #### A fast moving and exciting story about the dangers of technology . I really could n't read it fast enough . The characters were ' real ' and the plot had just the right amount of technology ( not being a technical kind of girl ) However ... if you are a technophobe then stay well clear ... the plot will terrify you ! ! :-o
5 #### It is difficult to choose from Michael Crichton 's works , the man who gave dinosaurs a new lease of life . However , Prey is his best yet . Based on Nanotechnology and its risks , the best part of the novel is the tension and involvement he creates . I could identify very closely with the characters and experienced a lot of anxieties as the climax aproached . What is also remarkable is that he manages to teach a lot while entertaining . This is a useful byproduct . This book also brings the conflict home , as a husband tries to battle not only his wife 's company , but his wife too . The dilemma is unnerving . Defintely Crichton 's best .
3 #### First , Prey - great story - very engaging , thrilling . Mr. Crichton is truly a master of suspenseful story - telling . I found myself sitting in the car after arriving at a destination to continue listening to the CDs . The characters are well - formed - at first some seemed a bit odd and inconsistent , but that is explained by the end . The whole book occurs in a week -most of it in 2 days , so there is a lot of suspense and excitement packed in . Overall , I 'd recommend the book / audio book . However , WHAT is up with Michael Crichton and the lectures ? I 'm in the process of listening / reading the books I have n't already read . I read State of Fear recently and felt like I was being beat over the head with envirnomental politics . There was certainly less of that in Prey , but certainly the overall message was one of research ethics ( or lack thereof ) and the book ends with more of a lecture . I just do n't find that enjoyable , and I 'm hesitant to read any new books he comes out with since there seems to be a trend toward this . I understand , Mr. Crichton 's books have always had a " when research goes bad " theme , but when reading fiction I do n't want to be berated with the author 's political / environmental / ethical viewpoints as much as Mr. Crichton has been doing recently .
2 #### If you can resist the temptation to drop it after reading a few pages , few chapters and manage to get captured you may end up liking it . It took me a lot of effort to reach the end . I found it slow , slow and slow ....
4 #### I will turn from this to an historical account of the Nanking Massacre -- I just want to know so much more .
1 #### Very slow read ... takes forever for the plot to develop and once it gets to the point , there is nothing there . Dull and uninteresting dialogue and events lead nowhere .
4 #### This novel was very interesting . Japan 's culture and history was described well . The discription of the unthinkable acts of Japan 's soldiers stayied in my mind for weeks however .
4 #### Not my typical genre but very well written and it definitely held my interest . I also learned more about the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 . Would recommend the book with Ghent caveat that it 's not for the facing of heart ,
5 #### Great book like this does not come often . This is one of the few books that I would recommend people to read , though it is not for everyone . The content is extremely interesting and disturbing at the same time . As a Japanese - culture - lover , I learned a lot about Japan , the place , the descriptions , the feelings , are all conveyed through the text as Grey lives her temporary life in Tokyo . Everything is very connected and it flows well together . I just can not put the book down one I 've read it . I do not want to give any spoilers , but the story plot is very unique ! Please read !
4 #### Read the rape of nanking and . This was an exciting , interesting and thought provoking read.the nanking story needs to not be forgotten . Thanks mo Hauser .
5 #### Whatever did happen during this war was horrific and another example of Satan 's hand at work to corrupt our minds , and any sense of sanity is destroyed in the process . Man has many sad stories to tell during its history thus far and hope for our future can only be found in Jesus , I believe .
4 #### this is the first michale chricton book I 've read , although I 've seen several of his movies .. this book sucked me in from the get go ... the main character , while very intelligent , is more or less an every man .. not infallible , not super athletic and good at everything ... that 's what I liked about him so much , as with all the characters in this book .... the key to any good characters are their flaws and how they deal with them ... very interesting story line and the pace just keeps the pages turning constantly .. almost could n't put this one down =) fantastic dialogue a well .. definetly worth your time !
1 #### Not only does Crichton build classic , generic , one level personality types , but he also utilizes the same redundant formula he always does - man advances - man 's advance gets out of control and threatens to do him in . In this case he uses nanotechnology as the " fearful antagonist " but he is not technically accurate , or even complete when describing his own pretend version of the technology . The scariest thing about Prey is not the plot ( highly predictable ) but rather that his portrayal might actually influence people into believing that this is the real nanotechnology of the future , and it is not . The nanotechnology of the future will have amazing benefits , cures for cancer , solutions for environmental issues and food for all ( try a Google search ) . And while any emerging technology has it 's cautionary side ( remember when human jobs were predicted to be replaced with computers by 1985 ? ) . Crichton 's tale is merely a fictional account , and a poor one at that .
2 #### A far cry from Crichton 's better workds , Prey is disappointing . The thriller element is not lost , however , that 's why I managed to complete it . Crichton does not seem to have read enough journals and books for this one , because the usual high density and often disguised technical portions are sparse . Even when they occur they 're inserted lazily . Everything from the beginning is predictable , if you 've read Crichton before . The perfectly normal start , then the high tech link person or persons , the tech breakthrough somewhere around a third or the middle of the book , and finally everything going haywire towards the end . And oh , the mandatory dead people . This time , it 's nanorobots which do the killing . Crichton 's artificial life forms seem to have everything , from vision to inbuilt memory . He goes on adding visual sophistication , audio response , solar power generators and blah blah whenever something become difficult to explain . AI learning ? No problem ! ! They have memory . Pretty unconvincing , primarily because it 's not backed up by hard science . It 's almost like a bad dream of The Andromeda Strain towards the end .
3 #### Prey is your typical Michael Crichton fast paced science thriller . However you feel about Crichton 's past novels , you will feel exactly the same about this one . Like most other Crichton yarns , the book covers a time period of only a few days , during which the fate of the world hangs in the balance due to some technological catastrophe caused by overly ambitious scientists . Also like his previous books , Crichton will educate you on a particular branch of state of the art science . Where previous novels covered fields such as paleontology , time travel , aeronautics , and virtual reality , Prey deals with the menacing new threat of nanotechnology . For me , this is the only reason I keep picking up every new Crichton book that comes down the pike . I enjoy learning about the latest cutting edge technology within the backdrop of a " worst case scenario " action story . Otherwise , I usually stay away from these sort of fluffy , beach book , dime a dozen thrillers .
3 #### From Dr. Frankenstein to Dr. Strangelove , the idea that any advanced technology will turn on its inventor / user , to the determent of civilization , has frightened and thrilled us as readers ! Michael Crichton has been able to scare us to death with his action packed visions of a future where bacteria , viruses and DNA cloning turn against the human race . Having read almost all of his books , The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic stand out as master pieces of technology run amok . Unfortunately Prey does n't ! It is n't that the premise lacks timeliness - nano - manufacturing is becoming a very realistic process . It may just be that I know very little about diseases and the cloning of DNA and a lot about micro - machines . Working in the area of software agents that " swarm " within computer networks and learn through group experience , we humans can make the " software " only so smart . Building micro , self powered , flying devices that can monitor air quality or send video feeds back to remote " observers " - not controllers - are moving out of laboratories and into field testing today . But , we are far , far away from the premise of Prey . Crichton has moved from industrial fantasy to science fiction in Prey . Yes it is exciting - it is a good airplane read . But , it is not at the level of many of his other books . I await his next .
4 #### This is defenitly one of Crichton 's better books . I read it while traveling from Buffalo NY to El Paso TX , which was about 8 hours . To me the end seemed a little forced which is why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 . Up until then it is a defenite page turner that will keep you guessing and anxious to read the next page . It has some scientific mumbo jumbo but defenitly not too much to turn off those of us who are n't that scientifically inclined . Of course that 's just my opnion , I could be wrong .
4 #### As per usual , Michael Crichton takes a top that he is currently interested in ( nanotechnology in this case ) and weaves an entertaining story around this central theme . Better than Crichton 's last book ( Timeline ) , I quickly got through this story and was n't disappointed in the slightest bit . For all Michael Crichton fans I would recommend " Prey " and I think you would find it a good , albeit light read . If for nothing else , Crichton 's meticulous research into the field of nanotechnology is worth the price of admission alone and the backstory is better than I expected it to be . * * * * RECOMMENDED
5 #### I have been a long term fan of Mo Hayder , especially since her wonderful Jack Caffery series . Tokyo is a stand alone , and a powerful one at that . Grey , a damaged and shy young woman , arrives in Tokyo not knowing anyone and with no where to stay . She is on a mission to find the owner of a piece of film that shows the famous Nanking Massacre and the atrocities that occurred . Along the way she meets a mysterious man who appears to be squatting in a run down home with two delightful Russian expats , and she is invited to stay . They also help her find a job at the smoky hostess night club they all work at , and she meets a wealthy businessman who appears to have eternal youth and who may have the answers she seeks . Tokyo is a gritty , urban tour of Japan and all its deep , dark corners . The characters and settings were all intense and smoldering , sending images of smoke - stained , dimly lit rooms and bare , bruised skin . An image of Scarlet Johansson lying on a bed in pink underwear , gazing out at the lights and alleys of Japan comes to mind - that casual indifference to the world .
5 #### Mo Hayder is my favorite female author . This person can do no wrong with her books . This book deals with a time in history , pre WW2 , I 've been interested in . Empire of the Rising Sun , a Spielberg film , also touches on this time period . The film is great , so is Mo 's book . I 've always been amazed just how fast Japan industialized . This island country attacked not only China , but the USA ! How ? ? ? ? ? The book gives us a peek at two western cultures that are , back then , very very different . Tensions continue between these two countries as we see in our present news . Reasons for this tension are certainly touched on in " The Devil of Nanking " It reminds me that the humans of our earth , then and now , are possible of performing horrifing acts and deeds . Mo Hayder , some how , reveals this nature in an unequaled manner .
5 #### A good read . Very different from her detective stories , and infomative about the Nanking massacres . It 's especially interesting given the current saber rattling by China and Japan .
5 #### An English girl in her twenties , nicknamed Grey by a fellow patient in a mental hospital , finds herself in Tokyo in the 1990 's in search of a rumored video that is said to document an unspeakable act that took place during the Massacre of Nanking in the 1930 's . Her quest leads her to Shi Chongming , a survivor of that massacre . The book alternates chapters between Grey in Tokyo in the 1990 's and Shi Chongming 's journal of what happened in Nanking in 1937 . This book has been highly recommended to me time and time again by two people that know me quite well . For some reason , I waited until now to pick it up . Maybe I was afraid it would n't live up to the hype they created . It started off rather slow in my opinion and I was wondering what all the fuss was about . Before I knew it , I found myself picking it up every free second I had . This is not your typical suspense / thriller novel . There 's not a lot of action . The story builds slowly , but it 's brilliantly done . The ending is surprising . Even though part of me expected it , I was still shocked . This book is n't for the faint of heart . It 's haunting . It 's perverse . It 's sad . It 's creepy . Most of all , it 's unforgettable .
5 #### I found this book very intriguing and most enjoyable . It is well written and a Wonderful story of very tragic times
5 #### Mo Hayder always writes an interesting book . You think you know the direction she 's going and then she takes you somewhere completely different . Original , sometimes odd , usually very disturbing stories . They always feel real and authentic . Her ability to know when to withhold and give information is remarkable . I 'm extremely impressed by this author . The Devil of Nanking is suspenseful and disturbing . She creates an uneasy , almost dreamlike atmosphere , filled with dread and peopled with memorable characters .
2 #### Ugly , poor , bad , and strange , the other two novels by Mo Hayder were brilliant . Not this one ! This is a bad crap , and not fascinating . Not recommended . The sample is enough .
5 #### The strongest part of this book is the fast paced action . I found the science almost boring(maybe because I have done computer programing ) , but the plot line and action are better than Crichton 's newest book State of Fear(also a great book ) . I could not read this book fast enough . I was yelling(in my mind)at the characters to run faster , get out of the car , do n't trust him , etc ... The book is now available in paper back and well worth the $ 7.99 it costs .
4 #### Indeed it is a scary thought : killer nanoparticles that swarm and devour anybody in its path . The novel is about nanotechnology , but it deals also with the evolution of atom - sized robots and the computer intelligence that drives them . The word " Prey " , which the book is titled , refers to the program that gives the killer swarm its instructions . It is a really good read . Crichton has a way of weaving together science fiction and the terrifying consequences of science 's alleged misuse into a really good story . If you are totally new to nanotechnology , " Prey " is a good , albeit fictitious , introduction . Another winner from Michael Crichton .
2 #### Interesting premise , but so formulaic that Crichton 's real motivation to take this straight to the big screen becomes transparent . Michael , do n't let us down . Remember your roots and Andromeda Strain .
1 #### This book is , sadly , one of the poorer scifi stories I 've ever read . From cover to cover , it is filled with inane , trite convoluted plots and annoying unrealistic characters that take us on a whirlwind trip to nowheresville . Some less discriminating readers may enjoy this type of airport drivle , but I was rather tunred off by it . Anyone with a desire for any type of realism in a novel would be forced to ask several discriminating questions about the story . Why do these supposedly brilliant scientists act like territorial adolescents ? Why are there only 5 workers in a billion - dollar nano - manufacturing plant ? Why is the first hundred pages dedicated solely to the main characters 30 - something midlife problems ? Why do books like this always turn into zombie stories ? If you want to waste 5 bucks on a laugh , by all mean buy this book . Then destroy it .
4 #### Crichton certainly lives up to the thriller label with this book . I listened to an audio version , and I was completely hooked from start to finish . Jack Foreman , our protagonist , is an unemployed ( for reasons not his fault ) computer programmer who gets called in to help solve the problem of a biotechnology company producing something in the desert . The something turns out to be a human - made technology that learns , reproduces , and is exceedingly dangerous ! Lots of twists , turns , and red herrings make this a wonderful ride . Occasionally , I got a little bogged down with the scientific explanations , but those are both the blessing and the curse of Crichton work ( Airframe is another great thriller of his where I had similar feelings ) . I 'm also never quite sure with Crichton how much of the science is real science and how much is ... fiction . And Crichton 's introduction about the dangers of messing with nature felt pretty heavy - handed . I have no doubt he 's right , but it still felt a little paternalistic : if we do n't do something soon , then something like what happened in my novel wo n't be so fictional after all . ( I 'm overstating , but this is the feel . ) Overall , this was a great ride .
3 #### Really 2 stars and then 1 extra one for the fact that I wanted to keep reading and not want to put it down . If you are looking for a book with character depth , this is not the one . However if you are looking for a fast paced sci - fi book about nanotechnology , this is a good book . Not detailed hard sci - fi , but Hollywood sci - fi . I suspect that there will be a major Hollywood movie starring Will Smith as the protagonist based on this move ... oops I mean book . By good summer read by the beach - I mean that you can skim a lot of the book and it will not matter . You can then pickup wherever you left off and continue reading and be enjoyed by the book .
4 #### Why I read It This also turned up on a lot of " the best of " mysteries of the last decade lists . Given mystery is my favorite genre I have been trying to make sure I did n't miss out on any of the good stuff . For the most part I had the top ten covered already except for this and Kate Atkinson below . What I Thought About It Really , really liked this . Had a lot of my favorite things covered like a historical aspect to the story , based in Japan ( love Japanese mysteries ) , English writer , and a solid story to boot . This book explores the idea that people will do some truly evil things and feel perfectly okay justifying it in some belief system . Now we as the average Joe may not be some nasty in our lives , but I see more moderate approaches to this cruelty all the time . Read it in one day it was that good .
1 #### A terrible book . I gave up and abandoned it after 150 pages of its 400 + pages . Most disappointed because I have read many good things about Mo Hayder and she was recommended by friends . But I just could n't get into this book at all . A very boring read . The font size was also very small and difficult to read . That 's why I love my Kindle -- you can increase the font size . If I 'd got the KIndle version perhaps my opinion would be different , but I doubt it . Skip this one . I will give her another try , but maybe one of the Jack Caffery series for which she is most famous . Hope it is better .
4 #### Beware - this book is exactly the same book as " The Devil of Nanking " by the same author . For some reason this book is out under both titles . So , buy either Tokyo or The Devil of Nanking ... ! ! Whichever copy you read , it is excellent . !
4 #### Beware - this book is exactly the same book as " Tokyo " by the same author . For some reason this book is out under both titles . So , buy either Tokyo or The Devil of Nanking ... ! ! Whichever copy you read , it is excellent . !
4 #### Brilliantly written , I was left sitting with the book in my lap for some time after I had finished it , just thinking . Probably though , I should begin with a token warning of how graphic this book is . Some parts will leave you a little sickened to the stomach ; more so because it is based on true fact . The book has two stories running through it , which are as intoxicatingly interesting as the other . The first , we are introduced to a young woman who travels to Tokyo trying to discover the truth to what she has believed she has read . She has been told she is crazy , and that no such thing occured , yet she is desperate to find out for herself and prove herself right . The second story which runs along side , is of a young japanese man and his wife , and their life before and during the Nanking invasion . The two stories meet up horrifyingly towards the end , and melt into one . You suspect , perhaps , where the story will end up ... but there is still a surprise waiting . Brilliant characters , and excellent historic references . Best of all the Hayder books I have read yet . Could n't put it down .
5 #### I think other reviews have already covered all the good points . Just wanted to add 5 stars to the count as this was my first time to read a Mo Hayder book and it was good . Really good . Could not put it down good !
2 #### While the technical plot and science were interesting , the lack of any real human emotion among the characters was something I found to be disconcerting . Without giving away much of the plot , I found a lack of realism in the effects that friends ' and long - time colleagues ' misfortunes had upon the hero , Jack , as well as upon each other , not to mention the lack of emotion about what was occuring to spouses and children . This , to me , was such a major shortcoming that it made the whole experience unbelievable and unsatisfying for me as a reader .
5 #### Nano - bots have been written about a lot in science fiction novels . Even if you hate science fiction , this book will change your mind . The only thing I can say is AWSOME ! ! ! On the positive side it got a great science fiction story and purple babies . On the negative side in the beginning it focuses to much on his marital problems .
3 #### The plot was good and the science was very interesting . It was way too predictable though and lacked any surprise at the end .
3 #### Jack is a computer programmer at a very high level , married to a computer scientist , Julia . After losing his job , he becomes a house husband , caring for their three children and puzzling over the strange changes that have happened to his wife since she became the sole breadwinner and even more immersed in her work than before . Her attitude to Jack and the children becomes strangely out of character and when he is invited to join her firm in a laboratory in the Nevada desert , she is involved in a car crash and put out of action temporarily . The firm is involved with creating a state of artificial life in the form of nanoparticles , micro robots which are self reproducing through the consumption of the decaying flesh of humans and animals . The creatures swarm like bees , are intelligent , virtually alive and can not be destroyed . While Jack is there at the laboratory , Ricky , the head of the project , directs the swarm to destroy some of the working scientists , who are killed and absorbed into the swarm . Julia reappears , totally in cahoots with Ricky and trying to kill her husband . This kind of futuristic sci - fi is n't my usual reading and frankly I find much of it terribly hard to understand . What I DO know is that the possibility of any of this sort of thing happening scares the socks off me !
5 #### One of the best Crichton books yet ! Absolutely no complaints at all ! Suspensefull , riveting and original plot . The writing was so vivid , that as I turned each and every page I could n't help but visualise the story in my mind . Like all his books , the underlying supportive facts and attention to detail immerse the reader so intently that he ca n't help but believe that he is part of a real life experience . If you Like a little science fiction coupled with todays ' cutting edge nano - technological advances , with a lot of mystery and a little drama , this book is for you ! ! A guaranteed movie blockbuster if it goes to the cinema ! !
5 #### Jack Forman , a stay - at - home dad has a problem . His wife , a scientist and psychologist appears to be cheating on him . But is she really , or are things quite what they seem at the Zymos plant ? I really enjoyed Prey- I especially found it refreshing that the main character was a stay - at - home dad . This role - reversal was fun and refreshing . I especially LOVED the first 3/4 's of this novel . The ending seemed .... Rushed , and I felt that Jack did n't seem to care that much for his wife . Also , I never really understood the ' swarm 's motivation . ' I would 've liked to have understood it better , especially in regards to Julia 's involvement with it . How much control did the swarm possess ? Overall , this was a superb book that kept me on the edge of my seat ! I sincerely hope there is a sequel . We never did find out why the sprinklers did n't work !
5 #### I usually take months to finish a book . This book I finished in under a month and loved every minute of it . This was the first Michael Crichton book I have read and was surpised to find how he can go into enough detail that I a computer programmer did n't feel he was making up complete nonsense but yet felt that non - technical people would get the same level of depth and meaning from his words . He 's a talented author . I thought I would find this book a bit of nonsense , but instead I caught myself quickly wrapped up in the story . He throws hints around and lets you feel like a genius by figuring somethings out yourself which keeps you reading further . I do n't want to spoil this wonderful book for anybody , so all I will say is if you enjoy suspense or mysteries definitely check this one out .
5 #### I read this book several years ago and I still think it is one of the most original novels to come out in recent years and certainly unusual . Not for the faint of sensibility but fiercely unique , the author addresses an infamous historical event in all of its horror ( the rape of Nanking ) and skillfully brings it into modern Japan and into an amazing story . Truly worth reading .
4 #### I read this book which I bought over a year back . My copy had the title " Tokyo " . I enjoyed the very " noir " atmosphere of the book , which hid a dark secret . However I must say that I guessed quite soon the plot . I must read more books by Mo Hayder . She is definitely a very good author .
5 #### This is a well - crafted , well - paced thriller . The author presents an exciting and mysterious scene from what amounts to the middle of the story ( ala J.J. Abrams ) and then proceeds to tell the story from the historical and present timelines , skipping between the two for parallel development and increased tension . The plot revolves around Grey , a young woman with an obsession and motives which are all her own . Grey is driven by a need to prove that Nanking was the site of a horrible atrocity by the Japanese in 1937 , despite an almost total lack of evidence that anything occurred . In pursuit of her obsession , she encounters a person she believes survived the atrocities , as well as a cast of seedy Tokyo fringe characters and members of the criminal underworld . Give this book a read .
2 #### I was excited to pick this book up from the library . I had heard some good things about it . Well it started off slowly and I really began to realize that there was an immediate need for an abridged version . STAT . If there was one , it was my fault for overlooking it , however even that was not enough to help me . The main character , GREY , is so hopelessly annoying that I immediately did n't like her . Her characteristics are so extremely so pathetic that I ca n't find anything redeeming to her . Then there is the second main character , Shi ( something ) I did n't even care enough to remember it . The book intertwines his feelings during the invasion of Nanking through recounts of his diary and the present day actions of Grey in her attempt to see a miserable and disturbing video of the atrocities of the Japanese soldiers during the Nanking invasion-- which Shi was witness too . It gets more and more long winded and annoying and soon I just felt like I had wasted several days of my life reading this travesty . I will NOT be reading any more of her novels and I am very very glad I picked this book up at the local library . Good grief and good bye .
3 #### The previous two novels that I read by Hayder were quite disturbing , so I expected something equally dark here . The book failed to live up to that same level as in&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Birdman / dp/0802146120 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Birdman</a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Pig - Island / dp/0143113607 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Pig Island</a > . There were a few scenes that gave me chills and turned my stomach , and the plot had some very surprising twists , but ultimately , the pacing felt surprisingly slow . And by the last page , the book did not feel concluded . It ended on an unfinished , and rather unsatisfying note . The narrator 's motivations were not properly explained , and Justin 's role in particular was left hanging . I liked Hayder 's distinctive style and her turn of phrase , but it just did n't meet my expectations for her work . I will , however , continue to keep an eye out for this talented author - but I would n't recommend introducing yourself to her work in this volume . It just was n't her best .
4 #### The unexpected great ideas are crammed into this book written by the author of Jurassic Park ! For example , a unique strategic airborne camera could be made of the nano - technology machines of molecular level , which could be formed by making it a " swarm " in the air . The swarming and the unswarming will be made possible by their own free will by the autonomous allocation of the roles of various camera parts . In the war time it will be a very convenient tool to use because that camera ca n't be shot down and could be disintegrated into the molecule level parts in such cases . It is seemingly an ultimate machine , but it has a fatal weak point of being easily swept away by the wind ! The responsible research company ca n't get the necessary fund raised from the sponsors because of this fatality , and begins dangerous wrongdoings ... . Like other Crichton stories , the uncontrolled swarms go out of the laboratory and start attacking people as a kind of monster . By the strenuous efforts of mankind , the danger is finally gone . But was it really exterminated ? This is the usual Crichton endings ! We can expect the sequels to this story and the movies as well .
3 #### Prey is a novel about the possible consequences of nanotechnology going wrong . Crichton very cleverly describes how nanotechnology , molecular biology and computer technology ( AI ) will fuse in the nanotech world . He does careful research and the arguments are presented by the protagonist who is a project manager in the nanotech world . The book describes how one application of nanotech will be based on a Predator - Prey system , which will be modeled upon animals in the real world ( like a colony of ants ) . Such systems may not have a central intelligence ( like humans or a company ) but instead have collective intelligence based on simple rules . It is a largely a tightly written book , quite well paced and the characters are real . The appendix at the end provides references to seeming interesting material on nanotech - both technical and social from scientists working in the field . Every book I have read written by Crichton has been interesting and I have learned something from it . But then it is just my bias towards someone who is a Dr from Harvard and very well travelled ? In any case , I enjoyed it and look forward to the next one !
3 #### Let me tell you , I was so hooked the first 50 or so pages , I could n't stop reading . I thought this whole " nanotechnology " business was fascinating ... I could n't get enough of it . As you 're reading , you yourself will imagine dozens of horrific ways this sort of stuff can go awry . Thinking back to " Jurassic Park " , he does something similar : a cutting - edge , just - in - the future technology that has one obvious but still quite interesting focus ( dino - DNA cloning ) , and then takes you on a rollercoaster that springboards from that initial conceit . This book has that locomotive start . You learn more and more about these swarms and computing technologies that seem ominous and powerful and mysterious . Then , and fairly suddenly , the plot devolves into a sub - standard B - movie scenario . You know , a group of people , isolated , with " something out there . " Ooh ... run outside ! Quick ! Get back inside ! I dunno ... I just expected so much more from the way this novel opened ... something more disturbing , I guess . It seems that the misuse of what Crichton describes could go so way beyond what is conjured here , this seems slight . Halfway through you 'll think this might make a cool movie . Then you think , well , maybe a TV mini - series or something . Now I think ( hope ) this is merely a prequel to something far more sinister and suspenseful .
2 #### After reading most of Crichton 's books , it gets hard not to compare the latest effort against the previous books . With such books as ' Jurassic Park ' , ' The Andromeda Strain ' , and ' Disclosure ' it makes it difficult to always hit a home run . This book takes on the dangers of dealing with nano - technology . Crichton is such a good writer that he grab the reader and keep them captivated sometimes in spite of the subject . I think that is a great skill and still enjoyed the book . The story did lose me a little regarding the mass of nanobots and their life like abilities . It is hard to believe some of the books imagery . This may be partly due to the limited knowledge regarding nano - technology . If you a Crichton fan or some looking for an enjoyable easy read , then this book is good . However , if you 're looking for Crichton 's next great novel , I did n't think this book stood up with the rest .
5 #### For the past 15 years , Jack and Julia Forman have been the quintessential Silicon Valley couple . Right now , though , he 's at home with their three kids . Unemployed at 40 , with his job search reaching the six - month mark , Jack attributes his wife 's increasingly long hours at her own tech - firm position and her changed behavior when she is with her family to - what else ? - an affair . Both his attorney and his psychologist sister encourage him to wake up , smell the coffee , and get ready to deal with Julia 's exit from his life . But that 's not it . That 's not it AT ALL . This could actually happen , if people with the right combination of scientific expertise and moral stupidity make crucial discoveries and ignore long - term consequences in favor of solving short - term problems . Crichton sells his readers on believing this , consistently , as PREY 's plot builds through the book 's first half and then explodes into action . After that it 's a wild ride , indeed . This one 's ending , like that of JURASSIC PARK , provides an errie mix of resolution and future menace . If you 're a techno - thriller fan , PREY is not to be missed .
4 #### Michael Crichton is undoubtedly one of the great popular novelists of our time , and Prey is a fine work of craft by a fine craftsperson . In the classic vein of reluctant hero meets technology gone mad , Prey leads the reader on a thrilling adventure . The writing is crisp and clear , and filled with suspense . As always , much of the science sounds much better than it really is , but that , I suppose , has to be expected . The less you know about computer science and nanotechnology , the more you will be impressed by Crichton 's way of blending bits and pieces of real science into something monstrous . The fact that none of it could ever work out that way does n't matter . It probably never stopped anyone from loving the " Frankenstein " story , ( or any of Crichton 's other techno - thrillers ) , and should n't stop you from enjoying Prey . That said , if you are looking for a story that is as original as the technology this story tries to portray , you should look for an author who has n't yet established such a distinctive style , and perhaps one who is not so studied in the tried and true techniques for writing a hero 's journey . I found myself flashing back to Jurassic Park constantly while reading Prey . So in a way I got to read two stories at once , one new , and one well over a decade old . And I loved it .
5 #### After reading Pig Island by Mo Hayder , I decided to pick up The Devil of Nanking as it seemed to be her best selling effort prior . Given the reviews , I expected it to be creepy and macabre , and boy was it ever . Any book that revolves around war atrocities , torture , and self - mutilation can hardly be light . The main thing about this book that makes it stands out though is Mo Hayder 's ability to evoke a different place , time , and being . Her descriptions of modern Japan and 1930s China are rich and atmospheric . Her main character is disturbed , disturbing , and hard to empathize with , but her voice is pure and unsettling . You wo n't forget this book easily .
5 #### I could n't put this book down . It was not what I expected . A UK girl , most of the time in Tokyo . Even so my connection to Nanking is only slight - my friend Keith Digby a film producer has written a film script on the subject - which he has not yet let me read . This book though was something else - I found the writing compelling - and driven . I could not find time to eat or work - I needed to know the awful truth . And then I reached it and felt strangley empty and yet fulfilled . Wonderful book .
5 #### I am still thinking about this book days later , written beautifully , and at the same time so creepy and informative . Fascinating characters , atmospheric , and kinda nasty- a truly great read .
5 #### A masterpiece , plain and simple . Gray is a wonderful character whose motivations are as touching as they are disturbing . The ending is both shocking and moving . I 've never read anything like it . Mo Hayder has become an instant favorite .
2 #### I came to this book with high expectations from Jurassic Park , Disclosure , and Timeline ( which was a better book than movie ) . I was dissapointed by this book , I expected it to be better than it was . It is readable , but I did not get a good feel for the characters and the storyline , while interesting on the surface , suffers from what is best described as " limp " telling . It just did n't grab me as most good books do . I ca n't say that it will do the same for you , but this is my opinion .
5 #### The book , Prey , by Michael Crichton , is a science fiction novel . With nano - parts moving like swarms , and attacking people , this book was very interesting . Michael Crichton is a brilliant man when it comes to Science Fiction books . The story was great making readers never want to put the book down . Prey was so good , you thought you were actually with the people in the book , doing what they were doing .
3 #### Prey is a fast paced science fiction thriller based on a biological nanotechnology mistake which results in the potention end of life as we know it on earth . Michael Crichton has done it again , and produced a novel which is bound to become a movie some day . Similar in structure to Jurassic Park , Timeline , and The Lost World , Prey contains characters , situations and events that were just made for the big screen . In parts , the novel dragged on a bit - with long winded scientific descriptions that I found myself skimming over . These were usually sumarised in layman 's terms at the end of the two pages of scientific mumbo - jumbo with comparisons to simple things like corn . There are a few references within the novel to a ' black cloak ' , which is never explained - and I still do n't quite understand what it was all about . Overall , it was not a bad novel - but it 's not Chrichton 's best either . Good for someone wanting a fast read , with a positive message about the consequences of messing with nature .
3 #### This sci - fi thriller follows a computer programmer as he confronts a terrifying organism which his company unwittingly created when experimenting with nano - technology and micro - biology . This first person narrative is somewhat boring in that the main character ( the narrator ) is not at all an intriguing personality . He seems cold ; he does not express the emotions warranted of man in his situations and thus does not evoke the corresponding emotions in the reader . As usual with Crichton there were also several explanatory gaps in the science behind the story . When Crichton runs into a difficult spot regarding the scientific particulars he tends to rush the narrative past that point or else he simply ignores it . Thus the reader remains unsatisfied for the remainder of the story and feels somewhat cheated for the sake of simplicity . A particularly large gap in this story comes when the organisms interact with certain characters . This event is central to the plot , but Crichton never attempts to offer even a theoretical explanation of how or why this complicated and unlikely event takes place . Nevertheless , the story moves along a fair pace throughout most of the novel , and Crichton 's style , while not remarkable , makes for an entertaining read with enough suspense and intrigue to get you through a cross - country flight . In comparison with Crichton 's other novels which I have read this ranks near the bottom , better than Airframe but not as good as Timeline , Sphere , Andromeda Strain , or Jurassic Park . I give it a C.
3 #### This author wrote books about real science . These books tended to have what a story needs namely belivable charecters and a resonable plot . There is none of that here Jurrasic Park was great and the Lost World was O.K but after that Crichton 's work began a slide . Its still going on I just pray that it does n't get any worse . I 'm reading The Andromida Strian agian please take my advice and give this one a miss .
5 #### My jatlagged mind must have led me to include this book , under the blander latter title of " Tokyo " , among my purchases at Narita upon departure after a whirlwind 1 - week professional tour of Japan . Little did I know what a gem I would discover on a sleepless journey back to Atlanta ! Impossible to put down , " Devil of Nanking " exposed me to Mo Hayder , an author of impossibly tormented powers of description and plot - building . After " Devil " , I moved quickly to her only other two books available , " Birdman " and " The Treatment " . How I suffered until I got my hands on " Pig Island " this year ! I am currently savoring the novel as if it were the finest foi gras , to be rolled over and swallowed one morsel at a time ... not for the faint of heart tho ' ; I am 47 and have had to sleep with the lights on !
5 #### Where has this book been hiding for all of these years ? This is one of the best thinker - thrillers that I have read in a long time . It had all of the adventure , history , asian thought , insight , intrigue and horror of a good detective novel . I liked the characters , especially the imperfect , yet gutsy , Grey , who stops at nothing to gain the truth . Mo Hayder has the courage to write about subjects that most folk just hide their heads in the sand over . Haunting ? That is putting it lightly . I ca n't wait to read Pig Island.--Doug Setter , author of : One Less Victim
1 #### I 've read both of Mo Hayders previous books and was deeply troubled by this latest one . First off I thought it read terribly and was just a piece of crap . It felt like it was a contrived effort of trying to write a novel built around her travels to Tokyo ( she was a hostess like the main person in the novel ) . Worse off though I was deeply troubled by the book - I thought it was such a sick piece of work and really stuck in my mind for all the wrong reasons . If I could give it zero stars I would have ..
2 #### What can you say about a writer whose central image for her novel seems to be . . . ( I 'm sorry but I think it 's fair to warn you , and you 'll get it anyway in the first few pages ) EVISCERATION AND DISEMBOWELMENT ? If you do n't like graphic depictions of viciously administered death , just stop now and do n't put yourself through the ugliness . The two stories of Nanking in 1937 and Tokyo in 1990 are cleverly intertwined . The young woman , Grey , obsessed with proving that her own desperate act has had a true historical antecedent , is a well - imagined character . And yes , there is a moral difference between doing something destructive in a state of ignorance , and doing other destructive and cruel things for pleasure . But any fool can tell the difference between the two main characters , with their lyric sorrow and their obsessed mission to rescue the dead , and the depraved ghouls they fall among . The suspense in the novel depends almost entirely on prurient interest in horrible acts . And horrible as the atrocities are , the idea that we have never heard of such goings on is , alas , pitifully absurd . There 's something a little meretricious at the bottom of this barrel of scary times .
5 #### Mo Hayder is one of the finest contemporary writers . Her books take you squirming and screaming to places you have never been . With a literary style , her damaged , but persevering , characters explore the depths of evil . The Devil of Nanking is an excellent novel . If it 's possible , the book is even more gruesome than The Birdman and The Treatment . But this is an author who tackles the most difficult subjects . The Devil of Nanking is a fast - paced thriller into the exotic lands of Tokyo in the 1990s and Nanking during World War II .
3 #### I liked the first two books ( Birdman and The Treatment ) a lot . I was really hoping for even better things in this book but found it a bit long and convoluted . The writer was aiming for a dark conclusion as is the norm with her work but this time I think went a bit into the realms of fantasy . The book did n't ring true to me . The story is really two stories in one that blend into one at the end of the book but the problem lies in both stories gradually unfolding and when one chapter ends , you start the other story for another chapter . I was continually left wanting to continue with one story or the other , and the conclusion was boredom .
4 #### The author did an excellent job writing a book that combines an excellent history of WWII China , the Rape of Nanking , and a look at modern Tokyo Nightlife . I was surprised that the writer was able to pull off combining all of these things , but she did and did it well . The book was hard to put down . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I bought this book on recommendation of a teacher for my teenage son . He loved it .
3 #### I was not impressed with this book . I 've been a long time fan of Michael Crichton , but recently his books have not been that great . I thought he was at his best when his subjects were science and medicine , so I had high hopes for Prey . Unfortunately , the first third of the book was mind - numbingly boring ( and NOT suspenseful . Everything was foreshadowed so much that you 'd have to be a monkey not to pick up on it ) . When the action finally got going , it was inconsistent and outrageous . Instead of this book , I would recommend some of Crichton 's older novels , such as Andromeda Strain , Jurassic Park , Sphere , and Congo ( do n't let the horrible movie versions affect your enjoyment of these excellent books ) . I think Airframe is good as well .
3 #### I bought the hardback of this because I was looking so forward to a new Crichton novel . I had read Airframe , Timeline , Jurassic Park , Andromeda Strain , and Sphere and I loved them all . Prey is a mediocre novel , that just does n't hold up to Crichton 's past works . The subject of nanotechnology sounded like it could be interesting , but I found myself fairly bored with it the whole time . Crichton did n't " sell " the story to me like he did with his past ideas . I did n't feel as if it was plausible at all , possibly because the concept of nanotechnology is so new that no one really knows much ab out it . Looking at all of the works he cited , it looks like he did a LOT of research into his subject . So why are there so many problems with the logic in it ? It seems like Crichton has become somewhat formulaic in this book . The book clearly mimics many of the themes , plots , and cliffhangers from Jurassic Park , but lacks the overall threat of 60 foot tall T - Rex ready to rip your throat out . It 's hard to develop suspense in a novel where the main threat is microscopic ( although it was done in ' Strain effectively , so why not here ? ) If you 're a fast reader and want something for the weekend , it 's not a bad read , but I would n't suggest spending any time or money on Prey .
3 #### Typical to all of Mr. Crichton 's works is a great twist on reality that hits so close that it almost could be , and thank goodness it is n't ! The story was intriguing but unfortunatley it was a bit predictable . I knew what to expect about one hundred pages before the end of the book .
4 #### I liked the evolutionary ideas presented in Prey because I also had a lot of time to reflect on them as I read the book while camping . The theories and evolutionary discussions were far more interesting to me than the plot or the characters , I 'm afraid . The climactic scene of the final destruction of the mutant strain , while not the end of the book , is reminiscent of the take down of the raptor nest in Jurassic Park . Crichton , keep writing and I 'll keep reading . You 're very good , but ca n't win 'em all . One book that really interested me by the same author was Eaters of the Dead . I really enjoyed that .
4 #### Devil of Nanking was an impulse pick from the library 's " new " shelf and my first Mo Hayder -- definitely not my last . China and Japan fascinate me anyway , but Hayder raised the stakes considerably when she wove history and psychology into an unforgettable tale . Dark , disturbing , haunting , riveting , and sometimes breathtaking . The Nazi Holocaust was the visible side of a horrific inkblot , but on the other side of the world the Nanking Massacre is the unseen half ; here the atrocities are commited by the Japanese on the Chinese citizens of Nanking in 1937 . These inhuman acts serve as the springboard for Hayder 's bizarre cast in 1990s Tokyo . And what a cast ! The main character , Grey , is so off - kilter , you do n't know whether to hug and protect her or smack her back to reality . But you will care about her . The " care " you 'll feel for a few of the other characters is the care you take to stay far far away from them . Hayder may have done too good a job : I 'm not convinced they live only in this book 's pages . You 'll need a high tolerance for gore and revulsion ( not my favorites ) , but the Devil of Nanking was certainly worth the upset . I learned a lot from the hisorical aspects and am left to ponder the psychology involved . The thriller aspect was really riveting -- almost impossible to put down . Very imaginative , quite satisfying , and probably not to be read in public as your reactions might draw attention !
5 #### I prefer non - fiction to fiction but a friend introduced me to the earlier works of Mo Hayder ( Birdman and The Treatment ) and I found them well written and interesting . Gruesome and disturbing as well . I find my reaction to her ugly tales to be the same fascination I find in the works of Shirley Jackson . I have always willingly gone wherever Jackson pointed me and I find with this latest book , I do that with Mo Hayder . I 've read the Iris Chang book on Nanking and found it very enlightening . Mo Hayer 's book reaches me emotionally on this topic the way Chang 's did intellectually . I have now relented and eagerly added Mo Hayder 's name to my list of authors to watch for new offerings . I know I wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### I would have to aggree with previous reviewers here who say that Prey is not as good as some of Crichton 's previous novels . However , it 's just as supsensful as you 'd expect from this author ; I could n't put it down . Part of what makes the book so suspensful is that the " villian " - the swarm of faceless nanoparticles - is one that is unfamiliar to us . Some of the scientific explanations get a bit dry and hard to understand , but it 's easy to skim through those parts and move on back to the story .
3 #### This book was entertaining enough . Not as great as Jurassic Park , but still worth reading . That is if you are like me and know nothing about Nanotechnology . He tells you just enough so that you are interested and want to keep reading but does n't drive you crazy with details . Apparently if you know more about nanotechnology and other technologies that are written about in this book , you may not like the book as much . But really if you are geeky enough ( I mean no offense , by using the word geek ) to work with this stuff in real life , then you should read non - fiction and not fiction books dealing with this subject .
1 #### This book will corrupt and ruin any reader 's genuine interest in virtually every subject it touches upon . Nanotechnology , emergent behavior , flocking , none of these are explained by more than an anecdote , something which mass - market commuters that serially absorb Crichton 's work will no doubt embrace , but which revolts anyone who notices that what they are reading is , from an informational perspective , running on fumes , and from a literary one , nothing more than a series of deus ex machinas , logical non sequiturs , and third - grade level prose . I personally resent his using emergent behavior , a really interesting subject for me and my network - theory brother , when he could have locked anything into his tired , childish formula , like the ring around my bathtub , which has more imagination than he does .
5 #### Michael Crichton is one of my very favorite authors . I absolutely LOVE all but two of his books . The thing that really gets me about Crichton is the science of the things he writes about , right now most of it is impossible , but if you think in terms of technological advances , in the next ten to twenty years or so , all of this stuff seems plausible and even likely . This one is no different . It is frightening , because as technology , specifically nanotechnology moves forward , something very like this could happen . I said COULD , not that it will . Read this book if you like Crichton and have any sort of interest in science and technology . It will make you think .
4 #### Prey is a chilling thriller about microscopic machines produced by nanotechnology . As a scientist , I was aware of nanotechnology , but I thought Crichton was stretching it a bit , until the latest issue of Science landed in my mailbox with a multipage discussion of rapid advances in nanotechnology . Thus , Prey is a great piece of suspense based on a fast - moving area of science . The plot is simple . Jack Forman , an unemployed , computer expert suspects that his wife , a vice president of a high - tech firm , is having an affair . He gets an urgent call to consult with the same firm , and the suspense begins . The company has developed microscopic particles , half - machine and half - living matter , for covert , military observation . But the nanoparticles have gotten loose , swarmed , and learned to survive by feeding on animals or humans . The company , located in the desert , becomes besieged by the particles . Things get worse in a satisfying manner . My only criticism is that Crichton felt the need to intersperse explanations of nanotechnology throughout the story , interrupting its flow . But that is a small problem in an exciting tale that is well - worth reading .
3 #### Prey deals with very difficult and technical subject matter . The story is about nanotechnology , a subject I 'm certain we 're all familiar with .... NOT ! The book starts out grabbing you around the collar and it holds on tight . It 's a mixture of mystery , as well as comedy , as we are introduced to our characters and what is happening in their world at this moment . There is a wonderful crescendo effect as the story evolves from ' getting to know you ' to ' Oh my God , what is happening ? ' What I did n't like about the book was the fifty or so pages in which the author tried to explain exactly what nanotechnology is and how it related to our plot . It was alot like reading a VCR manual . Hang in there , it gets better . Once you are thoroughly confused as to what nanoparticles do and how they originate , and by the way , I do n't think it was information we really needed to enjoy the story , the pace kicks into high gear and does n't slow down til the last 6 pages or so when our author wraps it all up . This book would make a great movie , and it was a really good book , minus the techno talk that was really confusing and too techno for us common folk .
3 #### I am a huge Michael Crichton fan , especially of his books . They are much better stories than their movie counterparts ( Jurassic Park is a perfect example of that ) . However , his last few books have purely been written for the screen . " Prey " , sadly , is no exception . This story is about nanotechnology and how the creators get overrun by the monsters they create . Like in most of Crichton 's other books , it 's very fast - paced supported by science that is somewhat controversial . It begins very quickly and has few slow sections , especially if you are interested in nanotechnology . However , it eventually slows down and ends anti - climactically . The characters were flat and could not keep the story going once it reached its end . Sadly , Crichton has written another book designed to become a movie screenplay . If you read it as such , you may find it interesting . It is fairly fast - paced and can be read in a few days . However , if you 're looking for a story to stand on its own merits without the underlying pretense of " this is going to become a movie " , then you 'll be disappointed .
1 #### I agree with Robert Graves ' review ; this book is unusually out of character for Michael Crichton in many aspects . I was particularly astounded by the level of scientific balderdash in this book . It was incredibly painful to read what Crichton passes off as " science " . In one case he talks about the nanobots eating out the carbon substrate from memory chips but not processor chips . Excuse me ! What makes processor chips so different from memory chips , that nanobots only attacked memory chips ? And if that was n't bad enough , memory chips happen to be made of SILICON ! Where in the hell do you get carbon from a silicon wafer ? Then there 's the case where he explains how the swarm will be tagged with radioactive selenium in a glucose mixture . I 'm sorry , this is a basic technology in radioactive tagging that was completely befuddled . Crichton has a degree from Harvard Medical school . There is no excuse for getting these principles wrong . Yes , this is certainly fiction , but boy , the science in this book is not based on any Earth science I know ; it 's all in Crichton 's own universe .
2 #### ( a few spoilers here ) This book is not a true exploration of Nano - technology and it 's possibilities . It is a science - fiction mind - number in which the villian ( the ferocious little nano - bots ) have no limits . One second they are starting to recognize shapes , the next they eat a few memory - chips and start controlling human minds . Is this believable ? And as if this lame plot were not enough , the story is chalk - full of flat characters acting entirely obvious . The prose is weak , the dialog is worse . I officially give up on Crichton , Airframe was bad , Timeline was dreadful , and Prey was nearly unreadable . So my advice in a nutshell : if you loved Jurassic Park , you will STILL hate this .
5 #### As thrillers go this book ranks right up there with the best of them ! Mo Hayer does a fantastic job of incorporating actual historic events with authentic locations in Japan , and tying them all together with a story line that just keep giving and giving until the final chapter . The book focuses on the main protagonist , Grey , and her research in to the atrocities that Japan inflicted on China in 1937 . The story , which starts out with a historical tone , quickly changes gears and lets the reader embrace the history and culture of modern day Japan , while somehow always managing to bring the reader back to those historic times in 1937 . Although I would like to say more about this novel , I really do n't want to give too much away . The plot is just that good . Pick this book up . You will NOT be disappointed .
4 #### With a great depth to the characters and a writing style that impresses , Mo Hayder has written a dark and sometime graphic novel that should impress all her fans . An overall good story taking place in both 90 's Tokyo and Nanking of ' 37 . Recommended .
4 #### Mo Hayder does not have much in the way of formal schooling , but she has become an accomplished storyteller with a better - than - average writing skill . This novel is comprised of two stories intertwined to make a shocking whole . First and foremost , Hayder provides a realistic and accurate picture of what the IJA 's ( Imperial Japanese Army ) destruction of Nanking , China must have been like . Then the second story : Gray is a young woman who grew up only reading books -- her parents did not have a television , nor were there other young people around while Gray was a child . She was reared on books ; and somehow , a rare and terrifying account of Japan 's genocide in Nanking comes under her intelligent adolescent scrutiny . She becomes obsessed with viewing a film that shows torture and murder perpetuated by a perverse monster in the IJA -- the Devil of Nanking . She finds help in Tokyo from the elderly man who brought the film back from China back in late 1937 . Eventually , we as readers get the portrayal of Nanking 's destruction through snippets from the elderly man 's journal as well as by information Gray gleans while privately investigating as a " hostess " in a Tokyo nightclub . This was well worth reading . I miss Jack Cafferty , the detective who stars in her first two novels ( Birdman and Treatment ) but Mo Hayder is not an author to be ignored . Her works are shocking and unique , and they deserve attention from anyone with the courage to stomach their contents .
5 #### Be careful when you start reading this wonderful mystery , because you likely wo n't be putting it down for hours . The story shifts back and forth between 1990 's Tokyo and the 1937 rape of Nanking , China , and the action is captivating in both time periods . Not to give away any plot lines , but the characters from both time periods combine strongly in the concluding portion of the book . If you have n't read Mo Hayder , take a chance on this haunting , unique novel . You wo n't be sorry .
4 #### The book makes one shudder at the thought of Nano Technology . Even though this is a cool technology that will make our lives far more eventful ... rather like living in Star Trek era .... Mr. Chichton used his suspense to the ultimate limit in this book and makes it quite difficult to put the book down . He has a knack to discuss and explain high end technologies in simple and easy terms that are easily comprehensible by an average joe ... I can not wait for his next title to come out ....
2 #### Frankly I was disappointed . Michael Crichton takes what could be an intriguing and potentially apocalyptic idea ( predatory swarms of evolving nano - machines on the loose ) and boils it down to week - long crisis that involves relatively few people . It 's easy to see why the author is so popular : There is nothing remotely challenging about his prose , which is easy to skim and even easier to digest , with plenty of pretentious techno - babble thrown in along the way . There 's also a mild indictment of corporate irresponsibility and carelessness here , but none of it 's enough to make you care very much . This novel is tailor - made for a two - part ABC miniseries , and that 's about it . I loved " Andromeda Strain " as a kid , I was thrilled by " Jurassic Park " .... but I found " Sphere " too puzzling and " Timeline " really weak . After reading " Prey , " I think I 'll just give Michael Crichton a rest . But for anyone really intrigued by the concept of nanotechnology , I would HIGHLY recommend " Blood Music " by Greg Bear .
1 #### Mildly entertaining rubbish , about a group of nanotechnicians locked in a lab in the Nevada desert , and the scary things that can happen if we get carried away with science , and ourselves . I got about half way through the story , and ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAPPENED ! ! ! I do n't often tear up a book , and throw it in the trash can , but I with this horrible excuse for a thriller ! Everyone knows that science , with no moral boundaries is likely to go haywire , and undo the good it was intended for , so why bother reitterating the obvious ! ABSOLUTE CLAPTRAP , AND NOT WORTH THE TIME , OR MONEY IT TAKES TO GET IT , AND READ IT ! Pick up , and read Timeline , instead , a much better book by Crichton !
2 #### Have you ever read any other Michael Crighton novels ? If you have , do nt ' expect the same suspense , well thought out action sequences , and character development that are usual fixtures in his works . Prey seemed like it was thrown together hastily . It 's as if he did n't have a lot of time to get the book together , and this was teh finished product . The dust cover is pretty snazzy though ...
4 #### Crichton is the master of showing us the dire consequences of man playing God . This book is a thrilling ride , and superbly gives us a glimpse of some of the possible dangers of both nano - technology , and computers that can think and learn for themselves . This book is fast - paced , exciting , and seems ready - made for conversion to the silver screen . I would n't be surprised at all to see this one become a movie , or at least a cheasy television mini - series .
4 #### Jack Forman used to run a program division at MediaTronics , supervising a group of young and talented computer programmers . After Jack 's division 's source code had been stolen , his boss Don Gross put him in charge of security . But then Jack found out that certain " irregularities " took place at MediaTronics and , advised by his attorney Gary Marder , resigned from his job and became a " househusband " . Now he is coping with all the chores at home , looking after his three children . Jack 's wife Julia works for Xymos Technology , developing technology in what the company calls " molecular manufacturing " or nanotechnology . Since she is the vice president , she is not often present at home . The plot starts picking up when Julia is severely injured in a car accident , the circumstances of which seem rather mysterious . At the same time , Jack is asked by Tim Bergman to take a consulting job with Xymos . But when Jack joins Xymos at an isolated , sate - of - the - art facility in Nevada , he soon discovers that the technology the company is doing research on is far from flawless ... Perfect suspense combined with lots of technology , this is one of Mr Crichton 's most entertaining novels . George Wilson reading " Prey " is a remarkable performance . I highly recommend this audiobook .
2 #### I have enjoyed quite a number of Michael Crichton 's books ( such as Jurassic Park , The Lost World , and Timeline ) and I have to say that Prey is one of the worst that he has written . Jurassic Park / The Lost World is based on the history of dinosaur and in a way , it is a believable science fiction . Timeline is based on Quantum Machanic and he has done quite a good job in making it as believable as possible . Being an avid science reader myself , I find that his interpretation of Nanotechnology lacking in many ways . The story is full of flaws and at times , I really wonder why has n't the author done more research on the subject matter before taking on the challenge ( He has spent many years in preparation of the Timeline story according to him ) . Nevertheless , if you look not too deep into the details of Nanotechnology , it is quite an engaging storyline . Hence , the 2 stars .
4 #### ' Prey ' has all the hallmarks of a Michael Crichton science fiction novel : thrilling suspense wrapped in a story that stretches the imagination to the breaking point . It has the feeling of a good film screenplay rather than a novel , but to be fair Crichton is a good writer . Both his prose and characterizations are fine . ' Prey ' takes us into the near future when nanotechnolgy ( building microscopic computers ) and biotechnology converge to a nasty effect . Silicon Valley scientists fail to understand the true menace they 've unleashed and it is up to the spouse of one of the dirty players to save the world . Crichton spends a fair amount of time trying to explain how all this horror is plausible . I did n't buy it but at least it 's not preposterous . And the suspensful storytelling had me going . Great fun ! Bottom line : shamelessly enjoyable piece of science fiction fluff . Recommended .
5 #### I put off reading Prey because I was afraid it would be overly technical , dealing with nanotechnology as it does . But Crichton has made this more of a people story with characters who are very appealing . Jack is a former software engineer . He is now a stay - at - home dad with three children . His wife , Julia , is a vice president for a company developing nanotechnology . The reader is quickly caught up in their everyday lives , then strange things begin to happen . This is a fast paced , action - packed story . Towards the end , it turns sort of Stephen King - ish , which I thoroughly enjoyed . The conclusion is non - stop suspense . An exciting and scary read .
3 #### The paperback cover quotes the New York Times Book review in part " Terrifying . . .irresistibly suspenseful . " Indeed , the story Michael Crichton spins has elements of terror and at times the suspense grabs hold of the reader and does not let go . A tale of science run amuck on the tracks of greed and stupidity . Crichton mixes an old formula with new science . The finish is written as if the Crichton has a deadline to meet . Definitely , unsatisfying for a Michael Crichton read . Fortunately , for the reader , a bad Crichton book is better than most other authors seem able to generate on a good day . Reduce your expectations and the book will be satisfying .
4 #### As is par for the course in Crichton novels , human beings have created a new advance in science / technology without seriously pondering the consequences . This time the culprit is nanotechnology ; microcomputers with a malevolent will of their own . Crichton does a good job of throwing together a mix of different characters and the relationships / tensions between them . It was this very tension that compelled me to keep turning the pages . The science is fascinating too . Most of us are familar with the menacing image of the " Terminator " cyborgs which are machines that are bigger and stronger than humans . In this case though , humans are pitted against machines that are microscopic , yet still pose an existential threat to humanity . Crichton 's description of the behavior of the machines relative to humans as predator / prey always made me feel like the humans were being stalked and hunted and kept the pace of the book moving briskly . A few years back I read an article in the Los Angeles Times by Bill Joy , Chief Science Officer at Sun Microsystems , about the advances and dangers in nanotechnology . Prey is a book that illustrates those dangers in vivid fashion and should gives us pause to question the wisdom of rushing forward with computer technology at breakneck speed without adequate deliberation .
2 #### Crichton writes some great books . This just is n't one of them ! This was Jurassic Park with Nanomachines replacing the dinosaurs and it just did n't do much for me . Characterization was poor and after awhile , you get the impression that Crichton has never worked or been around real life people . I enjoyed Airframe because Crichton was RIGHT on about the causes 0f such accidents and the flack that surrounds a crash . I liked Timeline because he did a good job of throwing us into a good time travel yarn , which has not been done properly for many years . I liked Jurassic Park because of the ideas presented . The Terminal Man was exciting . Congo was silly , but still enjoyable . This novel was just really a sorry reason for the death of some trees . It was a waste of my time as well as Crichton 's efforts .
4 #### I listened to this one on four cassettes , over the last week to and fro from work . It was quite a solid story , with the quick caveat that there 's an introduction read by the author . You know that saying , " That guy has a face for radio ? " Well , Michael Crichton has a voice for print . I could barely maintain listening and concentration to his part , and heaved a sigh of relief when he finally shut up . Then the story started - and it was good . Read by Robert Sean Leonard , he gave it a good go ( though often his voice seemed younger than the forty - something hero of the tale ) . Jack is a " did the right thing and got fired " tech fellow , who specializes in writing code that mimics natural biological behaviour . His wife is working with a company doing something with nanotech . Things start to go wrong , and what escapes is nano - sized , pred / prey programmed , and self - replicating . Cue the cacophanous " Oh no ! " music that ends each side of each tape ( acually , it 's a horrendous screech that has no place on an audiobook , and should < I > not</I > have been chosen ) , and the slowly rising tension that I 'm used to Crichton providing . If I have any qualms , it 's with the not - always explained abilities of the escaped nanotech , and a somewhat obvious " this is what I think is inevitable , so smarten up , humanity ! " overtone that Crichten might have toned down just a little . ' Nathan
4 #### The future of technology ? A good question . Reading this book you will ask yourself , how far will we go to design machines that we can not control . Though a very quick read , it is not as good as Andromeda Strain . But still will have you wanting to turn the page to see what happens . Our hero in this book is an out of work computer programmer who specializes in animal swarm behavoir . He is now a stay at home dad . And his wife is working on a new start up company desiging nanotechnology devices . He starts to expect his wife is having an affair and accepts a consulting job at the facility where she has been spending most of her time . He finds a lot more going on than he every dreamed . A swarm of nano - sized devices that that have gotten out of control . This time Crichton has nanotechnology go wild . He does a good job of explaining the difficult subject matter so that it makes the book more beliveable to those not familiar with the technology . So if you have liked his other books . Pick it up , and take the thrill ride .
4 #### A very good story , one of Crichton 's best and very thought - provoking . A potent threat -- an " evolving " cloud of nano - particles which act as an organism -- is actually made believable as the book rolls on . On the bad side , the first quarter to a third of the book goes VERY slowly and the protagonist is a whining , somewhat sanctimonious " Mr. Mom " -- basically , a loser . Things change when he gets into the action theatre and changes to a proactive , resourceful person . The ending is a bit far - fetched even with the good foundation in the middle of the book . But , it ought to make a terrific movie ( duh ! ! )
3 #### I expected more because the concept is very interesting . He did not do much with it to make it interesting . There was not enough tension . I did finish it -- it did keep my interest , but it was not a book that I hated to put down . Nor was it a book I could n't wait to pick up again .
3 #### You can read the editorial reviews for the book description . While a very interesting read , it was not very entertaining . Some areas seemed to drag on . For first time readers of Michael try Sphere or Disclosure first . You will not be disappointed ...
4 #### I found Prey to be a real page burner . It hooked me from the first few pages until the very last phrase . As scifi goes , the book is not of the caliber of what are in my opinion the greatest works of scifi such as Dune or the Foundation series , but Crighton manages to consistently produce novels that are both scientifically sound and engaging that echo the long gone era of classic science fiction in which science and not magic drove the plots . As forty year devotee of the genre and a faculty member who teaches a course about scifi , I highly recommend it .
5 #### Having just finished ( on March 27 , 2003 ) BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON by Dean Koontz , which dealt with a more fanciful , but equally enjoyable , depiction of nanotechnology , I was pleased to be swept up again into this pseudo - scientific world via Michael Crichton 's novel , PREY . Invariably , I find Crichton 's novels to be both educational and entertaining , since he explains every technical nuance with remarkable precision without boring the reader . Consistent with his trademark attention to detail , excellent character and plot development , and absorbing method of storytelling , Crichton has achieved another literary success with PREY . The ending was especially thought provoking , albeit somewhat unnerving , causing me to view computer science with a tad more appreciation - AND suspicion .
3 #### I gave this book three stars . Why ? Because , assuming you 've read some prior Crichton novels ( I 've read almost all of them ) and like his " science " thrillers , you 'll either like " Prey " a lot or dislike it a lot , depending on whether or not 500 or so " F " words in the dialogue offend you . It offends me so much I 'll likely never buy another Crichton novel . My two teenaged sons ( ages 17 and 13 ) have seen many of his movies , read his books , and not being overly offended in the past , I blindly purchased this paperback and let two sons , and my wife , read it first . Then my wife comes to me and says , " This is one great story about nanotechnology , but the language is absolutely " terrible " . Belatedly , I then read the book and find she 's right and embarrassed my sons have read it . So : I enjoyed the story . A lot . I 'd give it five stars if it omitted the most offensive profanity ! Whether you 'll like this Crichton novel a lot or be offended will in my opinion , be based on your sensitivity to profanity . So be cautioned .
1 #### Horror and suspense authors can relax ; this book just did not instill fear the way one would expect from author Michael Crichton . It is difficult to feel the sense of reality that is so necessary for a good suspense novel , as tiny nanoparticles of some experiment escape from a quiet lab in the Nevada Desert . These nanoparticles take on life like qualities and chase people around sucking the life out of them . Continually evolving , they change both shape and Modus Operandi with every turn of the page , leaving the reader not quite willing to submit to the usual spine tingler . I read this book in 2 days and could have read it in one if I had pushed it , but it just bored me . I also had the " twist " figured out long before the ending .
3 #### The science behind this is really interesting . It makes my mind soar considering all the possibilities that the technology discussed in this book evokes . However , the plot was predictable , except for a few silly surprises that seemed to have no relationship with the rest of the story - like one of the characters has a car accident for no particular reason . The relationship of the husband and wife depicted in this story is thin , predictable , and boring . Overall the book has a cool premise and a silly plot .
3 #### Crichton shows us the dangers of nanotechnology in his latest novel . In this case , a swarm of nanomachines escapes a military sponsored lab and go beserk as they evolve an even greater intelligence . It 's a really fun read , as Crichton novels tend to be , but I ca n't give this book full marks . As usual , Crichton falls into his usual patern -- a group of scientists or professionals , who by chance are also beautiful supermodels , face the current scientific hot topic , except it has gone terribly out of control . In the process , half of the members die , and those who survive face an ambiguously happy ending which gives Crichton the option to make a sequel . This describes about 90 % of Crichton 's novels , and it describes this one pretty well . Another weak point of this particular novel is that the solution to the problem is presented fairly early in the story , and you have to read through hundreds of pages and witness several pointless deaths before the hero figures it out . Usually Crichton is good at giving you some twists at the end , but in this book , it plods straight ahead to the ending you expect . In the end , I ca n't say this is a great book , but it is an entertaining book . If you have enjoyed Crichton 's formulamatic books before , you 'll probably enjoy reading this one . If you got bored to death reading one of his other books , be warned , this is more of the same .
3 #### The terrors and pitfalls of nanotechnology are endless and far - reaching , and Crichton uses this to good advantage . The frequent explanations along the way , which some have said are dry and academic , to me added to the suspense , making the swarms of nanobots all the more frightening . These nanobots are so real , in fact , that they threaten to overshadow the cardboard characters and formulaic plot ( this science - run - amok template goes all the way back to FRANKENSTEIN ) . The characters are uninteresting and , in order for the plot to move along , they make some stupid mistakes so that the ' bots can get the upper hand ( the main character , in fact , is so passive in the face of deception that he could just as well be sleep - walking ) . Then , at the end , the ' bots make some stupid mistakes for the plot to come to its conclusion . Read it for the science , not the story . This novel brought to mind similar , better , novels : A. A. Merritt 's THE METAL MONSTER , Poul Anderson 's BRAIN WAVE , Dean Koontz 's PHANTOMS , and the novel MUTANT 59 : THE PLASTIC EATERS .
3 #### Overall , Prey was a good read . I found the first half of the book slow , as I am not a computer programmer , nor do I want to be , but I know enough about computers that some of the stuff is exagerated . I also did not care for the endless evolution theories , as even as Crichton points out , 150 years in evolution proved us to be mostly wrong . So why would modern theories be any better ? He just bases a large portion of his book on something I find very controversial and still unproven . The second half of the book , when the swarms are finally introduced , is much better . Still plagued by evolution and distributred processing theories , but non - the - less gripping . A bit predictable , the ' clues ' about what will happen are very obvious . I thought it was worth my time , as I am a huge Crichton fan . His other works , however , are much better in my opinion . But the circumstances were very original ! Whooda thunk - killer nano - bots !
5 #### Crichton 's explanation to the ' untechied ' reader is detailed and instrumental in visualizing the composition of the Prey . Fast paced , with twists and turns ; I stayed glued to the book the entire 2 days it took me to read . He is very detailed , offering the reader a clear mental image of the events as they unfold . I could almost see the nanorobots , feel them while they attacked their prey with calculated intent ... always learning ... and watching ...
2 #### The subject is fascinating and I believe Crichton is right in fearing the technology may go terribly wrong in the future . But I was ultimately unable to suspend disbelief in the last quarter of the book when Crichton totally left the realm of the possible and indulged , for wo n't of honest imagination , in utter fantasy . His bot swarm development and activity make anything in " Jurassic Park " seem like the hardest of proven science by comparison , and it was far - fetched and belied a half - baked understanding of the biologically possible . I was terminally disenthralled with this book and with Crichton as a serious writer . My respect for his work has been badly shaken by his indulgence in fantasy to make this novel work . It was JUST TOO MUCH ! Please , somebody , do this subject justice and produce a credible work of future fiction . Crichton has badly failed the subject .
2 #### Sorry , I know I 'm going to be in the minority here , but I found this book darn near impossible to plod through . Not because of the science ( although any thriller whose chills depend on understanding geometric algorythems is , by nature , going to lose points with me ) , but because it felt so pointless . I found it difficult to be afraid of what amounted to genetically manipulated dust mites . Worse still , there were few chills ( unless , unlike me , you find the idea of the aforementioned dustmites chasing you through the desert terrifying ) , and those few came late in the book ( not to mention felt as if they were designed less for their chill - factor and more for the " wo n't this look cool on the big screen " effect ) . Oddly enough , the book is much more interesting during the opening chapters , when it sticks close to home and gives us a growing sense of dread about what might be happening to the wife and children . Ironically , once we abandon the homefront in favor of a trip to the desert , things cool down dramatically .
2 #### For the first two thirds of Prey , I was enthralled . Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors , and Prey was up to my expectations . Then in the last third , I thought the book fell to its knees . The plot devices were no longer credible , even given the suspension of disbelief inherent to this type of book . My hypothesis is that Crichton was thinking of the big screen when he wrote this book . He put in things that will make great scenes with modern special effects , but that just do n't work in print .
3 #### I liked the story , but like many of Crichtons other novels , it ends quickly . I felt like I was watching ER . The story builds , with no character development , and then ends quickly ... I do admit , I will read his next book and love his ideas ....
3 #### Standard boiler plate Crichton . Again we 've got some new interesting technology that escapes our protagonists control and wrecks havoc , teaching us all that there are some things we should n't meddle with . Frankly we 've read this all before . From Crichotn and countless other suspense stories . After reading the first 30 pages or so I got that awful feeling that I could tell exactly where the story was going , and dag gone it if I was n't right . Crichton 's writing is competant but it felt like his heart was n't in the project . There are two suspenseful moments in the story but they could have been more suspensful if we actually cared for the characters involved . All in all it looks quite obvious that Crichton writes Hollywood screenplays more than a novels these days . Crichton 's biggest mistake is relating much of the ending right at the beginning . By having the main character tell the story to us as if it all happend a few months ago we 're alerted to the fact that he 's surrvived . In a paragraph before the novel proper starts , we 're even givin a brief glimpse of how the story winds up . These techniques strip much of the suspense and intrigue from the story . Prey is a very quick and easy read . A McDonlad 's hamburger when I expected a more nutrious meal from this gifted writer .
4 #### Michael Crichton ai n't Shakespeare , but he turns out a pretty good techno - thriller . In " Prey " , irresponsible scientists develop a swarm of microscopic " nano " robots that gets loose and turns mean . Hijinks follow . It 's a quick and exciting read . Just as " Jurassic Park " looked at the darker side of genetic engineering , so does " Prey " introduce us to nano - technology and give us reason to approach it with caution . You could do worse for beach reading than Crichton 's latest thriller .
5 #### This is a great book . By about page nine or so it will start to get under your skin and itch ( bad pun intended ) , and you wo n't be able to put it down until you finish it . Crichton has really put it all together here , a tight well worked plot , a really terrifying threat , and just the right touch of erotically served up evil to really give you the creeps . The Thomas Dolby song " She Blinded Me With Science " will make the perfect opening score for the movie .
3 #### As usual , Crichton goes over the top a bit , but that being expected , I was n't disappointed with this story , it was a quick read and a page turner and basically a good story . The ending had enough of a twist that it was n't entirely predictable and the characters were interesting enough . It wo n't come as a surprise to any that read Crichton that the story involves a situation that could never really happen , but is grounded in enough science and theory to challenge the readers imagination . This story will undoubtedly be turned into a movie , there is an element of horror possible here and if the movie is done right , it could be pretty scary . I recommend this to any that enjoy science fiction / fantasy type quick reading novels that have n't yet tried out the authors work . If you already like his work , this book is not the mistake that the novel Jurassic Park The Lost World is and is not quite as fantastic as the novel Timeline , if you have any interest in the world of nanotechnology it will be thought provoking at the least .
5 #### Imagine in one week how planet earth could fall victim to swarms of self - reproducing nanorobots . These micro - flying machines are individually dumb , but making use of the " predator prey " algorithms , form highly intelligent swarms that can attack the existance of the human race . The drama is gripping in a classic " who do you trust " scenario . Can Jack trust his wife Julia ? Is she having an affair ? Is she even his wife anymore ? Can Jack trust the other workers at the plant ? Can Jack save his family ? You sort of know the end from Crichton 's introduction , but you do n't really know it , which makes for a very interesting book . The last day stretches out and you feel like you are reading the dramatic events in the time it took for them to occur . This book is an easy read , but filled with unnecessary profanity . Nevertheless , I highly recommend it .
1 #### Like the others who hated this book , I 'll be brief . I consider myself a fan of Crichton and I 've read many of his books . Airframe was one of the first books I literally could n't put down until I 'd finished it . But this junker Prey is not worthy of the author and makes me question whether he even wrote it , or just signed off on a ghost writer 's lame attempt to follow the Crichton formula . In one word , this book is AWFUL !
3 #### I think over the years I 've probably read 3/4 of Michael Crichton 's books ... and have liked most of them alot . This book is fast paced and entertaining but I did n't feel that it stacked up well next to a number of his other works . I had the feeling that it was rushed to meet a deadline and , as a result , lacked a certain originality . The Nano - technology as villian concept is great and seemed to be a natural for Crichton but so much of the book was outright derivative of other stories or films . There are scenes in this book that are right out of " Aliens " and John Carpenter 's " The Thing " . Maybe the biggest problem for me was the relationship between Jack and Julia . After 2 whole weeks of tension in the marriage and 48 hours of suspicion of infidelity Jack 's ready to toss the 14 year relationship away without a single conversation with Julia nor even a question as to why she 's behaving oddly ? This is the Mother of his 3 kids , including an 8 month old infant . I have a deeper relationship with my Mailman ! As we get closer to the end , and it appears that Julia may be the story 's central villian it appears that Jack could care less . Talk about marriages made a few feet lower than Heaven ! I kept asking myself ... who 's less human here ? The characters or the Nano particles ?
3 #### I 'll keep this simple : The journey is much more interesting then the destination . This book has a facinating premise , more character development then the average Crichton novel , and is facinating for the first 400 pages . However , the climax of the novel , is a letdown . Chichton seems so intent on " blowing us away " that he opts for a silly , cheap plot twist that is telegraphed in the first 50 pages ( I kept hoping Crichton was teasing and had something more interesting planned ) . I like the book ; I just wish that it had lived up to the promise of the first half of the novel .
2 #### A really good novel illustrating the potential danger of nanotechnology would be a welcome addition . Prey is not that novel . Here 's the plot : Somewhere in the Nevada desert , a hi - tech corporation has been experimenting with nanotechnology swarms . Of course , the little critters get loose and begin evolving into fierce predators . Jack Foreman , an expert in designing computer programs that mimic the behavior of swarming animals , is called in to deal with the swarm . Jack 's wife is a Vice - President at the firm , but she has n't clued Jack into the big picture . I wo n't give it away , but the swarm evolves so rapidly - and unbelievably - it 's difficult to sustain belief in the storyline . Actually , it 's impossible . Adding to the disappointment are B - movie characters that blur into the background , their tracks sinking out of sight in the sand of a sluggish plot .
1 #### I 'll keep this review really simple and to the point : I found this book to be far fetched and just plain silly . Save your money ! ! !
4 #### Michael Crichton is a master of limited disaster stories . Small areas and small casts combined with high tension and sometimes the possibility of greater impact . Such is the case with this one . An out of work programmer begins to suspect that his wife is having an affair . But at the same time other strange things begin to happen at home . As the questions about his wife 's behavior begin to become to much , he is offered a job straightening out a programming problem at his wife 's firm . The problem concerns nonotecnology and using microscopic robots for imaging . Some of the nanobots are loose and not responding to controls . Their fail - safes seem to be inoperative . The devices are evolving and they are dangerous . The story encompasses about a week with most of the action happening in a single day . Like Jurassic Park , the story is told from an after - the - fact perspective so some of the tension ca n't quite build . There are a few unanswered questions that seem like the answers were edited from the final draft ( i.e. the black cloaks ) but it still reads well . All in all , if you enjoyed Jurassic Park , The Andromeda Strain , Twister , or other similar Crichton stories , you will be hooked on this book .
2 #### Well , maybe not crap , but its nothing spectacular , either . Once again Michael Crichton brings to life a story that he once could have written so much better . Little tiny robots have been invented , and they 're smart . And they can learn . And adapt . And ... do things that you d only expect in a horrible John Saul book . For the last 50 pages I kept expecting the alien 's spaceship to come out of the clouds and end it all . Not that this book was about aliens ( at all ) , but it had that crappy sci - fi feel to it . I 've no doubt that nanotechnology could become dangerous if used carelessly , but the scenarios Crichton imagines border on the ridiculous . This is the kind of book you buy at an airport , and when you 're finished you leave it on the plane so the next person can have it . In some cases people do this to share a good book with a perfect stranger ; in this case you 're doing it 'cause its just not worth carrying around . ' Prey ' will pass the time , no more , no less .
2 #### I only purchased it because I was in downtown Phoenix for a conference and could n't find a real book store within walking distance . I was stuck with the hotel 's W.H. Smith and the NY Times bestseller list ( blech . ) This book is a fast , pleasant read . The early portions were quite promising , evoking a feeling of creeping doom . I also liked the sprinkles of social commentary , particularly the discrimination fathers face in custody proceeedings . However , the plot quickly became utterly -- and I mean utterly -- predictable . The only suspense left for me was seeing just how long it would take the main character to figure out what I had figured out , and details of the resolution . The last portions degenerate to a long " beat the unstoppable monster " sequence . Might make a good movie on the Sci - Fi channel . Save your money . Or , use it to buy Charles Pellegrino 's " Dust " .
4 #### First off , let me say that while I am not a horror fan , this book could easily be fitted into that genre . Add a star if you like your horror plausible . As far as the negative reviews , maybe they should go back and re - read the book . The main character is indeed a programmer who is now too old to write code . That does n't mean he is n't a programmer any more . As far as the rabit scene , which seems to be a major stumbling block , well rabbits are small creatures , humans are larger . Get over it . As far as the explanations , all I can say is , if you read any Tom Clancy you are used to long explanations . If you read the explanations you understand why , maybe not immediately , but further on in the book . This is called setting up a plot device . Those people who did n't understand why the main character was called out to the site did n't read the explanations , they only skimmed them . If you want to have a no - brainer read , go elsewhere . If you want to wonder about what is being cooked up in labs behind closed doors , and how it can affect the human race , this is the book for you . Go ahead , skip the latte at the coffee shop and spend the cash on this book instead , you wo n't be sorry .
1 #### I ca n't add too much but I am not buying any more crichton books 1 ) written as a screenplay , stupid poorly developed characters 2 ) lack of continuity throughout . I bet nobody proofread this . one minute the progonist is too old to write code , and the next minute he calls himself a programmer . He managed the developers of this fiasco , and he is the only one who can fix it . Why ? Why do they want to fix it ? They do n't ! Why do they bring him in ? ? ? Because he is the only one who can kill them all ? ? ? Why are their only 5 people in a huge manufacturing complex . Why does a complex with super high level clean rooms have no airtight suits , but plenty of thermite . Why could the infant swarm suffocate the rabbit but forgot how to suffocate the hero after it had evolved into the super - swarm . If the wife was infected , why did she shower to get off the assemblers . Why were the people who added memory , solar batteries and intelligence to the heros stupid program that did n't work not the ones called to fix it . Ohhhhh ! ! ! This is a bad book . I admit finishing it , but I feel used . Crichton needs to stop thinking dollar signs and find a few new gimmicks . At least the babbling Jeff Goldblum character who wo n't shut up is missing , but Crichton takes up the slack by making the first person narration be the harbinger of doom . Bad Bad Bad ! ! !
3 #### Crichton 's latest novel ( as of this review ) is not his best by far , but still provides hours of reading entertainment if you can suspend your disbelief . I may be spoiled after having read Timeline by him , but this one did n't quite show off his usual writing genius . No spoilers here , but think of this book as Jurassic Park on the microscopic level . The main group of characters is trapped in a secluded area . If caught , they 'll be killed by the predator . How can they get away ? Does this entire plot sound familiar ? Crichton appears to be writing a screenplay in book form in order to re - capitalize on the Jurassic Park popularity of former years . Sure it is fun and entertaining , but I was hoping for something a little more original .
2 #### This is not Michael Crichton 's best work . An interesting idea , but not very well fleshed out or expanded . I could have done without the scenes with the kiddies and I found it hard to believe the hero ever loved his wife . So who cared if she became infected . PREY they do n't make a movie .
4 #### I have always been a huge fan of Michael Crichton . He is , in my mind , the most versatile and interesting writer of popular science fiction I know , and he is always able to make his stories so multidimensional . Sphere was many things : a suspenseful tale , a look at a perilous environment , and a fascinating metaphysical examination . While this book is more like Congo than Sphere , it still has plenty of cutting - edge science and more than enough suspense to keep anyone reading . The story goes something like this : Jack Forman , former software manager and current stay - at - home dad , is baffled by his wife 's recent odd behavior , suspecting she 's having an affair . When he is asked to assist in the project his wife has been working on , he jumps at the chance , but his notions are soon dispelled as he discovers that there are intelligent swarms of nano - organisms on the loose . The book centers on the efforts he undertakes to stop these micro - baddies , who are able to adapt and come up with new tactics at an alarming rate . The writing is excellent , as always , and Crichton is certainly on top of his game in writing a suspense story . It is a story that also asks interesting questions about the future of artificial life . Ultimately , it does n't become greater than this , though . Sphere was philosophy , Disclosure was social criticism , and those were his best books . In any case , it 's good to read another elegant page turner by this very capable writer .
4 #### The formula for " Prey " is vintage Chrichton - a new wonderful technology is invented . Then someone makes a shortcut in order to meet some deadline or to make some investors happy . Then things start to go horrible wrong . Death and mayhem follows . Here nanotechnology is the new cool technology . The mistake is putting your designer organisms out in the wild , free to breed and evolve . So , the plot is pretty predictable , but somehow it does n't matter as suspense builds . Finally , you do become desperate to know how our hero is going to make it out of the mess . Its all so believable : Surely , nano organisms designed by humans are just waiting to happen . And surely , they will by accident be released into the wild . Making us believe this is n't hard , but there is more than just one dumb nano robot in the Crichton plot . Actually there are a whole lot of nano robots ! And they are not dumb , as they coordinate their intelligence in a swarm . Working together to accomplish some goal . Each robot programmed to follow simple rules , but with emergent clever behaviour at the swarm level . Really , really clever swarm behaviour . But , Ok , as things gets more complex , and more scary , there are a lot of weak links in Crichtons chain of reasoning . But what did you expect ? Afterall , it is a work of fiction ! Pretty good work I would say . -Simon
4 #### You could say that this is a modern day version of the classic THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN Michael Crichton wrote many years ago ( also a fine movie ) . But here , instead of an alien virus menacing humankind , it is a villan of humans ' own making , nanotechnology out of control , which in this book consists of microscopic machines on the rampage . The neo - Luddites should love this book . I suppose that , considering the vast potential and sheer power nanotechnology will probably give humanity someday , I can understand that we should be wary of this technology , proceeding with caution and with appropriate controls in place . Judging the novel solely in it 's literary merits , I found the story engrossing and well written , although at times a bit far - fetched . Plot and character development were superb , it will keep your interest , and it is an excellent addition to the genre of disaster novels . In addition , interspersed throughout the book are little tidbits on different aspects of science , you can learn and it is not overbearing .
3 #### Michael Crichton is a great writer . Prey grabbed me in the first chapter . But by the end I was just glad it was over . I read this book in a single day .
3 #### This novel was my first exposure to Michael Crichton . Though I had seen several of the movies based on his books , I had never read him before . The book was an extremely easy read ; I devoured it in one day . I liked the conversational style of his writing and the vulnerability he portrayed in his Everyman hero , Jack Forman . The pacing was well - done and the urgency of the situation kept me engrossed . However , parts of the story seemed awkward and his writing seemed sloppy in places . The story was told in first person , but Jack gave information that he could n't have known ( since he was n't in the room , etc . etc . ) . It seemed like Crichton was writing this one for a movie , since most of the flaws in the writing would not have mattered in the staging of a film . I thought this was an enjoyable thrill ride , but not a particularly impressive or creative piece of popular fiction .
5 #### Yet again Michael Crichton crafts a tale so compelling that you kow it could simply just happen . In a world dominated by technology it is only a matter of time before some bright spark scientist starts looking at Crichton 's novels as a blueprint for world destruction . In Prey he tackles the subject of nanoparticles and also computer intelligence with horrifying results . A simple computer program that helps systems problem solve is used to devastating effect when combined with swarms of nanoparticles allowing them to evolve independently of their creators , once released into the wild they become the hunter and their creators their prey . Not the easiest of books to read as it contains plenty of technical knowledge but it is written with such conviction and so finely crafted that you can forgive him his forays into the " technical stuff " and just sit back and enjoy a thoroughly enjoyable ride . Dealing with human relationships almost as much as the horrifying results of man 's arrogance it is a real page turner and you will not be able to put it down , not even long wnough to wonder if that itch is really an itch or part of the swarm invading you .
5 #### Before I read this novel by Mr Michael Crichton I had never heard of the word nanotechnology and much less nanorobots . It is a very exciting book and yes this is not very different from the other Crichton books like Jurassic Park or Timeline and the Andromeda Strain , it still a book about science gone wrong , but so what , as long as it 's exciting and not boring he should keep writing books like this . Michael Crichton cand do no wrong , I have read all of his books and all of them are great .
1 #### ... Tasty , but not particularly filling . As one reviewer noted , this has the unmistakeable feel of a movie treatment . I had thought that the novels that movies were based upon were supposed to be richer in detail , full of character development and those characters ' interior worlds . Crichton glosses from one scene to the next , introducing just enough detail to keep the plot afloat for the next action sequence . No , I was n't expecting Shakespeare , and yes , Crichton does bring up some interesting ideas about the dangers of nanotechnology and biotechnology . ( Not worthy of a three - page bibliography , usually reserved for scholarly works , but interesting nevertheless . ) Still , this book seemed rather less imaginative than anything by Philip K. Dick , and I found myself not particularly caring about whether the wife would live , or whether the kids were OK , or the end of the world , or anything like that . The characters were two - dimensional , hurried , barely even sketched . Great idea , haphazard execution . Perhaps Mr. Crichton 's editors are too much in awe of the author - as - moneymaker to offer him constructive advice on the basics of creative writing , but I 'm sure there are good community college programs toward that end if he 's interested .
4 #### Hand - in - hand with Crichton 's oft - used " do n't mess with Mother Nature " theme is the " do n't arrogantly mess with science we ca n't fully comprehend or control " theme . " Prey " has many of the same interesting elements that made so many of his previous novels so fascinating and gripping , but " Prey " also suffers from a weak and unsatisfying conclusion . I still enjoyed reading the story , but the chase scene at the conclusion felt like something from a generic TV movie . Not that a ( possible ? ) movie version would fare any better . The Crichton novels that have been turned into feature films saw a lot of their scientific and moralistic edges softened considerably . Too bad , too , because the films were much less interesting than the books as a result . But is " Prey " worth a read ? Oh yeah . And I anxiously look forward to his next book , whatever it will be . By the way , Crichton is a pretty decent film director , too ! ! Check out his films : Runaway ( w / Tom Selleck and Gene Simmons ) , Coma , The Great Train Robbery ( w / Sean Connery ) , Westworld , and Looker .
2 #### I used to really like Michael Crichton , and I still * want * to like Michael Crichton . Unfortunately , _ Prey _ is not his comeback novel . It feels like he is in such a hurry to get the books out these days that the parts of them are just sketched into place . The idea of the nanotechnology baddie in the book is timely and clearly well - researched . The ending , chase scenes , and all the associated stuff aroudn the relationships , could all have been left out . Too bad .
3 #### This book * should * keep you racing for the ending . But then again , you 've got nothing to show for the ride . The ending is rather choppy and leaves the feeling of " Well ? ? And ? " The use of first person was a bad idea . For example , when the narrator is in danger , you know he has to live . Because there would be no book without the narrator , he has to survive . That really cuts down on the suspense . One thing that really annoyed me about Prey was the continuous way of explaining things that ordinary people not involved in biology / nanotechnology / genetic fields would n't know . First , Jack ( the narrator and pseudo - hero ) has a little chat and speaks in indecipherable language for about a page and half . Then another page and a half explains what the heck the two characters were talking about . And so it continues : Dialogue - explain , dialouge - explain , etc . The plot itself has huge holes and is very Stephen King - esque . A mystery / horror / this - is - going - to - happen - someday - and - your - job - is - to - prevent - is prevalent throughout the novel . OK , but not the best Crichton out there .
4 #### This one rated four stars simply because it had me staying with it late at night to get to the ending . It is about swarms of tiny robots , molecular robots , swarming around , and up to no good . I bet you think the good guys will win in the end , the bad guys will die , the children will probably be alright . The children in this book , I do n't know if you root for them to be alright or to die a grisly death . They are about the most annoying children I 've ever seen in fiction . You want to smack one of them , and the other one , well you want to smack that one too . One thing I do n't get . The swarms of tiny robots can be blown away by a strong wind . So why not attack them with battery - powered Vornado fans ? Or politicians . In any event , the story gets quite silly when the swarms of molecular robots start taking the shape of the people in the story . I guess it would get some oohs and aahs in the movies . But it is ridiculous . All in all , it is a knockoff of Invasion of the Body Snatchers .
4 #### This is a novel a lot like andromeda strain in various ways : there are really tiny creatures out to get the heroes , there is a secure environment that is the only thing stopping the tiny creatures from getting the heroes , a couple people die pretty brutally in between the first and last pages , and the book has the most retarding ending , which should n't even be called an ' ending . ' With that said , as with all the Michael Crichton books I have read ( which is almost all of them ) , I really enjoyed this one ( minus the ending ) . If you want to do something kind of fun , read this book , and then read * Dean Koontz 's " By the Light of the Moon " . You could pretend it is a sequel to Prey with new characters and a new location , and that would make up for the ending of Prey . * You will know why after you read both books
3 #### In the first third of the book , Crichton delivers a fun read particularly with the emerging technologies and future possibilities of combining genetic and software engineering . Overall I liked the book , but by the middle , I tired of the the same old teritory that I had just visited a chapter back . Chapters flow by all taking place with the same cast of characters in the same setting asking the same questions . The book labors in the middle to try and tie up loose ends and reveal character traits both good and bad . The ending feels as if the editior got tired too , and told Chricton to end it and move on to his next effort . Worth the read but invest in the paperback and save your dough for a more " library - worthy " hardcover . - B.C.
1 #### I ve never submitted an Amazon review before , but if I can stop just ONE person from reading this piece of trash , save just ONE person from suffering through the clumsy prose of this wreck of a novel , then its worth speaking out . I used to look forward to a new Crichton novel every couple years . But I think Crichtons novels have gotten progressively worse and more unreadable as the years have passed . And just when you think he s hit rock bottom ( i.e. : Timeline , Airframe , etc ) , along comes Prey . Prey is so awful I ca nt even describe its awful awfulness to you . I m just hoping my repeated use of the word awful will convey how awful this novel truly is . After finishing Prey , I decided I would never waste money on a Crichton novel again . Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read . I only wish that there were a 0 star rating available .
4 #### I 've read almost all of Crichton 's novels and all have been excellent , Prey is another one of those novels . Prey unlike Airframe or Disclosure deals with alot of scientific facts concerning the new area of nano - technology ( little mini - machines ) It this novel our hero , Jack Foreman is a computer programmer turned house husband who is out of work do in part to the internet bubble burst . Jack is assigned a job to figure out why a large quantity of nano particles are unable to be controlled , what then happens is these nana - particles start to terrorize the lab and it 's techs . It is a quick enjoyable read , but there are a few flaws in the story line that I had trouble with , like why would a programmer go out and risk his life to stop this swarm of nano particles ? I also think the subject matter is pretty complicated for those who are n't too technical . Yet , this is not O'Henry , there is no truth to be seen here , it is a fun fast read and very interesting at the same time . I thought the ending was very suspenseful and nicely done . Just an aside , I can see how Michael Crichton 's ugly divorce made it 's way into this novel , by painting jack 's wife as a heartless , power loving B!$@H , I think he was trying to send a message to her .
3 #### Four nanostars which means three normal stars , at the beginning the book will keep you interested , but as you are reading it gets slower and slower , and as all of Crichton 's books the end is to long , it could be shorter and a little bit better , another thing is that all the book could be real , but the end is just a fantasy , he could think better on how to end this book . Nevertheless Crichton is a very good writer but is very difficult to write always very good books .
4 #### One of the strength of Michael Crichton 's is that he writes about such a broad range of subjects , and most of them well done . This is another example . That is truly amazing to me . How does he do it ? ? I 'm not sure exactly how likely the little creatures in the book would come to pass , but I could n't help think back to the nanites in Star Trek . I do feel very sorry for Julia . But yes , this is another one that read like a movie script . For that matter , though , did n't a couple other of his books read that way too ? But maybe he is one of the few authors I can forgive for that . Rising Sun , Jurassic Park , Disclosure all have turned out to be good movies and books . Prey has great movie potential too . But he definitely has my respect . Who else can write about Japanese companies , dinosaurs and virtual reality and space virus ( Andromeda Strain ) , etc . , with such aplomb ?
1 #### This book reminded me why I do n't read fiction very much . Although I am not a literature snob , I find much contemporary fiction to be kinda dime novelish , ( I created a new word ! ) with the exception of Crichton , whose work I have enjoyed since the old Andromeda Strain days . This particular book reminded me of s Stephen King book - Crichton starts to tell a perfectly good story , then , not knowing how to end it , tacks a ridiculous ending on it . If you absolutely have to read this book , either check it out of the library , borrow it from a friend , or wait for the paperback to come out . As a side note , I was very disappointed with the quality of this volume in general - pages raggedly finished , with ink blots partially obscuring the text . Really lousy quality for a hardcover - I have seen few paperbacks printed so poorly .
3 #### This is more sci - fi than I was expecting . Not really my cup of tea but interesting concept .
2 #### Heard the taped version of PREY , Michael Chrichton 's latest thriller . . . this one is about an experiment that has gone terribly wrong . . . a cloud of nanoparticles -- micro - robots -- has escaped from the laboratory and has been programmed as a predator . . . every attempt to destroy it has failed . . . geez , does this sound familiar ? The problem is that it is ; i.e. , in some respects , it reminded me of JURASSIC PARK . . . it also reminded me a bit of a Dean Koontz novel . The beginning was interesting , in that it dealt more with humans and their problems . . . but about halfway through , it fell apart completely -- at least for me -- and I do n't even have a desire to see the inevitable movie version . Robert Sean Leonard 's narration was n't bad . . . however , at then end of each tape side , there was the most annoying indication that I 've ever heard ( telling it was time to turn the tape over ) . . . it was most grating , almost like the sound of somebody taking their nails and scratching them down a chalkboard . . . methinks I 'll even write the company about this !
5 #### I do n't know why I read his books anymore . Maybe I still hope for something great , like Andromeda Strain . Take Jurasic Park , but substitute " little " for " big , " and " nanomonster " for " dinosaur . " There you have it . You could figure it out by about page 10 . There is one positive though : it was way better than Timeline !
3 #### I have always liked Crichton and his work , but I was disappointed in Prey . He is either churing out the books too fast just for the money , or he thinks his readers are stupid . Most people familiar with Crichton are intelligent enough to understand - in a layman 's way - the science behind his work . Otherwise we would n't pick up his books . But in Prey he spends too much time explaining the science and technology , which is n't that new . Scientists and other writers have been talking about and writing about nanotechnology for a long time . Even old Star Trek fans will recognize the plot idea of nanos - gone - wild . I had this book figured out from about chapter two , but pushed through it to see if I were wrong - but I was n't - very boring . However , if you have a teenager in the house who likes science fiction , then he / she should like this . I used a basic formula and found the reading level to be about grade 11 - 12 , so a wide and novice - science audience would like this book . I hope that Mr. Crichton gets back to some serious writing in the near future and actually produces something that challenges us .
4 #### I enjoyed this book . It 's classic Chrichton : salvation in a utility closet ; science in the service of profit ; last minute deus ex machina from a helicopter ; and pragmatic protagonists . You can almost see the characters ' hair blowing in backlit Spielberg way . Cue John Williams music score .... What surprised me was the slice - of - life beginning of the main character : a whistle - blowing , down - sized , computer - geek , stay - at - home dad . Then we get what Chrichton does best - explain science and technology in a compelling way . In a nutshell , it was good storytelling .
2 #### Michael Crichton again writes cautionary tale about Tech ( Nano - bots instead of Dinos this time ) pushed too far . Predictably it lashes out and must be thwarted by the protagonist . He is writing same old plotline with the same stock cardboard characters . Still he places just enough background and science information to make it passable until the last half of the book . Then he jumps over the line of willing suspension of disbelief and is then relegated to silliness . This same book written with a more subtle hand could have been chilling . He makes nano - bots into a large visible menace . My only thought is he was trying to write the book to be a movie . It might be a great visual but it ruined the book .
1 #### Could n't the whole " problem " have been solved if the people had worn HazMat body suits ? It seems totally improbable even to the layman that you would work with potentially dangerous organisms without protection ! Maybe the characters in the novel should have read Crichton 's ANDROMEDA STRAIN for tips .
4 #### Once again , Michael Crichton issues a foreboding caveat of our damnable future in his latest offering , Prey . This time around , his premonition originates from the burgeoning science of nanotechnology . Of course , as in all of Crichton 's books , man 's selfish pursuit for power , money , and fame consume his antagonists into an all - encompassing quest of self - indulgence . This undoubtedly leads to chaos and man 's loss of control of this powerful , yet arcane , technology . Crichton being one of the few modern authors that I enjoy reading , I have enjoyed virtually all of his books . Prey , although a little less substantive than some of his other books , nonetheless proves to be a fun , entertaining , and thought - provoking book worth a look . Prey , if nothing else , is a page - turner that you will fly through enjoyably in a couple of days .
1 #### nice idea , but I was not able to suspend my disbelief . there were too many opportunities to call for help , and the reasons they did not , even though they ( the characters ) seemed to comprehend the nature of the problem , were just too stupid . I could not get beyond that , unfortunately . Crichton may need a new editor unafraid of pointing out boogers in his writing .
4 #### This is the only book I 've read by Crichton . I expected much more . His plot and story lines remind me a lot of Koontz , and that is neither good or bad . This is a fantastic area , but as many writers have delved into similar stories , an author must go above and beyond the norm . I love many of the movies based on Crichtons novels : Andromeda Strain , and Jurassic Park especially . I do believe that between Crichton and Spielberg this would make a killer movie , but the screenplay would have to be better than the book . This book is highly entertaining , I read it in just a few hours ... time not totally wasted !
3 #### I have to admit , on the most basic level I really enjoyed Prey . The subject of nanotechnology is really interesting to me . Neal Stephenson 's The Diamond Age is a great peek into a semi - far future after nanotechnology has become common . Prey hooked me fairly quickly and I read it in less than a week . But as much as I like Michael Crichton 's " technology out of control " books ( Jurassic Park , Andromeda Strain , Prey , etc . ) , as I read Prey I could n't shake this nagging feeling that I was reading the novelization of a movie . The way Crichton described some scenes seemed almost to be screenplay notes to an FX department , and I pictured in my head how a CGI team would implement them . I think Michael Crichton is a very good author , I 'm just worried that he is starting to write books with the intention that they will be made into movies . And that is a formula for disaster .
5 #### This book , which I hope gets turned into another Crichton blockbuster , shows how dangerous things will get in the near future . Michael Crichton says in the introduction to the novel : " Sometime in the twenty - first century , our self - deluded recklessness will collide with our growing technological power . One area where this will occur is in the meeting point of nanotechnology , biotechnology , and computer technology . What all three have in common is the ability to release self - replicating entities into the environment . " This idea that we will soon have weapons that can make copies of themselves is troubling ! One of the last sentences of the novel says : " ' They did n't understand what they were doing . ' I 'm afraid that will be on the tombstone of the human race . " Michael Crichton is obviously warning us that weapons that can make copies of themselves could cause the DEATH of the human race . Powerful stuff ! I actually got my book for free since I am a member of the Lifeboat Foundation . They are taking his book so seriously that they are trying to get some people off the planet before this weapon is unleashed ! A nonfiction book that discusses such dangers is " Our Final Hour : A Scientist 's Warning : How Terror , Error , and Environmental Disaster Threaten Humankind 's Future In This Century - On Earth and Beyond " by Martin Rees . I recommend this book as well !
5 #### I love to figure things out and stayed close , but crashed on a few curves . Tracks right along , deeper and deeper into trouble . The end ties up the beginning . A fun read all the way through .
3 #### This was the first novel I read by Crichton and overall it was pretty good . The concept of nanotechnology is very interesting . I have also read By Light of the Moon by Dean Koontz which dealt with nanotechnology but in a different way . The major complaint I had was with the whole focus on the narrator 's family life . Although it played a role in the plot , I felt it went too deep into it and took away from the story . Also , the I did n't like the way the author portrayed the kids . The kid 's behavior did n't seem real life , the name calling was something an adult might imagine children saying to each but in reality do n't . And after awhile it just got annoying reading about them . I gave it three stars because of the idea and also the second half of the novel was better than the first half .
5 #### Chrichton 's prose gets better with every new book : the story is gripping , the prose is " no nonsense " and the atmosphere is superb . I read a review of " Prey " on powells.com . The reviewer objected some sentence in a book and failed to recognize why Chrichton wrote this story : no matter how great the technology is , the issues of ethical behavior , greed , lack of foresight and " Human Nature " will remain in the forefront , with a great potential for disasters . I enjoyed the story , the research behind it and great prose .
5 #### Fantastic book , as with the rest in the series . The Beautiful Cookbook series is by far the gold standard for photography , recipes and in - depth information for the countries which they feature . Should be a required book series in every home ! !
5 #### Love this book , had wanted to buy it for quite a while . Not disappointing ! !
5 #### Flavored of The Andromeda Strain , Sphere , Congo , and Jurassic Park , Prey is a choice morsel for Crichton fans who appreciate his realistic use of dialogue , the eerie not - quite - right feel he carefully cultivates even as things seem to be going the hero 's way , and the swiftness of his storytelling overall . I found Prey extremely hard to set down , though it was plain to see where some of the intricacies were heading ... some of them . The book starts off a little bland , like the hero himself , but once it gets moving the action is fast and nerve - wrackingly fun . The most refreshing thing about this particular piece is that Crichton does n't eat up pages explaining technicalities to death or filling good story - space with graphics and such which are kind of neat , but not integral for the reader to have to take time to study . This tale is told simply , quickly , and honestly , and should sit proudly on the shelf where his other works are stored in your home . Nice job , Michael .
2 #### I 've read virtually everything written by Crichton , because the technology is well presented , and the story is usually fun to read , at least . But in ' Prey , ' the technology , as described , is not even self - consistent , and the story reads like a screenplay . Disappointing .
2 #### Crichton 's " Prey " explores the possibilities and the potential catastrophies that might occur with nanotechnology . One reading a Chrichton novel expects a consistent dose of science , yet despite the interesting theme of this novel , the first 130 pages or so of the novel is devoted entirely to the main character 's family problems . I am amazed that I continued reading about such boring and ultimately inconsequential situations . Although Crichton 's characters in " Prey " are more " real " and human than Chrichton 's characters usually are , the dialogue is ridiculous . The main characters children speak to each other ( and their parents ) like brats . The adults rarely sound much better . The novel has many positive points and the middle portions of the novel are interesting and the pages turn quickly . The ending is poorly written and did not satisfy me . Although Chrichton attempts to tie the ending to the beginning , this technique , while usually effective , did not work well here . Without a doubt , Crichton is a brilliant mind and a great writer , but " Prey " needed a team of editors . He certainly could have done better .
5 #### I was a bit unsure of this book when I first got it . It seemed very much like Crichton 's early work Jurrasic Park . Was Crichton simply repackaging an old formula in a new wrapper ? In truth there are a lot of elements in Prey that are similar to Jurrasic Park as well as his book Sphere towards the end of the book . Technology gone wrong and the suspense that there is something out there wanting to get at the people inside . These elements are present in both books . Do n't let that worry you because it does n't matter . This is a first rate thriller that stands on it 's own and will please any Crichton fan . What makes this book much different however from his previous books is it 's downright creepy . Creepy like no other Crichton book that I can recall . It 's almost as if Crichton had worked with Stephen King . It 's almost like a old fashion ghost story but with technology rather than supernatural explinations . Hard to write a review without giving much away and I do n't want to spoil anything but needless to say Crichton has shown once again that he 's one of the top writers of today .
5 #### I wanted this book for a long time but it was too expensive to buy new . Then the opportunity came up to buy a used one that was in very good condition at a great price . I am so happy I paid a fraction of the cost of a new one and the book arrived looking as if it were brand new . This is a good book when it comes to the Mexican recipes .... they are quite authentic .
4 #### In Michael Crichton 's " Prey " , we may have a new genre that could be called " Gothic Biotech . " Using his masterful skills , honed over thirty years of writing best selling suspense novels , Crichton presents us with a riveting tale of a bio - engineered organism that rises up with a will and a vengeance , aiming to control its creators . From the labs of the Silicon Valley , scientists pressured by ever - increasing market competitions enter a dangerous realm . A secret facility " outside Reno " , Crichton tells us , is the scene for the nonstop plot . ( As a northern Nevadan , I must object that Crichton seems to have confused our climate with that of southern Nevada outside Vegas . Our " high - mountain " desert just is n't as fierce as the one he describes ! ) Crichton does the domestic scenes well , as " house - husband " Jack Forman , between jobs as a hightech computer programmer , struggles with family routines and unruly children in his new role . He writes in the voice of one who has been there , and women will appreciate the authenticity . The pace is trademark - fast , the suspense is intriguing , and there are surprises throughout . " Prey " is another good one from Crichton 's ever - fertile imagination . Recommended .
2 #### I was extemely impressed with Michael Chriton when I read this novel . Not at the quality of the writing , the plot , or the science though ; rather I was impressed that he could make nanobots act just like dinosaurs . The writing is still just as gripping as in his other books , and the inconsistencies in the plot are n't too obvious , but none of the characters are really well developed , and they often act in ways that add drama to the story , rather than as a consiquece of their personalities or logic . The science is perhaps the worst thing about the book . In Jurassic Park the only strange thing seemed to be Chriton 's belief that Zoos could n't possbily work . In Prey , though , we see numerous examples of confusion about the sizes of things , over and misuse of buzzwords , and downright magical evolution . The creatures in Prey seem to evolve new abilities in just one or two generations , evolve without selective pressure , and evolve as a group rather than as individuals - all without exchanging genes . If you want something fun to read , adn do n't have too much background in science , this book could be quite fun . Just do n't believe the science .
4 #### I have come away feeling that I read a good novel . Not great , just good . Prey is a high - tech novel , and though Crichton had much explaining to do , he did so in an entertaining fashion . You do n't feel like you 're at a college lecture here , he tells a simple story of technology gone wrong . The nanotechnology is hard to understand at times , but as for story - telling content , the novel succeeds well . Crichton is not wordy . The story is simple and flows quite well . Although it has its tense parts , I was never really on the edge of my seat . The most entertaining parts were where the nanoswarms figured out how to take the shape of ... well , read and find out . I finished it quickly and feel satisifed I bought the hard cover to add to my collection . I also woud not be surprised if his book found itself in a screen writers hands . It is a perfect story for a movie -- short , few characters , cool special effect possibilities . If you 're a passing reader , I 'd recommend picking it up and the library or waiting for the paper back . If you want GREAT Crichton , pick up Jurassic Park , Lots World , or Airframe . All in all , good book . He uses the idea of nanotechnology well , though this story could have been more grand .
3 #### While not his best novel , Crichton does a competent job of weaving a tale of suspense around some interesting emerging technologies . The first part of the novel had me hooked , but by the time he shifts locations , Crichton started to lose me . There are a couple of reasons for this . First , there is the mystery around what is happening to his wife . I found this pretty transparent , and so found myself having to wait far too long for it to be revealed . Second - and this is my own fault - I found the capabilities of the technology in the story pretty tough to swallow . I work in software , and have used some of the techniques discussed , so it was hard for me to suspend my disbelief sufficiently . Still , I thought the idea behind the story was interesting , and the beginning and end of the novel were pretty engaging . If you do n't mind a little technology mixed in with your fiction , you might like this . I would n't necessarily recommend it , but I would n't try to dissuade you from reading it , either .
5 #### What I find to be extremely interesting science is presented in Michael Crichton 's " PREY " . Biological science coupled with computer software science and nanotechnology are engaged in a project that involves evolution and adaption , among other things . " PREY " is really an exciting and frightening novel , partly because the events in the story could probably really happen . An unemployed computer programmer / manager , has become a job searching stay - at - home dad . He is eventually asked by his former employer , who had fired him , to return and help with a computer program . For obvious reasons he is reluctant to do this . In this book , evolution takes on a new meaning . If we only learn one thing from " PREY " it would be responsibility . " ... jerry - built , half - baked , concocted in a hurry to solve present problems and never a thought to the future . " ( p. 362 of " PREY " ) Sound familiar ? After you read the book , go back and reread the Introduction .
1 #### My opinion of Michael Crichton has sunk to a new low . This book reads like a sloppy first draft from someone who decided it was time to cash in on the current public and media interest in nanotechnology . From a literary perspective , why would anyone care about the two - dimensional characters in this book , much less the gauzy excuse for a plot and sleep - inducing ending ? If viewed purely from a " hard science " angle , the book also fails miserably because the author could n't be bothered to provide even a half - way plausible explanation for his nanotech swarms . Anyone with background in the physical or computer sciences will find the underpinnings for this latest variation on Shelley 's Frankenstein laughable . Good books from acknowledged masters of the genre feature one or more interesting ideas , are populated with fully formed , three - dimensional characters and plot elements , and furnish the reader with believable extensions to known scientific fact . This book , however , is drivel and I 'm sorry I wasted money buying the hardcover edition . I expected much better from the author of the Andromeda Strain , and it will certainly be a long time before I take a chance on another Crichton book .
5 #### An interesting Alaskan adventure told from the perspective of a guide taking visitors , including a famous photographer , into the back country .
5 #### What an amazing read ! Lynn has a way of telling a story that keeps you involved . His descriptions make me feel as if I were there . He has put so much heart and soul as well as knowledge into this book that I feel like I was entering into another reality . Great job ! I want to read his other books now !
5 #### Emotionally open and well written , this book is about the ties that we form and how passionate and deeply those connections can be to our core .
5 #### I truly love this book . It is a great story of a great man Lynn Schooler and his relationship with Michio Hoshino the great wildlife photographer and there hunt for the elusive Blue Bear or glacial bear . I enjoy a good bear story but this was so much more . It was life and learning to deal with the disappointments of life , which we all have in one form or another . It also has tragedy and even death , but the way it is written was great . It moved me and that is what a great book does . I have ordered his other book also . Hope to get it soon . Enjoy this book , enjoy life ..
5 #### This is much more than a book about a reclusive bear , it 's about important reminders about people we care about
4 #### I do n't believe " Prey " is among Crichton 's better novels , though he 's so talented that even when he 's not hitting on all cylinders he still comes up with something pretty slick and entertaining . My primary criticisms of this book are that the character development is a little weak and that the plot seems to fit sort of a prototypical Crichton mold without breaking new ground . I do n't think Crichton should stray away from his fascination and concern with technology in future novels , though I would like to somehow see him reinvent himself a little . I do n't know how , but I would like to see him expand his vision a little in the future . Nonetheless , " Prey " is still quite a good book that most Crichton fans will enjoy . Avery Z. Conner , author of " Fevers of the Mind " .
2 #### This is not Michael Crichton 's best work . An interesting idea , but not very well fleshed out or expanded . I could have done without the scenes with the kiddies and I found it hard to believe the hero ever loved his wife . So who cared if she became infected .
4 #### This book was great , I enjoyed it throughout , but not 5 star worthy . A great book I recommend but you will have read better . The end is pretty entertaining . You will enjoy the book and be glad you read it , but simply not the best out there .
4 #### Crichton has once again managed to scare the hell out of us with his latest novel PREY . As usual his characters are carefully crafted and his science is flawless , if not a little much . This one will keep you awake at nights with its nasty little predators and rollicking storyline ! Crichton did n't let us down ! You ca n't go wrong with this one ... treat yourself to a great ride !
4 #### Great book , but as it 's second hand , it has a strange smell ...
4 #### This gives a beautiful insight to the Mexican culture .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books , and I 've read it more than once . The descriptions are rich , and I especially enjoyed reading about the bubble - feeding whales . But underneath the story of Alaska and wildlife , which I admit was the main draw when I started the book , is the story of friendship . This book is one of the few paperback books on my shelf these days -- my only complaint is that it is not yet available as a Kindle book .
5 #### WHAT A WONDERFUL BOOK , WITH SUCH GREAT PICTURES . I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN AND READ THE ENTIRE THING , IN ONE SETTING . WORTH THE MONEY .
5 #### Schooler covers quite a bit of territory in this tight book . I enjoyed the accompanying map that I could use to follow all his adventures . His writing , above all else , is honest and at times gut - wrenching . Many of the awful experiences he suffers through are relatable . If anyone has ever unexpectedly lost a loved one , for whatever reason , can relate to the personal devastation he goes through . On the other hand he survives . This book is intimately involved about that survival . It 's also about the art of the naturalist photographer and the endless beauty of the inland - passage of Alaska . I could n't put this book down .
5 #### Recommended by a friend who knew I was on my way to Alaska . His description of nature , his relations with others and his skill as a seaman were all great . The book will be one of those that I will keep and re - read .
5 #### Every so often you come across a writer whose stories come across so effortlessly , that it 's like you are sitting down with an old friend you have known all your life . Lynn is such a writer . His stories are beautiful , engaging , and penetrating . If you love stories of mountains , seas , bears , and Alaska , this book is a great choice . Lynn 's intelligence and humility gives his stories an extra layer of polish and depth that makes this book all the more enjoyable . I picked up the Blue Bear right after I finished reading Walking Home , Lynn 's other book . I would highly recommend that as well . It 's been a year since I read both these books , and I just searched him to see if he had written any more , which is when I decided to write this review ( his stories will remain with you for a long time ) .
3 #### In Prey , Crichton uses primarily the same formula that he did in Jurassic Park and Timeline . Replace dinosaurs and Medieval horrors with nanoparticles , and you have Prey . That is not such a bad thing . All three of these novels will keep you up late at night trying to get to the resolution of some very exciting sequences . The resolution in Prey does seem a little flat though . The climax of prey is filled with as much intensity as any of his novels , but the denouement ( falling action after the climax ) is weak at best . When you hit the last page , you find yourself wondering why he would end the story at that moment . There is still a little left to be resolved . I was also a little put off by the main character . We are supposed to see him as being intellectual and yet some very obvious details and clues slip right past him . At times he is passive to the point of absurdity and other times he is a determined leader . Crichton 's characters tend to be a little flat . He is usually more concerned with providing background details than he is with developing characters . Having said this , Prey is a fun read . Crichton 's stories hold your attention , and like his books from the past , this one keeps you reading .
4 #### The more I read about the possibilities of the future , the more I embrace our past . Now it is nanotechnology which poses the threat and Michael Crichton has done with it as he has done with other similar themes , i.e. he makes terrible things sound reasonably possible . While I must admit this technology was not on my radar screen before I picked the book up , it surely is now and if you would like to spend some discomfiting time getting entertainingly educated , this is your opportunity .
5 #### In the beginning , our narrator , Jack Forman , ominously reveals that " Things never turn out the way you think they will " . Jack is a Bay Area high tech manager who has recently been fired , for exposing corruption in his company . His wife is in charge of a team that has been developing a kind of nano - spy plane . These nano - planes are intended to be a swarm of micro - robots that can fly to remote places and , acting in concert , send back a visual image . The team is using a piece of software that Jack wrote to control the swarms of nanoparticles , and hence when they get out of control he is called into the Nevada desert to try to help reign them in . As the battle rages , the nano - swarm begins to demonstrate what is referred to " emergent behavior " , ie their tactics evolve . As the plot twists & turns , I found myself drawn in and glued to this book . While it may not be fine literature , it is a tremendously enjoyable read .
4 #### Lynn Schooler lived what can only be described as a solitary life . Haunted by bad memories , driven to be apart from society and piloting a small charter boat for competitive photographers and itinerant tourists in the least populated portion of America , safe to say Schooler was among the least likely to make new friends . Yet , when famous Japanese nature photographer Michio Hoshino chartered Schooler 's boat in a whale photographing expedition , a durable bond formed . The bond would strengthen over the succeeding years as Schooler and Hoshino explored the coastline of Southeast Alaska in search of the elusive glacier bear . The Blue Bear is both a touching tribute and an interesting nature - based adventure story . Schooler provides abundant description of his particular place in the world so as to transport the reader to an apparently beautiful and undoubtedly challenging landscape . We feel present ( and concerned ) when the icy seas turn stormy and when the native fauna turn unpredictable . And perhaps most importantly , we feel the gentle presence and subtle wisdom of Hoshino in Schooler 's descriptions and narrative . While Schooler at times awkwardly attempts to wedge natural history into his narrative , the story in general flows all too quickly from its uncertain beginning to its solemn conclusion . Schooler 's book provides a genuine feeling of place and authentic intimacy - an ample reward for a few hours reading .
4 #### The Blue Bear was not exactly what I expected . It was more . Written by a man who had a hard start as a child and teenage , he is a remarkable wordsmith , painting pictures on every page . The progression of the story is gradual and unencumbered by the unnecessary . I was interested and involved from beginning to end .
5 #### This book was probably the best book I have read in a long long time . It takes a LOT for me to say " I could n't put it down " but I COULDN'T ! ! ! It was written so well and so compellingly interesting , it was over before I knew it , and I wanted more . I do hope that Lynn Schooler writes again about ANYTHING ALASKA . A terrific find .
4 #### I have been reading a lot of non - fiction Northern Frontier / Alaskan books and this was one of the better ones . A great read about a new friendship developing over something that was so rare and elusive . And yet such a sad and tragic end ... Highly recommended . It 's more about friendship than just that blue bear ...
4 #### The theme of this is really the author 's life , both past and now as a small boat captain in Alaska 's dramatically beautiful south coast . If you are passionate about bear stories this is not that great . Toting the Japanese film crew got old and his own entry into photography was tedious . Taken in total with the cultural history , the sea , forests , wildlife , and glaciers , and the author 's own qwest it is worthwhile , but certainly not epic .
5 #### This was a great read . The storyline is creative and gripping . It reads like a movie , which also makes a fun read . It is action packed and mysterious right to the last page . I do n't usually read Micheal Crichton 's books . This was a nice change of pace for me . I picked up this book and started reading before I had the slightest clue what it was about . I am so glad I did . I recommend that others do the same , do n't read an all - too - revealing review . This book will keep you guessing ! I just ca n't say anymore without spoiling it . Thanks for reading my review !
3 #### When I first started reading this , I thought it was going to be very good . The set - up was very interesting , getting to know the protagonist , and his situation and background . There was enough science to make it seem believable , but not so much to make it slow down the story . However , when the story got going , I thought it fell apart somewhat . There were many times when the characters did things that just did n't seem to make much sense based on the situation . And the main conflict just did n't keep me as interested as I had been leading up to it . Also , I 'm not a big fan of illogical coincidences that play a crucial role in the plot . Like Jack having written the code that his wife 's company was using , it was a little too convenient . I think the story would have worked much better if that had been presented differently . Finally , the end seemed to drag on quite a bit . I felt like I knew pretty much what would happen , but it took too long getting there . Overall , I thought the premise was very interesting and the characters were good , but the ending seemed a little predictable and it was too slow . I enjoyed reading it , but the beginning made me expect more from the end than I got .
5 #### For two days , I could barely put this book down . This time Crichton 's plot revolves around nano computers and an unemployed father of three , Jack , who believes his wife is having an affair . Jack 's real problems begin the instant his infant daughter wakes up screaming in the night from a mysterious rash but in short order he 's called upon to save the world from uncontrollable swarms of deadly nano computers . ( Luckily Jack 's an unemployed computer code writer , and it 's his code on predator and prey behavior that the tiny computers are running on . ) Prey reminds me both of The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park , with a great balance of story and science . The concepts in Prey are quite realistic and terrifying and the suspense in the last half of the book is incredible . ( Plus , Michael Crichton was years ahead of his time with the misuse of cloning theme used in Jurassic Park , so I think that adds an element of credibility to his ideas . ) I admit that there are a couple of too convenient contrivances , and the ultimate outcome is somewhat sudden and movie - ish ( Without a doubt there will be a movie version ) but Prey remains a great story . I enjoyed it immensely and ca n't wait for Crichton 's next !
4 #### This novel was not up to normal Crichton standards . The last 150 pages were exciting and made it hard to put down , but the first 150 pages were boring and almost caused me to quit reading it . I was expecting a story like Andromeda Strain , Jurassic Park , Congo , or Timeline that got you into the action fast as well as taught you about the science and technology Crichton is covering in the story . He did cover how the emerging nanotechnology of molecular robots combined with biotechnology and computer technology could get out of control on its own . These molecular robots swarmed together and developed emergent behavior ( learning new responses to new stimuli ) based on a predator model which becomes life - threatening to those who created them . The book is worth reading , but not one that enthralls the reader from beginning to end .
4 #### This is Michael Crichton style science fiction adventure at its best . I picked this book up Saturday morning and did not put it down until I finished reading it that evening . He combines well - researched ideas from nanotechnolgy , biotechnology , and computer technology with his vivid imagination and novelist license to create this fast paced story . Predator behavior emerges as swarms of agents evolve to form a network optimized to thrive and prey on their creators . The science behind this story is so well researched the book contains a three page long bibliography of scientific papers on artificial life , evolutionary design , self - organization in biological systems , competition and predation , and swarm intelligence .
2 #### I have read two reviews of this novel . Apart from some mild criticism , both were favorable . These reviewers have been too kind . Prey is one of the most poorly written novels I 've ever read . The only reason I gave it two stars is because it offers some interesting ideas as well as some fascinating information about the burgeoning new science of nanotechnology . Michael Crichton did n't try to write a readable , engaging novel here . All the characters are one - dimensional with virtually no character development , and much of the dialogue is inane -- in one chapter , two of the main characters spend a half a page discussing the virtues of various disposable diapers ! Prey is n't a novel -- it 's just a sloppy treatment of the film ( complete with some interesting ideas for cool special effects courtesy of the author ) that will undoubtedly be forthcoming in the next year or so . In this case , the movie is sure to be better than the book .
5 #### Not Tex - Mex recipes , traditional Mexican . Interesting and informative introductions . Recipes in both standard measurements ( tablespoons , cups ) as well as ounces , milliliters and grams . Most ingredients readily available and directions clear . Everything I 've made so far is very flavorful . Book is oversized , so does n't fit readily in standard bookcase , but minor issue .
3 #### I knew this book was older went I bought it , but I must say I do n't feel inspired to try any of these recipes . Mexican food has come a long way in the states . Nothing new here . Pictures are n't even that great .
5 #### I 'm from Mexico and my wife is not ; we recently got this book after a trip there where she fell in love with the cuisine . The book contains authentic recipes , many resembling my abuela 's cooking , and are accessible to anyone who understands English . Beautiful pictures are the icing on the cake . Enjoy it as much as we have . Buen provecho !
5 #### My review title says it all -- I could hardly put it down . Rarely do I read a book that so intrigues me , so captures my imagination that my life is literally put on hold until I 've finished it . That is exactly what happened with Prey . I knew nothing about nanotechnology going in , and although I still doubt the feasbility of many of Crichton 's assertions in the story , I was fascinated nevertheless .
4 #### Crichton does a good job laying out the future of nanotechnology and the good and bad it might bring . This is the second nanotech book I have read ( see Chasing the Dime ) and Prey offers more insight into what can and might happen . The story is an interesting suspense novel with science and scientist gone wild . What is developed as a potential military aid spins out of control and someone has to be brought in to get it under wraps . Oddly enough , husband and wife are battling each other in good versus evil . The story is intriguing until the last few chapters where it ends very predictably . All in all , it is a fun read if you enjoy exploring what the future can bring us .
5 #### I 've considered Crichton my favorite author since I was eleven years old . I 've even read his nonfiction . I do n't expect for his books to be any different from the all the rest , and that 's why I love him- for his constancy . I was thrilled when Timeline came out , because that 's real Crichton to me , and it did n't disappoint . Prey is the same- it is chock full of Crichton characters- the doomsday prophet , a la Ian Malcolm , the ' good of the company ' guy , the brilliant scientist , or two , or three , the human sabateur . They 're all here in Prey . Why should we fault the man for writing another technology - run - amok narrative ? Do we fault Grisham for writing another book about laywers ? The bottom line is : Prey might not be shockingly different than Crichton 's other books , but if you love Jurassic Park , Andromeda Strain and Sphere , you 'll love this one too ! Because everything we love about Crichton is alive and well in Prey . It 's so rare that you get just what you expect in a book ( whether that be good or bad ) , but I know that I 'll enjoy Crichton 's books every time , and that 's very comforting to me .
5 #### " The Blue Bear " by Lynn Schooler is a story of friends , of nature in all its raw and open forms , and of the possibilities of healing . The subject of this book -- just as photographer Michio Hoshino is quoted as saying about a Japanese documentary on him -- is actually Alaska itself . I enjoyed reading of the various journeys , both emotional and physical , that the author makes in his life , with the splendor of Alaska always providing a visual backdrop to the twists and turns in the plot . It was good that the author chose a more humble approach to his narrative as opposed to , for example , arrogantly listing all his conquests of the natural world , as we see in much of nature - related writings these days . I have to say , though , that after getting to know Japanese photographer Michio Hoshino better through the pages of this book , it was a bit difficult getting through the chapter in which he is literally taken away us . Of course , here in Japan , Hoshino is still considered something of a legend and his work lives on . Still , it was nice to be able to go behind the legend of a great photographer and human being , through such a gifted storyteller as author Schooler . A warm but tragic story that will leave you feeling much fuller inside than before .
5 #### What a wonderful book ! Loved it . I read lots of non fiction , adventure - type books & this has got to be at the top of the list . I felt like I was there in Alaska with Lynn & Michio , and a friend of theirs . Makes me want to see Alaska even more now . And learn more about the place of such wonder . It 's a great read .
5 #### Elegiac is the perfect word to describe both the cadence and direction of this book : somber , straightforward , yet filled with joy . We come to know both men -- the author and the late Michio Hoshino -- through dialogue and description that is utterly natural , yet weighted with meaning . Pivotal scenes are described so elegantly that you want to read them again and again to extract every nuance of mood . Small vignettes speak volumes , such as the visit of the two men to a village where hundreds of native women and children died by starvation due to a US government relocation program . Or the choice of the author to pilot the boat away from Hobart because he could not bear the sight of the ravaged hillsides . The author 's lightness of touch is captivating especially because it is paired with such a deep knowledge and love of the flora , fauna and weather of the region . Reading Blue Bear , you become effortlessly acquainted with the Alaskan coast , as though it is indeed home , and come to mourn its slow , relentless destruction . I look forward to Lynn Schooler 's next book .
5 #### This is a book more than worth the reading .
5 #### Lynn Schooler is destined for greatness . Anyone who enjoys reading will love this book . It 's a dark horse sleeper out of the naturalist / adventure genre and Schooler is yet to be a well known author , but The Blue Bear has ' best seller ' written all over and inside of it . The people he guided are a lucky lot because this book is going to change all that .
4 #### Creighton 's , " Prey , " is an intriguing and suspenseful novel with a technological edge that will keep you riveted throughout the book . The storyline is represented by nanotechnology ( micro - robots ) with a shrewd adeptness to form anthropomorphically in subterfuge and to exploit its code - enhanced erudition through artificial - distributed intelligence . The main characters are developed entirely with a rich plot surrounded by a scientific experiment that goes awry . " Prey " is a great title for this book , as the nanotechnology gains life through its ` realistic ' experiences as a hunter and hunted . I would recommend this book . It is an easy - to - read , captivating , and mind - provoking novel .
4 #### This was a good book but it could have been better . It was n't like his past books but a lot better than Timeline . Plus it seems to end but not . You will see when you read this book .
2 #### Ingredients : Pioneering scientist on the cutting edge . Potential for big profits on new technology . Combine ingredients . Apply nature 's surprising complexity , complete with many interesting but preachy tangents . When things begin to go horribly wrong , mix in male protagonist with scientific background and high virtue . After 350 pages , a few characters will be killed off but the hero will escape in a helicopter after eradicating the man - made atrocity .
4 #### Crichton engages the readers mind , satisfying both their technological curiousity as well as their appetite for a good thriller . Gary S. Potter Author / Poet
4 #### Simply put , Michael Crichton has composed a modern age , technological thriller that will keep you turning the pages . I personally read it in two days flat . The plot centers around " nanotechnology " and Xymos , a company that has created a mechanical swarm that can evolve and survive on it 's own . Julia Forman , a vice president of the company , has been acting very strangely and working long hours . Unemployed , stay - at - home husband Jack suspects Julia is having an affair with her co - worker , Ricky . As one of the original writers of the code that Xymos uses , Jack is quickly hired and sent to investigate what went wrong , although he will find more than just an affair going on ... I thought the book was totally gripping , it kept you immersed in the story and would n't let you go . If you are into technology , science , or simply want a good read , I recommend this book . I do have a few complaints about it . At times , Crichton gets sidetracked and goes into explanations ( through the main character ) about nanotechnology . In addition , I did n't really like how the ending turned out , I thought it could have been done a better way , and it left me feeling like parts of the story were n't resolved ( I wo n't give it away for those of you who have yet to read it ) . In any event , it certainly deserves a look .
3 #### I like some of Michael Crichton 's works . In fact , Disclosure was a great read , Congo very interesting with the adventure and the lovable Amy . However , I somehow feel that though he is a pretty good writer with a gift for cutting edge technology , somehow , he does n't have the same grip for defining characters or describing action sequences . While the concepts of nanotechnology and artificial life were interesting enough to provoke me into reading up some in depth material on Genetic Algorithm and AI , the repeated action sequences with the swarm keeping on attacking the characters got more than a little boring . While I was pleasantly surprised with Crichton 's promising depiction of Forman 's family and inter personal relationships in the first one third of the book , it soon went haywire and the plot shifted totally to the long drawn out chases by the swarm then onwards . The only reason I did not give the book two stars was is the fact that the concepts of Genetic Algorithm and Distributed Computing are wonderfully explained and really whets the readers appetite into reading more into it .
5 #### Lynn Schooler 's book " The Blue Bear " easily meets the qualifications for an ' Oprah book club ' selection . Schooler 's poetic prose has readers savoring each word of this rare glimpse at a special friendship and at a state most of us think of first as COLD . Picturesque scenes lure readers to experience first hand the beauty of this unusual state . Amidst the glory of Alaska 's greater - than - life topography and its land and sea creatures are tidbits of history that keep you riveted to the author 's words . " The Blue Bear " is a book you will not easily forget , a book you will eagerly share with friends . Beverly J Scott author of " Righteous Revenge " and " Ruth Fever . " Reviewer for Intriguing Authors and Their Books at [ ... ]
5 #### Lynn Schooler has taught me a great deal about landscape --- both the outer , physical landscape of Alaska , it 's history and inhabitants , AND the inner landscape of Lynn Schooler 's psyche . A very intimate tale , beautifully told , visually and emotionally stunning . Thank you for sharing , Lynn . I wish I could have met Michio , but I feel like I got to know him through your book .
5 #### I was driving around , running errands on a hot June day , when I stumbled across a National Public Radio talk show on which Lynn Schooler was promoting this book . By the time it was over , I was at the nearest bookstore , sipping a cup of coffee and reading the first chapter of The Blue Bear . Schooler is a natural - born story - teller and his knowledge and love of the Alaskan wilderness make every paragraph glow with authenticity . Like most good books , the Blue Bear can be enjoyed and appreciated on many different levels : it 's a wonderful adventure story , it captures the precious qualities of friendship and it encapsulates Schooler 's life - affirming world view in a way that is powerful , but never preachy .
5 #### This fabulous book is not only a visual piece of art but the recipes are incredible . Susanna Palazuelos traveled extensively through her home country of Mexico and has put together a cook book like no other . A true masterpiece .
5 #### This is absolutely beautiful , well written and now my family heirloon . It is this good . Recipes look so delicious . I ca nt wait to get started . Thank you Amazon for being there for all the great products out there .. You are also a great source of research and opinions for me . I actually look on other outside blogs and find Amazon to be the most comprehensive and honest . I love this product . Seller packaged well . Very pleased in every way . I sent this again as I meant to give it FIVE stars .
5 #### Of hundreds of cookbooks that claim to include Mexican dishes , this is the only one that completely holds to original , regional , and traditional dishes , without adding any modern variations . It has endured in my kitchen for 40 years , and remains as the singular reliable reference for Mexican recipes . The photography is excellent , and it is only too bad that it is no longer in publication . I have bought them as presents for one or two very special " cocineras " .
3 #### I was extremely excited when finally got my copy of Mexico The Beautiful Cookbook . The book is beautiful and the dishes are authentic , however I question if the author actually tested these recipes . She is a very well known caterer in Mexico so I had high expectations from her . I am a very experienced cook and by no means an amateur having been a private caterer myself . I have also lived in Mexico for years so I have deep insight into the authenticity of regional Mexican cuisine . After making many recipes from this book I finally decided its only worth being on the coffee table . If not for the beautiful layout and pictures this book would go to the thrift store as it is very highly overrated when it comes to the actual recipes .
5 #### this was highly intersting and suspenceful . Jack is a lovable character , and one roots for him , through this weird ordeal he got himself into . The enemy is hard to evade , since it can be invisible , unless it forms into a big black swarm . It 's kinda like the 1986 Chernobly accident , the invisible radioactive rays that killed so many people . The silent and invisible enemy ! You think it 's not there , untill you see what happens to ya ! awesome book , one of Crichtons bests !
4 #### It 's the story of nanotechnology gone awry . Crichton does a great job of walking you through the technical stuff that makes up the nanotechnology monster and creates some fantastic characters . The protagonist is a stay at home Dad who must battle runaway technology , a bizarre wife , an evil boss , and a nosy sister , all while taking care of three kids - including the double trouble of a teenage girl and a 9 month old infant . I was n't impressed with his last two novels , but this book represents a return to form . I read this in two nights . If you like techno thrillers , this is a great one .
4 #### It starts with the binding of the book , the texture that is unique among other hardcover bestsellers . Like Jurassic Park did with biotech , we get an introduction to where we are with nanotechnology right now and where we are going in the future . Then we strap ourselves in for a fun " what if " ride . Like his other thrillers " Sphere " and " Jurassic park " , he does a masterful job with the set up . Giving us haunting images of things I wo n't reveal for fear of giving anything away . We are kept guessing and are entertained and fascinated along the way . Like Disclosure , Congo , Sphere , Timeline and others we get to see some pretty cool toys and technology . Michael Crichton is the undisputed master of the Science techno thriller . He does n't quite hit a homerun here as he did in " Jurassic Park " but this is a solid Triple into the gap ! Recomended ! !
1 #### Crichton is resting on his laurels now . He simply picks a popular topic and cranks out a canned novel on the subject . While I found the storyline interesting , the character development stinks . The main character was an imbecile . All kinds of bad things are happening around him yet he continues to deny the truth . When he does finally wake up to the problem he continues to make one wrong move after another . It 's hard to believe that anyone is that dim . All of the other characters in the book are just as weak . The kids are horrendously annoying , the villains are wooden , and the good guys are uninspiring . Even the Swarm is not that scary . The ending is a little too clean as well . This book is simply weak . It is not worth the money . Crichton , like Danielle Steele , can write crap now and people will still buy it . For a much better book on a similar topic read Greg Bear 's Blood Music .
4 #### Once again , Michael Crichton , the master of " Techno thrillers " , has done it again . I could not put the book down . It was wonderful . I had heard a rumor in the book store that it was not very good , and was thinking of passing it by . I m glad that I did nt . The book kept me on my feet until the last pages , and that s what Crichton is best at . " Prey " is another one of Crichton 's novels that is based on bacteria sized particles , as was in " The Andromeda Strain " . This time we are faced with Nanoparticles , that are being tested to help look inside a medical patients body by forming a camera when coming together . But what happens when the particles escape and begin to evolve and think on their own ? This novel is just plain chilling . The research behind this book is wonderful , and well done , as Crichton always manages to do . And that is what makes this so chilling . It makes you wonder what would happen if the events of this novel really took place . I think you will be pleased with the results of this fast paced , chilling novel .
4 #### If you like to read a suspense book that makes you look at technology a different way , this is the book for you . I love how Michael Crichton can show how science can get out of hand . He just might be the George Orwell of his time .
4 #### Typical Michael Crighton book . He does a great job of making the unbelievable seem believeable . From Dinosaurs in Jurassic park to time travel in Timeline . But also typical of his novels the end peters out . The difference in Prey is the build up is not as interesting as some of his other novels .
3 #### If your going to try an read this book , I would give it a 2 . But as a book on tape it 's a 4 . Why the difference , it 's easy I would never read through ALL the explanations of the technilogy , but listening to it on tape requires no thought . It just sort of flows . Interesting story . Main character is a bit card board , but in all well worth the LISTENING to .
3 #### I 've read several of MC 's books and enjoyed all of them to various degrees . Prey introduces us to a very likable main character and gives us another one of Crichton 's famed runaway science experiments . As usual , the technogy described is cutting - edge and well explained . I was able to easily follow how it developed and evolved . Everything was great up until about page 300 ( out of 360 ) . It felt as the last part of the book was a Hollywood movie and the two hour flick was nearing its end . The book went from being intelligent and scary in a very real sense , to being an over - the - top popcorn movie with generic action . Maybe it would have been better if the ending came more as a surprise . I had pretty much figured out the twist ealier in the book , so the ending was n't that exciting to me . My wife on the other hand was blown away by those events and enjoyed it more than I did . All in all , this is one of Mr. Crichton 's better books but definitely not his best . I consider it a good read and look forward to the movie that I 'm sure will follow .
3 #### I read this book in 2 days . I REALLY enjoy Michael Crichton 's writing because you become so immersed in learning something new every time he writes a book ... but this particular plot felt flatter than most . Maybe its because of the tired story of a couple coming apart at the seams , maybe its because of the very rough chapter endings ala " Goosebumps " style ... Maybe he was writing in the style of a new movie script ? ? Seems a lot of authors are doing that these days , < sadly > . In any case , I LOVED learning about nanotechnology and artificial life ... but that was about it . Yeah , I 'd buy it - wait till the paperback comes out or buy a used one just to learn something new . Do n't expect to be brought in with your mind in the plot though , the way previous Crichton novels have seduced you .
3 #### I have really enjoyed some of Mr. Crichton 's books and then there is this one . Admittedly it has suspense and it was a quick read indicating a desire to find what happened next but it does get far - fetched and goes beyond realistic . Also , on one page there was a distorted sentence which really bothers me . What ever happened to proofreading . Mr. Crichton can and has done much better than Prey .
4 #### This book is beautiful and packed with appealing recipes . The quality of the paper , the vivid photography , and the engaging travel writing combine to make this more than just a book of recipes . It 's a book you 'll pull out and thumb through while you think about where you want to go in Mexico .
1 #### I like Susana Palazuelos , I enjoyed her meal at Izote in Mexico City ... and have used her recipes , but I have no idea what she was doing for this book . In my opinion , this was done when her vision was still quite immature . My main complaint about her recipes is that they are completely Creole Revisionist ... in other words they are done from a very Spanish / Euro perspective ... the Herb , Chile & Spice combinations have been extremely simplified & you really do not get to understand & appreciate the true genius of Mexican Cuisine . Its like a Spaniard revised all the recipes . Truly dissappointing .... it should be embarrassing to here that Rick Bayless 's books are a bit closer than this one .
4 #### " Mexico , The Beautiful Cookbook " not only is a wonderful cookbook filled with authentic recipes , but also a gorgeous coffee table book showing the beautiful country of Mexico . I received this book as a gift for my birthday several years ago . I was very excited as I am very interested in other cultures , languages and food . I was even more thrilled when my husband 's stepmother ( Mexican descent ) told me that she had n't seen these recipes since her grandmother made them when she was a little girl ! Each recipe is easy - to - follow . There is also a guide in the back describing unusual ingredients . With some thought , you can make suitable substitutions for those ingredients . If not , the book will have you pining to make that jump for a vacation to Mexico ! Mexican food lovers will love this book .
5 #### I had many Mexican students in my ESL classes , and my boyfriend is Mexican . I have an extensive Mexican cookbook collection , personally collected recipes , and this is the book I go to over and over . The recipes are pertty easy for anyone who likes real home cooking ; you may need to go to a Mexican store to find the banana leaves , epazote , chilis , etc . called for . But this food is like being invited to eat with a Mexican family . It has a wonderful variety ofcommon Mexican cooking methods and dishes . And what it calls regional are authentic ; for example , when I visited Veracruz , I was served fish soup by different families and was a little upset I never got the recipes ; this book pretty well duplicated the experience for me . The recipes are 100 % authentic ; you will not be disappointed . I have the softcover version and am going to buy the hardcover just to keep out for the pictures and keep my softcover for using in the kitchen . It 's a good cookbook whether you are just starting out or are looking for something a little different for your Mexican repetoir . I HIGHLY recommend this cookbook ! ! !
5 #### This is much more than a cookbook and rightly deserves it 's title . Many people associate Mexican cooking with tamales , tacos and burritos which is no surprise as many of the Mexican restaurants in the US limit their menus to such items . This book goes beyond what Americans consider traditional Mexican cooking and highlights many of the recipes derived from their Spanish ancestors , executed with local ingredients . This oversized book is separated into regions and includes recipes as well as detailed information on the country . There is an extensive chapter on seafood including some excellent recipes which should n't come as a surprise since Mexico boasts a 6000 mile coastline . Extensive photography is also included in this book making it a suitable for anybody . If you can find a spot for it on your bookshelve , buy this book !
5 #### From the gourmet to the everyday ! This truly is an exceptional cookbook . The photos are a plus to this well researched and written book . Some of the recipes border on the gourmet and may even be difficult to find in Mexican restaurants . The ingredients may seem quite peculiar to the average American but the effort is well worth the experimentation . Case in point : Crepas de Cuitlacoche con salsa de Poblano " Corn Fungus Crepes with Poblano Sauce " . Seriously one of the best dishes I 've tried . I own three Beautiful Cookbooks , but by far this is the most used . I can count on every recipe being fabulous !
5 #### This book is a classic of Mexican Cuisine . It 's not as anal - retentive as Diana Kennedy and more appealing than Rick Bayless . The recipes are truly authentic and I have lived in Mexico for many years , researching the cuisines of Mexico . This book contains the majority of the most common dishes cooked in homes in Mexico and a great deal of the " alta cocina " works as well . I have made 75 % of the dishes in this book and have served them to Mexican friends to rave reviews . This is the real thing . Marilyn Tausend collaborated in this book and it shows . She is an unsung hero of Mexican Cooking . There are others better known , but few that can take a recipe and make it easy to follow , yet as authentic as is possible with ingredients available in the US . If you want to cook like a real Mexican chef , get this book !
2 #### I have been onboard with Crichton since Sphere came out many moons ago , but , sadly I am jumping off his bandwagon . I trudged through Airframe , Disclosure and Rising Sun to see if he would return to his own created genre . However , what original ideas he used to have are now becoming formulaic non - sense . Here is Crichton 's formula - Research Obscure Technology + Find Worst Case Scenario + Have Technology Act Out Worst Case Scenario + Isolated Location ( underwater , desert , medieval Europe , whatever)+ Ignorant Character and Children = brilliant novel , plus a script Spielburg will look at ( crosses fingers ) . Ca n't wait to see him tackle the time - travel issue , oh he already did . It was enjoyable in a mindless way , plus you get to feel smarter about yourself afterward . Anyway , I 'm not expecting much from him next time and I 'll wait for the paperback .
5 #### While reading Prey , I honestly thought it was the best book I have ever read . It is truely awesome . I could n't put it down . I thought about it when I was n't reading it and could n't wait for loved ones to read it so we could talk about it . I highly recommend reading this book .
4 #### There is no Crichton fan who will be able to say this is his best , because it is not . I am a a lawyer with a pre - med degree so obviously Chrichton and other physicians in writing draw me . I love the way Dr C. sets up a possibility and brings it to life for his readers . This time he dreamt up a possibility , asked us to believe him , we tried , then he made us feel foolish . Still love the guy though .
2 #### This book is such a quick read , it 's apparent it was put together with cinema in mind . The characters are so thinly developed , they have no substance or impact on the story . As a reader of just about all his novels , this is the most disappointing of all . However , as a reader of just about all his novels , he still got my $ $ $ !
5 #### What else can you say to a book like this but , wow . I had so much fun reading it that I finished it in record time and handed it off to my wife . A fun , flippant but disturbing look at nanotechnology and the ramifications of using others theories , as Ian Malcom said , " Riding on the shoulders of geniuses . " The hero is the " stay at home " dad with a good sense of humor . You have to wonder if Mr. Crichton has performed this duty himself as it was very well played out and true to form . There is very little time for character buildup , but who needs it when the events are so well put together and new catastrophes unfold on every 10 pages . Crichton has not performed this type of " ca n't put down " writing since Jurassic Park . Although the reader figures out the ending way before everyone in the book does , it only adds to your wanting to find out when and how the characters will figure it out for themselves . The end is another great roller coaster ride from a master . Sit back , buckle up and enjoy the ride !
4 #### A great read , one that I had to read until I fell asleep , and then pick up as soon as I awoke . Crichton draws the reader in and builds an amazing story , as always . This novel in particular does n't feel like it was written as a screen play , and is all the better for it . That most of the novel takes place within a short time period adds to the tension and increases the pace . Character development is a little weak , but better than Crichton 's usual . Some characters we think we know throughout the novel but only realize our error near the end . But Crichton 's greatness lies more in his ability to take modern science- or soon - to - be modern science- and twist it just slightly , raising all the ethical and moral questions that surround the issues . It has been said that the best science fiction departs from reality only slightly . If this is so , Prey is truly quality writing . In the worst of worlds , one could see the book coming to life in another thirty years . But some words of warning : the descriptions of the deaths are really too gruesome and unnecessary . And the italicized blurb which is designed to get the reader to buy the book , just before the first chapter- it gives the ending away , making it obvious as to how the characters will respond to the trauma they face . Better not to read that till the end ....
5 #### Many years ago Michael Crichton wrote the Andromeda Strain . The Prey , in away is rewritten for today . Instead of the danger coming from a mutant microbe it comes from a man - made mutant molecule or nanoparticle , molecule size robots . Most of the story line takes place in a Nevada test laboratory , Xynos Technology where Jack Forman who wrote the original computer code that made these runaway robots possible , must find a way to confine and eliminate them . Crichton has , in the past written about genetic engineering ( Jurassic Park and The Lost World . Growing up most of us has seen dinosaur movies and can only wonder if man fooling around with prehistoric DNA could actually achieve this . In The Prey , we not only wonder but can only think how close to reality can nanopartiles be engineered and cause all the havoc in Crichton 's latest , fast moving , ca n't put it down thriller . Definitely a MUST read .
3 #### I felt like this book was well written , almost scary in its plotting . Then Crichton looked at his watch and decided the book was over and ended it . Still , I 'll pick up a Crichton book anytime for a good read ! !
5 #### As my husband and I have a predelection for fine cuisine and having studied with a few world 's renounced chefs and aficionados of Mexican Cuisine , I guarantee this cookbook 's recipes will delight even the most fastidious palate . The easy - to - follow recipes are ever bit as appetizing and appealing they appear in the exquisite photographs . Even a novice cook will look like pro with the savoir - faire of authentic Mexican cuisine . I strongly recommend this book for gift - giving . ( I actually own a copy and use it . )
5 #### If you are to buy only one Mexican cookbook , this is the one . It features a fantastic array of authentic recipes ( none of them have been adapted to suit the American taste ) , awesome pictures and a plethora of cultural information linked to each recipe . I got raving reviews everytime I prepared a recipe featured in this book , from American and Hispanic friends alike . This is a real treasure worth every cent of its price .
5 #### This is the most authentic and beautiful mexican cookbook that I have ever found . The recipes are full of flavor and the pictures are Muy bonito .
3 #### Not Crichton 's best , but okay . A bit repetitive in some place . C+
4 #### This is good , not great escapist fiction , although from all the hype surrounding the release of PREY , its premise is not that far from reality . Scientists in the fields of computer technology , genetic engineering , and nanotechnology are developing the ability to produce molecular sized robots that will be able to manipulate matter at the atomic level . In PREY , these robots swarm together and develop emergent behavior ( effective new behaviors developed when old behaviors are ineffective ) which is life - threatenning to the scientists who have created them . PREY has some very exciting and thrilling moments and offers some intriguing information about biology and animal behavior that elevates it above the typical story of " science runs amok ' . The problems with it however , are found in the missing literary elements that , when present , make excellent and satisfying reading . There is minimal character development and the dialogue is simple - minded and at times ludicrous . For example , Jack , after witnessing his wife , who is filled with deadly particles , attempt to murder another scientist , describes his experience to her : " I felt tremendously uneasy " . I guess ! Nonetheless , if readers are looking for a fast - paced , entertaining thriller that provides enough science and new information to speculate about the world 's future , then they should enjoy PREY .

3 #### I am a big fan of Mr. Crichton , but he failed in this novel to provide the nail biting tension typical of his earlier works . He seemed to be more interested in explaining and promoting nanotechnology and impressing the reader with his expertise in computer progamming techniques than telling a good story . This was more like a textbook set in a fictional novel . It is a good read , but wait for the paperback version .
2 #### Books like this make you appreciate Stephen King , especially when it comes to little details like plot , characters and motivations ; for instance , why does the swarm of artifical whatever designed to function as a camera suddenly start murdering anything that steps outdoors ? Crichton has obviously done his homework , but the setting is pure " Andromeda Strain , " the plot is recycled " Jurrasic Park , " the text reads like a first draft with myriad inconsistences , and the dialogue makes Ken Follett sound like David Mamet . And ya got ta love the yuppie scum that 's more worried about what the CEO and venture capitalists are going to think versus the carnage and moral implications of man - munching microbes . All in all , a great idea poorly executed . PS nice high school graduation photo on the back cover .
3 #### I was completely caught up in the first half of the book . His story and character development were typical top notch Crichton . Then the last half of the book became a rerun of previous Crichton novels . Not giving anything away , but it sure seemed at times like I was reading a combination of Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park all over again .
5 #### This was another awesome book from Micheal Crichton . I love the way Crichton writes because he takes a concept that is very complex and hard to understand and is able to make me understand all while telling a great story . Fans of Crichton will not be let down but the thrilling story that deals with nanotechnology . I like what this book has to say about not putting regulations on technology and the ramifications it can have on society . I read this book in about three days I could not put it down and neither will you .
5 #### An important piece of history , and an honest look at Democracy and Republics through the eyes of someone who was accustomed to government that included royalty and aristocracy .
5 #### Book looks great ! I 'm really looking forward to reading it .
2 #### But it 's a must read ... to find out what education has turned into this day and age - after education was redefined as a science . . He was after all an early role model to what education has become .
4 #### This book is a well - done standard edition of the most important of Jean - Jacques Rousseau 's political writings , using the classic Cole introduction and translation . It is nicely bound , in the manner of quality books before cheap paperbacks took over the industry . The size , 4.5 " x 7.25 " 325 pages , makes it a convenient carry - along for reading , as usual in the Everyman 's Library . Good quality printing and binding in every respect . There are other more current editions of Rousseau 's writings available , but this one has stood the test of time . With that , Cole was sympathetic toward Rousseau 's political theories , which makes for good translation , but not a very objective analysis . In my opinion , Cole completely misunderstands the implications of Rousseau 's invocation of the General Will , which perhaps with some distortion by later readers , has been responsible for many of the social - political disasters of the past two hundred years , including the Reign of Terror and guillotine excess of the French revolution under Robespierre .
1 #### This ranks as one of the worst books I 've ever purchased . It ramples with shallow characters . The writing is just terrible . At one point a group of characters runs around acting like birds ( they 're seriously attempting to avoid getting killed ) in an attempt to fool the Prey . Do n't buy it !
4 #### This book was a great read , fast paced and interesting . I 've come to love Michael Crichton 's books and this one it a keeper . Filled with action , awe - inspiring technology and suspense , this was an very interesting read . I did however , find that it did n't carry the weight that TIMELINE did , seemed to be " too fast " in some sections , and the technology explanation was a bit rushed not as detailed as TIMELINE or SPHERE . But over all , the book was awesome ( AAA ) ! Buy it !
4 #### Well , Michael Crichton makes another interesting technical story that only seems plausible because of his exausting explanations that seem to appear in every chapter . It always seems his explanations are meant to convince himself as well as the audience . Like Andromeda Strain , Jurassic Park , Sphere and most Crichton works , he likes to deal with small group dynamics and avoids the global effects of the crisis at hand . Still , it made for an interesting 13 hours . I " read " the audio version , which infuses a little of the reader 's acting into the read , but it seems the only way I can read these days .
5 #### Being an avid Michael Crichton fan , I must say I am quite pleased with his latest work , " Prey . " Although it starts a little slow as Crichton lays the groundwork and explains the basics behind nanotechnology . After 100 pages though , it TAKES OFF ! A very exciting read which teaches us a lot about animals & organisms : How they hunt , live , organize , adapt and SURVIVE . Mr. Crichton is always able to teach you something ... all the while keeping you on the EDGE OF YOUR SEAT !

4 #### What you get with Mr. Crichton is fascinating science/ technology and a fast , thrilling pace . What you do not get is character development or pristine prose . Every year or so I willingly accept that trade off . Prey deals with the cross section of biological evolution and the computer age . Crichton does a great job of feeding the reader hard to digest scientific/ technical facts in format that is easy to understand ( I think ? ) . As always , the plot is futuristic and told in a " this could happen " style . It is a page turner and a compelling read . There is a real JURASSIC PARK feel to the structure of the novel , the character quality and behavior . It 's only missing the dinosaurs . I do not rate this amoung Mr. Crichton 's best but it was a good read for a cold winter 's night .
2 #### This Kindle version begins with Book II . How can one eliminate entirely the first book , the one that bears the quotation " Man is born free and yet everywhere is in chains , " the book that sets out the purpose of the project ?
5 #### The Social Contract , published 1762 , is a very elegant piece of writing . Rousseau 's knowledge of history , human nature , and his use of logic create a cogent argument . He illustrates through example how men can live together with equality and equity if allowed to . The modern reader might think the ideas of the French Enlightenment obviouseven quaint . The oppression , torture , and death inflicted upon the common man by the early and middle years of Christianity have since disappeared , but human nature has remained constant . For recent generations the reign of Stalin , Hitler , and Mao Zedong are living memories ; and now , with the fiefdoms of Islam , it is happening again . How quaint is the advice given to us centuries earlierhow deaf have we become ? Or is it our nature ?
4 #### A necessary read . It 's highly biased and generally illogical , and yet serves as a foundation for modern land use code and real estate ownership .
4 #### If you want to understand the genesis of much of America 's constitution , read this carefully . Rousseau was the intellectual spark that set his country aflame in the French Revolution .
4 #### I like social contract theory so this was a book up my ally . Like with all philosophy books it will depend on your philosophical inclinations for your perception of the quality of the book .
2 #### Crichton 's premise of nanotechnology gone awry is interesting but not necessarily new and his characters are shallow and one dimensional . I found the first hundred pages tolerable but the remainder of the book to be formalistic . The science of the " black cloud swarm " requires way too much information and takes away from what could have been a good sci fi horror story . Much of the book reads as if it was originally written as a screenplay . Skip the book and wait for the movie that will , no doubt , be coming to a theatre near you in the future .
5 #### This classic piece of Enlightenment Literature helped me to understand my college history class and write a paper on the French Revolution . That being said , it was very dense and hard to understand at times ( its ancient , so archaic is understandable ) . I loved that Rousseau outlines the importance of social justice , how governments are owned by the governed , and his love for freedom . If you 're interested in understanding more about French History , as well as an influencer to the Constitution of America , then this is it . The Social Contract blends philosophy , ethics , and politics masterfully into a quick read that stands the test of time .
3 #### You will need to bone up on our French History to get through this one . While this book is essential reading for understanding modern political philosophy , it is a turgid read .
3 #### ... Mr. Crichton needs to write books , not screenplays . " Prey " begins with a lot of promise ( compared to his last 2 dismal outings ) . Good and interesting characters , background information that helps the story instead to halting the flow and a very interesting mystery . Then , about halfway into the book , it suddenly becomes yet another standard Hollywood screenplay . The characters become flat and lifeless ; every 5 minutes there is a new desperate chase scene ( they did n't work in Jurassic Park II , they did n't work in Timeline , but whoever bought the movie rights wants it , so Michael writes it ) . The final battle and resolution is very empty and hollow and the motivations of the bad guys ( see spoilers below ) is completely lacking ( but with plenty of room for a sequel Hollywood ! ) . The science and characters are interesting the action and plot is pure tinsel town . Mr. Crichton certainly has enough personal wealth these days that he should be able to stand up to his editors and publishers and write the book he wants to write instead of what will sell in Hollywood . The first half is a good as anything he has ever done , the second half is exactly the same anything he has done in the last 5 years . I ca n't help but feel that he was pressured to publish this book before he had really worked out the details of the ending ( see spoilers ) and the weak ending undermines the great work done leading up to it . ...
3 #### Michael Crichton has clearly developed a formula for his writings . He begins with the theme that technology often advances more rapidly than the understanding of the implications of that technology , adds some techno - babble , mixes in a few high octane action scenes , and voila : an instant best seller . Other than the slightly darker ending , Prey does n't deviate from the formula . Judging by the sales figures on Crichton 's books , it 's pretty obvious that this style has n't cost him any readers . Yet , one ca n't help but feel that this book is treading over well worn ground . The technology being discussed may change , but the style in which it 's discussed does n't . I suppose that Crichton sees no need to change his method . But given his obvious talent , one hopes for a little more than just formula . For Crichton fans , Prey does not disappoint . The book is another excellent display of Crichton 's ability to marry cutting edge ideas with solid action sequences . But , there really is n't anything new in Crichton 's presentation to make the book memorable . Consequently , Prey is much like a roller coaster one has ridden several times : it 's still fun , but it has lost its ability to surprise .
1 #### Crichton 's downhill slide as a writer , it could be argued , dates from the sequel to Jurassic Park . That dreadful book was obviously intended as a basis for a screenplay . Since then , Crichton seems to have been going through the motions . In " Prey " we 're given unformed characters , an absurd plot , and -- most disappointing of all for a Crichton fan -- boring science . Is the writer getting old , or does he care only about the money ? My impression is neither : He just seems bored . And so will you be , if you read this book .
5 #### The bad reviews all surprise me : most of them have all read a lot of Crichton and yet critizice the lack of characters , excessive tech , etc . This is WHY we read Crichton : he makes no bones about it , he likes plot . If it 's " techno , " we 're not gon na worry about the character development . It may not be literature but it sure is fun ... just like Grisham 's legal thillers . I could n't put this book down ... it was everything we 've come to expect from Crichton and I hope we get more . C'm on people ! Do n't be so serious .. this guy is great !
5 #### Great book ; the founding fathers were influenced by Rousseau as well as John Locke , America is in deep trouble we need to read the books by these great patriots .
5 #### Ordered for a class and the best price I could find
4 #### Awesome read , of course ! I read it in college and decided to order and read it again to brush up ; especially since the price was just awesome . I 'm in no way disappointed . Books arrive promptly and on time .
4 #### I give this one 4 of 5 because I think MC is getting a bit too formulaic . That is not to say I did not enjoy this book . I found it to be a little like Jurrasic Park mixed with a spatter of Airframe . Many of Crichton 's recent novels seem to be written with a movie deal in mind , and this is one of those . The pace seemed overly hasty at times and distracted from the action . I long for the Andromeda Strain / Sphere days sometimes . All in all a good read with interesting characters . The last third of the book was quite difficult to follow and made me go back to make sure who was doing what since not very many of the supporting players are fleshed out and much as I would have liked . I did appreciate it being told in the first person by one narrator . If you like Crichton you will like this book . If you do n't like him this is a good thriller that will keep you interested . The subject matter is interesting and makes me fearful for what may come in our society . Kudos to Crichton for taking on an emerging scientific topic and running with it .
3 #### The science is well researched and interesting , but told as too much exposition and not enough worked into the story itself . The characters are reaonably well drawn , and the silicon valley atmosphere ( before the crash ) is recognizable although a little too much of a stereotyype . The first two thirds of the story run well , but starts to get fantastic towards the end and the denouement is a little too far fetched , although if you can manage a willing suspension of disbelief it 's quite thirlling . It does manage to keep you guessing to the end . If you like Crichton you should like this somewhat formulaic novel , and for sci fi fans generally it 's worth a read . Not the kind of book you are likely to read more than once . It does have a good bibliography for those who want to follow up on the science . The Amazon editor provides a good plot outline .
5 #### Not an exciting book , but hey it 's for a class . It 's interesting , however , in the context of Political Philosophy .
5 #### I did n't think that Ardrey ( or anyone else for that matter ) could surpass the excellence of The Territorial Imperative as the standard reference on human socio - political organisation , but I 'm starting to think The Social Contract might just achieve that . I 'm an unabashed Ardrey fan , so perhaps it 's not surprising . Ardrey is a fine , ethical scientist who made no effort to be politically correct . I found this book riveting from the first page to the last , and like Territorial Imperative did some years ago , it formed a watershed in my understanding of the puzzling penchant of my species for warfare in all its many forms . I wish I could give it ten stars .
5 #### Rousseau is a great teacher and student of humanity
5 #### This book has made history and does n't need evaluation . It is a must read for students of social sciences and any body who wants to understand modern era .
4 #### This is one of those books that can receive the cliched comment , " Once you pick this book up , you wo n't want to put it down . " While this is true for most of the book , the ending becomes quite far - fetched ( even for a Crichton sci - fi ) and is ultimately predictable . It follows his tried - and - true formula to a fault . What I found quite pleasant was that this novel was written in the first person , giving it an interesting twist . As usual , the characters seems real , and the story comes to life . All - in - all , this is a good book , but should have had some more work done to it before its release .
2 #### This book has the trademark twists and turns you expect from Crichton but I was not impressed . He could have done better .
5 #### If you value sleep , please pass up on this one . Not because it 's scary ( although , when you think about it , it 's downright terrifying ) , but because you wo n't be able to stand it , wondering what will happen next . I imagine you might know this book will be made into a movie , and some of the scenes might be written with that in mind , scenes that beg for awesome special effects . Crichton does so much research , you have to wonder , " what if ... ? " The theme of technology overtaking society has been around seemingly forever ; however , with the news of a baby clone being born today , you have to wonder ... how long before the scientists lose control ? And how many would it take to ruin things for everyone ? Well , just a small handful .... read this book ! ! ...
2 #### My review wo n't be all that helpful since it 's spur of the moment .. I tried really hard to get into him , I believe perhaps because this was recommended as conservative . Lately I 've been reading 19th century books on socialism , actually 1800s editions , as well as books from the early 20th century , which repeatedly refer to him . It 's no wonder why I could n't get into him ... If you 're looking for more " conservative " or " libertarian " political books , search for Frederick Bastiat , Henry David Thoreau , Ludwig von Mises , Adam Smith , John Locke , Edmond Burke , Francis Bacon , Alexis De Tocqueville , and so forth ... If you 're looking more leftward , try Georg Hegel , Ferdinand Lassalle , Mikhail Bakunin , Nikolay Chernyshevsky , Jacques Pierre Brissot , Etienne - Gabriel Morelly , Gracchus Babeuf or Caius Gracchus , Pierre - Joseph Proudhon , Johann Gottlieb Fichte , Wilhelm Weitling , Antonio Gramsci , Saul Alinsky , Frances Fox Piven , Che Guevara , Mao Zedong , Johann Karl Rodbertus , Noam Chomsky , Julian Borchardt , Henry George , Betty Friedan , Bell Hooks , Simone de Beauvoir , or something like that .
5 #### This is a great theory and I enjoyed comparing it with other great theories . I hope you enjoy it too .
5 #### I love Rousseau because he attacks many subjects almost as if he were blogging way back when . Maybe 2 pages on a topic and then move on to the next topic . Sure , some are more in depth , but it is a nice writing style .
5 #### Nice book that really is relevant to todays situation . Rousseau and other French philosophers helped to shape the founding fathers attitudes . You will definitely get more out of this than those idiot talk shows .
5 #### These books are pretty thin in volume , yet contain many profound ideas that propelled modern democracy to become the most common social order in the West . Although Rousseau famously states that a true democracy is possible only for nation of Gods and he would not characterize current democracies as such , it is worth of reading , given the clarity of his thoughts and few remarkable predictions - e.g. regarding Corsica and Russia .
4 #### It is very interesting to see where some of our American ideals come from and how it actually affects us today .
4 #### For the author the man is born good and society corrupts . It is repetitive in this matter . And is the man who must govern , in a kind of community , a socialism . No absolute monarchies such as Hobbes . No governments elegantly formed as Locke . Used generally by the French revolutionaries of 1789 , the author had really died then . But his ideas were used , misinterpreted as the basis for everything that happened . It was really interesting to read what you wrote , here it is .

5 #### Edition has a very readable translation combined with a reasonable price and " good enuf " binding , materials for an excellent student edition . Have used the Dover Thrift texts in class context for over 10 years .
3 #### Social Contract is rather like celery - Interesting , but unnecessarily chewy , an effort for which one feels in the end somewhat under - recompensed . This is a case where I would recommend reading a summary , as his wording adds nothing and detracts somewhat .
1 #### I have to admit I read the whole thing , although skimming the action sequences would not diminish the book 's value . " Prey " is like a bag of Doritos ; you know its probably not good for you to eat the whole bag , but its hard to stop . Crichton consistently writes down to his audience by inserting technical details in dialogue . " Gee , " said Jack , " Tell me more about those molecules . " At the beginning of the book , I actually thought he was going to develop his characters in a more literary way , then , snap ! Back to the screenplay ( with detailed instructions to the special effects crew . ) I regret putting my hard - earned cash into this entertainer 's pocket . Maybe I can recover some of my loss by selling my " first edition " in an auction ( what was the first edition anyway - 10 million copies ? )
2 #### The synopsis of this book and the blurbs looked very promising and even after it begins you get off to a good start , but soon this book dissolves into a boring plot that is sci fi at its worst . I 've seen this plot elsewhere . I really thought sci fi and humanity would combine forces in this novel to tell a great tale of struggle against a new kind of bad guy and that maybe it contained a message to the future to beware of how far we push the technological envelope . But this promise never fulfilled itself . It 's amazing how quickly this book rocketed to the top . I enjoyed CLONED LOVE and SILICON SECRETS by two unknown authors far more than this book and so will you .
4 #### Perhaps not Crichton 's best book ever , but a solidly gripping tale that will hold your interest . Good suspense . The characters are n't overly interesting , but they get the job done . One of the important things Crichton does with this piece is open the dialogue on the ethics associated with micro- , molecular- , and nano - scale cyber organisms . As he points out in this story , we always think we know what we 're doing when , often , we really have n't come close to grasping the ramifications of our actions . Good food for thought and discussion . Read it !
4 #### I 've " discovered " Michael Crichton long before he made a name for himself having read Sphere and the Andromeda strain when they first came out . Since then Mr. Chrichton has made a quantum leap in terms of the amount of research that goes into each book and in his writting style . As a non - native English reader I find Mr. Crichton 's prose exceptionally easy to read , precise - almost crystal clear . And when it comes to the amount of research that goes into each book this is well beyond what any other fiction author would do . There is indeed a swarm ( albeit one formed by more intelligent independent agents that those forming the book 's swarm ) researching each book . The results are always cutting edge and , to a large extent , educational for the layman reader . A most enjoyable book -which I could not put down- combining an exceptionally interesting theme , fast moving plot and excellent prose . I just took one star off for what one could call slightly excessive " poetic ( or rather , scientific ) license " .
3 #### Even if you 're not thrilled with his book , you have to appreciate Chrichton 's attempt to get the science right . Crichton certainly did his homework in order to spin his tale in the most realistic , plausible way .
5 #### This is such an interesting read and the relevance and deep wisdom is evident on every page . Although it was written hundreds of years ago , there is so much to learn about human nature , politics and life and the author is relatively clear in his thoughts . I 'm not sure what type of reader would find this book interesting but it 's historical importance and general political nature makes it relevant to any study of mankind .
3 #### This goes a long way to helping us understand how to fit into a society while also seeking own individual will . An important work for social scientists , philosophers , and humankind more generally .
5 #### Anyone wishing to study political philosophy should read this for sure . It sets up the standard theory for the structure of society as the social contract or pact that is made up of the passive state and active sovereign . Within this The Prince rules . Jean - Jacques Rousseau adheres to his political beliefs and especially his strengths in knowledge of the state of nature of sociey that must turn to its general will and its body politic to achieve its goals . All is brilliant in this book except the end , and although Rousseau has an extremely strong point of view , it criticizes Christianity a bit too harshly without giving enough merit for what it represents . There is much knowledge to be gained in reading this book as Jean - Jacques Rousseau shows he is a master in politics and an important figure in World history due to his implicit wisdom and authority on the subject . It is a masterpiece on the philosophy of World politics .
4 #### I 'm still not entirely certain how to take Rousseau . He seems self - certain , but I read this as his own naivete . The work is often quotable , but without getting too far into detail I am troubled with the sometimes ambiguous nature of the text . This allows for multiple readings and interpretations which trouble me . However , I do understand how this can be a foundational text for enlightenment and post - enlightenment thinkers , so I will not allow myself to be troubled and just accept the work as an important historical document .
5 #### What a marvel to see the magnificent truth of the master 's work 250 years after he postulated it . What a treat to read Cole 's translation side - by - side with the original French to see how closely he followed the intent and phraseology . What a surprise to discern the deeply - held Christian views of this acclaimed free - thinker who is so often misused by the secular , progressive socialists of our day . Merci , M. Rousseau !
4 #### This book has very good points , it is a little long winded at times . It is a classic text of the enlightenment . Overall I would consider it a worth while read ....
5 #### When are you going to start teaching true classic literature such as this in your public schools ? Great , must read , for anybody who believes in human rights .
5 #### Not since " Jurassic Park " has Michael Crichton written a novel as simply entertaining and spellbinding as " Prey " . The plot is straightforward : a Silicon Valley - based start - up 's experiment in the blend of nano - technology and biological engineering has gone horribly wrong , creating a sinister yet virtually invisible malevolence . Jack Forman , an unemployed programmer married to an executive of the errant startup , becomes the unsuspecting and reluctant hero . To establish a foundation of credibility , Crichton must devote some time to the basic science involved . But while some have found these interludes dry or unnecessary , I found these brief side roads fascinating - highly relevant to the story , expertly distilled to the layman 's perspective , and well - blended with the story line . The parallels between distributed programming , for example , and highly socialized animal communities - like termites - added a dimension to this thriller that few contemporary writers besides Crichton could pull off . Some will have problems with the liberties taken with the science , while others will take issue with Crichton 's obvious political views of the subject matter . My advice : forget the politics and the science - just sit back and be prepared to enjoy one of the best yarns of the last decade .
5 #### After the last few disappointing novels , I was worried that this might be another hack - made - for - movie book . But , it is much more than that . My eyes are blurry , since I read this in one sitting . I could n't put it down and it scared me to death . I had heard something about nanotechnology , but really did n't understand its potential implications . Jack Forman the leading character has depth . There are the usual Crichton precocious kids , but he does n't use them to explain the science ... thank goodness . A few of the other leading characters are cardboard , but it is with reason .
4 #### Michael Cricton 's story telling pattern is pretty predictable . His story line is rooted in modern research , ( how many other fictional thriller novel 's do you know that end with an appendix of cited sources ) , where the outcome is carried to a plausible fictional extreme and wrapped up in a tightly told tale of adventure and mystery . Not that this is bad thing , this pattern offers plenty of room to write original story lines , and in the end Crichton knows how to spin a great yarn . This book brings together nano - technology , computer software and gnome technology . I did n't find this book as good as TimeLine , which was a great book , quite similar to DoomsDay in many regards , but much tighter to read . Nonetheless I enjoyed this book as a quick read , a brief past - time pause , like a cool lemonade on a hot day , refreshing even though it does n't last that long . [ ... ]
2 #### In Prey Michael Crichton rehashes the story of Jurassic Park , except this time instead of dinosaurs you have a swarm of killer nano - bots and instead of an island it takes place in the desert . The book reads like the screenplay he is sure to develop from it and quite frankly he should have just skipped the whole writing a book and gone straight to Hollywood . It 's a fast read and an ok story , but wait for the paperback .
4 #### Chricton gripped me once again after Timeline , with the introduction of nanotechnology , something foreign to me until this book . But , aside from the technology that Chricton delves in to ( as usual ) , the story kept me turning the pages . What held me the most was the antagnost that was neither phantomesque nor man , but something one may never conceive of . The story did tend to dwindle a bit toward the end , but it was a quick read . Chricton is now officially out of the dog house for giving us Airframe .

3 #### I picked up a copy of this book in a shop in Hong Kong with high expectations . I had heard of it but had not yet read it and was rather shocked to find an english language copy in a place like Hong Kong . It is very persuasive in some of it 's arguments but is essentially little more than a book advocating totalitarian government systems and as I read it I could n't help but wonder if the former Texas governer had a member of his staff read it to him sometime during his recent administration . Aside from a few clever quotations and a few speechlike chapters this book is little more than a more elegant political pundit book . It proves little more than one Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh would reason if they had a stronger command of the English language . One difference would be that Rousseau believed , at least in some parts of the book , that religion weakened government .
3 #### I do n't see how someone like Rousseau could ever write a book with " social " in the title . The woman lived alone on the island for over 16 years . She is clearly disturbed .
5 #### The issues of liberty and democracy , monarchy and legitimacy , are never better explained that in The Social Contract by Rousseau . Rousseau explains every thought on to the page , from the most abstract thoughts of the ideal society to every day issues of Lobbying ( which he finds a major detriment to society ) and Suffrage ( which Rousseau demands of society ) . The book is wonderfully written , every word is deliberate ( I must pay my respect for the translator on such a splendid job ) and shows how important understanding language is in order to understand the great ideas that are discussed by language . Liberals will see this book as a beautiful light of democracy , conservatives might see this book as proof of authoritarian beliefs . The truth is that both can be read in the book . Because the book not only conveys to the reader what Rousseau thinks , it inspires the reader to think for him or her self .
2 #### From the late 1700s to the mid 1800s , Western and central Europe put forth several major works of literature that examined the relationship between men , and between men and society . These include On Liberty by J. S. Mill , Leviathan by T. Hobbes , Capital by K. Marx , and The Social Contract by Frenchman Jean Jacques Rousseau . This book examines the origins , nature , logic , and inner workings of relationships between three entities . These entities are man the individual , men as in a collection of individuals , and the state , where the state includes laws , government , and other institutions . I first read this book in a high school class . I tried to read it later when in college . I could not finish this book either time ; this is the most difficult book I have ever read . Unlike other discourses on politics , this book is heavily influenced by philosophy , and written like a text in philosophy . I would not recommend it for any but the most determined reader .
5 #### Rousseau made a following statement : " Men was born free , and everywhere he is in chain . There are some who may believe themselves masters of others , and are no less enslaved than they . " In this book he was advising how the King should have interacted with citizens and not subjects .
1 #### The first section of this book was good , but after that it was downhill all the way ! ! I had to stop reading it after a certain point , ( the first 160 pages or so ) , as it was so boring ! Prey takes us into the story of a mechanical plaque , and the desparate efforts of scientists to stop it . It speaks a lot of nantechnology and artificial disturbed intelligence . The plot was weak and never really picked up again . I would n't waste my money on this book !
3 #### Crichton used to be my favorite author before being replaced by Preston and Child . I like Crichton 's books because they usually have an interesting premise and are enfused with technological information . Preston and Child are also able to create fascinating plots by blending historical events , biochemistry , and the supernatural . However , while Preston and Child 's books seem polished with excellent character development and dialogue , Crichton 's recent books have been short with thin character development and awkward dialogue . The pages are filled with blank space adding to the appearance that this is really a short story and not a novel . Crichton 's books are most interesting when he describes what a character is thinking of doing and not when they are speaking . There just is n't enough of this material to justify a full length novel . The book kept my attention , but it is not Crichton 's best work .
3 #### Prey starts out slow with the domestic life of the main character . It is only about 100 pages into the book that the plot begins to get interesting . Be sure to stick with it even though the first few chapters are a bore . Once Prey starts going it is hard to put down , and many plot twists keep you on the edge of your seat . There are , however , some major flaws . The book 's subject matter seems very far - fetched . It is hard to imagine that something similar to the events in the book could actually happen . Also , the science that lays the foundation for the book was very complex and hard for me to understand . Next , the ending is confusing and leaves a fair number of questions unanswered . Prey will be enjoyed by fans of Crichton , like me , but those not familiar with his work would be advised to pass Prey by . He has written better books , that are more interesting and easier to understand .
5 #### Crichton 's latest , a combination of scientific technology with fictional futuristic possibilities , is a thrill ride from start to finish . Jack Forman , househusband , is looking for another job while taking care of his three children . Wife Julia is a vice president at Xymos , where they are using nanotechnology , manufacturing molecule - sized devices , such as cameras , that can be inserted into the bloodstream to view all areas of the body . Convinced Julia is having an affair , Jack notices her tremendous mood swings and late working hours . Hired as a consultant at Xymos to fix problems on a program that he designed , Jack travels to their manufacturing facility in the middle of the Nevada desert . Switching identities from the neglected suspicious househusband , Jack suddenly becomes immersed in technology gone awry . Lack of proper venting at the plant has caused particles to be released into the environment , where swarms are created and seem to be multiplying . The technological aspects of this novel become more complex , adding depth to this read which increases in pace , thereby immersing the reader in Jack 's fight to destroy the predatory swarms before they destroy him and others . The plausibility of Crichton 's nanotechnology transforms this brilliant novel from mere sci - fi into a frightening look at future technology .
3 #### Since you can read about characters , themes and storylines elsewhere let me go right to the point : what kind of reading experience does this book provide ? Crichton is always best read for the way he handles plot , he is a master of the cliff - hanger . At the end of chapters , and , in this novel , even in the small subsections of the chapters , Crichton manages some real zingers that propel the reader to turn page after page . However be cautioned , nearly a third of the novel is a waist of time . For example , the opening chapters while providing some set up , drag due to trite humor about the central character 's life as a stay - at - home dad . But the real flaw is a final section that stretches credulity beyond the limits , falling to the level of C grade sci - fi horror . There 's even goo involved ! The other two thirds crackle along at a very entertaining pace , amusing the reader in the best Crichton fashion . Not a total loss , but not his best .
3 #### The title " Prey " is , presumably , derived from the " predatorprey " programming used to create swarms of predatory particles on behalf of the United States Military . In short , things get out of hand and the particles esacpe into the surrounding desert [ bad subcontractors ] only to adapt to - and take advantage of - the surrounding environment as they kill everything in sight . The problem is , the action takes place in such a limited area , involving so few people that the novel loses its punch . Granted , the concept worked well for a very similarly themed screenplay , " The Thing , " but swarms of collectively intelligent - and malicious - nanoparticles just screams FULL SCALE ATTACK ON MAJOR URBAN CENTER . I can see the U.S. Special Forces playing cat - and - mouse with an elusive enemy that contines to outmanuever them ... and so on . Unfortunately , I was n't in on the plot - making process . My suggestion : Wait until the book comes out in paperback .
3 #### I 've been an avid fan of Crichton since the start . His style of writing combines technical details with a sense of adventure I 've rarely found with other writers . In Prey the premise made me purchase his book as soon as I saw it . The first half was great , building suspense for the next chapter . However , the second half fell short , and I thought I was reading a screen play for the movie of the week . I expected more . As books go I would recommend it as a good technothriller , but not up to Crichton 's usual par . I tend to reread his work again and again . This one I 'll save for a lazy day at the beach after I 've read everything else .
5 #### The best science fiction has always been somewhat preachy . In the fifties we were warned on atomic dangers ( " The Day the Earth Stood Still " ) and in the seventies , environmental terror was a frequent theme . Now Crichton warns us against the intersection of technology , computer science and biology in a masterful work reminiscent of Hitchcock 's The Birds . Swarms of microscopic molecular computers which are programmed to mimic predators in the wild , rapidly evolve into shaft shifting artificial organisms which threaten the survival of their human creators . Jack Forman , recently unemployed software engineer , finds life as a fulltime stay at home dad frustrating especially since his wife 's career in nanotechnology is spectacularly successful . Unknown to Jack his program which mimics predator / prey behavior has been incorporated in his wife 's product . After something goes terribly wrong Jack is dispatched to reign in the mutating artificial creatures . It is a trip fraught with danger and clever plot twists . Alfred Hitchcock would have made a hell of a movie out of this one !
5 #### I first read the Social Contract back in college . Then , it was but one piece of philosophy / political writings out of many . I ran across the book again a few months ago and decided to give it a second reading . I was very happy that I did . In these uncertain times , the truth and role of government becomes cloudy . Rousseau 's work helped to remind me that the government should serve the people and humanity in general . This is an idea that really seems to have been lost , especially under the Bush administration . Although I do not agree with everything Rousseau writes , I would recommend this work to anyone to read this and reflect on its modern context . " Man was born free , and he is everywhere in chains . "
5 #### This work attests to the application of human freedoms within the context of organizational structures and governmental institutions . The author explains how the general or collective will intervenes when it is proper to do so . In addition , the will is believed to be omnipotent . In the long run , states tend to act in ways that promote self - preservation and perpetuation . Governments are divided into democracies , monarchies , royalties and in other organizational frameworks consistent with accomplishing a variety of missions . The State is far removed from the family . Nevertheless , it is charged with promulgating laws and conventions agreeable to the general or collective will . This work is an important contribution to comparative governmental organizations and structures . It explains the applicable rationale for implementing political distinctions of virtually every variety and type .
2 #### ' The tyranny of the majority ' - a brilliant phrase coined by the author of ' Democracy In America ' and a brilliant chink in the armour of Rousseau 's societal vision . An individual who owes everything to the state can not conceivably be called an ' individual . ' They are , rather , reduced to being an automated cog in the wheel of human motion . Their very individuality is subsumed to serve the will of the collective . This can not be right . Minorities must be protected . If not , they will find a way . However , I agree , as Orwell did , that there must be a rejection of ' every form of man 's dominion over man . ' We are equal but different . This paradox resists neat hyperbole .
4 #### Deeply influential book , " The Social Contract " is a " must read " for anybody interested in the history of political ideas , or even in history . It had a big influence on the French Revolution , and in many movements after it that considered that the individual owes everything to the state . After reading this book you will be astounded by the insight that Rousseau ( 1712 - 1778 ) showed . He explains us , among other things , the reason for the formation of political society , and the origin of the social contract . I believe this is a good book to start a study on political ideas . It is simple and well written , it has had an important political impact and can make you curious enough to know more . If you are interested , read also a book about the history of political ideas ( for example the one written by George Sabine ) , because it can guide you to other interesting books , and can give you a deeper insight into the ideas , circumstances and life of Rousseau .
4 #### Jean Jacques Rousseau is truly a great intellectual . His Discourses and The Social Contract are some of the best in Enlightenment thinking . In the Discourses Rousseau exalts the " noble " savage free from the corrupting influence of modern civilization . He believes that civilization has corrupted man from his original , yet ignorant state . I found the Discourses to be a little flighty and unrealistic . The Social Contract was a different story altogether . This is a monumental work . In it Rousseau shows his vast knowledge of the Roman Republic and Empire and the reasons for it 's rise and collapse . Rousseau also denounces monarchy and aristocracy as forms of government and exalts republicanism . He also decries the power of organized religion in the oppression of mankind . With his " General Will " theory of the social contract he shows true brilliance . A great buy .
3 #### This highly quotable book has a lot of fundamental democratic principles - though many seem borrowed . This text , at least in translation , is hardly lively or personal . It is more of a political theorist 's attempt to break things down for its target audience ( the one its ideas are cocnerned with ) - the people . Some of Rousseau 's beleifs regarding personal freedoms are rather cynical , and considering that he is writing a revolutionary free - thinking text , he seems to objectify his own theories more than is warranted while dismissing other possibilities . Still , Rousseau 's vision of social will compromising personal freedoms in the name of social progress is nothing if not untuitively appealing . Some of his musings regarding socioeconomic factors and political attitudes are understandably cockamaney considering the lack of resources for sociological research druing his time . His discussion of liberty with regard to indirect representation is a critical one and should be read by all lovers of freedom - even " freedom in chains . "
3 #### First off , I accidentally read two sentences in the front sleeve , and then I read the excerpt before page 1 , and I immediately knew what the problem was , and how the problem would be solved . Unfortunately , Crichton decided to spend half the book building a mystery that is answered on the front sleeve of the book . The mystery falls flat , as the main character thinks his wife is cheating . Of course , that is not true , but it takes Crichton a heck of lot of time to get to the point . His " insights " into Silicon Valley are pretty much an extrapolation of stereotypes . About 140 pages into it , he finally starts the darn book as the main character gets to Nevada . It 's a finally action packed , fluid , and fun , despite the fact that it feels like a blatant [ take ] of the movie Tremors . But hey , it was a good movie . Just replace worms with nano - particles , and you 've got the same thing . Then , in the ending , it gets truly surreal with the typical hack ending . The last twenty pages are pretty much a yawner . His classic fluidity , and the 100 pages of action are what makes this book somewhat enjoyable . Without a doubt , one of his worst books . Timeline and now this . It seems like Crichton 's career is just about winding down . Maybe he and Tom Clancy can move in with other Al Gore , MC Hammer , Michael Jordan , and other has beens .
3 #### I loved his earlier work , but this one even though a great concept really fells apart in later part of the book , you can actually out run airborne nano particles , an okay book , not a great one .
4 #### This most recent novel by Michael Crichton is another deep expression of concern about the misuse of science and technology by future - blind , irresponsible scientists and corporations bent only on the ' bottom - line ' ; and as a result , blind as to the dire consequences of their actions . As he writes in the introduction , ' ... our self - deluded recklessness will collide with our growing technological power . ' In fact , this has been Crichton 's pre - occupation for over twenty - five years , beginning with one of his first novels , ' The Terminal Man . ' His most successfiul novel to date , ' Jurassic Park ' , expressed this concern in no uncertain terms - genetics gone terribly wrong - in this case , however , nature retaliates in the form of dangerous dinosaurs . In ~Prey~ the new villian takes the form of self - reproducing machines - nanoparticles or micro - robots - a highly creative merging of nanotechnology , biotechnology and computer science . What I personally enjoy about all Crichton 's novels , is that you never come away from the reading experience without learning something . The man does immaculate research for each project and it shows . This novel is no different . Crichton fans will not be disappointed with this novel because it reads at a cracking pace , maintaining tension until the last page . ~Prey~ is a highly informative and entertaining read .
3 #### Rousseau 's treatise on the nature of people and their government has left a lasting imprint on political discourse . Though at times passionate and persuasive , most of the short book was simply too vague for Rousseau 's semantic games to be indisputable , and sometimes even comprehensible . Some of his ideas are simply wrong , such as the " noble savage " , while others quite clearly debatable , such as the social contract itself . I , for one , would fear to live in Rousseau 's ideal world , where every right I have is only mine so long as the majority ( who never can be wrong ) wills it . Whether you agree with him or not , plowing through Rousseau 's 150 pages is a necessity for anyone who wants to carry on high - level political discourse .
2 #### 200 years ca n't make a bad idea good . ( Heck , Christianity has proved that 1700 years ca n't make a bad idea good ) Rousseau bogs himself down in the same contradiction that has plagued all followers of the right hand path- the fact that there is no " great return " destroys his entire thesis . Skip this guy- read Thomas Hobbes , Nicolo Machiavelli , or Friedrich Nietzsche . They were political philosophers . Rousseau was just a sophist .
3 #### Rousseau 's " Contract Social " has originated many false beliefs that are , though sometimes unwittingly , still even entertained today , such as the " Noble Savage " , the originary state of the individual ( allegedly in a condition of primordial solitude and self - relaince ) , a social bond or contract ( the historicity of which is extremely suspect ) by which separate individuals agree to form a social union ( a society or polity ) and the gross fallacy of the innate goodness of man . This work , the product of a morbidly paranoid Genevan who had the callousness and audacity to leave his five children abandoned in an orphanage , owes its impact mainly to the fire of its eloquence rather than to any of its ideas , which are of no lasting merit . Like a thunderstorm , it cleared the air , only to pass ...
5 #### Elucidating the fundamental tenets of social welfare and humanitarianism which have yet to be achieved in most of the world , Rousseaufs gSocial Contracth remains one of humanities greatest literary achievements . Page after riveting page , Rousseau outlines his advocacy of universal emancipation , anti - authoritarianism and equality of condition . Rousseaufs gSocial Contracth is controversial only in that much of what he wrote has proven to be historically irrefutable and , sadly , more relevant than ever in todayfs in - egalitarian world .
4 #### This book is going to make a great movie , just like Jurassic Park . Remember how Jurasic Park 's theme was that nature can not be harnessed ? I can not give this book a 5 star rating ( save those for " The Count of Monte Cristo " or " Pillars of the Earth " ( Ken Follet ) . However , Prey is a good read . I could not put it down until I read the whole thing - it made me late for work .
4 #### Crichton 's latest novel shows he 's still at the top of his game , and he carries us along on a fast - paced thrill ride filled with horror and suspense . Crichton 's books generally center on some new and potentially disastrous technology ( i.e. the dinosaur cloning in Jurassic Park ) , and in Prey he addresses nanotechnology . In the near future , he warns , these tiny machines may group into a " swarm " and rapidly evolve into a threatening intelligence . This is the premise the hero of Prey races to resolve , as he also tries to find a new job , deal with his wife 's adultery , and take care of his kids . The plot details are well summarized by others , so I wo n't go into them . Although in many ways this novel is typical Crichton fare , I found it more horrifying than most of his other works , reminiscent of King . Although there are perhaps a few too many coincidences in Prey , Crichton 's introduction does a good job of telling us that nanotechnology is coming whether we like it or not , and must be thought about and dealt with before it is too late .
2 #### Given several hot new techs to play with , Crichton mangles his ambitious introduction to the promise and perils of each . Long - winded , particularly at the beginning ( easily half the book is consumed by character development that eventually goes nowhere ) , even still somehow the setup is left half - baked by the time an attempt to patch plot - holes appears at the end . Scenes stolen from " Fantastic Voyage " and " Aliens " appear without the benefit of Racquel Welch or Sigourney Weaver . I agree with another reviewer - this book reads more like Koontz than Crichton ( that claim not intended to impugn the former ! ) . What a disappointment - would be rated a three , but docked a point since it comes from a master .
4 #### This book caught me by surprise , I did n't expect to like it but Mr. Crichton captured my attention from the start . I usually shy away from a story that gets to technical but he kept the tech material interesting . I also was plesantly surprised that he wrote in the first person , which in this story , made the context real and more believable . I highly reccomend this book .
5 #### Excellent book . Not Crichton 's best , however . Read Sphere if you want to read Crichton at his best .
4 #### It 's 2009 and Jack Forman , software whiz at Media Tronics , is fired the day after he tells his lawyer about the corruption at the company . Pretty much blackballed in Silicon Valley , Jack functions as a stay at home dad while his wife Julia pursues a high - powered career in venture capital working on the Xymos deal . Xymos bills itself as the world leader in molecular manufacturing and is marketing its ability to create nanoparticles that can be injected into the bloodstream and project images of everything they pass through in the human body . This is all in the first twenty - two pages . For the next hunderd pages or so the story bogs down , weaving together the tension in Jack and Julia 's marriage with a lot of scientific backdrop for the climax to come . Then the action shifts to the Xymos plant in the Nevada desert where the nanoparticles are being produced . Jack is brought out to fix some software that Media Tronics created for Xymos and discovers that the nanoparticles have taken on a life of their own . From here on you can just imagine the special effects in the movie that will ultimately be made . Jack goes from one impossible situation to the next in his effort to save the world from the evils of a scientific miracle gone awry . Enjoy the action for what it is , but do n't get too hung up on Crichton 's message that advances in computer and biotechnology may converge to precipitate the end of the world .
1 #### Is this book just evidence to support his divorce ? Does his x - wife get the rights , so he just wants to punish her ? As usual , he is on the cutting edge of technology , but all he seems to want to do is write a mysogonists diatribe against women and mothers . I guess this book should be used in writing class to teach why someone going through a divorce should not write . I went to school with this 6'4 baskeball star , but all he does in this one is"dribble " and " foul out" . More Nano - lit than nano - tech .
4 #### not up to usual Crichton standards . Like another reveiwer , I felt as though we got an abridged version . The plot is engaging and the science is interesting , but this story could have been another Jurassic Park at the microscopic level but never achieves the grandeur of that great novel . I felt cheated by this novel , mainly because I have come to expect so much from Crichton and this book simply does not reach the quality I am used to from this talented author . Nevertheless , I still give it 4 stars because it is better reading than just about anything out there .
4 #### Well , if I could have I would have given this book 4 and half , and I wanted to take a half away for two really shallow reasons . Although I really enjoyed this book , it 's fast , ca n't put down reading , I really had no idea what Mr. Crichton was talking about most of the time!!!!I kept asking my husband questions concerning the science in this book , and well , that aside , I really enjoyed it . The second shallow reason I took a half away , was the ending . I wanted about 2 or 3 more pages , things wrapped a little more ...... but that 's just me , because I normally like my endings like that . So ... read this book , you will enjoy it .
5 #### This is his best since the Andromeda Strain ! I sat up half the night finishing it ; a real page turner . SIX stars
3 #### A little slow getting started , like a roller coaster , then hang on . Get in line for your movie tickets . A fast , educational thrill ride .
4 #### Crichton is finally back in his prime , covering what he does best : fact- and science - based fiction . This time around , he 's got the good sense to not let the book degenerate into a direct - to - video scripted action sequence halfway through the book ( read Timeline if that 's what you 're looking for ) . Having read all of Crichton 's books ( including Travels ) , I can say that Prey is one of the better ones , combining the how - cool - is - that aspect of technology ( Jurassic Park ) with the confusion and paranoia of being attacked by a force that 's not well understood ( Sphere ) . What puts the icing on the cake is that Crichton has again written a great character that 's fleshed out a lot more than his usual protagonists . Long - time readers might even be distraught at the amount of character development that exist within Prey . All in all , a satisfying read , although not the most intellectually challenging .
1 #### I really enjoyed this plot when I saw it on STAR TREK TNG a decade ago . . . This is a far cry from the originality he displayed in THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN . Futuristic stories that are based on humanity like in the novel CLONED LOVE is the road to originality in the sci - fi world . This novel fails to bridge that gap .
4 #### Michael Crichton has the rare intellect and ability to synthesize the most daunting scientific postulates and theories into a language that is easy to grasp for those for whom microscopic technology is an endless enigma . His new novel " Prey"is a frightening , horrific venture into the potentially destructive manifestations when molecular engineering detours off a contolled course . The main protagonist , Jack Forman has been laid off from a prestigous programming position in Silicon Valley and has been relegated toa " Mr Mom " role while his wife , Julia is vice president of a corporation involed in the manufacturing and harvesting of molecular particles which could revolutionize architectural structures and even delicate medical procedures with more innovative instruments . Problems arise when particles amalgamate into swarms and develop the capacity to become not only self sustaining and predatory . Jack has the ability to halt the scourge of these rabid , destructive particles before the repercussions are epidemic and disastrous for humanity on the whole . " Prey " is riveting in its impact and a cautionary tale which if not heeded ould lead to a holocaust generated by mans tampering with microscopic components that they do not understand fully . " Prey " really dramatizes the Walt Kelly quotation from Pogo " We have met the enemy and they is us " For in this novel , man has definitely sown the seed for its unintentional obliteration .
4 #### I read this book over two days . It 's definitely a page - turner in the same league as The Andromeda Strain or Jurassic Park . But best of all , it gets down to the science of " science fiction " in ways I think some of his other novels ( Disclosure , The Lost World ) seem to have neglected . While it 's not " hard science fiction " ( e.g. , the sample computer code in the novel does n't even make an attempt at looking like a recognizable programming language ) , it has enough scientific detail to keep the SF fan interested . The characters are also surprisingly well - thought - out , especially for a Crichton novel ( where the characters are normally not nearly as important as the concepts ) . All in all , I would recommend this book to SF fans who were interested in a good read , or any reader who is interested in being introduced to Crichton 's writing .
5 #### Prey is Crichton at his best . Meet Jack , out - of - work , software designer who has become a house husband . Meet Jack 's wife Julia , super committed executive on the cutting edge of the biotech field . Meet Jack 's kids , a baby with a fever rash that is cured by an MRI and a son who sees ghosts . Meet Julia 's co - workers ( those that are still alive ) , they are just a little bit strange . Crichton takes us to a world where science meets ethics . Naturally , ethics fails when it meets the bottom line . Just as Jurassic Park warned us about the dangers of tampering with things not fully understood , Prey opens a world where can it be done is never balanced with should it be done . To say more would give the thrill away . Prey is a truly frightening novel and I was up way past my bedtime finishing it . This one book that is a MUST MUST read ! But keep a light just in case the black cloud shows up .
5 #### you collect cook books - this is one to have - just nice many pictures and good recipes with lots of info
5 #### First off , the photography is magnificent . The book is almost too nice to cook from , so I copy recipes and retains its new look . Each recipe has a large , color photograph , and the text is easy to read . I 've been trying to cook my way thru this for years . So far , everything has been delicious and certainly different . This would be a great gift for the cook on your list .
5 #### Excellent service , prompt delivery , excellent condition as described , packaged well . Would use again .
2 #### Bleaah . Another of Lorenza de Medici 's big , unwieldy books of gorgeous pictures of Italian scenery paired with mediocre recipes . The text , not written by de Medici , has several silly errors , saying that sugar cane came from the New World and pumpkins from the Old , which is backwards . The recipes are better than in some of her other cookbooks , where we were treated to a gorgeous picture of , for example , croque monsieur , which is n't Italian and is n't really a recipe . But not much better . Vegetarians might go for many of them , since they are supposed to be from the peasant kitchens , where meat was , until recently , seldom seen . Yet the recipes are dull enough . Steamed asparagus topped with butter and lemon is , indeed , a fine dish , but not really a recipe . The food illustrations are punk , well under the gorgeous picture of croque monsieur , for example . The full page pictures of Italy are superb , though , if you like that sort of thing .
5 #### This oversized book is full of beautiful photographs . Each recipe is accompanied by a large color photograph , as well as its region of origin and Italian and English names . Italian cuisine is explored by region , with spectacular photos and an engaging essay on the cuisine of each of the following regions : il Nord - Ovest , il Nord - Est , il Centro , il Sud , e le Grandi Isole . This is a cookbook not only to use in the kitchen , but also to peruse for an enjoyable view of Italian landscapes and a taste of Italian culinary history and regional cuisine .
5 #### ITALY : THE BEAUTIFUL COOKBOOK is just that - a book brimming with known dishes and as well as rarities from throughout Italy presented in a format so well designed , filled with excellent photography , and thorough information about the country that it could rest as comfortably on the traveler 's coffee table as in the gourmet 's kitchen . Lorenza De'Medici takes the reader on an insider 's tour of Italy with readable maps , stunning photographs of each region , information about the peculiar characteristics of the regions that inform the recipes , and then gives some of the finest recipes you 'll likely to encounter for dishes both simple and complex . As with the best of cookbooks this one contains images that show how the result of the time spent in the kitchen will look . De'Medici writes with candor and in a relaxed inviting style . This survey of Italian culinary arts and the historic background that accompanies them is as fine as any similar book on the market . Highly recommended . Grady Harp , December 05
5 #### I brought this book some years ago and have continued to enjoy using the book as much for recepies as for the images of Italy provided . In the introduction there is a short history of eating habits and how they evolved in Italy . A lovely map also is provided so you can see where the areas spoken about actually lie in the country . From here each section has a short introduction to the region and then the recepies follow . I have found the meals easy to make and yummy to eat . The accompaning photos are just wonderful , as they give a glimspe of Italy and stimulate the taste buds as well . Since travelling to Italy I have come to appreciate this book even more .
2 #### I own and love my Mexico the Beautiful Cookbook , so I decided to invest , and at 50 dollars it IS an investment , in the Italian edition . I was severely dissapointed in it . The photography is indeed as beautiful as the Mexico book , but the recipes are rather blah . I greatly prefer my books by Marcella Hazzan , especially her Essentials of Classical Italian Cooking . After using Hazzan 's books , this one left me cold . I gave it away , and that is rare , as I collect cookbooks . Save your money .
5 #### I read this book first when I was a teenager . It really touched me and made me think . What a beautiful journey I was taken on ! I would recommend this to good souls everywhere .
5 #### I read this 30 years ago . I still love it .
5 #### This has been an inspiration to students aged 11 to 14 when I would read aloud extracts , for religious studies ( at a Presbyterian ( private ) secondary school , and for science in general social studies and reading classes . It 's also been my " go to " when wanting a spiritual boost . Interesting that early editions met with moral indignation from some christians , so the Archbishop of Canterbury wrote a Foreword for the 2005 edition . ( Illustration from the book , drawn by the great Papas
5 #### An old favorite book of mine that I had n't read in years . Loved listening to it .
5 #### I read this book many years ago and it changed my life . I just purchased this copy as a gift for my Pastor . I highly recommend Mister God ! You will be introduced to aspects of God you never dreamed of , I assure you , and all of them from the mouth of a 4 - year - old girl ! Yes , it 's possible to learn from a very small child ! Anna lived to the ripe old age of 7 years , then died from an accident , but in her short 2 1/2 years with Finn , she made an impact on his heart which lasted a lifetime and I think she 'll do the same for you ! You need to take the time to read this book thoroughly and carefully - a cursory reading will have little meaning .
4 #### Wonderful book ! Language a little hard to understand at times .
4 #### Still in process of reading . Love the insights this small child has .
5 #### you actually feel from flynn 's perspective . would reccommend the book that also has anna 's drawings and her own writings as well as this story . have read this many times and am now 52 yrs . old and still find this uplifting and still brings tears and smiles .
5 #### I gave this as a gift to my niece , for when I was her age , I loved it . It 's a heartwarming story -- very natural -- God oriented , but without religious dogma nor emphasis on " The Lord " , " Jesus " , or traditional Churchianity . Nevertheless , it is gentle and very uplifting . God bless -- C
5 #### The book was mind blowing . I have spent much time since I finished reading pondering the depth of thought and new insights I received . The book arrived on time and good condition , a little yellow with age but no writing in the book . The content is a 10 star amazing , make you think book !
5 #### Love this book . Bought extra to give out to friends .
5 #### This is my favorite book ever . I 've read and re - read it . I 've bought dozens of copies to share with people I love . Reading this book is life altering . You 'll have a whole new understanding of " Mister God " after reading this book . I highly recommend it .
5 #### This is my favorite book ever . I 've read and re - read it . I 've bought dozens of copies to share with people I love . Reading this book is life altering . You 'll have a whole new understanding of " Mister God " after reading this book . I highly recommend it .
5 #### A book I have often recommended ; it is wonderful ! Dolores
5 #### I have loved this book since I was fifteen ( over 35 years ago ) , introducing a new generation to Anna now . Wonderful way of helping to make our relationship to Spirit , people , animals , places and things so simple and uncomplicated . I betcha Anna 's Mister God thinks so too . You can not go wrong with this one ..... you will laugh , you will cry and you will never forget Anna 's life lessons . Would buy again .
5 #### This was / is a fantastic book that I read in the 90 's when I believe it first came out . Then last year I bought 4 copies & sent to friends who had never heard of it and one who heard me give a review of it when she was only 15 ! Needless to say I am so sorry that a movie was n't made of the story of this extremely intelligent " child " of the Universe ! But I understood the author 's feelings .
4 #### The cover was yellowed and faded but I was very happy to replace my lost copy ...
5 #### Love this book and share it with as many people as I can . Fabulous theological insights far beyond what most people even consider . Should be a must read for every systematic theology class in seminary !
5 #### Touching and profound . What may appear as common " new age " lessons should be a reason to re - read it without expectation or interpretation . Anna Lives ! And because of her , so does Fynn .
5 #### One of my favorite books ever ! I must have read it 10 times already . It is such an uplifting story and to think it 's real is just great . I have purchased copies for several friends and family . If you want to feel closer to God and see Him through the eyes of someone very near and dear , this is a great book . Anna is an amazingly insightful , precocious , and loving child . Her relationship to God , in spite of her circumstances is nothing less than awesome .
5 #### Heart - tugging story that will change your view on life and make you see the world and religion in a whole new light . Anna 's simple faith and amazingly brilliant insights will touch your heart and soul . Anyone who comes into contact with this pint - sized angel will be forever changed .
5 #### Thought provoking book which I first purchased many years ago , re - reading it several times , and now purchasing one for a friend , ( who loved it ) . The true story of a little girl that comes into the life of a young man . Each of them changing the life of the other in a tender and wonderful way . Makes you think . Many " aha " moments .
5 #### One thinks of this book as something for the younger generation , but here in my 70th year I found it appealing and profound in so many ways . Although I would recommend it for younger readers , a little more maturity is required to pick out all the shades simple faith and understanding of this child 's relationship with God . I will read it again ....
5 #### One of my all - time favourites , that I could n't resist adding to my kindle collection . Anna is a beautiful but down - to - earth 5 - year - old when the book opens - a foundling whom Fynn ( the author ) encounters in the streets of London and takes home to his equally grounded and immensely practical mother . It 's a setting made in heaven for Anna , who is a budding physics genius and philosopher just needing Fynn and his mother 's unconventional approach to life and education . Prepare to be astonished at Anna 's intuitive understanding of complex physics principles , and delighted by her very straight - talking approach to the constraints of religion and her free - thinking belief in " Mr God " .
5 #### Read this book years ago and bought it for some friends . Great story . I highly recommend .
5 #### Amazing book ! ! ! ! ! I do n't really know how to describe it , but ... You will fall in love with Anna , I guarantee !
5 #### This book is n't just a " cute " story . It speaks to the heart . So if you know a person who needs to " soften - up , " the you pass it on - after you have read it .
5 #### Mister God , This Is Anna ... is the best book to learn and understand how God touches us in unexpected ways .
5 #### One my top ten book we all need to look at life like Anna !
4 #### This charming story of a short - lived orphan and her childish insights on God and her relationships with the people around her was indeed moving and thought - provoking . I found myself wrestling with the idea that this simply could not be a true story . That a child at the age of 5 or 6 can not reason the way Anna did . Naturally the theology of this book is raw and undeveloped , but again , coming from a child , at minimum gives you reason to pause , reconsider and smile . The tragic circumstances surrounding Anna 's life and the mystery of how this book came about all add to it 's mystique . Do yourself a favor and track this one down . It will be worth it ! Corrgc
5 #### This book is a MUST read ! Anna 's understanding of maths and Mister God is inspiring . It 's one of the few books I read and re - read and find great joy in the book each time . Highly recommended book .
5 #### This is one rare and amazing book , and I 've read my tattered , thrift - store copy 3 times myself , and given away copies to other people . Since I first read it many years ago , I have referred to God as " Mr. God , " the way Anna did . This is a GEM of a story .
5 #### I bought this because my original copy , purchased in 1977 , changed my life .
5 #### My favorite book of ALL time havehad the hardcopy for 35 years and read it to shreds . There is always something new somehow or just a thing I needed reminding of .
5 #### I just love this book . It is a delight . My husband gave me it first and I have done the same sincemany , many times .
5 #### Fynn weaves magic through the story of this amazing little girl and their life together . She is a spunky little cherub that has a unique way of seeing spirituality in everyday life . Fynn 's backgound in mathematics makes for a lively back and forth between them . This book help me form my own concept of God .
5 #### I read this as a teenager in my native german and the bought it in english for my american Hubby . This book shaped me as a person as much as The Little Prince did !
5 #### This is a simple story with a simple little girl as the main character . However , she is an old - soul and gets to the heart of each matter in such a simple but profound way . It 's hard to keep up with the delightful twists in Anna 's mind and heart .
3 #### I am on the fence about this book . The book does some things that are not good / proper for children to do like letting strangers in the house , leaving open the choice to not tell their mother the truth , flying kites indoors , standing on balls , etc . This does open discussion to what a child should and should not do , however with the wrong child , this book might actually encourage those bad behaviors . Spoiler : The cat in the hat enters the house while the kid 's mom is away . The fish tells the kids that the cat should leave , but the kids do n't intervene so the cat makes a big mess of things in the house . Then at the very end of the book the kids tell the cat , thing 1 , and thing 2 to leave and the cat helps clean up the mess so their mom will not be mad . This means the kids avoided the consequences ( whic I do not like ) . Then the kids do n't know if they are going to be honest about what happened that day . Does my son like the book ? Of course . Do I really get into the rhymes and word patterns - yes . But , does this book teach anything of value ? only if you put in a lot of work .
5 #### such a sweet book that is written not by a well known author , but by a simple man with a special story
5 #### Anna is a the utmost trust in God , who is bigger than anything can imagine . I recommend this light - hearted book for anyone searching for a God of their understanding .
5 #### Very thought provoking We all could learn about sharing and loving our fellowman . A wonderful book that perhaps should be read more than one time to really get all the messages in this story .
5 #### That 's all I can say .. read the introduction with the " look inside " feature , then if you love it , you can confidently buy it , you wo n't be disappointed .. if you do n't like this genre , then do n't buy it .. but I can guarantee this opens your heart ! !
5 #### I first read this book when I was thirteen now I am 48 and I have never forgotten it . it 's a great book to see Christian faith from a child 's perspective .
5 #### A classic . Words of wisdom from a child regarding esoteric spiritual topics that spur one to view the world and God differently than ever before . In simple terms , she captures the essence of understanding God in a new way .
5 #### This book popped out at me in a bookstore around 20 years ago and I was replacing it in my library due to not knowing where it disappeared . Sometimes we just need a boost that Anna gives to be cheerful about our relationship with God and not be afraid to ask God anything .
4 #### Got this as a gift . Cute and durable so that a baby can play with it . Only has about 4 actual pages counting the cover and the back . Its cute but kinda overpriced .
5 #### Loved it ! Sometimes God works in very different and compelling ways proving once again that you simply can not stereotype grace ! A wonderful heartwarming read .
4 #### Anna 's thoughts of Mister God are so deep and yet so simple . She will stay with you for a long time . I had to keep reminding myself that yes , this was a real little girl .
5 #### I remember reading this book more than 8 years ago and yet i very very fondly hold on to the beautiful imprint this little child made on my heart . The most important thing Anna taught me ( the value of which I realize today ) is to have a relationship with God . Anna made friends with Mr God and would have open conversations with Him ! Anna in her simple words stated the profoundest of philosophies . A thought provoking , heartwarming read albeit with a tragic twist . Anna manages to remain , till the very end , the epitome of goodness , hope and positivity ! !
5 #### One of my favorite all - time books , a reminder of a child 's open - minded , off - the - wall thinking and pure spirit . Anna , a little street orphan in old Cockney England , finds God everywhere , even in an old ruffian named Fynn , and is not afraid to say out loud why we grown - ups struggle so much doing so . No wonder God told us to come to him as a little child ! ! ! This book will make you laugh , cry , rethink some things about life , and may even cause you to do math or play in mud puddles !
5 #### A friend shared his copy of this book with me many years ago and it became one of my favorites . It 's a sweet book told by a little girl in her words . Funny and sad . Once you read this , you ca n't help but be touched ...
4 #### I will be honest . I did n't get a lot of it , , but it was a very deep and touching book . The end was very sad . But it was a good book .
5 #### Dr. Seuss birthday was today so we read this . They loved it . Thank you dr . Seuss . You are always appreciated .
5 #### I loved this book . Anna is a 4 yr old child homeless in London and taken in by the narrator of the book Fynn . She has an amazing way of answering life 's problems with the simplicity of Mr. God . In her child like way everything has a easy and direct answer in Mr. God . It was inspirational .
5 #### I 'm an agnostic-- which would be fine with Anna 's Mister God . So would being an atheist . I think that may be why this book annoys some adherents of the more dogmatic religions . There is much here to consider-- and pleasantly-- about God , physics , the nature of existence and the nature of our own minds . Having taught children and been one , I do n't find Anna implausible . Most of the questions that she tackles are questions that many small children * do * think about . I can remember doing so myself , and have seen children doing so . Few do it as well as Anna . But it 's hard to doubt the existence of remarkable children if you 've spent much time around children . That said , Anna is also strained through the memories of 40 years by the time the book is written . In a sense the dead become our memories of them . For those questioning the existence of Fynn , he was Sydney George Hopkins . He died in 1999 .
4 #### From the outset , let me just say that this book thoroughly captivated me when I read it . I was hooked and I basically fell in love with Anna , as I suspect many other readers have done . However , did you read the introduction ? I believe the Intro is written by the publishing editor . Fynn , the storyteller , comes to her shyly , I believe a number of years after the events allegedly occurred . I do n't think he ever gives his last name . He pretty much disappears from the scene after that . I ca n't help but wonder . Is the editor being completely honest ? Why was n't Fynn more up front about his personal information ? Was it just a timid desire to remain anonymous or was he passing fiction off as non - fiction ? Part of me really hopes this was a true story --- that there really was an Anna and she truly knew God . When I read what happened to her in the end , another part of me wishes that no precious child would undergo suffering or die in that manner . Whatever the case , the book reminds me that Jesus did say that anyone who enters the kingdom of God must have the simple , unquestioning faith of a child .
5 #### My son keeps reading it over and over again
5 #### I forgot how good this book is and it allows you to open the discussion about your kids telling you things when they happen .
4 #### Beautiful books in a sturdy case and I received them much faster than I 'd expected . The four stars is because they fail to mention that these are not full - size books . They 're about 4 1/2 " x 6 " . The size does n't appear to affect the content though .
5 #### this is the tiny book size not the big ones
5 #### The Cat in the Hat is amazingly Voom - powered and I 'd invite him round to my house anytime ! Long live the Cat in the Hat !
5 #### Wonderful story about a little girl and her insights in the big picture - and subsequent recall home at an early age . Despite her tender age and all the seemingly injustice that she had to endure so far in life , she is a positive personality - she knows God as he really is . And such special people are called home quickly . She fulfilled her purpose in life , and so did Fynn , telling the rest of us about her . I think it is one of the best books ever written .
5 #### I give Mr God This is Anna away as gifts and to give people inspiration . I can not say enough about this book . Every time I read it I find this little girl to be amazing , insightful and profound . The author really captured her essence and her religious nature . Anna distrusted organized religion and thought going to church AFTER you learned about God and what he expected was all for posh ( showing off new dresses and socializing ) BECAUSE IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTOOD MR GOD , you would NOT need to go to church for more " schooling on how to be good " . You would have learned how to act like Mr. God would and not need more church schooling . I LOVED IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! And , although I am not a mathematics type person , Anna 's comparison of math to GOD , nature and all things is astounding in such a young child . It was totally captivating to read her assessments and comparisons and EVERY TIME you read the book , you find something you overlooked . This is MY FAVORITE BOOK above ALL OTHERS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### This is one of those books that will cause you to laugh , cry , and maybe even scream out loud . It is very moving and thought provoking . The tough spiritual issues are clearly addressed . The book is easy to read . I highly recommend this book !
5 #### This is one of my favorite books ever . Anna is a delightful little girl with a most tragic background , but she has all she needs to go back home ! This book is simply wonderful .
3 #### If like me , you care about the quality of the book the story is printed in , then you will understand the 3 stars . I did not like the book , but I LOVE the story . I read this story on a borrowed book and loved it so much I ordered this . I was very disappointed by the book and the print size , both of which were too small for me to handle and to read comfortably . Also the paper quality was cheap . The book arrived in good condition though . I returned it and the seller was good enough to refund my money . I 'm sharing this in case book and print size and paper quality matter to you too . I found a different book of this story that was also cheap but which I was very happy with . So please read this wonderful story , but you might want to do so on a different book than this one .
5 #### The Cat In The Hat returns to visit another day as the children are cleaning up . Will he foil their plans ?
5 #### My goodness ! I have thought about this book so often since first reading it in 6th grade 24 years ago . It just popped in my head a moment ago , and I rushed to the computer to look it up . HERE it is ! I remember distinctly reading it practically all the way through in one sitting . This book was indeed one of the initial ( with many to follow)spiritual steps on my ladder to getting to know God . In fact , I just told my 12 - year - old daughter that I will soon be buying it for her to read and always have as a keepsake . I 'm ecstatic !

4 #### I really enjoyed reading this novel of a little girl 's understanding of Mister God , partially because of how it delved into personal spiritual development and fellowship , and largely because it tried to approach quandaries about faith with a scalpel and wizened simplicity . Sometimes it succeeded ; other times it failed . Regardless of the misses , the entire book is a wonderful eye - opener that will inspire you to take your own inventories , conduct your own experiments , and perhaps check your insides and outsides for Mister God daily . A friend recommended the book to me when I needed guidance on how to approach prayer ; believe me , it helped tremendously .
5 #### This is a journey to a place in time when a small child , Anna , leads a young man to heights of knowledge of " Mister God " , that are far beyond the knowledge of this small child . She perceives the spiritual things , that only an angel would know . This is a true story . It will touch your heart , and give you a hunger for more . " A little child shall lead them " .
3 #### The book seems comes from a library . It is not as good as described in the ad . I am wondering how a library book will be on sale .
5 #### Great collection of the classics . Pages are delicate so you do n't want to let toddlers hold it or turn pages .
4 #### A charming introduction to thinking outside the orthodox boundaries of Western science and religion . Several reviews I 've seen for this book appear to have been written by people who had bitter reactions due to strong personal biases in these matters . This would seem to speak rather more deeply about the inhibitions of the reviewers than of the subject . If you are not firmly attached to any dogmatic approaches to thinking and being , if you can walk through a romantic summer evening without needing to reassure yourself by explaining the astrophysics of star light to whoever is within earshot , you will probably find this little book entirely worthwhile .
1 #### My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book . The book is clumsily written , and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy . That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad , and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are , and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world . And no , I do not believe there was any such child .
3 #### This book was interesting . It is kind of hard to believe that this actually happened though . I 'm not a big fan of religious things though .
3 #### Generally interesting , occasionally tedious , sappy , or scarcely credible . Worth reading , especially if you 're interested in fundamental questions of theology , but more suggestive than coherent . Some good use of dialect . Anna herself is charming , and this is the best of Fynn 's Anna books .
1 #### This is a formula book , aimed at people who are already convinced of the existence of their god . It 's as realistic as one of the medieval Lives of the Saints , and as subtle as anything from Stalinist Russia , where heroic peasants worked heroically for the common heroic good . Here a little girl uses the socratic method to " enlighten " her guardian in the ways of god . The character of the little girl will be unrecognizable to anyone who 's ever encountered a real child for more than five seconds . This would be acceptable if it were not for the fact that the philosophy is threadbear . Only an uncritical acceptance of second - hand ideas coupled to a second - rate god would make this an interesting work . The writing itself is workmanlike enough , though this does n't preclude the inevitable tedium that comes from the subject matter itself . In other words , it 's a false piece of writing , just as hagiography was false and heroic socialistic heroism was false . Spare yourself this juvenile meandering . If you really want to know something about the way god has evolved in the west , take a look at Karen Armstrong 's book A History of God . Far more interesting and insightful , and much more capably written as well .
5 #### This book continues to touch my life . From my first encounter with the book , it helped clarify much of what I felt about God . The reviews below have certainly expressed exactly how I feel . This is the best book I have ever purchased . And Purchased . I have given away so many copies . I would never dream of loaning my copy . Read it . It will have a beautiful effect on your life .
5 #### I read this Great Masterpice back in 1977 ; it was a gift of my late mother ( her last gift ) and what a gift ! Fynn is superb , with that power which is deposited in very simple people , the power of the written word ! I wonder Who deposits that virtue in this this " Special Reserve Author " . If you start page ONE , you will not stop ... and soon you 'll be brewing the best coffee or tea , as companion to the inspiring dialogs among a liitle beautiful blessed girl , that will shake our the very foundations of our soul . If you are looking for a religious book this is not for you . " Mister God , this is Anna " is well far beyond any of your expectations ; the kind of perfect gift to the people you love at any sort of season . When Anna asks or say something we are amazed ... to the point we could feel the magic sensation that HE es right in front of her . Stright fooward conversations , philosophy and over all : love ! There is no useful rewiew for this beauty , this one is just an excuse to let you know ... that Anna is waiting for You . Thank Fynn . I know that at any forgotten alley of England , you know for suere that your book -the gift from you to all people of sensitive heart is a very precious gift .
5 #### Read it a few times since we got it my kids love"Cat In The Cat . " Added it to the collection that I already had for my kids .
5 #### Bought this as a gift and it a great collection of Seuss .
3 #### Print is too small and difficult for a Grandma to read by a lamp .
5 #### In much the same lyrical quality of Saint - Exupery 's ' The Little Prince ' , ' Mister God ' allows us to ' get small ' , as Anna would say , and see the world as a still wonderful place . I first discovered this book almost 25 years ago , and have given as gifts countless copies whenever I can find it . The copy on my shelf today is from the 19th printing in 1985 . I can not think of anyone -- young , old , sinner , cynic , saint -- who would not enjoy the wit , wisdom and other - worldliness of spritely Anna and her exuberant joust with -- and quest for -- the truest reality . Anna 's relationship with Old Woody is a pattern for adult - child relationships not easily surpassed . Fynn proves coming of age often means not leaving childhood behind , but hauling it with you into adulthood . If you 've not yet discovered a pair of companion books -- ' Anna 's Book ' , and ' Anna , Mister God , and the Black Knight ' , both also by Fynn -- seek them out and latch onto them if you can find them . If joy has a name , it is Anna .
5 #### Great way to get traditional books at a great price .
1 #### Wrong item and no way to cancel I want my money back .
5 #### Ordered for my godson 's birthday & he 's a big Dr Seuss fan . My present was hit of the party . He loved it
5 #### I ordered this for my beginner reader grandson . I love how the words and pictures are clear . Binding is good as well .
5 #### Amazing full collection of all Dr. Seuss books . I believe this set is published for the UK , whereas all the US Dr. Seuss sets are hardcover and much more expensive . Each book is coded by reading level , which is helpful . Also books are brand new and arrived in perfect condition . I bought it as a gift , but I 'm going to keep it save it for my kids :-)
5 #### Hi ! My name is Samuel and my grandmother let me read this book on her Kindle . I am four years old and I read it to myself . ! ! ! ! ! ! I LOVED it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I will read more Dr. Seuss books .
5 #### Such a great book that every child should have the privilege to enjoy .
5 #### An all time favorite . Everyone i 'm sure is familiar with this story . It 's a cute book and price on amazon is better than anywhere else .
5 #### Very nice gift for an avid reader of a little grand daughter
5 #### bought for grandson to add to his library . perfect
5 #### Love the story . The CD is a godsend in the car !
5 #### Exactly what was expected . I got all of the books I wanted , although not in hard covers , but again exactly as expected .
5 #### I love this book . It is fun . It makes fun of learning words . Reading is an adventure . Rhyming is a way to remember . And the illustrations will make any child laugh .
5 #### My adult daughter with learning disabilities is thrilled to rediscover this book from her childhood . After seeing a wonderful dramatic performance ( dance and song ) of this story now spends hours reading this book and is thrilled with revisiting The Cat in the Hat ! !
5 #### This was a gift for my 7 year old granddaughter . They were celebrating Dr Seuss 's birthday at school all week . She enjoyed being to read each book being featured at school
4 #### Just like cats in real life ... he 's a PITA , but the story never gets old and my kids still enjoy this one before bed .
5 #### my son loves this book . I have to read it every night . Nice illustrations and great quality .
5 #### Up up with the fish ... not sure if my baby or me likes this book more :)
5 #### I have always loved Dr Seuss . My kids and I love reading his work in Hebrew .
1 #### READ THE REVIEWS FIRST ! ! ! ! ! You got my money . I hate being deceived .
5 #### Through multiple generations and across the earth , the stories of Dr Seuss have stood the test of time . The cat in the hat is a perfect reminder why .
5 #### I bought this book so that my daughter can start reading to her son and he really loves sitting on the couch with this book .
5 #### Great price to own the book and have a read - a - long cd with storytelling option . Good value !
5 #### sequel to the Cat in the Hat , which is another equally funny , classic easy to read story
5 #### Bought this set to read when grand children come to visit . Classics never go out of style .
5 #### Book was in great shape when I received it
5 #### All of the books are full length Dr. Suess stories and they include some of the classics that I grew up reading in the early 90 's . My daughter is 5 months old and can not appreciate the ryhming or story aspects yet but she likes hearing me read and looking at the insane and colorful characters littered throughout the books . 20 full length Dr. Suess books for $ 50 ! I should have bought them earlier .
2 #### Buyer beware ! ! This audio contains only 4 or the original 13 stories contained in the Case Book of Sherlock Holmes . Clearly it is an abridgement . ! !
5 #### " The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes " was Doyle 's last collection of short stories on the great detective . The stories may not have been uniformly as good as the earlier Holmes stories , and some of the plots may have been derivative , but they still entertain . " The Three Garridebs " rehashed the plot of " The Red Headed League " . " The Creeping Man " turned in a creepy tale whose premise has been disproved by later science . " The Veiled Lodger " was not even a mystery . The rest of the stories were much better . " The Blanched Soldier " presented a conundrum which Holmes solved without visiting the scene . " The Sussex Vampire " had a perfectly natural explanation . " The Lion 's Mane " involved violent death , but was there a crime ? Holmes worked for an unnamed " Illustrious Client " , but you should be able to figure out who it was . We meet Holmes ' page , Billy , for the first and last time in " The Mazarin Stone " . We meet international intrigue in " Shoscombe Old Place " and an arrogant murderer in " The Retired Colourman " . My favorite story of the lot is " The Problem of Thor Bridge " , where Holmes clears a young lady of murder in the face of almost overwhelming evidence of guilt .
1 #### I want my money back ! ! ! I bought it as I was on the Kindle version page and it said it had a very high score , almost perfect . When I opened it in my Kindle Paperwhite , it came as 2 pages in 1 ... impossible to read . I have come back to the page and read the reviews . To my surprise , all reviews are mixed up ... not only the Kindle version , but original movie , new movie , someone reading a book ( tape recording ) , original books , fake books , second hand books , books with bubble gums inside or torn pages . What is this ? Reviews should be separated to correspond the product you ARE buying . So if I wish to buy the Kindle version I should ONLY see the reviews for the Kindle version and nothing else . I will now contact customer support to get my money back . I have never been so disappointed with Amazon as last night . Update : Thanks , Amazon , for giving me credit ( refund ) for this purchase !
5 #### So much Dr Seuss tongue workout but the children love reading and being read to as we celebrate his birthday !
5 #### Conan Doyle 's Holmes stories scarcely need any comment from me . They remain classics in the best sense , in that they are readable , enjoyable , superbly written and still have life and freshness many years after they were first published . These are n't all among the greatest of the Holmes stories , but they are still a fine collection and I have thoroughly enjoyed reading them all again and it 's easy to see why they have inspired so many interpretations over the years . I was kindly sent a free digital ARC of the Dover Edition via Netgalley for review , and it 's a good , clean edition without flaws so if you 're looking for a Kindle edition of some Sherlock Holmes to wallow in and enjoy , this will do very nicely .
3 #### As others have noted , the stories here are n't up to par with Conan Doyle 's first Sherlock Holmes mysteries . If you 're a huge Holmes fan , you might find them interesting . Those who have n't yet been introduced to Holmes and Watson should opt for the earlier works .
5 #### I 'm a long time fan of Sherlock Holmes . And this case book has me enthralled .
3 #### Some odd and repeated plots , but still a good read for Holmes fans .
3 #### This is the weakest of the collections , although some strong stories remain ( Thor Bridge and The Illustrious Client especially ) . Even the terrible stories - even Mazarin Stone , clumsily adapted from a simplistic play - have a line or two that highlights the friendship even when the mystery is a dud . ACD was so clearly well and truly over it by the time of this book .
5 #### One of the best ways to teach kids to read is to introduce them to the Dr. Seuss books . The words are easy and the stories are just odd enough to keep your child interested for years . They helped our kids become avid readers in a digital age , that we thought we 'd get them for our grandson ! This is a smaller version of the big books , the standard size , but it is also more economical and nothing is abridge ! You do actually end up liking Green Eggs and Ham at the end of the book . I 'd like to give you more detail about the selection and all , but .... the books are at my son 's house so apparently , they are still a hit !
5 #### Some of my daughter 's favorite books are Dr. Seuss , you ca n't go wrong !
5 #### This is the final collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories . An excellent collection with a few even told by Mr. Holmes himself . The strength of these stories is just as good as the first . I will definitely be revisiting them soon .
5 #### Arthur conan doyle has always been a favorite of mine , and especially Sherlock Holmes .
5 #### Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is still one of the best there has ever been
5 #### The Sherlock Holmes books have always been delightful to read with many surprises . However , some of the conclusions now seem rather out - dated . They are usually predictable in that Holmes usually gets his man ( or woman ) at the end of the story . His nemesis adds a nice challenge to the stories . I especially enjoyed the way this book was organized in a casebook format . ( Illustrations , though small , are always helpful . )
5 #### Cases of Holmes later years , written by Conan Doyle .
4 #### A very pleasant change from the constant American writing . Well worth the reading .
4 #### This is a great flag ! Two sided and very high quality . I took off one star because the wing on the outside was tucked in on itself so I had to wiggle it into shape and was n't very successful .
5 #### My son likes this more than the original The Cat in The Hat book - I do n't , but still it 's a cute book and a fun way to go through the ABCs .
5 #### A gift for a beginning reader . He absolutely loves them . Dr. Seuss has always been a staple in our home . Quality product .
5 #### Its an amazing classic ! A great addition to any library ! Its a bedtime book my children love ! The rhyming is addictive ! !
4 #### Very late period Holmes stories . Like many readers , I feel there is a steep decline in quality and originality in the later Conan Doyle stories . But even with clunkers like " The Three Garridebs , " " The Mazarin Stone , " and " The Veiled Lodger , " you have the two undeniable classics of " The Illustrious Client " and " The Problem of Thor Bridge " . You also have the stylistic departure of " The Lion 's Mane , " one of only three stories in the canon not narrated by Watson . So while I would urge anyone new to the original stories always to begin with " The Adventures , " " The Memoirs , " and " The Return , " both " The Casebook " and " His Last Bow " have much to recommend them .
4 #### I enjoyed these short stories . They are not as detailed or complex as many of the other stories about Holmes but still a fun read . The Casebook is a great way to round off and complete the Holmes saga .
5 #### Another thoughtful tale by a very good author , This is another of the thought provoking , and addictive story 's by SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE . I have never read a bad story yet .
5 #### This reprint of the last Holmes collection is little more than that , but still an excellent book -- even in decline , Conan Doyle is our finest mystery writer , and Holmes our finest consulting detective .
4 #### Love the stories ! I always wanted to read it from the beginning and this is great ! Thoroughly enjoying it . And picturing RD Jr. as Sherlock is still rather easy and entertaining ! Haha
5 #### I love the Sherlock Holmes books ! Great book that will capture your mind and gets you thinking . Love love love
5 #### A huge deviation from the Victorian / Edwardian era Holmes story 's . Doyle is able to keep up with the times here . S.H. is sarcastic , witty , and a PI of the 20th Century . These were written in the era of Black Mask Mystery Magazine , Dashiell Hammett and the new Hardboiled Private Eye of fiction . This is more like the Holmes of the popular BBC series running now . The purist here seem to like the old style Holmes much more ( judging by the reviews ) . I think this collection to be a refreshing break , and a more multi - dimensional Detective .
3 #### I just read this book to finish reading the complete Conon Doyle Holmes series . I agree with those who say the stories here fail to live up to the standard of the previous . I found myself with every story conclusions finding issue : instead of the usual awe over Holmes ' intuitive brilliance , my reaction tended to be " that would have been obvious " , or " that made no sense " , or " there was no way to conclude that from the clues . " The writing , on the other hand , is fine . Character descriptions were excellent , and it was novel to be able to read two stories from Holmes ' , rather than Watson 's , perspective . So it 's worthy reading to a Holmes & Watson fan , a fan who 's read all preceding works in the collection , but it hardly ranks with the all - time greats in the mystery genre , unlike virtually any of the Conon Doyle Holmes works . Two favorites were the Illustrious Client , which contained a very strong character , and the Veiled Lodger , which was a nice variation on the usual paradigm . So please read this book , but do n't make it your first Holmes exposure .
5 #### I read every Sherlock Holmes I can get my hands on and some I have read 2 or 3 times . Relly love Arthur Conan Doyle 's work !
5 #### My daughter grew up on all Dr Seuss books . Best books for grammar and phonics ever .
4 #### Kids loved it My boys love the Cat In The Hat books . First time reading it on the kindle . Will get more .
5 #### Children love this book ! I 've read it several times right on my Kindle app by cell phone . It 's a convenient location for my nieces and nephews . They can practice rhyme and beginning sounds , colors , and shapes .
5 #### A Great Deal ! Note that this set is the larger size book . Read the product dimension . There is another set of paperbacks for cheaper that is smaller , and there is another set of hardcovers that are smaller . Read the product dimensions to know the size you are buying . This set is the larger size and I felt the best deal . A great deal ! If you want the hardcovers at the full size you should get the three book collections as starters . That route is more expensive . I would have preferred the hardcovers , but this softcover deal was too good to pass up . The retail price is $ 190 on this . Half that price would be a fair deal . I paid less -- a great deal . Invest in books for kids and lots of them . Lots of them . Turn off the TV . Read .
5 #### Sherlock Holmes adventures apparently was written only for intelligent readers by challenging their faculties for observation and intrigue . Stories are nearly unequaled in 100 years .
5 #### All good things must come to an end . And so do the stories of Sherlock Holmes in The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes . It 's sad and depressing to know that as I read the last twelve stories . Although The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place is the final story , The Adventure of the Retired Colourman is the more appropriate one . As usual , Arthur Conan Doyle resumes the thrilling words of the cases and sets the mood for the sleuthing methods by the famed detective although on a somber note . Of course , Holmes forewent the honors anyone could bestow on him including the knighthood from England . All in all , as I close the 1,100 + page book of Sherlock Holmes stories , it has been a great adventure for me , and I thank Arthur Conan Doyle for making literature fun to read .
4 #### These novels and stories by Doyle keep me fascinated and I will always buy them again En joy the historical time period and language of the Englanders or English
5 #### This was the first Sherlock Holmes volume I had as a young boy and it was great to enjoy an old friend again . Shipping , etc . was great and painless . I hope many more will meet the great detective for themselves , he is quite an unforgettable character .
5 #### As my previous reviews of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's books on Sherlock Holmes , this too was an excellent read . Just when I thought that I had read all of Doyle 's writings on him , I happily discovered more . Again , if you are a fan , one never tires of reading about Sherlock Holmes ' keen skill at attention to details in solving crimes . This book was no exception ! Each story was well developed . I enjoy the fact that I can read one of his stories in one or two sittings . I hope I find more stories . Well done , Doyle !
4 #### The Case - Book of Sherlock Holmes is the last of the Holmes short story collections written by Arthur Conan Doyle . In general , the stories are not as deep as the previous publications , but most are more fun to read and are somewhat more innovative than the previous Holmes stories . Some of the plots tend more toward the horror ( e.g. a possible vampire ) , medical fiction ( e.g. humans taking monkey DNA ) , and twisted financial scam type of storylines . I think this may have been the first time that suicide was used to frame another individual in classic literature . The mysteries are almost never easy to figure out ... mostly because the author does n't provide you with the clues you need to solve the puzzles ( unlike the previous books ) , so the surprise usually lasts until the end of each story . Great fun that can be ingested in bite size pieces when you need to kill a few minutes at a time . A fitting end for one of the most enduring characters ever created .
5 #### Seuss was one cool cat . Kids just naturally connect with the sense of humor that turns loose Thing 1 and Thing 2 . Come to think of it , I still connect with those things ...
5 #### Who does n't love dr . Seuss ? My sons love for me to read it to them and I look forward to when they can read it themselves !
5 #### Just classic , fun to read . Love it . This is the first kids book on kindle that I 've purchased . On the Ipad it 's absolutely great .
5 #### I have always been a huge fan of the Sherlock Holmes classics and this is the best one yet . If you have even a slight interest in the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle , you owe it to yourself to check this one out .
5 #### As a fan of Sir ACD , I enjoy reading all of his works and his short stories are best . Sherlock and Watson ensure a good read before bedtime and any time I need a puzzle to figure out . They win every time of course but I am with them every step of the way . I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this crime solving time period , before DNA and fingerprinting , just good observation , ( un)common sense and their wits . Too bad it is one of the last of Sherlock and Watson .
5 #### All of the Sherlock Holmes books and short stories are great . Amazon has most of them for free on kindle . What 's not to love ? Get a kindle and read all of them .
3 #### Being read by Derek Jacobi , of course it 's good , but it 's very annoying having half a story on one disc and having to change discs to hear the end . As I listen to the discs in bed , I find it a great disadvantage . It 's put me off buying other similar products .
5 #### This Book Is A MUST HAVE For Anyone Who Calls Themselves A Sherlock Holmes Fan . I Love Every Story In This Book . Ca n't Get enough ,
5 #### I always enjoyed reading Sherlock Holmes when I was in jr . high and high school . So when I was searching for a few free books ( I 'm a little cheap went it comes to Kindle books ) I was happy to see pretty much all of Doyle 's Sherlock collections . I 've read pretty much all of them and am reminded why I loved them so much in my youth . The great thing is that this second time around reading as an adult I get a whole new outlook on the stories . The plain fact is that there will NEVER be a greater mystery / detective story than Sherlock Holmes . Doyle was so creative in his stories / cases that it is no wonder why they have stood the test of time . I HIGHLY suggest that you read these collections . If you 've read them before , do so again ... you'll be surprised . If you have never read them before , jump in and get started . What can you lose ? Its free !
5 #### Is there a Dr. Suess book that is not good ? All his books are 10 star books !
5 #### I bought this set because I wanted lots of books to read to my colicky infant . This set was less expensive than buying all the same books separately . Recommended for fans of boxed sets and Dr. Seuss .
5 #### I was born and raised outside the US . Dr. Seuss was not part of my childhood , but I grew up in a household where books were serious business . I barely remember my toys as a kid , but I do vividly remember all my book collections , illustrations , textures . Both of my kids were born in the US and I read for them every single day . They are growing up hearing different stories then I did , and I am very much enjoying the ride with them . When I first read them a Dr. Seuss book I had mixed feelings . I honestly was n't very sure if I had liked it or not . But after reading a few books , it just grew in me . Dr. Seuss ' books are magical . There is something about them ( their oddness , I presume ? ) that simply sticks to your mind . And most of them have a very nice hidden message among all the chaotic scenarios and crazy characters . Now Dr. Seuss is one of my favorite authors , and The Cat in The Hat my favorite character . This book is simply great for preschoolers and kindergartners ( older kids too ! ) . The rhymes and the humor are spot on . I had read it first at the library and end up buying it as a gift to another foreigner kid who was n't familiar with the story . It was a hit .
4 #### Actually , I 'd forgotten that this one is where the cat makes a huge mess ! He does clean it up before the mom gets home but ... (hey , that 's just me ) ! So , I 'm kind of unsure about the subject matter ; maybe I 'm being nit - picky . I like the other ones better .
5 #### This one is one of the best gifts we received ! So much fun and so many new things learned . Excellent investment in your child !
5 #### An awesome book that has given me hours of fun with my kid ! The pages are strong and the cover is very resistant !
5 #### Classic fun book everyone needs to read . Fast shipping
5 #### Dr. Seuss books are great way for young children to get interested in reading
5 #### My sister loved it as a child . My children loved it when they were little . My grandson loves it now , at age 3 . Over and over again What more can I say ?
4 #### A Classic . Not my favorite now , but I remember liking it as a kid . My kids find it intriguing . We lost our old copy while moving .
5 #### I loved Dr Seuss as a child & I love sharing them with my granddaughter ! We 're making great memories reading them together . She loves the bright colors in the illistrations .
5 #### I love Dr Seuss Books . " The Cat in the Hat " book I had word out . So I have replaced it . Happy Customer
5 #### This is a perfect book for a beginning reader . I have it as a birthday gift to my great - grandson whose mother said he spent all day reading it as soon as he opened the package .
5 #### My son loves the Dr. SEUSS books ! We read them every night ! Great for story time !
5 #### I use these children 's books to help me practice and learn my Spanish language learning . It helps well . It makes it easier for me to learn Spanish basics .
5 #### I remember when I was a little girl and I had a subscription to the Dr Seuss books , they are amazing and I loved them . I bought this one for my great grandson and I am sure he will love them as much as I did . I got the hard cover book because they last so long and my granddaughter can keep them and read to all her children and they can read to her when they start reading . All of the Dr. Seuss books are great
5 #### I always loved Dr. Seuss as a child . Now I want my grandchildren to enjoy them . I plan on having a substantial Seuss library for when the grandkids visit , so of course I am not nearly finished collecting . So I will just continue to enjoy my Seuss expansion .
5 #### Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss The Cat in the Hat brings us to the acme of children 's book writing . This beginner book for very young readers has every thing we want in a book for the smallest readers , those who still have adults reading to them as they look on and see the words . Those few among us who have not read this to their children or those few who have not had Cat read to them have missed a great deal . The drawing by Dr. Seuss have a dynamism , a quirkiness and a charm that we do not find anywhere else . We and the littles love to see the cat and his pals , Thing One and Thing Two . The short , sharp words should be known to the children by the time they are old enough to look this book over . They can now match the sound of the word ' cat ' or ' fish ' to the written representation of that word . By repetition and rhyme the sound will implant with the visual , written word . If this is not the best book for the smallest readers ever written I just do n't know what is .
1 #### I truly HATE this book . The librarian made my mother take the book out and read it instead of the " orange biographies " that I LOVED ( Childhood of Famous Americans created by the Bobbs - Merrill Co. ) She said I was too young to read and understand the biographies and that Dr Seuss was more age appropriate . OH MY GOD I HATED IT . I hated the illustrations , l hated the rhymes -- it actually made me HATE ALL POETRY because it reminded me of this drivel . Do n't buy this for your kid unless he or she ASKS for it . Otherwise it 's just cruel .
5 #### Excellent collection . Highly recommended by reading specialist for preschoolers .
5 #### My seven - year - old loves these books . Dr. Suess is her favorite and the paperbacks are easier to handle .
5 #### Fantastic price . I received full sized paperback books . The case was a bit crushed and torn on one side , but I fixed it easily with some clear tape . So , it was n't an issue . Very happy with my purchase !
5 #### Building my Dr. Seuss collection for the grand kids who LLLLLLOVE his books !
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for and in excellent condition
5 #### These are such cute books ! The are a child sized version of the Dr seuss books we love .
5 #### we read his countless times , a classic for all kids
5 #### always teaches and makes the child pay attention as does most of his books
5 #### Amazing to read to my grands . I read them to my three children when they were small and now I get to read them to my grands
4 #### I was surprised when I got these and found out how small the books actually are . They ca n't be more than 8 " . Other than that I love them .
5 #### I wanted to get this because it is a CLASSIC ! I had n't read it since I was a child and was surprised to read as an adult as I think the whole story is a little creepy in nature . Still a great classic children 's story that any kid would be lucky to have in their collection .
5 #### Cat in the hat original story is kind of creepy when you get to thinking about it . This one not so much but definitely keeps the kiddos attention . Fun read .
5 #### 24 years after reading it to my daughter , I now love reading it to my grandchild
5 #### This book is just as enjoyable today to my granddaughter as it was to me " many " years ago ! It outlasts the test of time .
5 #### My twins LOVE Dr. Seuss ( who does n't ) lol This was a great price and super fast shipping ! Thank you !
5 #### My kindergartener loves reading this book . Great book for early elementary readers .
5 #### Ordered from UK my grandson in USA absolutely loves them
5 #### Come on , this is a classic , must have . Register for Dr. Seuss books if you have n't already on your baby registry . Start reading these as soon as you like . Rhyming and fun is always a hit with kids , young & old .
5 #### I love this book ! Great recipes and information about the country . Glossary is extremely useful .
5 #### This book is really packed and pretty . The pictures are great , but I think it could have included more desserts .
5 #### A great collection of the recipes that gave French cuisine its international fame is awaiting you in this book . Do n't allow yourself to be intimidated by the excellent pictures , and try some of these traditional dishes . The vast majority of the ingredients can be found in the United States . Just make sure you take your time to enjoy this wonderful food , as the French take theirs to make meal taking an amazing experience .
5 #### I am glad to be able to share a part of my childhood with my child !
5 #### A wonderful book that I read to my children and am now reading to my grandchildren .
5 #### My daughter is using this to have guests sign in at her high school graduation open house because this is one of her favorite books !
5 #### My kids age 4 and 3 totally love this book . The Cat in the Hat is a lot of fun !
4 #### Good . A harder , lengthier and more confusing read to kids than the original 1st " The Cat in The Hat "
5 #### Great read for young children . Always give it as baby shower gift . Fun to read on March 2nd , Dr. Seuss 's birthday .
5 #### I 've been looking for a good french cookbook . I finally found it . This is a great book and I love the beautiful photos of France ! It 's quite large in size but worth it .
5 #### The book is beautiful . Ca n't wait to try a new recipes
5 #### Another excellent beautiful cookbook from the series , this one is filled with photographs of the entire regions , it 's people and traditions , these recipes are as close to the real deal as you will get . As the name says , a BEAUTIFUL Cookbook , you learn about the place and not just the platters .
5 #### you collect cook books - this is one to have - just nice many pictures and good recipes with lots of info
3 #### Pretty book , enjoy this series but do n't think I will be using this much for cooking .
5 #### It was in fair condition but suits my needs perfectly . Thank you
5 #### Son absolutely loves this book . Great sequel better than original .
1 #### the Kindle format was just plain disappointing . love the regular book format .
5 #### Dr Suess is always loveable and easy . This is an excellent starter reading book . Since we are going on a Carnival Cruise this June , and the new children 's program is Suess at Sea I thought it was time to brush up for vacation !
5 #### a classic gift for my kids . If you love tongue twisters Cat in the Hat is definitely that !
5 #### Loved this book . Gorgeous images of France and wonderful recipes . A delight to explore ; especially for this Francophile . Also have Provence and Asia from this great series and they do n't disappoint . I highly recommend this whole series .
5 #### Beautiful pictures and wonderful recipes ; they do n't make cookbooks like this anymore . Highly recommend this book for any cookbook collector and/or anyone interested in the food of France . It 's great to cook and learn from and looks nice on a coffee table as well !
5 #### I bought a half dozen other French cookbooks before I found this one . I wish I 'd found this one first . If I had I would not have wasted my money on the others . This book has recipes I actually want to cook . This book does n't insult your intelligence with recipes so basic as basting a chicken with butter , or frying a trout in a pan , or adding some garlic to mashed potatoes , or ripping me off with a plain fried steak with French fries recipe like the several of the other books do . ( Ya , I know they 're called " French " fries but I did n't have to buy a French cookbook to figure out how to make them . ) The pictures in this book are fantastic . The recipes are well chosen . The book is well written . For once I feel like I got what I paid for . If I could have only one French cookbook it would be this one .
5 #### Instead of purchasing this book here , I recommend looking for it in stores like Waldenbooks or Barnes and Noble in their section of books on sale . These stores always have a section of huge books that have been marked down to very reasonable prices . This book is n't particularly huge , but it is legitimate in its recipes . I have tried several recipes from this book and they 've all come out wonderful and comparable to the " real deals " that I 've tasted over in France myself . There was no need to alter any of the ingredients or amounts , as so far I 've had no failures / disasters in cooking from this book . It is divided up into sections ( poultry , fish , desserts , etc . ) and each section opens first to an introduction to a region of France with a little bit of background . The book provides pictures for almost every recipe they list , which I know can be helpful to some readers / cooks to know what it is they 're cooking . I would say , though , that some of the recipes might require you to be a little adventurous , as of course these authentic recipes require foods that Americans do not normally eat very often ( like lamb and rabbit , for example ) . But I 've found that other than that , the ingredients were not so exotic that I could n't find them in the store and was forced to make adjustments .
5 #### Who does n't love this book ? My son wanted to be the Cat in the Hat for Halloween after reading this book . A must - have for every child 's home library !
3 #### Has a fun , somewhat trippy sensibility and very creative . HOWEVER , as a parent I took issue with the message that having strangers running around your house is something to just stick around for .
5 #### It 's Dr. Seuss . What can I say . Love him .
5 #### Learning Russian . this is a fun book to try to get through .
1 #### Yeah , I 'm probably alone here , but as a parent this book creeps me the hell out . It is a outdated relic leftover from a much different time . So are a lot of other Suess books . Remember the one about the moose with so many squatters living in his antlers that he almost dies , but instead all the other animals are shot by hunters and then stuffed over the mantel of a cigar smoking Teddy Roosevelt lookalike ? If you do n't it 's because it was n't keeping in time with modern values and left to the wayside . This one should have been as well , only The Cat in the Hat is kind of the franchise mascot . I love Dr. Suess , but this one is just not okay , classic or not . This stranger shows up and tells the kids " Hey guys , I know your mom is n't here , but I want to show you some really funny games , c'm on she wo n't mind at all " . Really ? ? I just can not read my kid this book , it makes me feel really icky .
5 #### This is a classic in every sense . Fermentation of kids have learned to read with this book and future generations will too . The adventures the cat takes Sally and Conrad are full of fun . The method Cat uses to get Conrad to mature and start taking responsibilities while loosening uptight Sally is educational for all . I read this book when I was young and sat there while both of my kids read it too . The best .
5 #### Enjoyable at all ages . Dr. Seuss is a treasure . His books are so fun to read and his art so lively .
5 #### Of course I was pleased with the books I ordered , but I was promised a free video , Kung Fu , and it has n't arrived .
5 #### Nothing like dr . Seuss for some good family reading time
4 #### I bought this book for my toddler because we are going on a Cruise that has a Cat in the Hat breakfast . I was not going to pay 9.00 to Carnival when I can get it for 4.00 . I am only giving it 4 star because I do n't want to say " I love it " when its just a kids book . No shipping issues or anything negative .
5 #### How can you go wrong with the Cat in the Hat ?
5 #### I Love this book ! It is one of my favorites from growing up and I was so excited to be able to purchase this again for a baby shower . I obviously had to read it before I wrapped it up and it is still as wonderful as I remember and brought me back to the good old days . I ca n't wait till I have wee ones of my own and purchase again .
5 #### This was requested instead of greeting cards for a baby shower - neat idea and costs about the same as a card .
3 #### Love Dr. Seuss books but this one was a little too long for my three - year - old . He lost interest about halfway through .
5 #### Classic children 's book . Great for a child 's 1st book !
5 #### Played these for my children when they were young and will now share them with our grandchildren !
5 #### Who does n't love The Cat in the Hat ? :) Great price came on time
4 #### It never fails . My child always asks why the children would be left at home alone or why they would let the cat in if they did n't know him . Also at the end the question about telling their mother , my child always ponders that and wants me to answer it .
5 #### bought this for my son , he loves it . Its nicely sized for him and can withstand him tossing them everywhere .
5 #### Exactly the same as the copy my Uncle gave me in 1960 . That copy was , recently , disemboweled by my grandchildren , so this new copy is for my granddaughter .
5 #### reading this with my kids and its very helpful for my son to practice his sight words thru this books . thanks
5 #### Got this for my grandson .. What can I say .... Dr. Seuss is a classic and this is his classic book !
5 #### We got all of Dr. Seuss books for our children and now are starting over with our grandchildren :-)
4 #### Dr. Suess is a classic and this is his classic book
5 #### Ordered for grandchildren , a beloved classic from their daddy 's childhood . In fact , from my own childhood too . Nice quality edition with bright colors . I still love sharing Dr. Seuss 's riotous rhymes and big imagination creatures with children .
5 #### My granddaughter is reading these books out loud to us now . She loves them .
5 #### My Granddaughter is only 20 months old , but these Dr. Seuss books were the first books I read and the first books that I purchased for my children . Sometimes she likes me to read it to her and sometimes she just likes the feel of flipping the pages because her books from her parents are the thick , cardboard like books . I 'll keep reading and the older she gets , the more I believe she will appreciate it .
5 #### It 's Dr. Seuss , is there really anything else other than 5 stars for this classic ? !
5 #### The product arrived as pictured , my niece loved the book and illustrations .
5 #### The product arrived as pictured , my niece loved the book and illustrations .
5 #### I got a ton of these Dr. Seuss CD Read Along Books for my first grade listening center . My kids really love them since many of my students are already familiar with most of these stories . This seller was better than others .
1 #### ... I was given this as a gift and did take the time to wade through its moralizing , preachy text . " People are Your Most Valuable Assets , " the authors breathlessly remind us , as if those of us in business are somehow blind to this obvious truth . Its fundamental promise of transforming ones ' organization , like that of so many management gurus , rests on the notion that the authors ' sheer intelligence and brilliant insights into human nature will transform any organization into a productivity machine . This , as anyone with a real job can tell you , is long , hard work deeply idiosyncratic to the specifics of one industry -- nothing that can be collapsed into a book ; certainly not one as thin as this one . Which is not to say that the One Minute Managers is all bad . It paints a wonderful theoretical world where all interpersonal problems can be solved in 59 seconds flat thanks to the fact that the characters are all fictional . It is a terrific daydream . Because that is really what the One Minute Manager , like most fad management books , are about ...
5 #### Nephew loved reading Cat in The Hat plus it was at a great price .
1 #### Angry , Disappointed - not what I expected . There was no indication that the books are not a standard size . I plan to ask for a refund .
5 #### Classic , ca n't go wrong . I can go into the psychology of this book , as others have ... But I 'm just happy my son enjoys me reading it to him . Period .
4 #### Just received this book as a gift for my son . We love reading Dr. Suess books but this one did n't seem to keep his interest . It was very long and not as cute as the original . But still a great classic Suess book . Maybe he will like this one better in a couple years .
5 #### Would love to help my granddaughter start to read and develop a love of Dr. Seuss . Best way to do that is to give a gift of this book .
1 #### I am so mad and frustrated . I originally purchase this book to add to my collection of Dr. Seuss books for my 4 year old son This book was on sale . I have mistakenly purchased board books in the past thinking that I was buying hardcover books . This book was a fail and it failed badly It was not the original Cat in the Hat book . It was slightly similar to the original story but clearly not the same book . Same name though . In a lot of places the words do n't even rhyme . I 'm so very disappointed .
2 #### The One Minute Manager posits that to be a good manager , only three things are needed . One , clear and concise goals which are aptly named one minute goals . Two , immediate praise with clear feedback on what was done well . Which Blanchard names one minute praisings . Three , immediate reprimands with clear feedback on what was n't done well and making clear that it 's not personal but only work performance . These three rules are placed in a narrative that takes up most of the pages of the book . While it keeps you reading , the rules are typically agreed upon to be universal through the narrative . So Blanchard essentially validates the theories about management that were put forth by himself . The book has a few merits but it definitely needs to be taken with a grain of salt . It 's a quick read though , so there 's that .
4 #### It 's short and simple , with not much content . The book really focuses one idea , which would transform the national economy and maybe global society , if people just used it more often .
5 #### My boys grew up on Dr. Seuss . Very good .
5 #### Happy to introduce this old favorite to my Grandson . He was captivated through the entire book . Sometimes with longer books like this he gets impatient ( he is 2.5 ) . He is old enough now that he does not rip pages , so this book format is good for him .
5 #### ( Kindle Version ) An adaptation of the awesome classic that really helps children read and keeps their interest .
5 #### My wife and I chose this book to base my son 's school Halloween outfit off of ( Thing 1 ) . I was expecting the typical " new " book when I received this ; however , just like another Dr. Seuss book I ordered , this book was as flawless as if I picked it up straight from whatever factory it was made in .
1 #### This Kindle version reproduces the original as two facing pages side - by - side on one Kindle page , resulting in text that is unreadable without a magnifying glass . The text - scaling tool will not work ( because it is all one integrated image ) . It is useless as a resource to help our granddaughter with her reading . What a shame - fortunately we still have the well - worn original hardcover in glorious color .
5 #### I 've always loved this book and enjoy sharing it with my GREAT grand child!~
2 #### Written for teens , who do n't yet understand the obvious facets of adult employer / employee relationships .
5 #### We have read this book with our Landscape , Golf and Airport leaders at Ole Miss. It is a great simple way to encourage leaders managing and leading people . Keeping it clear , simple and managing does not have to be super complicated , but it does need to be consistent . It is very applicable to ground level leadership .
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with Ken Blanchard . I 've even had his audio books . Love the One Minute Manager . I have promoted several times with some of his tactics ! !
5 #### this is a classic - can read it to each generation and love it !
5 #### Everybody loves Dr. Seuss ! The Cat in the Hat does not let you down ! Such a fun and entertaining story , and what a destructive way to spend a day ! You ca n't help but fall in love with this one !
4 #### This book is very readable and makes a good biography for a Junior High School student . Written from the perspective of a British officer , the book portrays Rommel as a gentleman . Very interesting information on the plot against Hitler . Recommended .
5 #### I have learned a lot about Rommel who was probably one of the few great and honorable men in Hitler 's Germany . I 've had my eyes opened . Too bad there were not a few million more like him during that era .
5 #### I have to admit that I ca n't be impartial about this book , may be because it has been one of the fisrt history books that I read , may be because I liked very much the style of writing of the author , may be because I have been fascinated by the Rommel 's personality . It is useless to say who has been Feldmarschal Erwin Rommel and so speaking about the book , I have to say that it is a very complete biography , with a foreword written by the English Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck , the one defeated by Rommel in the battles of Tobruk and Mersa Matruh . The appendix is a little treasure because it includes considerations about the desert war and the campaign fought on 1942 directly written by Rommel himself ( given to the author by the Rommel 's son ) . It is a book that for me it is unforgettable .
5 #### Rommel was first a soldier in the German Army and not a Nazi madman . He served as all soldiers should serve , his country and his troops . By the time he realized the path Hitler had chosen it was too late . This book tells the story of Erwin Rommel the man and soldier not the story of a General / Field Marshall in the Nazi army . Rommel was one of the best leaders of military forces in WWII except he was on the wrong side and was the victim of " lack of support " . The western forces were very lucky Rommel suffered from the incompetence of those above him .
5 #### A great book for kids and a silly read . Good for lower level readers as well
5 #### So it 's dr Seuss and cat in the hat . Can you say anything else ?
5 #### One of my favorites and now I have a copy for my son .
5 #### Fast shippingGreat book .. Highly recommend it for reading to 4 , 5 , and 6 year old children . Great beginning reader for primary grades .
5 #### Really enjoyed it . Everything I 've ever believed for a manager . Trying to do these attributes and have other managers do the same . Difficult when they think they are doing everything right !
4 #### This is a very helpful book . It is a very simple and easy to understand resource in narrative form highlighting key points in being an effective manager .
5 #### My 5 children , who are all adults now , absolutely loved this book . Started all over again with each grandchild . Children love this book . Makes them anxious to learn to read all by themselves .
3 #### A pretty good book but It jumps around quite a bit from topic to topic without being consistent .
5 #### Unlike " Who Moved my Cheese , " I read this one on my own . I liked it so much , I bought a couple more and gave them as gifts .
5 #### I got this book for my best friends daughter , and she absolutely loved the book ! Glad to see old classics still being popular !
4 #### My son really enjoys this book . He 's 2.5 years old .
4 #### There 's a reason Dr. Seuss will last forever !
2 #### This is paper back and the pages are not very colorful . My kid was only interested in tearing the pages
5 #### recivied in less than a week in excellent condition . excelent collection of short western stories
5 #### Sent promptly . Book description was as described . Good experience
1 #### Not a very good book . I personally did not like it and not the worth of time spent on it . very general type of cooments and instructions and failed to keep me interested .
5 #### The original is the best of all the books . Read thoughtfully & occasionally .
5 #### Came very quickly . This was a last minute gift and it came just in time ! ! !
5 #### Bought this for my son 's 4 K teacher as an end of yr gift ! It was exactly what we needed !
5 #### How can you go wrong ? The price is right . The formatting is excellent . The colors are sharp ( depending on what you are using as a display of course ) .
5 #### I think all of these books are pretty cool . They are new and sealed . More than likely I 'll just have my kid watch the movies though . That 's easier .
3 #### Still as superficial as the day it came off the press .
5 #### Excellent book and came highly recommended . Fast delivery , excellent service Thank you ! A++++++
5 #### If you 're a fan of Louis L'Amour , this is a must have for your library . If you 've never read his books before , this would be a pretty good choice for a place to start . None of the stories are too long , but each is fairly representative of L'Amour 's brand of action , humor , mystery , redemption , and even a little romance . Highly recommended .
5 #### Never read much , in fact little as a child and as an adult . I would either not be interested or would go to sleep after a couple of pages . I now have most of the L'Amours frontier and western short stories and have finished cover to cover about three of the volumes . They are exciting and the writer keeps you excited and you do n't want to lay the book down . I wish that there were ten stars and I would give a ten plus .
5 #### I love losing myself in these classic westerns . There 's nothing like it .
5 #### Louis L'amour may be the greatest Western story teller of all time . This volume is packed full of Western stories , most that can be read in less than an hour . It is a fun read .
5 #### Rotary Club reading and celebration of Dr. Suess 's birthday is our annual event and the books are selected by each classroom teacher for the class .
5 #### We love Dr. Seuss . I plan for purchasing more . Good book for beginning readers .
3 #### I love Dr. Seuss , bought this series for my grandson . I like that it 's in a case for him to keep his books together but I was n't expecting it to be in miniature sizes , that was disappointing .
5 #### Gave as a gift and the little girl loved it .
5 #### Book arrived as indicated and I 'm enjoying it very much
5 #### Serious Book Pertaining To Some Strong And Powerful Issues Regarding Day to Day Incidents For Previous Government Leaders During A Painfully And Bitter Part Of 20th Century History .
5 #### Albert Speer give a day to day account of what it is like in Spandau . The diaries are divided daily so you soon feel that you are there . You soon feel that his memories are yours and wonder what you would have done . Sure you know now , but wait until you read this book . There are 32 pages of exclusive photos . It is weird win you think what you or a relative was doing on the same days . Albert got out just one month before I went in to the military . Even his epilog is impressive . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Inside - the - Third - Reich / dp/0923891730 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Inside the Third Reich</a >
4 #### Very interesting portrayal of WW 11 from the German side .
4 #### I found this book to be good . However , Albert Speer 's attempt to set himself apart from the other Nazi 's , is somewhat foolish . This , " I did n't know what was going on in the concentration camps . " Is very skeptical . He does however write a good observation of his prison life inside Spandau . The day to day routine . But , the ' rough life ' he experienced at Spandau , like not having enough food , or not enough tobacco , or , a cold cell . Would be a holiday compared to a Nazi concentration camp .
4 #### I did grow up in Mifflin County and have always been fascinated by the Amish there and elsewhere . This book could have been very dry , as it is a quite detailed and scholarly work . Therefore , I was pleasantly surprised to find it interesting and quite reader friendly . Kaufman takes us on a journey from the Amish origins in Europe , to their earliest settlements in America , to present ( as of 1991 ) . Although I read it cover to cover , it 's extremely well organized and indexed , so it 's also easy to look up specific information . One thing I did not expect was the amount of information on settlements outside of Mifflin County . Although I understand why the author did this -- to show the contributions and outgrowth of the Mifflin County Amish as well as their heritage -- I have to admit , I was a bit disappointed that so much of the book was devoted to these " outside " settlements . That same attribute may well give the book a more universal appeal , but I was hoping this book would shed more light on the daily lives and specific practices of the Amish in and near my hometown . Nevertheless , it contains a lot of information not found elsewhere , and I 'm happy to have it in my collection .
5 #### A must read for anyone who has employees , or is a teacher , or even a parent . Wonderful tips for how to give a person critique and build their confidence at the same time .
4 #### It was an interesting read . It gave me things to think about & see how to adjust the way I approach a situation .
5 #### Nobody tells a western like Louis L'Amour ! He 's a master craftsmen who favors the Texas Rangers ... Short Stories # 2 is highly recommended , as is Volume # 1 .
5 #### As the reviews say , " Louis L'Amour 's stories take off like a shot . " The stories are very readable , very much fun , and good escapism into the romantic days of yesteryear ... Good grief , I sound like a commercial . But truly , you ca n't go wrong with L'Amour . Highly recommended .
5 #### Love this traditional family staple formatted for today 's technology . I read the paper version to my daughter and now I 'm reading the kindle version to my grandson .
4 #### The standard for early readers ( of course parents and , grand parents too ) .
4 #### book is well made . Seems to be the original version and not abridged like some kids books . I forgot how long this story is . A little much for a 3 year old , but they will grow into it .
5 #### Have wanted this book for years . Finally found it at a reasonable price in good condition and have found it very enlightening .
4 #### Although Albert Speer was n't among the absolute innermost circle of Hitler trustees ( maybe only Bormann , Gring , Goebbels , Himmler and a few others could be counted among those ) , he was nevertheless the highest ranking Third Reich official to open up so extensively in a book after the Third Reich collapsed . Starting out as Hitler 's favourite architect and the official architect of the Third Reich , he then moved on to become the Armaments and Munitions Reich Minister and thus enjoyed Hitler 's full support for most of the war . In this book he details his fellow inmates in Spandau prison - all of them former high ranking Third Reich officials - and gives an interesting insight into how each of them copes with their new roles and reconciles with the past . Speer 's writing style is not very engaging and quite dry at times , but this is excusable , since he is not really a writer and is simply chronicling his own experiences . It has been more than 10 years since I read the book but I still remember various details and bits of information , which I found extremely enlightening and hugely engaging , yet which I have never been able to encounter in other sources detailing the Third Reich . Even though this book is not as strong as Speer 's other book ( " Inside the Third Reich " ) , I 'd still say that this is highly recommended reading for anyone interested in the Third Reich on more than a casual level .
5 #### This used book came promptly in much better shape than I had anticipated . Recommend this seller ( Thrift Books ) and affliates . Very interesting read along with ' Inside the Third Reich ' .
5 #### A fascinating dispassionate eye witness first hand review and accounting of Hitler , his closet circle of contemporaries and the inner workings of the Third Reich . A must read if you are interested in this period of history .
5 #### One of several short story collections purchased for the RV home - away - from - home library . L'Amour is a terrific writer , I never get tired of reading his work .
5 #### If you love Louis L'Amour , you 'll love this collection
5 #### Great book as all lamour books are FAST SHIPPING THANK YOU !
5 #### There were plenty of short stories , each distinct on it 's own , and provided a variety of plots . Characters were generally believable and generally different from story to story . A nice easy , pleasant read especially if younlikecwesterns .
5 #### This second collection of short stories is great . I liked that he stayed with some of the characters for an extended period of time and I liked that the short stories varied in length . Highly recommended .
4 #### It'ss a funny and fascinating book . I enjoyed it !
4 #### Board book is not available So this was next best thing
4 #### We luv dr . Seuss books .. Loads of fun and outstanding for kids brain development . Strongly recommend all these books .. Loves the rhyme words
5 #### Spandau 's dairy by Albert Speer is a soul searching , tormenting battle within for survival . The diary explores Speer 's days as Hitler 's friend , his days as Minister of Ammunition and Armement , but , especially , his day to day life inside Spandau prison . His relations with guards , fellow inmates , his fears and sense of guilt , the experiments he pursued inside Spandau in the hope of passing time and retain his satiny are to say the least astonishing . I was deeply mooved by Speer 's story , and I strongly recommend anyone interested in the 3rd Reich , WW2 and human interactions to read this wondeful book . I felt sympathy for this man . We owe him much .
5 #### I literally could not put this book down . I really felt as I was reading it as if I was there in the prison with him . What an incredible , sad life . Also I got to thinking about all of the Germans who ended up in the Soviet Gulags after the war . Albert Speer should consider himself lucky that he was imprisoned at Spandau .
5 #### Excellent historical book and great Amazon price . Fast shipping , and book condition as described . The appreciation of the contents will vary from reader to reader but seemed well written by me .
5 #### That which was good ( Inside the Third Reich ) is now even better for " Spandau " is Speer 's soul - searching account of and reflection on himself and his life while he was imprisoned for 21 years . The book was written in a day - by - day diary entry form so one almost feels one is there with him sharing his emotions and observations . He made it quite clear from the very outset that writing kept him sane but " .. it must be more than a matter of organizing sheer survival . This must also become a time of reckoning . If at the end , after these twenty years , I do not have an answer to the questions that preoccupy me now , this imprisonment will have been wasted for me . And yet I fully realize that even at best my conclusions can only be tentative ... " Upon his release in 1966 , he left the mass of papers of his prison diaries lay untouched , unread for over ten years before he finally published them . Apart from the historical importance , readers will enjoy the writing of a fine intellectual mind despite his sad observation that " Diaries are usually the accompaniment of a lived life . This one stands in place of a life . " This is an immensely personal and moving book that no one could afford to miss and deserves much more than a running commentary .
5 #### What a good story . I could n't put the book down . I recommend that you read a book on the Nuremberg trials ( Persico 's is a good one ) before plunging into Speer 's diary . Speer wrote his diary while paying his 20 years sentence at Spandau prison for his responsibility as one of the leaders of the Thirch Reich .
5 #### L'Amour is an acknowledged master of the Western genre . If you 're reading this , you 're likely already familiar with his works . This version is an excellent cross - section of his Western short stories . The Kindle formatting is excellent and there were no problems .
5 #### I discovered the writings of Louis L'Amour shortly after I learned to read . I read all of these short stories in the past . It was great to relax and re - read stories I have enjoyed since childhood and through out my adult years . This is a collection of Western short stories by a master writer .
4 #### I have read almost all of Mr. L'Amour 's books . I prefer his writing because of the details . It 's as thou I am living right there .
5 #### Purchased this as a gift for my father in law . He was excited to receive .
5 #### I am amazed at myself for loving all the stories written by this incredible author . My normal reading includes historical / romance / suspense or modern romance / suspense / thriller stories . I assumed L'Amour wrote for men which , of course , he does as well . But these are universal , timeless treasures capturing a time of great drama and struggle which was an important part if the birth of the nation .. His writing style is unique and very well suited to the storylines . It is minimalism which has such power and depth that I am constantly in awe . I like everything he writes but I prefer his short stories .
5 #### Anything by L"Mour is worth reading ! A nice collection for Western fans .
4 #### Speer is an intriguing personage in the Nazi hierarchy : was he really the only " good Nazi " , as he was called , or merely a master manipulator ? I read his " Inside the Third Reich " many years ago and found him to be unafraid of his history in Hitler 's cabinet . Although " Inside " was published before " Spandau " , the diaries had to be written before he could write " Inside " . Speer struggles mightily trying to comprehend his role in Hitler 's agenda and subsequent responsibility for its actions . This alone is interest enough , however , Speer 's anecdotes about life with his fellow inmates , first at Nuremburg , then at Spandau , give a different view of such historical figures as Goring and Donitz . Speer even manages to humanize the odd and remote Rudolph Hess . Alone of the men convicted at Nuremburg , Speer sought and accepted personal accountability . His writing provides a deeply introspective view of how ordinary men are caught up in extraordinary circumstances . That he sought to understand this in himself was his redemption . The casual reader will enjoy the book for its human insights , however , some passing familiarity with WWII , Hitler , and European politics will add depth to the reader 's experience . Speer may have longed for an abiding fame as an architect , but I believe he has built something much more lasting and significant with this work than he could have imagined .
5 #### I can only repeat what others have said about " Spandau Diaries" ... it 's extremely well - written and interesting to read . I 've been thru it many times , and still enjoy reading the journal entries . I 'm glad to see it 's back in print , at least for now .
5 #### Albert Speer , Hitler 's brilliant architect and later minister for war production was sentenced to 20 years at Nuremberg .This gripping account was cobbled togather from the notes(scribbled on pieces of toilet paper ) Mr. Speer managed to smuggled out of the prison .This book is one rivetting read ! It personifies the triumph of intelligence and WILL over despair , tedium and all the petty abuses that a prisoner has to put up with . It will be on my " desert island " list .Very highly recommended .
5 #### ' Spandau : The Secret Diaries ' is the record of Albert Speer 's twenty years in the Berlin prison and is just as compelling as Speer 's earlier work , ' Inside the Third Reich . ' While serving his sentance Speer tells us of the endless discussions and thoughts about Hitler , Nazi Germany , and failed military strategies that he and his fellow inmates shared . Speer also tells us of the day to day boredom that was his constant companion . His insights into Hitler are perhaps the greatest ever produced and the portraits he paints of Doenitz , Raeder , von Shirach and Rudolf Hess provide wonderful glimpses into that troubled time . Perhaps most compelling of all is Speer 's moral struggle with his own conscience ; can a man who was part of such evil truly ever make amends ? Speer relates that his daughter was invited by a Jewish family to stay with them while she visited America . To this , Speer could only cry ; hoping that at least to some extent forgiveness is possible . Much more than history , this is a powerful look at one man 's search for redemption .
1 #### I really did n't like the theory presented in this book . I like to spend time with my employees , not just one minute with them . I just ca n't get behind an idea like that . Human factor is important in the workplace !
5 #### Does this really need a review ? Well here is a short one . I purchased a few of these for my kindle and I read them to my baby in my belly . Once I start reading the baby starts moving around enjoying the sounds of the different rhymes within the book . Love it !
4 #### Nice book , product as described , stitching is good quality . I am only putting 4 stars because I am not sure what I expected after reading all these excellent reviews . The little poem is just ok . Could have been something a little bit longer too . I do n't know . Also there is nothing for the baby to play with in the book - no crinkly paper , nothing attached , just a short poem to read . But fine : I give it solid 4 stars .
4 #### It was on my Kindle for my granddaughter . She liked it .
5 #### Another classic by Dr Seuss . My seven year old that the Car uses the mother 's dress to clean the tub .
5 #### There is nothing else better for young children than you reading a good story full of fun sounds and surprises to them
5 #### I always enjoyed Dr. Seuss books as a child and they still make me laugh . Just give some a try , have some giggles and fun read to your kids or grand kids or a classroom of little A , B , C 's all the way to Z , then you can see their faces light up too .
5 #### A riveting historical and psychological record both of the third reich and its aftermath and of the human experience of imprisonment . The candid and private reflections of Hess , Doenitz , Speer and others over a period of years are illuminating as to the true nature of the innermost workings of the Nazi heirarchy . Also a compelling portrait of powerful , dynamic men as they unravel under the strain of years - a lifetime in some cases- of forced tedium . A must book for any serious student of the era .
5 #### Interesting look into what it takes to be an effective and efficient leader / manager . The book takes place in a business setting , but these tips and ideas could be used in many aspects of everyday life . The OMM takes management theories and explains them in a way that flows freely in a story . Some ideas can be a little outdated , as I do n't know that something like touching in the workplace would still be acceptable in today 's world . But the ideas are all still valid and significant .
4 #### I have read this book several times . It is a short book and a quick read . You can find it used on Amazon for $ 0.99 if you look . The business principals are valid and the story is fairly interesting .
5 #### For me , Louis Lamour is the end - all of western writers . His stories are riveting , resulting in a consistent suspension of disbelief . The theater of the mind is actively involved when reading his stories . You picture yourself there and involved up to your maximum involvement . It is a real let down when you put his stories down and realize you are back in your real world . I would recommend his stories for everyone . And you can let your older children read them without worrying what the stories will do to their tender psyche .
5 #### Louis L'Amour is one of my favorite writers ! Whether he 's writing about an airplane pilot or a cowboy his writing is very entertaining . These short stories are brilliant !
5 #### You ca n't get writin like this no more , least not in these here parts . This L'Amour galoot is a writer to ride the river with . No low down one - star hombre 's gon na get me to quit readin him . An this here collection at $ 1.99 for 464 pages is the best buy I ever seen short o ' the Louisiana Purchase . Do it pardner , you know you want to . And happy trails to you and all yer little pardners .
4 #### Stories from the Wild West are highly romanticized and true to the value system under which I was raised here in the far western u s after wwII . these are not Goosebumps or Harry Potter . I do n't know if l'amour 's writing reflects the values of the 1950s or if he imposed his values on postwar America through his popular writing . Who cares ? Good stuff for me and my contemporaries .
3 #### Not his best , but good enough I 'm glad I spent the $ to buy it .
5 #### Bought this for a Baby Shower gift where they asked that you give a book in lieu of a greeting card . One of my personal favorites of Dr. Seuss .
4 #### Like volume 1 , there 's many excellent stories . Some better than others , but all worth the time to read .
4 #### not a great fan of short stories but love L'Amour
5 #### Once you ve read these stories you ll understand why the author is famous . The writing is really good and a lot of variety in the plots . the small thick format is a little hard to hold . I would have preferred the book to have a larger perimeter .
5 #### This book is part of a recommended collection of books for financial success . There are 8 other books to read . google up 9 books to read for financial success . reading them all gives you an overview and mindset of how to better manage your financial stability in life .
5 #### Who does n't love this book ? Bought it for a new consumer .
5 #### I enjoy reading a western always . But these byLouis L. Are always the best . True shooting cow punching Cowboys
3 #### I bought this for my husband who is a huge Louis L'amour fan . The part on the cover " first time in paperback " was not exactly true as my husband reports that there are many similarities of other stories ( or other books only in short form ) that were in this book . Still he read it from cover to cover .
5 #### Short stories by the best of the western and outdoor adventures writers ... what more can I say ?
3 #### Very good nearly indispensable information written in a format that oscillates between children 's storybook and a raging sociopath obsessed with surrounding people that like to call him a One Minute Manager . The material is amazing but the story is outlandish and contradictory . Right out of the gate the book says people are more effective when they feel good about themselves , but the manager says incredibly harsh things like " ' Then do n't waste my time , ' he snapped . " The manager snapped ? Really ? Does everything the manager says need to be in a pissy italics tone ?
5 #### Just like when I was young . The book is well made .
5 #### Just like when I was young . The book is well made .
5 #### This book contains the English words along with Taiwan Chinese ! I know this is the Taiwan version of Chinese , because a friend of mine spent time in Taiwan and recognized the particular Chinese symbols that are used by people from Taiwan .
5 #### Have almost everything L'Amour has written . My dad left me his collection . Husband also nuts about him . Has read everything ! !
5 #### In my opinion Louis L'Amour books are always good and this one is no exception . It is a series of short stories that he wrote for magazines years ago . I really enjoyed the book
5 #### The stories in this book were captivating . I spent a day read it . Would love to read more short stories . Not sure if there is a volume III but if there is I will enjoy reading it .
5 #### Another great selection of short stories by the master . Most of the stories are relatively short ( taking 30 minutes or so to read ) . The main character in most is Chick Bowdrie and there are several stories of this Texas Ranger in a row . If you are so inclined , you may want to take a break between some as I did but this did not lessen my enjoyment of this character and others in this collection . Comfort reading at it 's best ! !
4 #### Good short stories . He did not have time to develop a long plot but this is good for a chapter at bedtime or in a Dr office , etc . I recommend it highly ! !
5 #### Always a plesure to read Dr Seuss books ! And now I can read it to my baby !
5 #### There 's nothing like a good story from the pen of Louis L'AMour . Thanks for your service . Tom Wall Jackson . MO
5 #### Bought for my husband , who is a huge fan . He loves it .
5 #### Another great selection of short stories . Some I have read before , some new ones ; all entertaining . If you like western stories , or stories of the old west , this is a good collection to own .
4 #### For those wanting something less than a single , full - length story of the cowboy West this volume offers a wide range of stories that in spite of their shortness can still awaken a lot of emotion and sustain interest in the fortunes of their heroes both men and women . The stories also vary in length to suit different tastes . Of particular interest in this collection is the appearance of one of Louis L'Amour 's lesser - known figures the young Texas Ranger Chick Bowdrie and his hammerhead roan . Bowdrie 's skill with a gun almost took him onto the owlhoot trail but he was saved in time by an older Texas Ranger who could see his potential for getting inside the mind of outlaws and outwitting them . A series of Bowdrie escapades sits in the middle of the volume .
5 #### Louis L'Amour is one of the few writers that I love to reread over and over
5 #### Too many people confuse Russia with the Soviet Union . The diversity of peoples and lands is huge . Of all the books in the series , this one is by far the best .
5 #### Straight and to the point . A must have for all managers .
5 #### if you 're a manager , new or experienced , you should read this . is it the right answer for every management situation ? of course not . but it will give you a great and effective place to work from .
2 #### This is a mixed bag . Before Dr. Suess came along , children 's authors assumed that children had a vocabulary of 250 words , and kept it simple . Dr. Suess challenged that theory , and gave a bit of a stretch to the amount of words being used . However , where most children 's books also have some kind of instructive moral , this one does not . It says , " disobey your parents , and everything will be ok . " Nice try for stretching the vocabulary , but shame on the author for teaching bad morals to kids .
5 #### THE CAT IN THE HAT is a classic story of children left alone at home and the mischief they get into when the Cat in the Hat comes for a visit . While the Cat tempts the children into adventures , the children are told by their pet fish that they should not be involved in such things . THE CAT IN THE HAT is n't even on my top 5 of favorite Dr. Seuss books . I always liked the more rhyming stories as a child . As a parent , however , I really like the idea of what happens when mom is n't home and children have to make their own decisions . The last part of the story which asks whether the children should tell their mother of their adventures and then asks the reader the same thing is something that can be used to foster discussions between parents and children . What else is there to say . Like it or not , it is a classic that everyone should read .
1 #### The Spanish translation is just worst than awful . It 's a waste of money .
5 #### Hello my is Aidan I am 8 years old . I just read cat in the hat comes back , and I thought it was a really good book . I really liked the part about catA , catB , catC. And all the other cats too . I read with Mas . Hobbs .
5 #### Short stories are GREAT for short runs in the car ..... or for driver keeping awake while everyone else is dozing .
5 #### I 'm a long time fan of Louis L'Amour and own almost all of his books . My Dad has moved into Assisted Living and I have now introduced him to these books . He is an avid reader at the age of 89 and enjoys the books tremendously . I 'll be purchasing more of these short stories for him and he likes the large print
5 #### The storys are well done and I will listen to them over and over . I already have several of the storys and am always looking for more .
4 #### I seem to be going back to school majoring in history when I read these stories . The research must have been ongoing for many years .
5 #### How can a guy go wrong .Started reading seriously in my old age , L'Amour is authentic I 've been to many places he writes about
5 #### Books on tape are so great for traveling and this one was no exception . It was fast paced all through the book and took us several miles before it was done . We are Max Louis L'Amour fans and as usual , his books have lovely spoken scenery in them . Loved them all .
5 #### Easy read . Very quick to get through . Short , actionable lists throughout that help you summarize and condense the material for you to use in your life . I liked it a lot .
4 #### My husband speaks Russian and I wanted to pick up just a few children 's books for him to read to our daughter . The goal is n't for her to learn Russian , just to be exposed to something different . He says the translation is good but it 's not his favorite book .
5 #### Have this book as an application on my reader but wanted the hardcover to read to my twins . Classic book . Will repurchase when this one wears out . Fast delivery and in good condition .
4 #### Good book , not better than the original but a decent sequel .
3 #### The book 's content is a Seuss classic . This particular book had a few dozen cards in the front advertising a book club . Since it was purchased as a gift , I was disappointed that it looked like a promotional item , not the regular book I wanted .
5 #### These are not cowboy shoot 'em ups but realistic tales of pioneers . There are in each volume a few of the , to me , more traditional cowboy tales of violence and shooting but nearly all appeal to me . If you like historical fiction of this time period and place I think you 'll enjoy reading these .
5 #### Great little Book - good service as well - great communication . I would highly recommend to anyone . Thanks for everything .
5 #### Louis always makes sure that the cowboy has a happy ending : his ranch , his horse and his girl . Probably in that order . Historically accurate . Always entertaining . Pass the pork and beans .
5 #### Had bought this book as a gift for my husband to add to his collection . Was very pleased with transaction .
4 #### Though a romanticized view of the " old west , " these stories provide the reader an experience with the men and women of an earlier time when people had to face hardships and solve their problems themselves ; whining got you nowhere . One negative : the collections need to be organized so that readers do not purchase duplicates of the stories under different titles .
5 #### I really enjoyed this book . I wish I had it earlier in life when I was working . Nevertheless , I am using the information in my church ministry .
5 #### 1 Minute Manager and The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey are two of the Greatest , easy to read management books I 've read , and I 've read a bunch .
5 #### One of the easiest books to read but also has substance that you can instantly use .
5 #### Dr Seuss is timeless . I know everyone is going with digital Notebooks but there is nothing like a book to sit down with a child and read with . This was used and in very good condition . I m very happy with the purchase .
4 #### A little more complicated than the average dr.suess books . Love that there is both Spanish and English on the page .
1 #### ( 1 ) Not as advertised . Bait and Switch per Amazon . I purchased this with the understanding it was a true 1st ed . , it was not . ( 2 ) It 's a great story , so even though it was NOT as Amazon said it was , it makes a pretty special gift for any young kid for Christmas . 5 stars for the book , 1 start for Amazon 's false advertising .
5 #### I love having all of his best in one book . I read all that he writes . Try this book for sure .
5 #### Not only are these great stories , but they provide insight on the way things used to be back in the day .
5 #### If you like books written by Louis L'Amour you will like this book . I love to read anything that was written by him . Volume 2 is more of his great stories .
5 #### This book was a gift and she loved it . She read it everyday , she said it was like watching cowboys on TV . She wants me to read it and I will .
4 #### This book makes a good introduction of the works of Louis L'Amour , even if it is the second volumn of his work . There are so many stories and when you want to read a few at a time you can , then set aside to come back to later without missing anything . I would recommend this as a look into western themes and the stories of Rangers , etc . that inhabit our cowboy movies and television programs of times past .
5 #### Louis L'Amour is the best Western writer in the last 60 years . He goes into much detail as to the layout of the area where each story takes place . I have all of his Frontier Stories in his Collected Short Stories series . Enjoyable reading ! A master storyteller .
2 #### Very easy , fast read . Be upfront with those you manage by setting goals with them , praising them immediately , and reprimanding immediately . Behaviors are praised and reprimanded , not people . This book is written in narrative form about a person searching for answers in order to be an effective manager .
5 #### My 23 mos loves the book . Reads it every night . She recites story lines with me and attempt to read by herself .
5 #### My granddaughter picked out her own Beanie Boos and was happy with all that she got ! She loves them !
4 #### I gifted this book to my nephew who recently had his Bar - Mitzvah . He loved the book and learned from it .
5 #### I have only begun reading Louis L'Amour in the last year . I find these short Western stories to be a joy to read .
4 #### For those of you who have followed the Sacketts - this anthology gives us another hero , Texas Ranger Chick Bowdrie . Be forewarned if you buy this book it is mostly stories of this rugged , fast with a gun lawman . It is best to read interspersed with other books as reading about only Mr. Bowdrie as a steady diet can be a bit too repetitive . That being said it is a fun read .
5 #### I love Westerns , and I absolutely love the way Louis L'Amour tells his Western stories . Granted , there 's not always a lot of suspense with regards to the outcome ( L'Amour seems not to have been enamored of downbeat , twist , or morally ambiguous endings ) , but there 's often considerable suspense along the way . The writer was a national treasure , and if your tastes run along the same line as mine , this book will be your personal treasure .
4 #### I 've been a fan of Louis L'Amour for as long as I can remember and I have always liked the audio tapes , and now CD 's , that let me listen to the stories when I am driving . But I do have a couple of complaints about The Collected Short Stories of Louis L'Amour Volume One and Volume Two . First , it would be nice if they listed the titles of the short stories , but they do n't . There is no where on the CD itself , the CD case , or the slip cover with the titles of the stories . Why the big secret ? Second , and more important , neither of the readers , John Bedford Lloyd for Volume One and Jason Culp for Volume Two are good at doing voices . Their natural voices are great but then they try to change their voices for various characters , instead of simply reading with their natural voice , and that significantly detracts from the stories . And neither is any good at doing women 's voices and should n't try . It is embarrassing . It is also embarrassing when Culp does the voices of some of the heros - they come of as either 10 or 12 year old whiny kids ( as in The Drift ) - or not very bright adults . What is the point ? If different voices are important then they should use more than one person to read the story . If not , dispense with the attempt since it detracts from the stories .
5 #### This book has been around a long time . I had the book years ago but gave it away , now I have a copy for myself . Share the information in the book with others , it will help us managers be better able to deal with people .
5 #### I was in a seminar put on my Kenneth Blanchard about twenty years ago . Everything in this book makes sense . A manager at my work has issues with all his employees , but does n't bring these issues up , unless he uses it against people at review time . I bought him this book and things have been turning around . He now spends a minute coaching people towards what he wants them to do and now their reviews are better , production is better , and their raises are better . If your boss is n't awesome , buy him this book .
5 #### Well if you liked the first one you 'll like this one too
5 #### Great buy ! ! My baby loves them and is so happy cuz he got movies lol !
5 #### Great book .. I took a lot from this book for managing my team .
4 #### good book , given as a gift ( read it years ago , passing on to another generation )
4 #### If you think you can change the world or your business , and have some better understanding of the business culture , go for it .
3 #### As was alread said , this is a fitting end to the series , however it is just that . It does n't really qualify as a novel in its own right , as the others do . Still , readers of the first two books should read it .
5 #### Always the greatest and so timeless ! Arrived in new condition , fast and a real deal !
5 #### Still as lovable as it was 55 years ago ! Bought it as a gift , arrived in beautiful condition ( new ) and fast , for a great price .
5 #### My 5th copy I keep handing them out they are so good
5 #### I was pleasantly surprised with this book ... It 's not you 're typical book on management with charts , diagrams and bullet lists , instead the authors redacted the book in the form of a novel or story about a young manager eager to learn the secret to effective management . It 's very descriptive and has immediate and practical " take - away " content from start to finish . This has definitely shaped my way of looking at management forever . I strongly recommend for those interested in expanding their view and stand - point on what good management and leadership should be .
5 #### LOVE DR . SEUSS BOOKS . I read them to my son every night and they always keep him entertained .
5 #### I remember reading these books to my boys when they were young and now I 'm enjoying reading them to my grandson
5 #### How could you possibly go wrong with this classic ?
5 #### Love good old Cat in the Hat to read to my grand daughter , as loved reading to my children growing up .
5 #### I needed this for a class ; served its purpose . good points .
5 #### What is there not to like about the Cat in the Hat ? Plus kids doze to sleep from the rhymes .
5 #### My son loves this book . He is almost 3 and asks me to read it every night before bed . He calls it Mommy 's favorite book .
1 #### I used this in a Master 's class . Here the Cat pushes his way in - forces the kids to disobey their parents and just when all is lost and the moral lesson would be learned - Thing One and Thing Two show up and clean up the whole mess . Message : if you disobey your parents , things will still work out .
4 #### Perfect for Read Across America Day . Make sure you have the hat to go with the book . Every one loves the Cat and Dr. Seuss so it 's good to dress the part .
4 #### A neglectful parent , a subversive cat , a piscine Big Brother , and twin automatons . People regard&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Alice - In - Wonderland / dp/0553213458 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Alice In Wonderland</a>&nbsp;as a shining beacon of literary nonsense , but The Cat in the Hat more than holds its own . Illustrated in simple primary colors of red and blue , this is a book your kids will love but with which you ought to have a rather more complicated relationship . Ted was some kind of writer to spin a story so silly ( in a child 's eyes ) and yet so deviant . The questions which may be asked are myriad : Should Sally and her brother have called 9 - 1 - 1 the moment the Cat broke in ? Why does this " Cat " wear gloves ? Does ennui invite catastrophe ? Why are young children home alone ? Did their mother set up the entire plot ? Why did Seuss choose a Darwin fish to be the eyes , ears , and mouthpiece for Big Brother ? Did the circus ever find their performing cat ? And perhaps , was it all a dream ? The story ends with a question reminiscent of Dr. Seuss ' very first book ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/And - to - Think - That - I - Saw - It - on - Mulberry - Street / dp/0394844947 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street</a > ) , i.e. , What would * you * do ?
4 #### A page was missing from the back . I contacted the seller and all was resolved to my complete satisfaction . This is at the top of my list as a favorite for every child to have on their bookshelf . So very " famous " and always entertaining to read aloud .
4 #### This book has helped me to set attainable goals and achieve them !
5 #### Everybody in a manager role need to read this book , this is one of the best .
5 #### Superb book by the former Soviet apologist and atheist . Muggeridge provides his inspirational insight into a woman who was otherworldly ; that is , seeing the Crucified Christ in each soul . Short book with a profound message !
5 #### One of my favourite books of all time , on one of my favourite people of all time . A candid , honest ( could it be anything less ) and illuminating dialogue between two people searching for an understanding of GOD . Though both are on very different path 's , their shared humanity , desire to know and intimately connect with and experience a complex GOD has resulted in a very moving and inspiring work . Questioning and doubt are OK , GOD is not too small to meet us at our point of need , and to fill us with a love and compassion for others .
5 #### This view of St Mother Teresa presented by Muggeridge was very moving . It provided insight into her personality and faith that leaves no doubt as to why the Catholic Church has declared her to be a saint . Very few people could achieve the total giving of self in service to God as she did , but it gives those who want to serve a goal to strive for .
5 #### A great primer for Sept 4th , when she becomes a Canonized Saint .
5 #### Love this set , gave this to a charity and some of the books in the set were n't bought by any one else so it really came in handy so the kids could read all the absolutely wonderful Dr. Seuss books . I love them !
5 #### After we divorced , my ex - wife got a lot of my material things ( read : junk ) . But not my collection of precious books , including all of Dr. Seuss 's treasures . I was 13 when this first came out , and even though my peers were all out playing army and being James Dean with the rolled - up sleeves on their t shirts and smoking Camels , I was hidden under the stairs in our walk - up , reading Dr. Seuss . Somehow it made me a child again , not that 13 was n't a young age , and it took me far away from the Cold War and nasty invasive politics of the day , far away from Frisbees and Elvis Presley . The Cat in the Hat was a magical and lyrical story about idle time , fun and games , mischief out of hand , and the final reprieve before mom got home . I love the question at the end--"What would you do if your mother asked you [ what you did for the afternoon ] ? "
5 #### " WOW ... this book is amazing " , said my 6 yr old son . All Dr Seuss books help with learning frequency sight words .
5 #### It 's pretty rad . My parents read it to me and my brother when we were young and now I read it to my kids . Never thought a Seuss sequel would be so cool .
5 #### This book is the place to start for everyone who manages people . It is an easy reading , practical , and insightful book that provides valuable tools and understanding for managers . I highly recommend it , and would recommend The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey as a follow - up to this one . I have given copies of these books to all of the managers that report to me .
5 #### super little book about smart managing . A totally smart way to be a good manager of others . This was a second copy to share with others ... It is that good .
5 #### Excellent read , book was just as described ( great condition ) . Delivered quickly .
5 #### More people in this world should care as she did
5 #### This is Something Beautiful for God . It 's about seeing Jesus in the Poorest of the Poor .
5 #### My daughter ( 20 - 24 mo ) asks me to read " silly hat " book morning and night . I think she will continue to enjoy it for a long , long time .
1 #### This story is about children letting a rude , borderline sociopathic stranger into their house . How is this funny , amusing or appropriate for children ? Also the spanish seems like it came from a cut and paste into a translating program .
5 #### I 'm 30 and reading this for the first time ... so what are you waiting for ? Be a young kid again ! !
5 #### A crowd pleasure ! I have n't read it in so long , so it was a pleasure to reconnect . Dr. Seuss was a master in rhyming , which is becoming a dying art .
5 #### A classic that is fun to read to my baby . She seems to enjoy the pictures and the funny words that I read from the book .
5 #### excellent book and arrived in great condition ! thank you !
5 #### Thank you very much everything came on time as always . Product tight and well in tact I have not read the book yet but I will . And I will write again
5 #### My wife uses these books at her job as an HR manager . She enjoys loaning them to other managers .
5 #### Short and sweet , it 's got some great , effective lessons that are easy to implement immediately .
5 #### awesome book ! I read it for college , but as a manager it has really helped me .
5 #### This book is a keeper . Such a beautiful life story and it includes pictures and tells about a bit of a miracle .
5 #### We loved this book . It really touched us and made us think and discuss . We recommend it - good read .
5 #### Humbling and inspiring . A wonderful gift for people looking for an example to try to come even close to emulating .
5 #### The book was recommended to me by a friend who worked with Mother Teresa . I knew very little about Mother Teresa and her work and the book filled in the gaps for me . As for Mother Teresa - what a remarkable and inspirational person .
5 #### Short and so very sweet . Truly inspiring -- both Mother Teresa and Muggeridge 's own thoughts and observations on the experience of meeting her .
2 #### difficult to begin , but once in it gets better . Many wonderful quotes to ponder once you are beyond the introduction
5 #### All time favorite . Every kid should own this book .
4 #### A classic the kids continue to love . Ebooks are soo easy on the road . Just wish it was audible as this book is for your children who most likely ca n't read on their own yet and I ca n't read to them and drive at the same time . Audible would get this listing 5 stars .
5 #### This book was a gift for an immigrant Chinese woman and her son . It is an interesting way for both of them to practice English and strengthen their family bond .
5 #### Purchased for my granddaughter . A favorite book from my childhood and I hope it will be a favorite for her as well .
5 #### This was an awesome book . I loved how it was a quick read and it was straight to the point . I enjoyed how the content was presented as a story . It really kept me hooked , quite surprisingly . You can read this in about an hour and I 'd say you can learn a lot from that short hour . It 's a worthy investment and it was a book I wasted no time telling my girlfriend and friend about . They were both intrigued ! Highly recommended !
4 #### " The One Minute Manager " might be old news now but I think it has some of the best advice for young managers at all levels available . This is a little book , almost a handbook on how to deal with common issues that come up in dealing with subordinates . The text is crisp and unadorned , matter of fact and quick . If you are or if you know a young person who finds himself in charge of others , recommend " The One Minute Manager " to him or her . This is not at all the end of the story of an evolving manager but will help clueless young managers to find their way . I buy copies and put them in the hands of people I care about and want to help along their path .
5 #### Ken Blanchard has established himself as a thoughtful , forward looking , provider of very solid advice for managers . This seminal work has developed a following of copycats , but none as succinct as clear as Blanchard .
5 #### The book is divided into four parts : The first is Malcolm Muggeridge recounting his experience with meeting Mother Teresa for the first time . It was definitely my favorite part of the book . It certainly reads biographical of Mother Teresa , but there is also an overarching sense of an autobiographical faith journey for Mr. Muggeridge . It certainly makes for fascinating reading due to both the topic and Muggeridge 's mastery of the language . The second portion is titled " Mother Teresa 's Way of Love " , which essentially amounts to a catechism of Mother Teresa . If anyone doubts the holiness of this woman , or is curious about her view of life , you need only read this portion of the book to be satisfied . The third part reads as the Q&A with Malcom and Mother Teresa . The fascination of Malcom with Mother Teresa is apparent and no doubt due to the way she answers the questions put to her . The fourth part of the book is Malcom 's reflection of his encounter with the saint . It picks up where the first part leaves off . This book would serve well as both an introduction to the life of Mother Teresa and the writings of Malcom Muggeridge , as well as a guide on how to live a saintly life and grow in holiness .
5 #### This is a great account of some of the life and work of Mother Teresa . Everything written by her in this book is worth a million stars , but the work by the journalist , although good , is written in a somewhat poor manner . None the less , this is a great account of the devotion and love Mother Teresa has for the poorest of the poor . A testimony to the love of this saint that she had for Jesus , both in the poor and in the Eucharist . One of the most remarkable things about this book , is the Journalist that wrote most of it was totally enthralled by Mother Teresa . So much so , that he thought of converting to Catholicism just for her . But he decided he could n't just accept the Church like she could and could n't just accept it on her account . Mother Teresa was insistent that he would one day be Catholic , she said she had a desire to partake of the Eucharist with him , and God does not give desires he does not grant . He converted to Catholicism 12 years later .
5 #### Excellent book . Very well - written . This woman is simply miraculous and this book revitalized my faith in humanity . A must read .
5 #### In this book it describes how Mother Teresa established her Missionaries of Charity and how they served the sick , suffering and dying in Calcutta . She gave everything she had and her life was totally dedicated to her mission , her calling and those who were hungry , homeless , and very sick . This book makes me realize that everything that I have today is a gift from God ! Great book .
5 #### This book was recommended by Father Illo from St. Josephs in Modesto . Very moving and inspirational book . I highly recommend !
4 #### Late in his adult life the renowned agnostic Malcolm Muggeridge converted to Christianity through the influence of Mother Teresa ( 1910 - 1997 ) . In 1959 he interviewed Mother Teresa , and then ten years later made a television documentary of her life for the BBC . To honor her beatification in October 2003 , Harper reissued the book version of these two efforts as a short , popular biography . Muggeridge reviews how Mother Teresa left her very satisfying call as a high school teacher and followed her " call within a call " to love the poorest of the poor in Calcutta . Under her direction , and convinced that every person should be able to die within sight of a loving face , no person was ever refused . Today , the Missionaries of Charity which she founded have houses in almost every country of the world . Evocative black and white photos accompany Muggeridge 's powerful story - telling .
5 #### I have a 5 month old that just giggled and cooed the entire time I read this to her , almost like she was trying to read it to me . She grabbed at the pictures and tried to help me turn the pages . Something about all the blues and orange colors really fascinated her lol .
5 #### My son is almost 3 now and loves this book .. He sits through the whole book and calls the two kids in the book as Sally and Molly . This was the first of the Dr. Seuss books that I had and looking forward to buying all the other books ! !
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Dr. Seuss , and this fun tale that is a sequel to The Cat In the Hat does not disappoint . Fun rhyming with that mischievous cat with a fun problem of getting rid of a bath tub ring ! Quirky fun and educational also . I love that these book utilize so many words , and are long enough but not too long . Great vocabulary and style .
3 #### this was a good book but not so well . you see it is weird . but to you it could be awesome .
5 #### I had to get this book for my son because this was my favorite book as a kid . When I read this book to my little one it brings back a lot of memories .
5 #### Cat in the Hat was one of the favorites in my family . They learned how to recognize words and listen to sounds as you read them . Now with the great grandchildren we are just carrying on with the Dr. Seuss books . The Mom 's and Dad 's like them .
5 #### Among the hundreds of books written on Mother Teresa and her ministry , this is one of the earliest and the best . It has the very words of Mother Teresa with regard to her life , vocation and apostolate . The photographs and interviews included in the book make the portrayal of this nun and her work almost complete . Making a TV program about her and writing this book , were life - changing experiences for Malcolm Muggeridge . For someone planning to learn about Mother Teresa this may be the book to begin with .
5 #### .... of Mother Teresa 's activities with the poor , written with grace and conviction . My favorite book about her and her work . You wo n't read this and remain unchanged by it .
5 #### Muggeridge , in his conversion to Catholicism described the process as " a homecoming , a sense of picking up the pieces of a lost life , of responding to a bell that had long been ringing , of finding a place at a table that had been set and long vacant .... " There is no finer person then to describe the power and poetry with which the great mystic Mother Theresa lived this presence , someone who was constantly picking up the pieces of lost lives , bringing them together at the table with Christ . This book is unsurpassed in its simple beauty .
5 #### Tired of chasing mammom and the treats of this world that wo n't survive your death ? Malcolm Muggeridge gives an outstanding review of the daily life of Mother Teresa and the sisters who serve in the Missionaries of Charity and why they are such peaceful and joyful women . Mother Teresa and her work are a fresh breeze in a world that is increasingly populated at all levels with naval - gazers . She makes it clear that you do n't turn inward and find ways to indulge yourself in ever increasing amounts but , to be truly happy , you must serve others . Why should you do this ? Read the book and find out ....
4 #### Had read this years ago when it first came out . Bought it again to read to see if it was as great as it had seemed to be then , given my own change in perspective and mellowing over the years . Meh ! . Cute and folksy , common sense . Light weight homilies , one minute insight -- don't make a BFD out of anything .
5 #### I read this books years ago and loaned it to someone or misfiled it in my library . At any rate , it is a must have book for managers so I bought another one to replace the one I loaned or misplaced .
5 #### I order this book for all the people I give gifts to . I read it myself years ago . It does not get better than this for helping to deal with people and in a concise format .
5 #### Just read it too my daughter and she loved it . Truly a classic that will love on for the ages .
1 #### The translation was so bad my Spanish husband stopped reading it to our toddler a few pages in . Will just read it in English .
5 #### Bought this classic for my son and it was an instant hit . You definitely ca n't go wrong with Dr Seuss !
5 #### A child 's collection is simply not complete without The Cat in the Hat . It is so fun to read aloud and to memorize little excerpts like " I know it is wet and the sun is not sunny . But we can have lots of good fun that is funny ! " And " It is fun to have fun but you have to know how . " Nobody would write a story anymore about a badly behaving stranger who intrudes on children who are home alone , and for good , obvious reason . So , yes , an occasional lesson about stranger danger should go along with readings of this book . The fish , whose pleas go ignored , is the sensible and safe character whose warnings the children would have been wise to heed .
5 #### My Great Grandbaby loves to be read . She will be 2 years old in August . I bought Green Eggs & Ham by Dr. Seuss and she loves it so I bought The Cat in the Hat . She asks me to read Dr. Suess by name . I am so glad that Amazon has these books to download to my Kindle Fire for her enjoyment . I have n't read these books since my own children had them and enjoy it more than I can remember reading them to a whole new generation . She has started asking her " Memere to read The Cat in the Cat . I think it 's the way Dr. Suess makes his stories rhymes that intrigues her .
5 #### I liked it ! I did . It really was fun . I 'd love to write more , but I 'm on the run . The Cat in the Hat is quite funny , you see . And is evidence of God - given creativity . So press on , dear reader , in the pages of Suess . You will discover great wisdom for use .
4 #### My daughter enjoys the mischief and the fun of this book ! Things One and Two are her favorite ! Good story !
5 #### Wonderful book for children . My sons loved it we read the book 3 nights in a row . Buy this book .
5 #### It is a good translation to Spanish . I like bilingual books as my daughter is fluent in Spanish and when I read the English part she understands the meaning
5 #### The Cat in the Hat is another great Dr. Seuss book . I remember reading it as a child and after having kids of my own , purchasing it for them so they could enjoy it as well . They are a little older now , but when they first started reading they loved it . My daughter would read it and listen to the audio version over and over before going to bed . She just loves the story . The also enjoyed the movie as well and would watch that over and over to the point where I had to hide it just to get them to watch something else . I think this is an excellent book for early / young readers . Its written in a way that s easy to read and is extremely entertaining for kids . T.S. Charles Author of young adult book , " Consumed . " Available on Amazon .
5 #### This slim volume will take you an hour or two to read but , if you follow its three simple rules consistently , could help you become an outstanding people manager . The language is a little bit dated and sexist but , if you can ignore , that the advice is pertinent regardless of the gender of the manager or the the employees . I bought this edition for a colleague who is struggling managing both her manager and her staff and I am confident it will help her do both better . It certainly helped me in my younger days as a manager and was the first book I thought of when I became aware of my young colleague 's difficulties . One of the better ' how to ' books .
5 #### The One Minute Manager is direct and to the point . It teaches you what you need to know without all the fluff . The book reveals that techniques that increase your productivity , job satisfaction and personal achievement . The book gives you three very practical secrets on how to be a good manger and get the most productive out of your team while keeping them inspired and engaged . This book is simple , short and opens your eyes to the right way of managing your team and workplace .
3 #### One minute on the clock and go ! This book had interesting points as well as surprisingly brash and blunt points ( e.g. the " One Minute Manager " getting upset and warning the man who came to question him not to make him repeat himself ) . The " One Minute Manager " claims to like people and results . The latter part is understood . However , does he really like people ? It seems his personality is similar to most other managers ( i.e. condescending , haughty , curt , speciously polite , etc . ) . Although the " One Minute Manager " needs to work on his people skills , if you peel back his ( onion ) layers , he seems to authentically want both his business and his people to succeed . Oh no , my minute 's up . There 's the door . Take care now . ;-)
5 #### I was told by Intel that I needed to read this book . I did it gets right to it and makes since . Even though this management style has been around It does not waste your time understanding the concepts . If you like direct , concise , easy to read , but revealing info this book is for you .
5 #### I 've used this book for years and recommended it to my employees who worked independently throughout the country . When my youngest son started his own business I gave him this to help him stay on target with his workday . When your daily schedule is self - directed , it 's so easy to become overwhelmed with challenges and distractions . This book gives you a tool to help you accomplish what must be done by taking a minute several times a day to evaluate and prioritize your activities . I 've recommended it for years and put my money where my mouth is ... bought it and gave it to others many times .
5 #### I have loved this book for thirty years , and in sixteen years or parenting I have never liked another more , unless it was another Dr. Seuss .
5 #### I could n't read to my children enough times , so I got my " revenge " by sending it to my grandson . :) I does n't download to a Mac .
5 #### And now , after reading this , along with The Cat in the Hat , to my daughter , I can also read it with my granddaughter !
5 #### Have loved this as a youth and still enjoying the joy of cat and his friends with my grandchildren today
5 #### My great granddaughter loves reading all of the Dr Seuss books . They are excellent beginner books . Her kindergarten class has them and now she has some of her own . I would recommend them for all beginner readers .
5 #### Every child should have this book . With rhymes and silliness , it is still a favorite for my 9 year old .
2 #### The book was boring and not very informative . I would n't recommend it to anyone . The way it was told , like a story , was really silly .
5 #### Everybody should read this book , specially business people . This book gives you a great perspective on how to treat you employees and people in general .
5 #### Read this and the " One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey " ... Both are worth reading- they apply to owners , managers , and all others in any sort of a leadership role . Read them once ... Read them twice ... Read as much as you like and I guarantee you wo n't be sorry for the time
5 #### Quick read with great recommendations and suggestions on how to manage without micromanaging . Everyone understand expectations , is involved in the setting goals and held accountable when not meet or praised when met .
5 #### this is an interesting book it 's about how to manage people and all you do is praise people . I would rather receive praises all day then someone tell me what I did wrong .
5 #### Revolutionary book . Get one for yourself and one for your manager . You will both be glad that you did . The three principles are simple and clear and the fun story line makes it easy to review the material again and again .
5 #### Having grandchildren that are bi - lingual is always a puzzle as what to get for gifts . This book proved to be the surprise that made a little girl happy . I can not speak Russian but her Russian Grandfather read this with her and she was happy to relate that to me- her BABA . thank you for having Russian books accessible .
5 #### My son loved this story . It is a great followup to the original . And the easy read feature is great for big words
5 #### This book is such a classic and always pleases parents and children alike . I was very happy with the kindle adaption of this book . Even on my smartphone the words were big enough to read at a mild distance and the pictures looked just as good as they do in a paper book . The little guy were happy , so that made mum happy too . I recommend it .
5 #### this book is wonderful , also bought many others as gifts , cute story & illustrations , it 's definitely a 5 star purchase
5 #### One of the all time Classic children 's books . Every home should have a copy . Your kids will love it . I loved it , and now my daughter loves it .
5 #### Purchased for a child who is just starting to read . He read threw it and was so proud of himself . Classic book
5 #### Purchased for my 7 year old . I did n't know there was a cat in the hat comes back . Super neat to read
5 #### The principles are what you want to take away not the literal persona of the " manager " in this story ... it 's a great metaphor to help you break the " I do n't have time to manage " or " I must micromanage my team " nonsense ...
5 #### I bought this book after taking a class on management skills . It has great ideas how to reward employs for doing something correctly or retrain them for something done incorrectly quickly , easily and painlessly ! A great tool for managers . Even the book is quick and easy ! I wish my boss would read it !
5 #### I read this book back in the 80 's and it was a great situational management book . I re - read it again before gifting this used book to a friend who is n't a manager but works with people she needs to manage in situations in which she feels her time is abused , and I still like the simplicity of the techniques and they are effective . They still translate well for today 's management concepts .
5 #### I have read a lot of management books and without a doubt this is the best . Short , to the point and logical
5 #### Read Cat In the Hat when I was kid , t h en read it wi t h each of my 3 children . It never gets old ! !
5 #### My grandson loved this book , they are going to read the Dr. Seuss books this week in kindergarten , and also dress in Dr Seuss clothes .
5 #### The family loved it . We bought it because we have the original Cat in the Hat . It 's a great sequel and a must own if you have the first one .
5 #### I loved this as a child , and happy to read it to my son . He loves it too . So fun to read this with him .
5 #### The Cat in the Hat is a timeless classic for children . If you have ever had a struggling new reader , this is a book I would recommend to you . My son does n't particularly like to read , which is part of the reason he struggles , but the rhymes and the silly plot of this story help him both to get better at reading and enjoy it in the process . The story begins with a brother and sister sitting at the window watching it rain . They ca n't play outside and with their mother away ( whom they would probably usually go to for ideas of what to do inside ) has gone out to run errands . Low and behold a cat in a funny looking had shows up with all kinds of wacky things to do that most mothers would not allow taking place inside and the children are suddenly thrown into a flurry of fun and crazy things to do . To add to the fun , the children have a talking pet fish who serves as the conscience of the story consistently telling the children that all of the cats activities are inappropriate while their mother is out . My son laughs throughout the book and consistently reaches for this one when it is his turn to practice reading and so I recommend it wholeheartedly .
4 #### my daughter loves this - has a physical book and insists on reading it on the laptop and the ipad too :)
5 #### My kids love The Cat In The Hat Knows A Lot About That on PBS , so I got them this book for Christmas to teach them Spanish . They love the story as much as I did when I was young .
3 #### Oh , Dr. Seuss , you always astound us with your ability to tell a whole story with all these easy words ! Now , as a kid , I thought the Cat himself was a little creepy and kind of a jerk . After all , he shows up on a rainy day and hopes to cheer up and entertain a couple of kids who have been left alone , and though the kids do seem to enjoy him , they 're also left worrying about the disasters he 's leaving in his wake ( especially when Thing 1 and Thing 2 arrive ) . The pet fish is the voice of reason but is portrayed as kind of a stuffy jerk , and honestly I actually sympathized with him most , because it 's hard to be the person who sees the environment going to pieces and being powerless to set it right . The illustrations were the usual fun and colorful and whimsical style , though , and I really liked the Things .
5 #### Simple read and to the point . Using basic Pavlovian conditioning to manage employee behavior . I found this book extremely helpful in how I was approaching my employees . It is amazing how you forget the basics when you are stuck in the rigmarole of the day . This was a great reminder to get back to basics on consistent and instant feedback . I would recommend to all managers and parents as the concepts absolutely apply to behavior in the home .
5 #### Purchased this as a replacement because it is loaded with great tips . Shipped quickly . Arrived in good condition . Recommended for anyone wishing to manage their time better .
4 #### Was recommended by friends as a very good tool to aid with successful transition to management . Have not yet hear how its working out . Received promptly , as ordered . Very happy .
5 #### Book was near new and in good condition . Is being passed around the office for everyone to read , thank you ,
4 #### My son whose 3 and a half initially did n't want to read this book because he he did n't like the illustrations(not as many colors as they have on tv ) but as I read it to him he began to enjoy it . He even has his favorite parts now .
5 #### Was looking for some music to play for a Cat in the Hat Theme and this was perfect . Book in excellent condition !
1 #### This is such a sad sounding translation , that I am embarrassed to have ever given it as a gift . It is as if it was directly translated from the English text , with no flair for the sound of the words , which of course , is incredibly important to any children 's book . Surely , there could be a better translation of The Cat in the Hat , especially with Spanish being such a prevalent and important language . Stay away from this one , or just buy it in English , and translate it yourself .
5 #### ... and actually put it into practice . Face it , most managers are micro - managers and the ones who are laissez faire managers usually are more worried about themselves or their jobs or looking good . These guidelines outlined in the book would be awesome if truly put into practice ... still waiting for that opportunity
5 #### After reading dozens of various leadership books , I find that the One Minute Manager to still be one of the best . Blanchard 's use of a story to educate us on situational leadership is simple and direct . For those who can understand that people are different and as such leadership styles need to adapt to be most effective , you will enjoy this quick read . For those who do n't understand why their leadership style does not always work , pick this quick read up .
5 #### This book is simple , short , and reveals some profound truth about management . I have been a military officer , and now I manage a start - up company . Regardless the scenario , whether military or tech start - up , one thing has n't changed , people remain as the biggest asset of the organization . This book tells you how to quickly and efficiently manage people , their emotion and productivity . It 's a simple system , if it was n't simple , it would n't work .
5 #### The one minute manager series is excellent guidance for rookie managers . Too many of us have conditioning in our minds from poor sources like TV , movies , previous bosses , etc . of what a manager " should " be like . I thought I would only need to imitate these things to be an effective manager , but that 's not the case . There 's a lot more to being a manager than just this book , like goal setting and motivation , but Ken sets up the bare basics for you in how to treat your people fairly and do your job as a manager effectively .
5 #### This book will make you think you can give a detailed report on your day in rhyme . And maybe you can ! But to do it in such an impeccable way requires true genius ! Dr. Suess is my favorite children 's book author . I love the plot , the characters and of course - I love the rhyme ! The truth is , it 's very difficult to write such excellent rhyming books . This will always be my favorite :) Somebody asked me in an interview who would be the one deceased person I would like to have dinner with ( if they were alive ) and I should have responded Dr. Seuss ! Alinka Rutkowska , Readers ' Favorite Picture Book Author of&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Maya - Filippo - Make - Friends - in - Auckland - Volume-1 / dp/1493626949 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Maya & Filippo Make Friends in Auckland ( Volume 1)</a>&nbsp;and others .
4 #### This was the first e - book I downloaded for my preschooler . She loves the hardcopy of the book but the e - version was less appealing .
5 #### The Cat in the Hat is about a talking cat who comes into a house with two kids . The cat destroys the house because he is trying to help the kids have fun . You have to read the book to hear the ending . My favorite parts are when the cat came and cleaned the house . Then he said good bye . Then he stayed in the back yard . I like it because he stayed and he could play with the kids another day . My second favorite part is when the cat walked into the house and scared the kids . I liked it because it was funny . I think that boys and girls would like this book , and I also think that kindergarteners would like this book . They would like it because there is a part where the kids are scared of getting in trouble and most kids know how that feels . You should really read this book !
5 #### I teach 6th grade English - language learners and Dr. Seuss is an integral part of my beginning readers ' reading logs ! As any reading teacher / parent can attest , finding Dr. Seuss books at a decent price is hard to do -- thank you Amazon !
5 #### The book is corolful and keeps the baby 's attention . Stating the new grandchild off with lots of colorful books to read .
5 #### I needed this book for a college class . It was well priced , shipped fast and was in very good condition . The book is part of the OMM series and offers very clear , simple to follow advice . Worth reading .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books . The wisdom is quick and to the point . The management style is what I modeled and helped me be a better manager . Highly recommend !
1 #### I read this for my Management class at school and was underwhelmed . Not just with the book but with the idea that there is any " right " way to manage people . Assuming that any strategy will work in any situation is foolish and believing that manipulating people and leading them are the same is folly .
4 #### I enjoy Blanchard 's way of telling a story to communicate another business idea and practice . It 's a quick read and you understand what he 's doing right away . The One Minute Manager seems a bit hokey at first but many of its recommendations I can see how they 'd work and I plan to incorporate most of it in one way or another .
5 #### Please realize that these are not the standard sized books - they 're tiny . But it is a wonderful , wonderful collection !
5 #### Love almost all Dr. Seuss books . Totally recommend it , especially in hardcover . My some love it , and I really enjoy hearing him learning to read and reading it to me . They are also really funny and the pics too This is one of my favorite
5 #### This was downloaded for 4 year old grandson , and he absolutely loves it and asks me to read it to him often !
5 #### my order arrived in good time & packaged well I wanted to order this book for my nieces & nephews to read , everyone grew - up reading these books . & had so much fun reading it ! ! ! this book was in good condion & good price , tku Trish :o)
1 #### but the book binding cracked and all the pages fell out .. other than that I was happy thank you very much
4 #### Quick and easy read . Had to read this for management continuing education . Good managing skills means spend less time micro - managing and more empowering employees .
5 #### I love to read it aloud . Such fun - it makes me giggle . No matter how young the child , they respond in kind !
5 #### Classic for a reason ! ! ! ! Time to share my love of the amazing Dr. Seuss with a new generation ! ! ! woot woot
5 #### One of my favorite books to read to children .... in fact , I tutored grade school children when my boys went to grade school , and this is one of the books I used to help the kids .
5 #### Who does n't love that naughty cat ? I got some of dr seuss classic for my girls , but they are secretly for me . bring back memories
5 #### It 's the first time we read the cat in the hat , though we 've read the Cat in the Hat Comes Back ( several times , in fact ) , and my six - year - old son really enjoyed it . It 's a great classic !
5 #### This book tells the story of a man who has searched far and wide to discover the secrets of effective managers . He finds what he is looking for when he discovers the One Minute Manager . At first he is in disbelief , but after a couple encounters with the One Minute Manager himself as well as a few of his employees , he is convinced of this management style . The One Minute Manager manages in three ways : -One Minute Goal Setting : set goals that can be reviewed in a minute or less -One Minute Praising : immediate , genuine praise for things done right -One Minute Reprimanding : immediate reprimanding for things done wrong , but still assuring the individual of their value Then the One Minute Manager explains why these methods work so well and the young man goes on to become a One Minute Manager himself . I found this book to be an easy read . It is a brief book with short pages and an interesting storyline . I really like how the principles are taught through a story in this book . I also like that at the end of each major principle , an outline is given to summarize what you just learned . Also throughout the books are brief quotes to help you remember what you are learning . The management style itself sounds very effective and I think this book is a good tool for anyone in a management type position to study .
5 #### With a great concept . All his books seem to be pretty close to the same , so I say stick with the original !
5 #### It 's a quick read - less than 30 minutes and well worth the time . I 'm not a manager , but I still found the lessons worthwhile .
3 #### Claire and her Doctor / Mother live their relationship out in a series of notes left on the refrigerator door over a one year span . Then low and behold , a crisis hits and we see how shallow a teen daughter can be and how when communication between parent and child breaks down , there is always the refrigerator door . This small quick read book left me expecting that there should have been more . Wish there was .
5 #### A real page - turner . Especially when there 's only one sentence on a page . This is why the book is cheaper than other hardbacks of the same size . Some thoughts about it : -- A modern drama written on a typical medium of our time , the fridge note . -- The story unfolds partly in the reader : the fragmentary input makes a continuum in the reader . -- It has a rhythm and theme you can easily connect to . -- Actually , you could also use the text to teach English as a foreign language . -- A modern version of the epistolary . -- A small book so you can take it with yourself and read it anywhere and whenever you have some time to spare . The main topic is nothing special . You might even say that it was probably financed by the health department to warn women to take regular medical check - ups seriously . Another trite theme is the relationship between a teenage daughter and an overworked single / divorced mother , which carries no novelty either . However , the way the threads of the story are woven , does not let you see it that way while you are imbued in the tale and after putting the book down finished . The magic effect of a good story teller 's tale wears out slowly , which was the case with this book for me . When looking at the red spine of the book on my shelf , I have a general positive feeling about it . How the story is told makes a difference here .
3 #### I was n't sure I was going to like the note style of writing but it was actually very easy to read . Because you can read the book in 20 minutes it almost does n't feel like a ' proper ' book . However it has both a story and characters who I found engaging . It gives an insight into a relationship between a mother and her 15 year old daughter , not just a glimpse of their everyday lives but their worries and concerns when the mother has a health scare . The author captures the confusing and conflicting emotions both of them experience and although short , it 's to the point and gets across what I feel was intended ; Not only to appreciate and enjoy those we sometimes take for granted but also to communicate with each other . That does n't mean just telling someone we love them but appreciating that we need to share our happiness and our inner worries with them too sometimes . It made me cry ( I think you 'd have to be made of stone not to be moved by it ) , but maybe the last couple of pages were over too quickly because I would have liked to have felt more uplifted by it .
5 #### This book is a classic but then again how can you go wrong with Dr. Seuss . My 3 year old son loves this book better than the first Cat in the Hat book . He loves the little cat 's with the letters on their hats .
5 #### I have always lived these classics . Thank you for making them available digitally ! ! The illustrations are as crisp as the paper version .
5 #### I have 3 kids and they LOVE this book . It 's an innocent children 's book from the 50 's . It 's about innocent childhood imagination . Do n't over think it .
2 #### I was excited to get a big collection of Dr. Suess ' books . When they arrived , they 're miniature ! These are NOT full - sized books . It does n't say that in the description . You 'll never be able to read these in a dimly lit nursery before bed - unless you have bionic eyes like the Six Million Dollar Man . The print is so small , it 's crazy you see , it 's hard to read to you by me , it 's small , small almost nothing at all !
5 #### Actually it 's my seven year old grandson that is the one who loves it and it 's the beginning of building his lifetime library . His house will not only have books but shelves to house them .
5 #### I love this book . I have gained great knowledge reading it and plan to share the learned experience with others ..
5 #### Really enjoyed this book . New in the managing department , and I have found this book very helpful in dealing with employees and problems that arise .
5 #### I use this with every new management coaching client . It 's approachable and allows almost anyone to try its ideas and get early success . Jim Grew The Business Transition Defogger
2 #### The manager who manages best manages the least . That 's the big takeaway from this book . It 's mostly true and there 's some basic elemental truth in this title . People are people , and regardless of the time period or work environment , they still operate in the same ways and respond to the same incentives . However , the writing is absolutely wretched . I could n't wait to finish reading the book and plowed through the last few chapters by sheer force of will . On the positive side , the book is mercifully short . I 'll sum it up right here : Give your employees clear goals . Let them know early what success looks like and how they can achieve it . Give immediate feedback and focus on the positive . Actually care about their growth and well being . If an employee has a problem , tell them immediately , and make sure you make it about their actions , not about them personally . People want to know you respect them as a person and they do best when they know what 's expected . Many managers do n't let people know if they 're doing a good job or a bad job until it 's too late to fix it , and too many focus on the " no news is good news " style of management . If you did n't know these things already , maybe you should read the book -- it 'll explain why all that works . Otherwise , skip it . It 's a short but painful read .
4 #### Although written around 1980 , this 100 page book packs a wallop of solid , timeless advice on managing employees . The premise of the book is simply ( although often forgotten ) " happy employees produce great results . " While there are other aspects of good management , The One Minute Manager provides foundational direction on how to communicate goals , motivate positive action , and make adjustments in employee behavior when necessary . If every manager read this book , employee morale would skyrocket and the corporate world would be far better off .
5 #### Remembering this book from my childhood , I knew it was a must - have for my children . And it 's still among the top 10 books my children like to hear / read .
5 #### when I was a child a had a copy of this book . it is truly a great classic that I most definitely recommend . now many years later , I have written my own book.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/alchemy - and - the - green - lion - the - truth - of - the - philosophers - stone / dp/1481028456 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">alchemy and the green lion : the truth of the philosophers stone</a >
5 #### Very pleased with book , would purchase again . Tradition , tradition , tradition . Enjoyed giving as a gift for new baby . Nothing beats time spent reading with a child .
5 #### this is a really great book , our school kids like this very much.and they want one more i think . amazon is great place order books too .
5 #### it is good for my son . He is very happy with it . It is very nice and fanny . I recommend it .
3 #### It took a bit long for the book to arrived , and it had some damage . But in all I was satisfied with the book .
5 #### This book has a very unique story base and is almost the opposite to any normal story . I find it is interesting how Alice Kuipers tells her story through the letters her and her mum write to each other . I managed to read the whole book in just over 1 hour at one go . I felt very sad and teary towards the end of the book so make sure you have a box of tissues near by . I would really recommend this book to all ages above 10
4 #### Life on the Refrigerator Door by Alice Kuipers is a small book that delivers a swift punch . The words are limited but speak volumes as a busy mother and her teenage daughter communicate to each other through notes . They leave the usual messages about being late , babysitting , reminders to pick up a few groceries . One note , however , is a little different . " It 's nothing to worry about , but I found a lump in my right breast . " This book took no time to read . Some entries are a mere few words . But added together , they complete a full and touching story , one that makes us appreciate and cherish relationships with our own mothers and daughters .

2 #### This is described as " a novel in notes " , I 'm not sure a 20 minute read constitutes a novel but maybe I 'm just being picky . I found it a very unsatisfying read , not surprisingly there is no character development whatsoever , which I could forgive if the characters were more interesting . The major event of the book is a life altering one but it is handled in a clichd way , with the content of the messages and the responses nothing you have n't heard or read before . Which would also have been ok if the writing was beautiful or witty or funny or something , but it is just plain - as you 'd expect notes left on a fridge to be . Because of this they failed to evoke a strong emotional response in me and I think the situation should have . In a way it sort of reads like a parable , it is attempting ( I think in a heavy handed , unsubtle way ) to remind us to spend time communicating with those we love and to make time for what is important in our lives , as the time available is finite and could be ripped away from us at any minute . Which is a worthwhile message but presentation is everything and the superficial way this is presented means I can dispose of it without much thought - which , for me , is a bit sad . I like a book that makes me think .
4 #### Claire and her mom do n't have a lot of time with each other . Claire 's parents are divorced and her mom works a lot delivering babies . Claire is also quite busy socially , with her boyfriend , homework and babysitting . When her mom goes to the doctor 's office , she does n't not come back with very good news . As their time together ticks by Claire and her mom get into a few verbal fights . Claire 's mom just wants to protect her from having to go through this too , but she might find she needs her daughter 's love and support even more . This was a touching story told in brief notes left on a refrigerator in a house rarely occupied by it 's two tenants simultaneously . Claire and her mom seem to constantly miss each other . Some things are easier to say on paper , but some things need to be said out loud . This novel discusses growing up and growing closer to those you love and care about . I do wish the notes looked more handwritten , instead of typed out paragraphs . I think this is a great book that shows the dynamics of mother - daughter relationships . A must read for teen girls and their mums . It may bring you closer to your loved one than before . First Line : " Hey Claire - bear , milk apples bananas avocados onions potatoes tomatoes mushrooms carrots and rabbit food for Peter ground beef bread juice -- you choose " Favorite Line : " I feel like all the colors in the room have got more intense . "
4 #### I read this book at the library while my children played ( It only took about 1/2 an hr or so ) and it was well worth it . I found most of the " notes " realistic and touching . I did get very teary eyed at the last few . The relationship between mother and daughter made me think of all the times I should have verbalized in my own life . Life is precious . It made me appreciate it more .
5 #### Worth a read and a reread . I use this in supervisor training and it always goes down well . A quick read but full of valuable insights and thought provoking concepts .
5 #### I have always enjoyed this book . I keep loaning them ou and they never come back . It 's a quick read but has so much inside .
3 #### If you have commanded troops do n't waste your time on this book . If you are new to corporate leadership and management do n't waste your time on this book . If you want a simple bedtime read go for it .
5 #### Great lessons , quick read , concise principles . Easy to implement and great results . It 's a winner for everyone when you implement these lessons .
4 #### Plenty of relevant advice , improve relationships with employees and develope management skills . Fantastic book with an amazing narrative , extremely well written and a real pleasure to read .
5 #### The anecdotal information provided in this gem is wonderful . It actually describes my work environment and a popular ' management ' style to the letter . What I think is interesting about this book also is how , the One Minute manage does very well and seems competent . However , I 'm sure many manager who are n't competent attempt this same management style . I 'll read other books from this author , as it obviously is a series , though this book is an excellent start . My only concern is that while it makes ' others ' accountable for their work , it does n't really give much insight on how the One Minute Manger actually organizes his / her time . THAT , would be worth reading ...
5 #### Geat reading material , enjoying the contents and sharing with fellow employees . Love the Author ! Learning from this book is excellent . Thanks , Denise
5 #### I had read this book previously but loaned it out . My daughter has just taken a promotion at work and asked to read my copy . I bought her one to keep and she is already using the wisdom contained in its pages .
5 #### Again and again this book grabs a child 's attention and they love the story . If you can get or make or buy a hat like in the story the child will love it even more .
4 #### This a great set for traveling with children , but the books are much smaller than I expected . The are the size of my hand and I have very little hands . The print is rather small and as a teacher , I would n't suggest thee books to be used with beginning readers because of the print size . If you are planning to use these for reading to your children they are sufficient . The seller was great and I received my order as I was promised .
5 #### Our baby is always listening to us read to her and loves her cat in the hat stuffed animal . So now she holds her cat while listening to us read .
5 #### All children should have the opportunity to have this read to them and then be able to read it by themselves .
5 #### A wonderful book for children . They love to have it read to them and it helps beginning readers . Who would n't like ie !
4 #### I love epistolary novels , so I was predisposed to like this book . I wish it had been longer , though - and more fleshed out . But the author did manage to distill the essence and reality of this mother - daughter relationship in a very short book . I , too , was crying at the end .
1 #### It took me longer to drive to the library , peruse the shelves , check out my books , drive home and unload than it did to read this book . Seriously . Which is n't an altogether bad thing , except that the sparse pages coupled with the After School Special quality of the plot made me just shrug when all was said and done . I have to confess , this is one of those times when I was blinded in my book choice by my own personal issues . My teenage daughter and I are going through a " patch , " and I was caught by the book 's supertitle : Notes Between a Mother and Daughter . Be advised - that little inclusion is not an exaggeration . The entire book is written in note form . You 're left to do the detective work in filling in the plot between the scribbles . While I give the author points for trying this interesting concept , it created too shallow of a storyline .
4 #### This is a super - quick , engaging read that had me crying like a baby towards the end . It 's a story told in literal notes left on a refrigerator between a mother and daughter -- a really unique premise . It 's not a totally deep , meaningful read , but it 's a good one !
4 #### Mother and daughter relationships are so different from anything else . I loved this book . I loved the note type style it was written . It was VERY quick but got the point across . We have a mother who is a doctor . We have a 15 year old daughter who is left alone quite a bit because of the mother 's work schedule . She does the shopping , cooking quite a bit and comes and goes as she pleases . The mother gets bad news that she has breast cancer . From there it goes on -- Being a mother , I think the notes imply that you always " think " you have more time . The only thing I did n't enjoy is Claire seemed to come and go as she pleased . That would n't work for me . She had to grow up quick . I did really love this little book . I would n't consider it a novel at all either . But then again I am not a writer or know what would constitute it a novel . I think this would be a good book to give for Mother 's Day . Enjoy !
2 #### As most of the other reviewers have stated , this is an extremely fast read . I did n't find the characters particularly compelling , in spite of the tragic circumstances of the novel ; Kulper 's unconventional ( but interesting ) method of letting the story unfold solely through notes left on a refrigerator limits the depth of the characters and their story , and leaves the reader feeling somewhat detached from the whole experience .
5 #### We have all heard of open door communication , and that it is so important to keep lines of communication open . We have all jotted down notes to our moms , and other loved ones . All of us women have been daughters , and many of us go on to have daughters . This novel could have been lived by many of us . For all of these reasons this book should be read , kept , reread , passed along and cherished by generations of mothers and daughters everywhere . It is one of the most simplistic yet creative books that I have read in quite sometime . It is not only meaningful , but important . I highly recommend it . I will look for more from this author . However , whether she writes another book or not remains to be seen ... but she has done her job beautifully in this book .
3 #### I finished this while having my breakfast one morning , and it only took me 20 minutes . There 's 240 pages , but each page has a note on it . Which can sometimes only be a line or two , occasionally , a paragraph . The story 's about a mother and daughter , who never see each other , they 're like ships in the night , they pass each other . The mother 's a busy doctor , the daughter 's busy at school and her social life . The mother discovers she has breast cancer , and suddenly , the relationship between the two changes . It 's painstakingly honest , but too brief . You 're made to feel like the daughter 's selfish and does n't care . Which did n't feel quite right . The note style of the book is quite original , much like Cecelia Aherne 's Where Rainbows End , but it does feel you leaving empty afterwards . And by the time you get to the last page , and keep turning , and there 's no more , it 's even worse . I did actually start crying , which was n't pleasant ( soggy cornflakes lovely ) , but at least I had n't my face on for work yet . It was twice in twelve hours I 'd cried , so do n't read this book if you 're already feeling emotional . I 'm definitely going to pass this book onto my mum to read , and then onto a couple of my friends , as it 's an excellent read , just too short .
1 #### I have never read a book less deserving of being published . Shallow , predictable , dull . I read this in the bookstore ( took me all of 20 minutes ) and even though there is often only one sentence on a page , I found myself skipping ahead . The relationship between the daughter and mother is empty , pathetic and I guess the writing does mirror that accurately . As the mother of a 15 year old daughter myself , I guess I wanted something ( anything ! ! ) more . I think I 'll go read " The Runaway Bunny " now for some depth . Kudos to the author for duping a publisher and the public with this tripe .
3 #### I believe I bought this as a school text book . I do n't even remember one thing about it . Sorry ... maybe someone else can be more helpful .
5 #### I love this book because it is written in a plain English with life examples from a new managers ' perspective . It is all about one minute actions .
4 #### I continue to offer this to my clients as a quick read " management 101 " tutorial and it continues to be a hit as a primer .
5 #### Great principles which can be applied immediately to your personal and professional lives . However , will probably require more than ONE MINUTE to master . (-;
5 #### This is a wonderful hardback book , something to keep for years to come ! Great book for a great price . A classic .
5 #### this was a gift for our grandkids in another state . They are learning to read and we hoped this would inspire them .
5 #### One must have this book to go with the original ! Glad I could send it on to the parents of my newest grandbabies !
5 #### I bought this for my newest grand babies because the parents requested books ! How can you go wrong w/ this most classic of Dr Suess books ? :)
5 #### An absolute classic . I learned to read using this book , as did my kids and grandkids . There are very few children 's books out there that can match it . If you have n't read this to / with your kids , you 're all missing something . Enough said !
5 #### 3 key tips told in a story format that follows a journalist looking for guidance on the best mangers . No cons - only pros ( for the price I paid ): * Simple principles * More entertaining than a straight management book just on principles and facts * Quick to read - took me about 30 mins , but I 'm a quickish reader * Paid for a cheaper version ( second hand book ) - so good value as I 'll probably end up giving it away anyway . The difficulty will be applying the tips in a consistent manner .
4 #### A lot can be gained by learning one minute praise , one minute reprimand , one minute goal setting , etc . It leaves you with 7 plus hours to just loaf all day and let your employees do what is needed , if that is what you choose . Employees actually do like the one minute approach .
5 #### Instructing and managing three departments has been known to be time consuming if not draining . K. Blanchard offers simple and easily attainable methods in improving performance while making those you lead feel even better about themselves . Happy people who feel good about their work and achievements want to achieve even more . It feels good not to dread reprimands . It feels great to have an easily execution - able action plan . It feels wonderful having structured positive encounters that create time in the day .
5 #### What I like about the Cat in the Hat , this book , unlike many of the others is actually a book . Some of the books there are a couple words on each page . The Cat in the Hat tells a story and there are over 50 pages in this book . :) One of my favorite !
1 #### No , this book is so long , my son is too young . He just was n't interested after the first few pages and neither was I.
5 #### Yes , this is every parent 's nightmare and a huge talking troublemaking cat is disturbing , say the same people who look for psychedelic and sexual undertones in Scooby Doo . But there 's one undeniable fact ... it 's a classic ! It 's also a great book for beginning readers . This book was written by Dr. Seuss based on the 212 Dolch sight words . Besides that , it has become such a part of the American vernacular it would be cruel to deprive any child .
5 #### Recently , while waiting for my man to check out at a department store , I was once again dragged into the saga of The Cat in the Hat . And who would n't be attracted to this charmingly bright colored book ? Simply written , captivating and totally engaging . Read this as an adult with new eyes . It 's an allegory . The total abandon the cat brings to these children 's rainy afternoon is really a lesson for all readers . Do n't play it safe . Learn every day and try new things . Do n't box yourself in . Why not BE The Cat in the Hat ourselves ? For anyone with a creative bent , this book offers the gateway . Obviously , geared toward children , the language is straightforward and basic enough even for beginner readers . And its structure has all the musicality of a poem . However , none of Seuss ' work ever reads dumb downed . The beauty in fact resides in its simplicity . So , if you have children , please read this to them . They 'll enjoy it thoroughly , and so will you .
5 #### Seriously , how could you go wrong with classic Seuss ? Unlike the butchered board books , the hardcovers are just like I remember them .
5 #### This book is short lessons on how do deal with management issues . Our daughter is new to management , so we got this book for her . Both my husband and myself have profited from reading this book in the past .
5 #### Even when the book is oriented to become an effective manager , the principles can be applied to every aspect of your life . It wo n't take you more than hour to read the book to cover to cover , but the principles will stay with you for a life time .
5 #### Sooner or later every manager or leader reads Blanchard . I got into his work because he promotes Anthony Robbins . I also saw him in person at a seminar ; his inspired me to honest tears . His books may be pricey , but that is because he said he did n't want to write 10 dollar books . His value is seen in the fact that people finish his books due to their smaller size and their interesting stories . One of the most helpful in this one is his discussion between leaders and ducks . It is an unforgettable lesson .
5 #### The One Minute Manager is a narrative about a young man looking for the most effective management skills . Through this parable , Kenneth Blanchard and Spenser Johnson seek to show what makes the most effective management approach , an approach that allows for employee innovation and creativity . The book includes topics on motivating , appraisals and sanctions as well as goal setting . I believe that the advice offered here is very practical and applies to most managerial scenarios . While some may dismiss it as lacking in academic structure , the concepts offered here can help many managers become more effective in motivating and inspiring their employees to creativity and performance . The use of the parable not only simplifies the concepts but also makes you feel less attacked , especially if you are at a managerial position . Whether you are a new manager or you have been in a managerial position for some time , this book has some hidden gems to help in your role . It is imperative to put the advice into practice to see the results . I would recommend this book to anyone who is overseeing others in a managerial capacity .
5 #### One of the best books you can read . It is practicle and gets right to the point . It may have been written some years ago but is still right on point .
5 #### What more needs to be said ? The ultimate Seuss read . Great to teach children to appreciate rhyme as well as what can happen if they do n't listen to their parents . Love Seuss !
5 #### This was a replacement book for a metallic covered special edition from the library . My three year old loved it so much , i decided to buy him his own copy . Then , while being babysat by my uncles , he inexplicably ripped the library edition to shreds before ours arrived . The librarian said they usually do n't take replacements , just charge the cost of the book , but it looked so nice , he would make an exception as long as he(my son ) never treated another book like that again . The book arrived well inside the shipping window and in perfect condition . I actually paid more for the replacement library anti theft tag than the book ! Ps- we have this book on our iPad , but every child should have a hard copy of The Cat in the Hat . I 'm glad to report that after several months , and countless reads , our new replacement remains in pristine condition . Pps- if you 're making a Dr. Seuss collection , always check the dimensions of your books . They come in lots of different sizes .
5 #### The Cat in the Hat is back and the kids in the book need to get ready for more trouble . It 's a captivating story and exhausting for the characters as the Cat 's mess gets worse and worse but the rhymes , the speed , the pictures give you very a very attentive audience . True , perhaps using guns for the spots ( to kill them ) was a bit much but that was the author 's choice to use those instead of , I do n't know , water guns ? Sling shot ? Bow and arrow ? And I guess the author could use used " getting rid of " wording instead of " killing " so that it would n't be as upsetting to some , but ... this is how he decided to write it and it 's always possible to explain to the readers / listeners why it was written the way it was .
5 #### We love Dr Seuss books and this was one that we needed to help complete our set ! Brand new & perfect !
5 #### As always , Dr. Seuss does n't disappoint . Very enjoyable . Kids of every culture can understand and enjoy the story . Cool Cat .
5 #### I was hoping to get a break from the original cat in the hat book that my daughter makes me read three or more times a day but she was n't fooled .
5 #### Wonderful book . Great condition . My son loves the rhyming and it is a wonderful teaching tool for young readers . I would recommend the entire set !
4 #### This is a must read , I read this book about 15 years ago , better the second time . It is a timeless book , read at difference point in your life , meaningful all the way through ,
5 #### Loaned this book to someone and never got it back so this was a replacement . Received it very quickly and in great condition . Very pleased to have it to re - read and to refer to .
5 #### Great principles in this book that stand firm in the management space . It 's laid out simply but packed with a lot of power that sends an important message to all in the positon to lead.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Navigating - Life - s - Roadways - Stories - of - Insight - from - My - Odyssey - and - Inspiration - for - Your - Journey / dp/1453849858 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Navigating Life 's Roadways : Stories of Insight from My Odyssey and Inspiration for Your Journey</a >
4 #### I work for a major retail store , and am also climbing the ranks there . My store manager recommended that I read this book , because it was helpful to him when dealing with people . When the book arrived , I thought I 'd start reading it before bed . Not the case . I layed down for bed and read the whole book , cover to cover . I did n't know it was going to be in " story " form - which was kind of cheesy - it almost turned into the Wizard of Oz at one point . I was expecting a non - fiction book . But I must say , it was semi - helpful . I use the " One minute reprimands " and " One minute appraisal " techniques alot now , and have been complimented by other managers who overhear them , which makes me think reading this book was not a mistake !
5 #### I did n't read this book until after I retired , but I sure wish I had read it before I retired . Managing people was always my weakness . After reading this book , I see how easy I could have made it for myself . I highly encourage anyone who desires management or entrepreneurial position to read this book , as well as my book . - Aimee Elizabeth , Author of Poverty Sucks ! How to Become a Self - Made Millionaire .
5 #### The book was new ! It arrived prior to the date of shipment . The cost was good . My granddaughter donated the book to her school library for Dr. Seuss ' Birthday .
5 #### my preschool kids love Dr. Seuss , however this is their favorite . Great sequence of events to be followed . Highly Recommend
5 #### What a treasure this books is ! The songs are fun and easy enough for my kindergarten class to learn quickly . Most songs will be familiar to anyone that has seen a Seuss cartoon and that would be half of the known universe .
5 #### This is a great story and kids love that The Cat in the Hat gets in so much trouble , nicely priced also .
5 #### My first grade nephew is learning to read and this is a great story and also a great way to learn to read .
5 #### Fantastic book for kids ! So imaginative and creative . Easy read that children will find delightful ! Dr. Seuss is always brilliant ! His stories and rhymes are fun and entertaining ! Some of my all time favorites ! ! Such a great way to entertain children and get them interested in reading !
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Dr. Seuss for little kids . I had purchased three different ones for my 7 year old nephew and was delighted that he is actually reading books . It 's great to find something that a child will enjoy that does not involve having a piece of electronics ! He tells me about the books and it 's wonderful to see his interest in reading !
5 #### A brief and interesting read about management . It is not overly technical so it would benefit anyone wanting to improve their time management skills .
4 #### The book states common sense approach not only to business management but also skills for everyday life . It is short and to the point and easy and quick to read .
5 #### I gave my daughter this book as a gift . She LOVES it . It now sits on her desk at work .
5 #### A great book and a must read . You can apply the teachings to all aspects of life and not just management . Simple and quick to read . Should only take a couple of hours at the most .
1 #### The book 's tone is rude and I do n't see how the tone could be in the least bit effective . Some of the techniques used are also used in dog training . A real disappointment . With books like this , it further weakens the already faltering leadership we see in corporate America today . Do n't bother to read this book or better yet , if you want to train people like you train dogs , just pick up a dog training book .
1 #### I do n't know how people could give this book 5 stars and write about how this book sends a good message to children . This book is disturbing . The use of guns and the rhymes about killing are inappropriate for any age . That combined with the pink splotchy snow creates the imagery of a war zone . Do n't buy this book . Get one of the other ones .
5 #### I love speaking to my grandsons in Spanish . I want them to at least be bilingual . It is an easy way to introduce a new language to the kids .
5 #### My son LOVES this book ! It has just the right amount of text and pictures on each page to keep him focused ( which is our problem ) . He is 3.5 years old and very energetic . But every night he wants to read Dr. Seuss . So we do by taking turns . I ordered several Dr. Seuss books and they are all absolutely great . I think its an absolute " must have " for every child .
4 #### What an I say ? Kids love Dr. Suess ! And if your likes " Cat in the Hat " , they will also love this sequel .... Adventures that happen on a rainy day can also happen in the snow !
5 #### What can you say ? This is a classic book and a wonderful beginning book even for 1st graders . Rhyming words and funny pictures , it is sure to be a hit .
5 #### this book is soo great , my baby loves it , i read it while i was pregnant also . it works great , would def . recommend this book , its a keeper .
5 #### My Sons Really enjoy it They want to hear the story every night , even as they get older they still listen
5 #### Bought this as a gift for a new set of twin boys whose mom is a librarian . Hope they 'll enjoy Dr. Seuss as much as my daughters and I do !
4 #### This book is a must read for those who want to improve there management skills . It gives good advice and examples . It is easy to follow and an encouragement to put into practice what they share . Whether you are starting out in management or have been doing it for awhile you will benefit from reading this book . It is n't too long so you can get the points they are making and easily use the information .
5 #### Even if this book is a bit older , it does not mean that the subject is not accurate . On the contrary , this book is still up to date and worth to read . I would recommend this one to all the managers , middle managers and anyone who want to learn more about management . This is easy to read , not a text book like . It 's simply style is charming and makes you want to read the next books by this same author . About the content of the book : The One Minute Manager reveals three secrets to productive and efficient managing as told through a young man 's search for the perfect managing and leading skills . These three secrets are : One minute goals , one minute employee praisings , and one minute reprimand . These are all good advise for all the managers how to become a better leader and be more effective in their job .
5 #### I love this book . It made a segnificant diference for me . Simply gives you the how to ! I 'm ordering now the rest of the series !
5 #### As an executive trainer , I purchased this book for one of the new young manager candidates in our organization who was having trouble especially in handling poor performance . The One Minute Reprimand was the solution .
5 #### The great thing about Ken Blanchard 's " One Minute Manager " is you can read it in about an hour ( not a minute , as my co - worker joked ) . It 's a tiny book that you can power through in no time , but the concepts in these limited pages are important and thought - provoking . " One Minute Manager " emphasizes the importance of asking the right questions , holding your staff to a high standard , holding them accountable ( and yourself ) , and offering praise when it 's appropriate . Like most leadership books , Blanchard 's philosophy is pretty straightforward and touches on many of the same concepts other books espouse . You just ca n't beat the super fast read and the super easy to reference layout . A must - have for your leadership library .
5 #### What a fun , cute , intelligent book that does n't condescend to its audience . And the audience is pretty large , I should think , as you can keep reading this one to your kids for a long time . They wo n't outgrow it as quickly as most children 's books .
5 #### I have started buying my grandson the De . Seuss books a few at a time for him to start collecting them , like I did my kids .
5 #### This is a Dr. Seuss classic and every parent should get their child to read all the Dr. Seuss classics . This one is the best of them all !
2 #### Not only am I a Spanish native speaker but I am a college instructor teaching Spanish language and literature . I really wanted my kids to have both versions of the story since they are being raised bilingually . However , to my dismay , the Spanish translation is an awful , pathetic , literal one , totally lacking any cultural interest and not to mention the rhyme . We also own " Un pez , dos peces ... " and the translator an Aida Something did the most amazing job . The only reason why I give 2 stars instead of 1 is that at least we have the English version and that 's definitely the one I am reading to my kids . I am not poissoning their ears with a made up Spanish with a lot of unforgivable mistakes .
5 #### What else can you say , another great book as always from Dr. Seuss . Great addition for our little ones collection .
5 #### What else can you say , another great book as always from Dr. Seuss . Great addition for our little ones collection .
4 #### This classic allegorical tale is a helpful first step into the world of management . Whether you are a business owner , division supervisor , politician , or pastor , this book can help you manage people in a few easy steps . Indeed , not only are the concepts simple , but the book itself is quick read by any standard . With over 100 Amazon reviews , let me just say this : any reader could likely get the gist of the book by simply consulting the pocket - size " Game Plan " near the end of the book . This summarizes the key elements involved in being a One - Minute Manager : One - Minute Goal Setting , One - Minute Praising , and One - Minute Reprimands . The chart is a little weak on " Goal Setting " but the information is outlined ( on its own page ) early on in the book for further consultation . For the beginner this is a great resource . For the experienced this is a good reminder , yet will likely be regarded a bit too simplistic .
5 #### Has a lot of good ideas and how to apply them in the workplace . Good read and well worth the money .
1 #### I was required to read this book for a promotional test for my work . This book is chalked full of clunky metaphors , over generalizations , and pedantic bullsh * * . It is worthless for anyone who is not retarded .
3 #### I think I enjoyed this book at the time but it did n't leave much of an impression because a few months later I ca n't remember anything to say about that book .
5 #### The time management techniques outlined in this book have become part of my daily routine for many years . They have bought me hundreds of extra work hours , solidified information and increased my effectiveness as a manager and as an individual . This has become one of my favorite resources to share as gifts .
5 #### A+,exellent , and ordinary product . I recomend it to others . The vendor is good , fast and responsible . I can do another buy with them .
5 #### I 'm not going to over analyze this book for its literary , hidden - meaning , and political incorrectness . Just going to say I loved this book as a child , my kids loved it and now my grandchildren love it . The illustrations and rhyming dialogue along with a situation kids can relate to make for a clever , entertaining read for kids and adults alike !
4 #### I read this book to my children and they enjoyed it . It is not the best book I have read to my children , but a good one . They found the pictures very entertaining and funny . I would recommend this book to others to read to their children . I enjoyed it myself also .
5 #### I read this book as a child , and it was read to me . I read it to my older daughter , with great emotion , and she still remembers that years later . I read it tonight , to my younger daughter . Rhythm catches the subconscious mind much better than prose . This has rhyme , as well . We have forgotten the value of rhyme . In the old days , students would memorize what they learned , in rhyming verse , because rhyme is easier to remember . Twas the night before Christmas ... we have so much visual pollution in our culture , we do n't remember the simple rhyme . This is a fun book , for toddlers , and for adults reading it .
5 #### The kids are outside shoveling snow when the Cat in the Hat breezes inside and makes himself at home . The cat leaves a pink ring in the bathtub which he wipes clean by transfering the unsightly mess onto something else , then yet again to ... oh my goodness , is that a pink stain on Mother 's new dress ... now on the rug ... and what 's the cat doing with Dad 's 10 dollar shoes ? Have no fear , the cat can take care of this pesky pink problem . The cat sends the pink outside on the snow ... but now all that pink snow has to go . Have no fear , my dear , the cat can take care of that with what he 's got hiding under his hat . From A to Z , his helpers pop out each from under the hat of another . The pink mess is so big , so far , and so deep , it takes all 26 to clean it up ... but they do , and then they return to their rightful places under his hat .
5 #### Have you read The Cat in The Hat by Dr. Seuss ? Well if you have n't you should . It is a really great book for all ages , no matter what type of book your child is interested in it is a classic ! It starts out with Sally and Dick sitting in a house on a cold wet winter day . They are sitting and staring out the window at the puddles and rain . They were so bored . They just wanted to play . Then they were all surprised because a cat came to play . The fish said , " Oh no that cat must go away . He must play when mom is away ! " In the middle of the book the house is a mess . The cat is still throwing things all about . Mother is out the house is a mess thing 1 and thing 2 are flying a kite .the fish has been flung all about , and still says , " That Cat should n't be here when your mother is out ! " At the end the cat decide he should n't have been there when their mother is out but there is one problem the house is still a mess and there mother is walking up the drive way . Want to find out how it ends ? All you have to do is read this marvouls book . I recommend this book to everyone and anyone who wants to read it . This is an excellent book and I know you will love it .
5 #### This is one of my favourite children 's books , it is fun and inspirational . Everytime I read one of Dr. Seuss 's books , I am inspired to write my own stories . My son loves this book and asks me to re - read it over and over . A timeless classic , a fun and creative adventure . We love it !
5 #### the cat in the hat by dr . seuss this is about a girl and boy and how they sit in their home while their mother went to town . a cat walks in and wants to have fun with them . the fish is not for it at all and tells him to leave . the children play with different things and the whole house turns into a mess and they see their mother about to walk in the door when the cat calls upon things one and thing two to help clean up the mess . they do it before the mom walks in the door and the cat leaves . the ending question is do you tell your mom what you did while she was gone or just say you looked out the window all day .....
5 #### I just read the amazing The Cat in the Hat story , and I think it is the most fantastic kids ' book I have read to my younger brothers and sisters in a long time . The characters in the book are an outraged fish , an extremely bad cat , a very good girl , and a very good boy . The story is very entertaining to read to young kids . The story begins when the sister and brother are very bored on a wet rainy day . A big naughty cat comes to the children 's home . The fish is right when it said " He should not be here . He should not be here at all . " And so the cat in the hat makes an enormous mess of the children 's house . Their Mommy is away , and the kids are afraid the messy house will never get cleaned before their Mommy gets home . How will it get done ? Read the book to find out . Now the children in the book are not at all bored . I liked the pictures that show how the cat makes hilarious things happen in the usually , very neat home . I also like how the sentences rhyme on every page . Dr. Seuss usually writes great stories with rhyming words . I think you will really enjoy reading this book to young kids too . By Hannah N.
3 #### Please note that this is an abridged version . All of the parts with the fish , " No , no , no said the fish . . . tell that cat .... etc " are left out in the interests of brevity . This is a big deal to us as they are some of my sons favorite parts . He 's 14 months , and loves when I say " NO NO NO ! " . We have been reading the regular version since he was about 5 months old , and he adores it , though I'l admit that I never try to get all the way through it , which may be why they shortened this version , however , they had to leave out all the fun stuff for little kids to do it , which is after all the point of a board book .
5 #### We are fifth grade students from Jones Elementary School . Our opinion about this book is that we enjoyed it very much because this is a book for all ages . This book has great style like descriptive , voice , vocabulary , and most of all it has lots of figurative language , for example , when he said " fast as a fox . " The illustrations and characters are very creative because they are very weird names and things . Dr. Seuss is the most creative and amazing author I have ever heard of . One of the things we did n't enjoy about this book is that it has too many tongue twisters . Here is an example of the tongue twister , " I can get them I bet . I bet , with my net , I can get those Things yet ! " The lesson in this book is to never say that you will never have fun if you are not outside . I would recommend this book to people who like tongue twisters and also people who have read Dr. Seuss books because this is another great story with great styled in it .
5 #### Cat in the Hat is a classic and I know the kindergarteners are going to love this story ! I am glad I got this book !
5 #### I checked this book out at our library to help our middle son learn Spanish . My 2 other children are fluent , and I am an " Eh " Spanish speaker . My husband 's first language is Spanish . I love this book because it is very easy to read , uses common expressions , and is a literal translation . My son knows the English version , and so he is really picking up the vocabulary . Some have mentioned that the point of the rhyming is to teach reading , but really , Spanish is very easy to read once you learn the rules - they do n't change . You do n't need to use rhymes to teach Spanish reading . My 7 year old reads Spanish fluently because of this , but does n't know the vocabulary . This is where books like these come in so handy ! I like this book so much more than the other " rhyming " Spanish versions like Green Eggs and Ham . Those are not accurate translations . They sound good , but do n't help us . I think they did an excellent job .
5 #### I did n't know such a book existed before shopping on Amazon . Book was in EXCELLENT condition , great discount , and my students have thoroughly enjoyed the songs I 've taught them .
5 #### This is the one book everyone who supervises people should read , especially anyone who supervises me . I have given this book to every new supervisor who reports to me and taught it to groups several times . Everyone finds it a quick read and goes away wondering how principals so simple could have eluded them up until now . The procedures in the book do not have to be executed exactly as described in the book , however the principals of " One Minute Goal Setting " , " One Minute Praisings " , and " One Minute Repremands " give a framework for communication essential for successful teams and relationships . I have an MBA in management and if I had to choose between what I learned for the MBA and what I learned from this book , I would have to choose the One Minute manager .
5 #### A positive management culture is a worthy goal for any corporation . This book plants the seeds for such a culture . The only problem is the people , who need this book the most , are the very people who will reject it .
5 #### The One Minute Manager is a very short book , in the shape of a modern tale in which a young man wants to learn about some company and its esteemed manager . He meets him , he becomes exposed to his philosophy of work , and goes on to meet other members of the company ; each of which presents another aspect of the One Minute Manager work ethic . This is a book that everyone in business is required to learn in many countries , such as Japan , and I can see why . It is not only interesting for the work place , but you could learn a thing or two about the management of any human group , like a family , a club , or else .
2 #### This definitely feels to me like there were a few good ideas puffed up with lots of words and air to make a longer book . Anyone who needs this info does n't need all that storytelling and wants the info in the most effective form not in some long drawn - out storyline . It also feels like it was a set - up for more books at big prices to present info that could have been presented effectively in one book . I am very glad I got this out of my local library instead of buying it !
4 #### I ordered this book for a class . It was in perfect condition when I got it . I think it is small and overly condensed as far as context is concerned , but useful if it is for a class .
2 #### " The One Minute Manager " purports to give the reader instructions on managing work and life . It does that , but the advise is so obvious and the instruction so superficial as to make reading even this short volume a waste of time . The advice is to give employees clear instructions , then praise them when they do well , and reprimand them when they do not . That is nearly the whole book . Now you do n't have to read it . While this advise seems correct to me , it is also very obvious . I would think that any manager who does not already know this needs more help then this book can provide . In any case the book can not do much harm since it is short .
5 #### I have a wonderful hardcover copy of the book from Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson that started the whole " The One Minute ... " best - selling series . Over the year the One Minute Goal and the One Minute Reprimand have been two of my favorites " One Minutes .... " This is a superb classic management book , reminding us of what is essential . Indeed , parents can benefit from reading and applying the suggestions as well because , of course , parents are the " Managers " ( and stewards ) of their children . The One Minute Manager is a book I take off the shelf and review annually . You will definitely want to add it to your library as well .
5 #### I ordered this book for my practice administrator of a three doctor group in the Texas area . She has improved her knowledge and used the resources described in the book to aid her in managing the practice , and all the myriad responsibilites that go with running the business side of a medical practice .
4 #### I read this book right after reading the book " Who Moved My Cheese " by the same authors . It is also a quick read and can be read in about an hour and a half or so . The book is easy to read , and quite frankly I found it a lot better than the cheese book . Mostly because it gives managers a good insight into what we do wrong and one possible way to correct this . Their method comes down to a simple advice : Do not wait with compliments and complaints and scoldings and praise until the annual review , but do it whenever it is needed and then scold the behavior , but appreciate the person . Their second advice ( although it is given first ) comes down to making clear to both manager and subordinate what is expected . Too many employees and managers think different of what is expected of them and have not written it down . Thus confusion begins and people feel unjustly treated . This book I also borrowed from the library , although I might someday buy it . I would recommend this book , both due to its good advice and easy readability . But I find the price of 16 dollars high for the content in it .
5 #### I bought this book as a Christmas gift . I love the book , I know that you send quality products , and I know that my grand daughter will love it .
3 #### do nt buy this unless you know how to read and play music . i thought it would be simple songs put to familiar music . that is not the case . i did not , however , look at all of them .
5 #### I have 3 books by Dr. Seuss in Russian ( about horton and egg ; horton i gorod ktotov ; cat in the hat ) . The 2 books about horton win the prize . If you are on a limited budget , buy the horton books first . The translation is sooo much better ! It did n't have that awkwardness in sentence structure and felt like it could be an original ( not translated ) story written by the Russian author . My now 5 y.o . loved all 3 books . She picks them off the book shelf to read on her own . Even though the font is n't large enough for toddler 's eyes , she loves these books so much that she does n't seem to mind that . Overall " Fefeylevskaya bashnya " wo n't leave the whole family disappointed .
5 #### Used it as a photo prop for my newborn nephew and when he becomes a reader , he will love it as much as I do !
5 #### Love all Seuss books so does my son . He loves to hear the rhythm of the words the book makes him laugh .
5 #### my kids loved cat in the hat & thing 1 & 2 so it stands to reason they love hat cat to come back with all the little abc cats in his hat making havoc . this book was in excellent condition as are all the books i get from amazon . i 've received about 20 or 30 books from amazon & only been disapointed with 2 flap books but the problem was quickly resolved & again i was a happy customer .
5 #### Quite simply , this is the most useful management book I have read . Every page has a good idea , and every idea can be applied in the workplace . I use these techniques daily , and i assure you -- they work . Read this book if you currently run a business or aspire to .
5 #### Very interesting take on a great manager . This book is short , to the point and is written like a novel which makes is real easy to read . What I liked about it is its wisdom . It gives you quick but effective lessons on how to treat people that work for you right , how to create the most effective organization through your people and how to free up your own time by delegating and developing experts within your organization . Read it , you wo n't regret it . I wo n't recommend buying it though , get it through your local library .
4 #### One Minute Manager was a runaway hit when first published in 1982 . It made popular a style of presenting a business lesson in very short story format . This book tells 3 things that a manager should do : establish clear goals with employees ; give praise ; and give reprimands . Praises and reprimands must be specific and timely . The one minute manager approach is not only to do those three things ( above ) , but to do them in a minute . This is great because a meeting would only last a minute . Meetings can carry on longer than expected without a way to know when to terminate the meeting . Also , some theorists say that meetings generally serve the purpose of affirming who is in charge . This theory at least offers an explanation for why top management appears to enjoy meetings , especially longer ones , while the rank and file tends merely to endure many meetings .
4 #### This book is a very fast read and gives and overview to some nice concepts . Managing people is a bit more complicated than the book explains , so I consider this book and intro to see if you enjoy reading management books . If you like this book , then there are many more solid books out there to graduate to .
5 #### This book is really the cornerstone of so much of what people really do in management to be successful . As managers , we are so busy that it is often impossible to take any time to really learn anything new . But this book stays in my office all the time-- I can pick it up for a little refresher course anytime . A Classic !
5 #### I had never even seen it until a friend gave it to us . It is a really nice addition to The Cat in the Hat .
5 #### I think the people who complained about the Spanish text not rhyming have completely missed the point of the book . It is to teach English speaking kids Spanish . If the Spanish were re - written to rhyme , the words would no longer match their English counterparts . Excellent book for my daughter who is learning Spanish .
4 #### This is the cutest bath bag I could find for a little girl . It is small , but does the trick . It has proved to be not very durable though , the suction cups have lost their hold over time ( but maybe that is typical of this type of toy ) . Overall , it has served its purpose and looked cute in the girlie bathroom !
5 #### This book is a classic that children love . The level of whimsy and learning contained in his books can not be topped .
5 #### Yes , I think New Hampshire 's state motto fits with the Cat :) For me , the morals of the story are : 1 . Give your kids autonomy and independence at an early age . 2 . Indulge your enthusiasm and that of others . 3 . Do n't tell about the things you got away with . :)
4 #### Very very quick read . A classic . Very simple to understand . Great for communication and goal setting . You can incorporate this mindset into your management right away . Highly recommend .
5 #### Once you read this , you will never think a boss is as good as the one in the book ... unless they have read it and use it ! I ca n't say enough good things about this . Readable within an hour . Stays with you for a lifetime ! !
5 #### As the owner of Integrity Management Solutions Group , I give a copy of the One Minute Manager to all of my clients . I believe it is a effective way management should be done in todays business . Micro Managing is not the way business owners need to manage to be effective . Holding their employees accountable is the way to run a profitable business . The One Minute Manager is an easy read for anyone and has a step by step guide to putting these techniques into place . Shelley Bradford Integrity Management Solutions Group Pointing the Veterinary Industry to Excellence [ .. ]
2 #### Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson birthed a monster writing style when they published THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER , " The Runaway # 1 National Bestseller ! " -- and that style is surrounding a hideously boring topic with clichs , adverbs , adjectives , redundancies , dull characters , and exclamation points . The book is then called a nonfiction fable . Hunh ? When this book came out in 1981 it used a new , perhaps fresh , approach to teaching management skills , but since then it has been copied and copied and copied ... when it should be put in a cage . It 's time to stop dumbing down and start smartening up books for managers . Enough already ! Note : You 'll only need 1 minute to get what 's useful out of this book .
5 #### I 'm a human resources manager and use this book and CD to help first - time supervisors understand the power of managing people properly . Not an intimidating , theoretical book that they will never read , but a real world " how - to " manage people . It 's a great first step as they make their foray into management . Plenty of time for the heavier stuff later in their careers .
5 #### I know for a fact that when this book idea first came into its eventual publisher 's hands , all the editors laughed at it ! " Who would read a silly book like this with almost no words in it ? " they scoffed . Yet for whatever reason they decided to publish it and the rest became amazing publishing history ! In my own book , " The Expert 's Edge , " I discuss how to develop leading - edge ideas as well as the importance of viewing failure as " desirable . " Without practicing both , you will never produce an unexpected success . Ken Blanchard was obviously doing both back when he conceived this groundbreaking book and the world ( and his publisher ) has never been the same .
5 #### For years I have considered this the best , quick read management book available . The " catch them doing something right " sums up the book nicely and it is a policy that I truly believe in .
5 #### This is a delightfully funny book to read to toddlers and a great book for beginning readers . It was the first book my 9 year old read by himself . I could n't find his well used copy so I bought this for my 2 year old . It 's as good as I remembered . Good illustrations good story with some repetitive phrases humor and an ending we did n't expect .
5 #### Duck in the muck and stuck reading it over and over again . I have read this book about 300 times now and while it is now irritating it 's nice that it is a short good kids book .
5 #### If there is this much information one author has come up with , how much more is out there begging to be uncorked from this silly state of Utah ! Friends and family have all perused the book ; it 's a great conversation piece !
5 #### My kids love Dr Seuss . The Cat in the Hat is one of their favored .
4 #### The mischief continues as the ever troublesome cat in the hat returns . Although not as good as the first book , " The Cat in the Hat Comes Back , " is another classic Dr. Seuss book told with clever rhymes , and aided with beautiful colorful illustrations . Once again , Cat in the Hat , drops in on the unsuspecting kids and makes a mess . The chuckles received while watching the cat make his messes , and the rather unorthodox ways that he and his helpers clean the mess up are the main storylines of the book . My child loves this book , just like the first one . Darien Summers , author of The Mischievous Hare , a children 's book.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Mischievous - Hare / dp/1432746022 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Mischievous Hare</a >
4 #### My child really enjoyed this tale , just as I did when I was a kid . In this timeless classic , Dr. Suess uses rhymes and animals to create a story full of mischief , fun and entertainment . Two children and their pet fish are stuck inside on a rainy day , only to have their boredom broken by the antics of a mischievous cat that storms into the house and entertains them and creates a huge mess in the process . In the end though , the cat cleans up after himself , becoming a somewhat good role model despite his previous carelessness . The before mentioned rhymes are used in this story to represent the text in a grabbing and mind provoking way that my child loves . I hope you give this classic book a try ... if you have n't already ! Darien Summers , author of The Mischievous Hare , a children 's book.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Mischievous - Hare / dp/1432746022 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Mischievous Hare</a >
4 #### A neglectful parent , a subversive cat , a piscine Big Brother , and twin automatons . People regard&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Alice - In - Wonderland / dp/144042909X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Alice In Wonderland</a>&nbsp;as a shining beacon of literary nonsense , but The Cat in the Hat more than holds its own . Illustrated in simple primary colors of red and blue , this is a book your kids will love but with which you ought to have a rather more complicated relationship . Ted was some kind of writer to spin a story so silly ( in a child 's eyes ) and yet so deviant . The questions that may be asked are myriad : Should Sally and her brother have called 9 - 1 - 1 the moment the Cat broke in ? Why does this " Cat " wear gloves ? Does ennui invite catastrophe ? Why are young children home alone ? Did their mother set up the entire plot ? Why did Seuss choose a Darwin fish to be the eyes , ears , and mouthpiece for Big Brother ? Did the circus ever find their performing cat ? And perhaps , was it all a dream ? The story ends with a question reminiscent of Dr. Seuss ' very first book ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/And - to - think - that - I - saw - it - on - Mulberry - street / dp / B0006ANY0W / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">And to think that I saw it on Mulberry street</a > ) , i.e. , What would * you * do ?
5 #### I have been reading this book to my children for over 10 years . And my children have learned to read by reading this book . Now , my 12 year old loves to read it to her brothers . A book that is a wonderful addition to the family time .
5 #### I ca n't count the times that I have read this old standby to my children . They are grown now , but never seemed to get enough of it when they were little . It is simple , yet mesmerizing . Dr. Seuss sure got it right when he created this classic . It is a must read , and I will read it many more times to my grandchildren and great - grandchildren .
1 #### Dr. Seuss 's books are known for their rhyme and and whimsical characters . This translation DOES NOT succeed in achieving the lyrical style in Spanish . Any Dr. Seuss books translated by Aida Marcuse or Yanitzia Cannetti are fabulous because they ARE able to maintain the lyrical rhyme in Spanish . I hope one day that one of those two translators does their magic with The Cat in the Hat . In the mean time , I just read this one to my son in English . The sequel , El Gato con Sombrero Viene de Nuevo , ( I believe is the title ) , is translated by one of these ladies and is fabulous .
5 #### Love this book and my students feel the same .
5 #### This is a cute and fun book with lots of rhyming words . I think I liked it as much as my 3 year old .
5 #### I absolutely love this book . Duck in the Truck has a wonderful cadence , and loads of sound effect opportunities . I do all the voices and sounds for the kids and they absolutely love it . I just bought this book for a friend who is soon to have kiddos of her own because we so enjoy this story .
5 #### My boys absolutely love the duck series . We own a few other stories as well . This story is easy to follow and the words rhyme and are perfect for a 2yr and 4yr old . I love the large print and they love the pictures and the detailed expressions on the character 's faces . They truly love the series and ask to read the " duck " book almost nightly . Will definitly be purchasing more " duck " books in the future
5 #### Back in 1981 , I was a first line supervisor for a large steel company . As an organization , we were struggling against the competition coming from Japan dumping large volumes of low quality , low price steel on our shores . Our management team bought everyone a copy of the new book , The One Minute Manager . We found this small book to be a fun and crisp read . In short order , our local group solved our problems and thrived in the face of the competition . In 2007 , I was now a corporate director for a fortune 500 company and one of our operations were struggling with continual losses . Part of my corrective action was to dust off my old copy of The One Minute Manager and put it to use . I was somewhat surprised that it was still available through Amazon . I bought multiple copies for the managers and as in the past , they started solving their people issues which in turn solved all the other problems . Needless to say , I highly recommend this ' old ' book . Plain and simple , it works . Michael L.

5 #### I read this book in my last year in university . I was a senior management student and after reading this book , I understood that during the past four years ; I was not introduced to Ken Blanchard , and this masterpiece book . I will keep it short . This book is actually not a book , it is an advisor when you need one , it is a friend who approves or shows you what to do in some common , but real life situations in business life . This book , I suggest , should be read by everybody ( not necessarily only by managers or supervisors or employees but everyone who lives a social life ) because it teaches you how to communicate with people . It is so easy to read , and one should read after and after so that the principles and ways are embedded and implemented by the readers . Thank you Ken Blanchard and his co - authors for writing this book .
5 #### This is a great book to read , It makes you think about your management style . It does not take long to read an should make you a better manager at the same time . I highly recommend this to anyone who is a manager .
4 #### I just reread this great little primer on management and found it just as helpful as I did fifteen years ago . While its concepts are simple , they are also quite effective IF managers ( including teachers , parents , and front - line supervisors ) would implement them correctly . The three secrets of one - minute goal setting , one - minute praisings , and one - minute reprimands are based on sound behavioral principles and are bound to work as long as certain guidelines are met . For instance , goals should be realistic and specific , praisings should be sincere and immediate , and reprimands should end with a bit of encouragement . I love the idea of managers walking around trying to catch people doing things right . What a refreshing idea ! Read the book and apply the principles in your home , office , or factory . While the three guidelines wo n't solve every human relations problem , they offer sound , practical advice that will lay the foundation for effectiveness .
1 #### do you want a summary of this book ? Stupid kid : " Hey Mr. Manager , how about you teach me some managing stuff to manage people " Manager:"you want me to teach you some managing stuff to manage people with " ? Stupid kid : " yeah i want you to teach me some managing stuff , to manage people with " Manager : " allright , ill teach you some managing stuff to manage people with " Stupid kid : " you mean to tell me you 'd teach me some managing stuff to manage people with " ? Manager : " i do n't like repeating stuff , ill show you some managing stuff to manage people with " * repeat thought out the whole book if you are in idiot and you think books like rich dad poor dad are good books , then prepare for a heart warming story if not , do n't waste your time like i did , this bs could have been written in a greeting card
5 #### It 's short , simple and reinforces its main points . The book is so efficient and well done , there is never a " need " to reread it , but people do . That says something .
3 #### This is the book that started it all . I was recently reorganizing my books and ran across a copy of the original version . I decided to reread it and was really a little dissappointed . I remember reading this back in the 80 's and being quite impressed with it . So why was I not impressed with it twenty years later ? Well , a few reasons . Back in the 80 's , we bought our books at a place called a book store . There , you could actually thumb through the book before buying it . So , you could easily see that there was n't much content . The book is 112 pages , but could have easily fit on half that number . Ah , the magic of formatting . Today , we buy our books online and can not see that we are dupped into believing there is more content than what is actually here . Also , the basic concept here revolves around 3 simple principles , 1 minute goal setting , 1 minute praising and 1 minute reprimanding . There you have it . Do n't get me wrong , this is great stuff to know and live by , but by today 's standards , this is simply not enough content to warrant the price . If you have n't read this book , by all means , get a copy . But do n't pay $ 14.95 for it . It 's easy enough to find a nice used copy for a couple of dollars .
5 #### We 've has this and other Dr. Seuss books since I was a kid , but watching my kids with these books is a very different experience . Even the 3 year old has come to recognize the brand and anywhere he sees Dr. Seuss he wants to read it . My six year old looks for the books for his reading assignments . Some of these books get rather long and the kids are not intimidated by it because they know they will enjoy it . Across the board it is a good way to get your kids interested in a series of books rather than one or two favorites .
5 #### The Cat In the Hat is still one of the best kids books ever written .
5 #### I think this is a UK printing , or purchased from a UK vendor . I have n't seen this book in BOARDBOOK form in any children 's bookstores in the US despite how popular the book is . When I wanted my daughter to have this at about 20 months old , she was going through a period of chewing and tearing off bits of even the most well constructed books , so I was not going to give her any paper page books . She succeeded in tearing off the top layer of the spine of this one , but otherwise has survived nicely and now she really enjoys the narrative as well .
5 #### This was my favorite book up untill about the age of 13 . I must have read this book over a hundred times . When I was n't studying for school , I was reading this book . I use to be able to say the entire book outloud from memory .
5 #### I read a couple of songs from " The Cat in the Hat " about 20 years ago . Since then , I`ve been looking for the book . Got it , at long last ! And I find the songs as fun as they seemed to be back then . What would make me totally happy would be a CD , but I have not found one to buy , alas ... the link provided by an Amazon client shows " Not In Store " . Well , one can not have everything , I suppose ... But I sincerely recommend the book to All Good Friends !
5 #### Dr. Seuss was one of my favorite childhood authors . His books were easy for me to read as a very young child . They are excellent primers for beginning readers . They are also beautifully illustrated and they will tease and twist your child 's mind into a delightful pretzel filled with laughter . The Cat in the Hat has got to be one of my favorites . It is a wonderful story about how a cat shows up at a child 's home one afternoon and turns the house into chaos . I would have to say that Dr. Seuss ' writing has affected my own since I write books in a humorous albeit adult vein . I am grateful for the creativity that he sparked within me . Davis Aujourd'hui , author of " The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude "
4 #### I purchased this book to read to a group of headstart students to celebrate Dr. Seuss 's birthday . I wore the big hat and read to a group of twenty children . It was a great success ! They wanted to see every picture and most of them knew the story and asked questions on every page . I think all children over the age of four would love this book !
5 #### Everyone knows this book is a classic . What everyone may not know is that on Amazon it is a very good price . I was going to buy this at a bookstore in the mall this weekend for someones baby shower but quickly put it back on the shelf because it was $ 17.00 . Once again , Amazon has the best deals .
2 #### I must admit it took me a minute to remember this book , as I have read it several years ago . That gives me an advantage on judging the impact of this book . At the time I had given it 2.5 stars but now it will definitly be 2 stars . This review is hard to write as I do n't like critisizing books . People put their heart and soul in it and it may work for a lot of people . However , I 'm not one of them . At the time of reading I had no management experience at all , so it should have felt like a quick and easy way to learn something . I found other books a much better help , though . If you want a quick read and spend 4 dollars an hour on this book go ahead . I 'd just rather spend more time and money on another one .
3 #### Few , but EFFECTIVE , hints that stress on the importance of being clear and consise when defining objectives , praising or critisizing employees . Recommended .
5 #### A great and insightful resource for everyone - we all ' manage ' others in our lives , especially moms and dads ! Great management advice , grab a copy and pass it around work .
5 #### The ONLY book , from the guys who decided to keep milking this one good book , that really is worth a damn . Good , simple management perspective . Over - simplified ? Maybe . But , practical , and useful . Especially for new management . At least worth the time . And , hey- you can easily read it in one sitting .
4 #### On one hand I really like the way this book gets right to the point without consuming lots of time . Too many books with a similar mission would spend 400 pages , but this one can be read in an hour . The brevity is a double - edged blade though , because the book falls short of fully explaining its concepts . It really touches on only three main approaches to management , but it does not provide anything in the way of examples or contingencies in case real life does not match the story . I am glad I read it but it is hard to say the book is worth the money . You really do not get much content for the price . Upon finishing the book , you 'll soon realize the need to buy more books from these authors to flesh out how to implement their suggestions .
4 #### Saw this recommended online -- checked it out at the library and bought it for a young friend . I heard he likes it .
5 #### I use this book while homeschooling my preschooler . He absolutely adores this book . We use this with a flannel board for story recall , this book really got him excited about story sequencing .
2 #### Not my favorite story . At the end of the story , the duck leaves the others in the mud after they helped him get unstuck .
5 #### This is the all - time favorite book of my three boys . They 're 11 , 13 and 15 now and they can still recite Duck in the Truck ! We have spent many hours throughout their childhood reading this book over and over ... to each other . This book taught my boys how to read with inflection . And , whenever we see a duck ... or a red truck ... somebody will make a reference to this book . It is an absolute f - a - v - o - r - i - t - e ! ! In fact , this is book we gave to little Liam at his Mommy 's baby shower . I ca n't wait for another couple of months when his Mommy and Daddy will be able to share this book with him too . Yes , it 's just that good .
1 #### A sing - song , fun enough book until the end . As other readers have clearly explained , Duck enlists the aid of passing animals to help him , then happily driving away , leaving the animals who helped him stuck in the mud themselves without so much as a shouted " thank you " . As my daughter succinctly explained , " That 's not nice . " I 'm sure some readers will love the colorful pictures and dismiss such negative reviews , but consider yourself forewarned .
5 #### My kids and I just LOVE this book . We have had it for a couple years now , and it 's still one of our favorites . It 's a cute story with great rhymes .
5 #### I had a hard time finding this book . I use it to introduce Forces of Motion to first grade children . I was grateful to finally find this book . It came in a timely manner and it was in great condition . Thanks for helping me get this book .
5 #### Cute story and great illustrations . The story is quite entertaining especially for toddlers . This book is worth buying .
4 #### This is a fun read for ALL .... I started reading this book to my son when he was 2years old , two years on and he still loves it ... One of those books that is a pleasure to read over and over again .
5 #### Two small children , left home alone on a deary , rainy day , are startled by a home intruder -- a giant , talking feline who proceeds to trash the house ! This book should have damaged us forever , but it remains deliriously funny . It is left to the fish to be the voice of responsibility and everyone knows fishes are all wet ! This 1957 book brought compelling drama and conflict to the easy reader section of the library . The glimpse through the window shows that the mother is returning ! What will she find ? Thing 1 and Thing 2 running through the house , banging their kites around ? Disaster ! No spoilers in this review ... get your own copy ! Although this has been made into a movie and an audio tape , I point out that although it 's a great story , it 's meant to be a book that the child can read . Translating it into other media is a bit like cheating .
5 #### Times have changed . Little kids left home alone and should n't they have been told by their parents not to let anyone in ? This is the book that must of led to a lot of wild house parties and may have spawned many party while your parents are away flicks ( Risky Business , etc ) . A good fun read with a lilting cadence !
5 #### This silly story centers around self - responsibility . The children panic because they know their mother wo n't be happy if she comes home and find the house a mess . The fish fluctuates between being an annoyance and a voice of reason . The story stars a well - meaning cat who tries to release the children from an afternoon of boredom . He brings excitement , which quickly devolves into chaos ... or so it seems . This is a fun bedtime story , nothing more , nothing less . My sons were n't looking for a debate about latch - key children and abandonment . We 'll leave those reviews to the sociology graduates . If your children enjoy this book , I also recommend,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Cat - in - the - Hat - Comes - Back / dp/0394800028 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Cat in the Hat Comes Back</a > .

5 #### This book features the great comeback of the Cat in the Hat , who again finds the two kids home alone and comes in to make havoc . The story is funny , as the cat makes a big spot on the bathtub and tries to clean it up and ends up making a bigger mess each time . So he calls his helpers , little cats that are kept in his hat featuring the whole alphabet . The rhymes are catchy and my 3y.o . loves to " read along " with me ( he 's a big Seuss fan ) , and it 's a nice and original introduction to the alphabet . Definitely worth the buy ! ! !
4 #### This is , of course , the classic beginning reader by Dr. Seuss . What can I say about it that has not already been said ? Honestly , I ca n't think of a thing . Just that it is a classic , and has taught many children how to read , and is a fun read - aloud to younger kids as well .
5 #### The Cat in the Hat By Dr. Seuss The Cat In the Hat was my first book . I remember reading it to my mom in the kitchen while she cooked dinner . Any child who has to sit , sit , sit on a rainy day , would enjoy a visit from the cat in the hat . He made a game of balancing on a ball , adding items one by one , until the whole thing was overturned and the cat fell on his head . The cat brought in a box with Thing one and Thing two , while the fish in a pot warned about the mess , and what their mother would do . Your children 's book collection would not be complete without a copy of The Cat In A Hat .

1 #### This book started out in similar fashion to the original Cat in the Hat book , but then it turned ugly and a little disturbing . Once again , the children are left alone , this time responsible for shoveling snow while the mother goes into town . The Cat in the Hat shows up and invites himself in the house , where he makes himself at home by eating cake in the bathtub . When he exits the tub , there is a pink ring that needs to be cleaned up . The cat uses various objects and surfaces in the house to clean the ring , but it eventually winds up outside in the snow . The Cat enlists the help of other cats that are under his hat to " kill the mess " , using pop guns . The more the cats shoot , the more the spots spread . There 's an illustration of pink - tinged snow covering the ground , the house , and even a snowman . This picture , coupled with the words " Kill those spots ! Kill the mess ! " , just comes across as a little violent and gory to me . Just plain weird story . Not a favorite of mine , by any means .
5 #### Duck in the Truck is one of my 3 year old son 's favorite books . When he was very young he was enthralled with the vibrant illustrations , and now he loves the way the story rhymes . We 've enjoyed this book so many times that on a long car trip I recited the story - word for word - over and over again , even though the book was tucked safely away at home . It 's the only book I 've memorized from reading so many times !
1 #### The ending of this book completely kills it . We received it as a gift . I read it to my daughter and now we are going to get rid of it . The reviewers who say the duck is clearly portrayed as an antihero are mad . You may pick up on this - and help your kids interpret the ducks behavior , but even at 18 months , my daughter is more than capable of pulling books down on her own and looking through them without me standing over her shoulder as interpreter . The message in this book is poor . Trick people into helping you and then leave them in the lurch when you get what you want . The sad part is that they could have fixed it pretty easily at the end . If only a second tragedy befell the duck - kind of as karma come back around . Then the message would be bad things happen to bad people .
5 #### This has been our 2 yr old grandson 's favorite book since he was 9 months old . My daughter and I can recite it in our sleep . Yet , it never grows dull . The illustrations are bright , colorful and engaging . There are several items to point out and look for , which is what our little guy enjoys . The text has rhythm and the story begs for participation via sounds effects and physical support . Our boy shouts every time he sees Duck 's vegetables go flying ( and we exclaim " Where 's the carrot ? Look at the watermelon ! " etc . ) He compares everyone 's feet during , " These are the feet , which jump the duck down ... " And he gets red in the face helping sheep , frog and duck push against the back of the truck . I like the introduction to poetic language ( again , " the feet that jump the duck down " ) and the rhyme . Reviewers have commented on Duck 's selfishness in leaving his friends stuck in the muck . However , for our family , being in the muck is a pleasurable , sought - after experience and Duck 's quirky character provides opportunity for silly comments . This is the easiest of the duck books . The others are slightly more complex and Duck 's irascibility is even more pronounced . As our boy grows and understands , we know that Duck 's less desirable characteristics will serve as object lessons and also provide opportunities to highlight the patience and friendship of Goat , Frog and Sheep . Good lessons , those .
5 #### Our little boy ( a young toddler ) loves this book . We 've got hundreds of similar books and have owned and read this one for months now -- it does n't get old and he still loves and laughs at it . It 's got great illustrations , excellent rhymes , lots of opportunity for sound effects and voices . As for the idea that the duck is treating his friends badly , well ... that 's part of why it 's funny ! You have to explain that the duck is being a jerk , although I think the kid will see that himself .
5 #### I loved this book when I was young and still do ! It is bright and colorful and a great way to get children to read . A fantastic story about a race between dogs . The dogs use many methods of travel to try to win this imaginary race . One of a few books that is as appropriate for children of today as it was when I was growing up .
5 #### I loved this book as a kid and love reading it to my kids . Plus now it 's in a board book edition - can't get much better than that for your book - eating litle monsters ! It 's an easy read , with lots of rhyme and fun illustrations . And each time the girl dog and boy dog meet up ( " Do you like my hat ? " " I do not " ) the kids get a good laugh out of their good - byes .
2 #### This book is too simple to be really effective . So what if you are a tough or nice manager ? This book is basically trying to find a balance , and that 's nothing new . And it tell you to evaluate your performance with your goals , thanks for the insight , wow , I 've learned so much . Save your money and time . If you must , check it out at the library .
5 #### For an adult to have not read this book , to me , is like a person who never read " Green Eggs & Ham " or " Jack and Jill " . This is a MUST read for anyone who is involved in the corporate community at any level . The three concepts introduced in " The One Minute Manager " are so simple to understand , yet so profound at what they accomplish . Actually , " The One Minute Manager " IS as easy to read as " Green Eggs & Ham " . I love the " story book " format that is used to tell the tale of this enigmatic character who calls himself a one - minute - manager . The other character , a young man on a quest to learn what makes a good manager , who subsequently encounters the one - minute - manager , reminds me of Columbo who asks questions and investigates tirelessly until he finds answers . This book is an easy read and a fun read . Yet the concepts that it reveals are priceless .
3 #### Sometimes we need somebody who reminds us of what we already know . I guess it 's the same with this book . This book points out the 3 key elements on managing people / staff . ( It takes more then managing staff to be a good manager ) . Basic line the three techniques of one - minute management - clear goal setting , one - minute praisings and one - minute reprimands . The book is written in a way that 's easy to read , do n't expect rocket science .
5 #### I love this book . I use this book when I train my assistant managers . It has some great management tools .
4 #### The original One Minute Manager deals with the three " secrets " of good management : One Minute Goals , One Minute Praisings , and One Minute Reprimands . I found this book well done but simplistic ( apparently this manager does very little outside of the two hour staff meeting each week ) , which I guess is all one might expect from a breezy read that one could polish off in an hour or so . Nevertheless , I certainly would recommend it as reading to all managers . And because of its short length , it is a book that a manager could reread every year . The basic insights and principles are valid and should be considered by all thoughtful managers . Certainly not the only management book you 'll ever need , but a helpful supplement to your bookshelf .
5 #### OMM is an oversimplified version of how to lead people . It applies not only to work , but to parenting , relationships in a church , or anywhere else . While it is simple , it is profound . I read this book about once a year as a refresher . It is a must - read . Sometimes the writing is a bit corny , but look past that to get the message , which is simply the best way to lead people . I also recommend the " One Minute Manager and the Monkey . "
5 #### One friend 's little boy has so much fun with this book , and I have so much fun reading it to him I bought it for another friend who is about to have a little boy .
3 #### Unfortunately I 'm not all that thrilled with how the story ends , but up until the very end it teaches helpfullness , problem - solving , etc . I really think it 's a great teaching tool in that respect - I just hate that I have to lecture at the end on duck should 've been kinder to his friends . They rhyming is great and really engages my preschooler . Would love the book more if it had a more positive outcome . We are huge Jez Alborough fans and this book will stay in our library .
5 #### This is my 2 - year - old 's favorite book right now . The illustrations are quite clever with some wonderful expressions and body language on the duck and friends . The storyline is simple with a lot of rhyming words which contributes to my daughter 's enjoyment . The ending is not quite what one expects , but it can easily be turned into a discussion as to why the duck abandons his friends .
2 #### I love Jez Alborough and this book is great to look at and read and rhyme with -- until you get to the end ! Shame on you duck . I read this to a group of children at a day care center yesterday and they were shocked at Duck 's treatment of his helpful friends .
3 #### When I read to kids , I enjoy it so much when the story has some rhythm and rhyme . This is a simple little story that is a fun read with very entertaining illustrations . The animal characters are drawn with humor and expression . The book would be a great choice for emerging readers since the illustrations and rhymes support the beginning reader . The storyline is presented in frames on some pages which would help with sequencing and retelling also .
5 #### Review by Sherry North , Author,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Because - You - Are - My - Baby / dp/0810994828 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Because You Are My Baby</a > As a child , I liked The Cat in the Hat Comes Back better than the original . Now my 4 - year - old son agrees . He ca n't get enough of this absurd tale of a bathtub ring that ends up all over the house and yard . The story 's imagination is breathtaking , as the cat in the hat reveals 26 more cats in hats atop his head . There 's educational value , too , because the 26 little cats are named each letter of the alphabet . The final solution at the end of the story is a bit vague and abrupt , but otherwise it 's a fun - filled romp both kids and parents enjoy .
5 #### When I can , I plan to purchase the entire series of Dr. Seuss books for my child being that his style of poetic prose is so appealing to children . It presents concepts in a way that do n't stop to make them " think " ; yet encourage a style of their own " brain - storming " that allows them to try to understand how silly chit - chat can become something interesting in a very sensible ; yet diverse manner . LLO'C
5 #### I have this delightful book in English , Japanese , Spanish , and now in Chinese . Availability in all these languages is magnificent for children for many reasons . It allows children of these linguistic background to enjoy this great book . It is a wonderful attitudinal validation of these languages , especially if read in a school setting where English is the predominant language of instructin . This is valuable for chldren of every linguistic background . It contributes to the appreciation and awareness of these languages . This is so very important for inter - linguistic / cultural harmony and understanding . All of these benefits through a story that is so much fun ! ! !
4 #### The feline in the big long red and white striped top hat is back again , with his subversive , mischievous ways . The two kids are bored and doing the crappy yardwork thiing , and with the parental units away , the cat wants to play . Crazy snow stunts , games and fights and dodgy bathroom antics are more fun than works .
4 #### When the parental units away , the cat will play . Take a kid , and a cat , and a lot of smaller cats , and a bunch of toys , and many snowballs and other devices of childish warfare , and you get a barrel of laughs and entertainment , indeed . You just have to be good at the fast cleanup .
5 #### What can I say , it 's The Cat in the Hat . You remember this book from your own childhood . Let 's face it , it 's one you have to own . The rhymes , the fun story , it 's Dr. Seuss at his best . My kids will pick this book to read over and over , and over ! Even my 19 month - old can get into the Rhyming and playful wording . If you do n't already own this , you owe it to yourself and your kids to buy it .
5 #### My children 's children are enjoying the same Seuss poetry we read at least 30 years ago . Thank you Amazondotcom for offering very reasonable and reliable books for children !
5 #### I am a volunteer reader for the Denver Public Library and I recently read this book to a group of preschool children . It 's a fun book ! The rhyming and repetition patterns of the text are characteristic of some of the finest books for young people . As far as the content of the story , yes , Duck is a character of suspect temperament , but I thought the author made that clear ( Duck is an antihero ) . You are not expected to cheer for him . Besides as the reader , you should point out Duck 's flaws to your listeners ( it 's your " moral " obligation ) . Ask your son / daughter how he / she would feel if someone treated him / her the way Duck treats his " friends " . I spent time with my listeners and asked them about whether Duck was being nice to the other characters in the story and emphasized the importance of treating people well .... check out the book for yourself at a library .
5 #### We checked this book out from the library & have since had to buy it . Every night for the past month just before bed time my 22 month old starts calling for " truck truck " , meaning this book . It is so much fun to read I enjoy it too ( even 30 + times later ) .
5 #### This is a funny book whether you are 2 or 70 ! The predicament of the duck and his friends is delightful . The illustrations are lovely . I have looked for more books by this author . Great book , in the most frequently requested pile ....
5 #### 1 minute goal , 1 minute praising , and 1 minute reprimand can help you not only on your career but also in your personal life . This is a short book and very easy to read . The main idea is knowing what your outcome , catching people doing things right , catching people doing things wrong . Simple but convincing . At the end of the book , it does explain why these things work and why people function these way . Pleasure reading in 2 hours . Very helpful and practical ! For the CD audio book version , it also includes an interview with Dr. Spencer Johnson about where did the 1 minute manager 's idea come from and how did Dr. Johnson apply the idea on his daily life . ( Reviewed by Otto Yuen , 07 - Jan-2007 )
4 #### A little oversimplified and repetitive , but still a classic management book . Every leader should read this . Its concepts are so simple , and yet , there are so many managers in the world who remain ignorant of them ! I wish every boss and senior colleague I have ever had , have , and will have would read this book .
4 #### This classic is based on the premise that it does n't take much to " get very big results from people . " In fact , it takes about a minute ... a well - timed minute . Start by setting goals with employees . Each goal should take no longer than a minute to read . The manager then looks for progress made toward the goals and " catches people doing things right " rewarding them with 1 minute of praise . Conversely , when things are not done well , the manager takes about a minute to reprimand the employee . Basically , it 's about timely and honestly communicating with employees , a practice which is severely lacking virtually everywhere . If managers actually followed the simple advice of this book , there 's no telling what they could accomplish . It 's a quick , easy , and very beneficial read . -- Nick McCormick , Author , Lead Well and Prosper
4 #### This book is a synopsis of easyt ways to evaluate and resolve conflicts in a business environment . To the point .
5 #### The book is brief , the language is simple , and the best of all ... it works . This handy , and concise book will teach you how to manage your life ( Not only your Work ! ! ) , and thus reduce your stress , simplify your life , and get the work done in less time . What you will find in this book is an easy to read story , that quickly teaches you three very successful and practical management techniques : One Minute Goals Setting , One Minute Praising , and One Minute Reprisals . Its story format makes this book readable and light , .. but yet very insightful and effective . You will want to read this book over and over , just for the pleasure of doing it . I bought this book 13 years ago , and I still enjoy reading it .
4 #### The tools the authors advocate in this book are effective and easy to work with in any organization . They are simplistic but surprisely effective . They are not a silver bullet for all the ills of an organization . However if practiced , they will lead to a better work environment . As with many management tools , the policy advocated in this book are not a cure for all organizational difficulties . In organizations that do n't care for their workers , this policy would not work . Organizations using only this method will not become more profitable . This is just one of many tools a manager should use in leading his / her organization .
3 #### My first real manager pointed me in the direction of this book , and you know what it 's helpful . Offering some nice tips on how to make people feel important . One tip in the book about touching people on the elbow or shoulder really adds something to a quick exchange . Nothing earth shattering here but if you are new to managment or want to brush up on some concepts before going on a first interview for a managment job this is a nice read .
5 #### P.D , Eastman and Dr. Seuss are perfect for early readers !
1 #### This is not the full version of the book it is missing the whole do you like my hat part . Do nt waste you money . But the regular book .
5 #### A classic book in board book for baby . Love it !
5 #### What can one say about The Cat in the Hat that has n't already been said ? It 's doubtful there is anyone anywhere in the US that has n't heard of Dr. Seuss or his most famous of books The Cat in the Hat . Suffice to say this book was a classic when it was written and it remains a classic today , some fifty years later . What you may not know about Dr. Seuss is that the good doctor was really a gentleman named Theodor Seuss Geisel . Mr. Geisel began his career as a little known editorial cartoonist in the 1920s . As his work evolved , he became known for his intriguing perspectives and fresh concepts . His works moved from basic cartooning to deft illustrations , sculptures and oil paintings that showcased his elaborate imagination . He had a unique artistic vision , and his artwork became the platform from which he delivered dozens of children 's books , hundreds of political cartoons , hundreds of advertisements , and many editorials filled with wonderfully inventive animals , characters and clever humor .
5 #### Everyone knows this one , yes ? Well , I actually did n't until maybe 6 months ago . This book is KING at bedtime and has kept my daughter 's interest for longer than expected - especially for a 2 year old . All the Dr Seuss books are engaging and fantastic for developing language skills and a love for books .
2 #### I confess I was deeply disturbed by Seuss 's parable , which pits the soul - crushing wickedness of a Satanic character ( " Cat " ) against the unspoiled innocence and naivety of two suburban children . Things come to a head when " Cat " seems on the point of morally subverting the universe itself , in a series of feats so nihilistic that the children are reduced to little more than blubbering idiots . True , " Cat , " in a whimsy , stays his paw at the end . But I ca n't help wondering if the children were so harrowed by the experience that they were ever after unable to return to the bright world above .
5 #### Your child will love this as much as you did in your youth . A sustainable classic . You ca n't go wrong .
4 #### Even though the Spanish portions do n't rhyme , I still found the book a worthwhile tool for working with those gaining proficiency in reading the Spanish language . Because it does n't go to lengths to make it rhyme , the English concepts are easier for beginners to find in the Spanish wording , and the words are easier to grasp the meaning of without a dictionary .
5 #### THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN SAY IS THAT YOU CAN'T BEAT THE PRICES ON THESE BOOKS FROM AMAZON . THEY WERE MY FAVORITES AS A KID AND NOW I GET TO ENJOY THEM ALL OVER AGAIN WITH MY OWN CHILDREN .
5 #### I remember reading this way back in the 70s . It is great that this book still helps children to learn how to read and actually introduces it in a way to make it fun . When I think of the books that I read in my childhood , this is the one book I always remember . I thank Dr. Seuss for introducing reading to me at such an early age and inspiring me to also write books years later that are also meant to help others . Get " The Cat in the Hat " for your children . They will cherish it . Peace and Happiness , Patrick Leonardi
2 #### I remember buying and trying to read this book as a young whippersnapper , so I thought I would pick it up for my nephew as a reward for keeping his pants up at school . After receiving this book in the mailbox ( I prefer not to use e - lectric mail since I do n't trust the darn thing ) , I realized this is not the same book that was printed 46 years ago . The first part is great and all , but I definitely do not remember the 2nd part . This might be some of Seuss ' most eccentric work . Most of the words do n't make sense , and do n't even correlate to the illustrations . I guess the proofreaders came to work drunk the day they read this pile of horsefeathers . The book blatantly reuses the same illustrations from the first part of the book ( as filler I guess ) , and there 's all sorts of spelling errors . I even saw an upside down exclamation point . How 'd they miss that one , let alone type it ? I do n't see that key on my typewriter . I 'm not sure if they thought kids would get this far in the book or not . Yes , I understand how the world works these days ; everyone 's out to make a buck , but come on , they obviously added a bunch of incoherent filler pages so they could charge a premium for the book . The children are your CUSTOMERS , and you just ripped them off , Mr. Seuss .
5 #### The Cat got old ? Do not say that ! Do not say that about the Cat ! Fifty years old ? It can not be ! That means I am as old as he ! Am I as old as that old Cat ? That Cat who wears that old top - hat ? It seems like not so long ago I first began that book to know And later took it out again To read to Aly and to Bran And now it 's half a century ? Oh my ! How fast the years do flee ! You are not getting old , just better , Your rhymes inspire our Christmas letter You may have been born long ago But into old age you wo n't go Your childhood will never end You 'll always be our children 's friend For children everywhere , each one - Two hundred fifty mill - i - on * - Will always keep your wondrous verses In their heads when they converses . You 've little competition . ( Damn ! There 's just that pesky Sam - I - Am ! ) So here 's to you , you grand old Cat . You 've aged , but you are still " all that . " Consider this a birthday toast , To one fine feline , one fun host Of bedtime stories far and near A top - hatful of birthday cheer ! ( ..... )
1 #### I was forced to read this , and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group . Our CFO lives by the concepts , and he is running our department into the ground by following them . The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read . There is ONE good point that I got from it , and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable , relevant , and attainable . I got that message in about 5 minutes though . The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private . No kidding , learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school . Skip the book , and polish that resume if you are forced to read it .
3 #### B.F. Skinner , K. Breland , and N. Guttman discovered shaping in 1943 at a General Mills flour mill . Oh , the excitement they must have had teaching pigeons to do funny tricks like bowl , peck discs , and pull strings . Now , you can share the fun . Let your employees be the pigeons and you can use Skinners 60 - year - old principles to teach your employees tricks . Kenneth H. Blanchard and Spencer Johnson shamelessly repackage Skinner 's operant conditioning as a management tool . Even the examples are the same : Pigeons and bowling . Told in parable form , the " employees " of the imaginary company love their successive approximations ( " One - Minute Goals " ) , positive rewards ( " One - Minute Praisings " ) , and aversive stimulus ( " One - Minute Reprimands " ) . Using operant conditioning principles to control humans is not new ; in fact , B.F. Skinner himself suggested that the principles of operant conditioning can be used efficiently to control a society . In his 1948 novel , Walden Two , he presented a utopian society guided by operant conditioning principles . His 1971 book , Beyond Freedom and Dignity , caused a controversy by presenting his ideas on how operant conditioning could be utilized in an actual society . Although most people are not willing to accept Skinner 's utopian ideal , the principles of operant conditioning are being applied in our everyday lives . Apparently , DRS . Johns and Blanchard feel employees , as pigeons , can be controlled with simple antique behavioral modifications .
5 #### I have read this a couple of times in my career already , but the new boss just bought a hardback copy for his management team so I read it again . It does n't take long . The authors of the negative reviews here miss the point . It 's not a management tome meant to provide day - to - day advice , but rather a parable offering a timeless philosophy : Tell your employees what you expect , offer timely feedback and exhibit support . One reviewer recommended an annual reading . I concur . It 's easy to get lost in the specific details and lose sight of foundation principles . Buy the hardback , read and reread . Yes , there is a lot of whitespace , but it 's about the message . It 's not rocket science , but it 's timeless . You and I could have written it , but Blanchard and Johnson beat us to it .
4 #### I liked this book and it 's easy to read style . However I highly recommend purchasing ( from Amazon of course ) " The Art of Giving and Receiving Feedback " by Shirley Poertner , Karen Massetti Miller . I combined the info from the 2 books to give myself a complete system of " reinforcement " and " redirection " to use ( I dislike Blanchard 's use of the term reprimand ; sounds too harsh and punishment - like ) . It takes the process a step further than Blanchard by showing what to do if after a " reprimand " the employee gives resistance or is confused about the expectations . I highly recommend Blanchard 's " Situational Leadership and the One Minute Manager " . The situational leadership system made my " lightbulb " come on . I am now ready to be the manager I was hoping to learn to be when I first purchased the One Minute Manager book !
5 #### Great advice does n't have to be complicated . One Minute Manager provides a simple formula for management success , whether you 're a Vice - President , a school teacher or a parent - this book will help you become a much more effective leader . It 's profound yet straight forward and easy to read . The One Minute Manager is a classic ! Make sure you read it .
1 #### I read all the business and management books that I can find and this is by far the worst I have ever seen . The main character spends the entire book devoting his life to improving at his job after he makes a mediocre presentation to a client . In the end he finally presents the results of all his hard work to his supervisor . When she reacts positively , he stammers " you mean you are not going to fire me ? " Are you kidding me ? He showed he is as dedicated an employee as there ever was and worked like crazy to get better at his job . After all his dedication he ends up with very little self confidence . And even worse , his boss replies , " I ca n't afford to fire you . " She jokes about how much they have invested in his training . Unbelievably bad book , the writing is very sophmoric , and the overall message is one of self doubt , groveling , and low self confidence . Save your money and avoid this book !
5 #### It 's easy to belittle this book for its endless platitudes , but the fact remains that its advice - if shallow - is rock solid . Every manager thet reads this book will be rude about it , but very manager SHOULD read this book and , despite their predictable rudeness , will go away with some simple and valuable points that are worth remembering . When I first read it ( back in the Middle Ages sometime ) I hated it , hated its style and hated the sense that I was being patronised . But I have found , over the years , that its message has stuck and that its fundamentals do apply to the real world of management much more than many " worthier " tomes .
4 #### This is another book that was a textbook for my first class at Siena Heights University . My professor made it amusing with the comment that it could be read in one sitting on the toilet . In fact , the only real problem I have with it is the idea of showing you value people if you really do n't . Other than that , it is brutally effecient .
5 #### Oh , what timeless positives have n't already been said about this Eastman classic ( Wish I had the publishing rights ! ) . A great book for the 2 - 4 yr . old kiddies learning to read , and for the parents to read to their kids too . Addictive , clever writing , and always fun . Thank you , P.D.
5 #### I am 58 years old . This magical book has a hold on my heart . If I have grandchildren , this will be read to them by me . I still recite my favorite lines from it .
5 #### Addition to grandchilds book collection , great product great price !
4 #### It 's a cute book and a fun read , asks kids at end about what they 'd do to teach them about responsibility and safety , etc .. It 's a bit long for toddlers but most will hold their attention , as usual the pictures from Seuss 's books are attention grabbing .
5 #### Thing is , there are guns in this book - pop - guns , but it still runs so counter to our politically correct culture . How can the cats use guns in a children 's book , I kept thinking , almost against my will as I was reading it to my three - year - old daughter . Ca n't this scar her somehow or make her violent . Then I realized how silly that thought is . I read it when I was five and somehow grew to be an adult without killing anyone . This book is great fun and manages to teach the alphabet while it 's at it . Of course , Dr. Seuss does n't need my help to sell books .
5 #### The Cat in the Hat at first glance may seem like a nonsensical text meant merely to amuse its readers . If you stop and ponder this story of two children left at home alone one afternoon , you soon realize there is a more powerful message than first meets the eye . The children clearly know the difference between right and wrong , but with the slightest influence from the Cat , they easily give in . I believe the fish represents their conscience . They choose to ignore its warning time and again , and therefore , find themselves in a mountain of mess . Before the story 's end , they are able to right the wrongs , but we as readers are left with this thought and question : " Then our mother came in and she said to us two , " Did you have any fun , tell me what did you do ? " Should we tell her about it ? Now what SHOULD we do ? What would you do if your mother asked you ? " ( Seuss , 60 - 61 ) .
5 #### It was very late one weekday night , My sleep was restless so I turned on the light . I was looking for something ... something to read , But what on earth would fill such a need ? I searched high and I searched low for just the right title , Would it be literature ? Would it be non - fiction ? How about the Bible ... I wanted something fun ... something light ... something easy And then I came across the gift I was given when I was just three ... The Cat in the Hat , such a delightful tale No matter how many times I read it It never seems stale So I sat on the couch and turned the old pages , Wishing my wife were awake so we could both laugh , ( Cuz laughter 's contagious ) But I persevered and continued to read Feeling and knowing I had met my heart 's need . I put the book on the shelf in its place A smile still stretched on my happy face I went back to bed with that smile still on And quietly slept until the new morning dawned .
5 #### This is such a fun clever book . I love to read it to my son . The story gets so exciting- the only problem is it has so much going on in it that some times I think it is not good to read it before bed time . Because if you get too into the characters it could wake your kid up . Love it !
5 #### The children loved this book . I liked reading it to them too , though I was always a bit disturbed by it . The cat -in- the hat 's entering the house and making disorder everywhere was if i remember rightly , made amusing by the rhyming humorous language . This was one of the children 's books that did not simply fascinated but amused . Perhaps too children identify with the cat - in- the- hat 's total defiance of adult order and rule . He comes into the house when the parents of the children are away , and from then on proceeds to take all a part . The way he rapidly cleans it up before they come home , I think too speaks to children . They have done something forbidden , defied the order of the world , and yet gotten away with it . I will admit reading this always made me a bit uneasy . But again the language , the excellent illustrations made for delight . And the children loved it .
5 #### My neice loves it . Loved it as a child too .
4 #### Thought I was getting a more average sized book , but this one is pretty small . Otherwise the book is good .
5 #### In my top - ten classic children 's books list . We still quote this one as adults at my house . " I like it ! I like that party hat ! "
5 #### This was my sons ultimate favorite book ! He used to get so excited when I read this to him . I purchased this book for Christmas for him , but he s 24 . Its something to remember . I m sure hell still be surprised . One of my favorite dr . Seuss books with PD Eastman ! !
5 #### This book is a classic . I absolutely loved it as a child so I buy it for all the kids in my life . This book arrived in great condition and is exactly as advertised .
5 #### My toddler lived this book . It was easy for him to remember and repeat the words .
5 #### This is a very short book , but very precise in describing what a good manager looks like . I wish more people would read it ! !
5 #### This book is a must read for everyone whether they are a boss , parent or just someone who is interested in becoming more effective in their life . This book as well as the others by these authors ( " The Present " and " Who Moved my Cheese " ) contain powerful messages with an economy of words , they are all around 100 pages each . I have read everything I can find by them and have shared them with family and friends .
4 #### The book is great . My first advice : do n't start reading or listening to it without some papers and a pen . Why ? Because you will get some interesting ideas . Those ideas and notes will help you to create a method and after that will be easier to start being a " one minute manager " . I bought the audio book version . It just takes 1 hour 40 minutes . The reader is very good .
2 #### Another business book from bestseller list . Does it really help your vision ? I do not think so . It is simple , well written , easy to read book . But , I did not get anything from it . If you have really have time , go ahead and read it . By the way , it takes only 45 minutes to finish it .
5 #### Excellent book -- one of my faves as a child . My granddaughters love it !
3 #### I did n't realize when I bought this that it 's abridged for the board book . I would rather have the full story version .
5 #### My brother , sister and I , now in our 60s , can not try on a hat without quoting , Do you like my new hat ? and then responding , No , I do not like that hat . Our children all know this book and now I have the pleasure of purchasing it for my first grandchild . Go around again !
5 #### I like the story because the dogs were going fast . I like the dogs and the hats and the party on the tree .
5 #### My favorite childrens book all growing up , and still is !
3 #### This book is great for young children learning to read . The words in it are n't very hard and it has some childish humor . The rhyming that Dr. Seuss incorperates into his books is very catchy .
5 #### What else can you say about the Cat in the Hat ? It has been entertaining children for years and it still is . I have 2 children that visit regularly . They are 1 1/2 and 4 and whenever they catch me sitting down , they grab a Dr. Seuss book and head for my lap .
1 #### This is a put - down to the Spanish language . It is literally translated- word - for - word , and obviously that does not work with any kind of translation . The translator has to use his / her discretion to transmit the message through whatever type of medium they are working with . In this case , Dr. Seuss 's writing is playful and rhyming- this translation does not do this book any justice . They should really never have published this . Even as a non - native speaker of Spanish , I know that this translation is not well - done . My suggestion-- go read " Huevos verdes con jamon " , which is wonderful .
1 #### Not only does this lose all the wit and charm of the original , it 's not even very good as a Spanish primer . I ca n't imagine a real Spanish speaker using this kind of convoluted syntax . If you 're looking for a fun Spanish children 's book to read , then " Huevos Verdes con Jamon " ( Green Eggs and Ham ) is a much better choice , as well as many of the other Aida Marcuse translations . If what you want is a good vocabulary - builder transliteration , try the Spanish versions of P.D. Eastman 's Books ( " Corre , Perro Corre ! " or " Eres tu Mi Mama ? " ) . Anything but this .
2 #### Before you buy this book -- use the " view it online option " . As the conflicting opinions point out : 1 ) It has neither rhyme nor rythm in Spanish ( e.g. , it is not a Dr. Seuss book but a literal translation . 2 ) If you want a faithful translation it seems to do that My opinion : There are plenty of parallel , side by side , etc . story books and the fun of Seuss is lost . But if you LOOK at the view it online , then you can decide if it meets your needs .
5 #### We like the characters in this book , especially the talking fish . The kids should never have let anyone or anything in their house while their mom was gone . It was fun to hear and to say the rhyming words and it helped us learn to read . You can read this book over and over again and it will still be fun .
4 #### The issue is that most of the managers are not effective . The conclusion is that if you use the One Minute technique , you can become very effective . The One Minute technique is : One Minute Goal setting- Take time to set major goals as that the employee knows what needs to be done . One Minute Praising- Praise your employees by catching them doing the RIGHT thing One Minute Reprimand- First reprimand the BEHAVIOR , Second encourage the PERSON ( shake hands ) There are examples given to explain each point . This books is a bestseller because of it 's simplicity . But subsequent books by the authors have acknowledged the need of more than the above 3 items . It is good in theory but it 's practice demands much more .
5 #### This book is great and I gave it as a baby shower gift . Great book to read to kids and later to have the kids read to you once they are learning to read . The book arrived quickly and was in great shape .
5 #### My six - year - old grandson is learning to read and is VERY proud that he can read this book himself , plus it is fun . A classic that has been around for a long time , it remains a total child - pleaser .
5 #### Great book for little kids , plus I wanted another copy to keep on screened in porch where kids love to sleep next to each other on foam mattresses , giggling together under their favorite quilts . I take their picture , and show them the " dog bed " page in this delightful children 's book .
5 #### Always a great book , to read again and again ! To read to children , to to read by children and to be read by adults for their own pleasure . Dr Seuss set out to teach children how to read painlessly and I believe he succeeded . His books are a perennial delight . The narrator , his sister sally , the Cat and the fish are all great characters , and the story , like the words , stays in the mind as one of the great things of childhood .
4 #### With the Universal Studios movie just out , my fondness of cats and a work mate who affirmed , " if you have n't read Dr. Seuss , you have missed on one of the most wonderful childhood literary experiences " ; I decided I would pick one of his books on my next visit to Borders . That was this afternoon . The result ? It 's simply brilliant . " The cat in the hat " presents children not only a wonderful chance for learning to read , but with the possibility of having fun at no one else 's expense . When feelings do n't get hurt , no one ends up unhappy . The two children enjoy what would otherwise have turned into a dull rainy day thanks to presence of the magical cat . He does make a mess of things , but in the end he knows when to stop and ... PICKS UP AFTER HIMSELF . ( Young children , listen ! ) The wonder of the book is not that the mom will not be upset at the mischief her children have produced when she comes back , but it lies in fact that the children have ownership of their own private world . The fun they had is their own little secret . No one knows or has to know . And the ending ? Well , I can just imagine a child 's face when the story gets read to them and the parent goes : " What would you do if your mother asked you ? "
5 #### The Cat in the Hat is , quite frankly , the bomb . Period . Being a professional cartoon reviewer and monitor in my free time and the founder of Stop the Violence in Cartoons Foundation , I feel refreshingly reassured that at the end of a long hard day at school(it 's where I work as a custodial engineer ) that I can come home and read this engaging tale to my youngsters . After cleaning up pungent excrement , piss and vomit at work all day long , The Cat in the Hat provides a most welcome breath of fresh air(pun intended ) . Keep it up Dr. Seuss !
5 #### Have you ever had a cat visit your house and make a BIG mess while your mother was gone ? Well , the kids in this book have ! I do n't need a cat to make MY room all messy , it is messy enough already !
5 #### Is there a short , easy - to - read management book that can be really useful to the businessman but also helpful for the housewife and in the conduct of family affairs ? Is it possible to squeeze into 100 pages enough valuable information so that it serves a multiple audience and could even be a guide for raising children ? This book is based on techniques occupying one minute . Concentrating on three core issues , the author first concentrates on goals . In the business world goals would probably be getting more bang for the buck or more widgets per shift or greater efficiency ; in the home goal setting can start with children making the bed , keeping the bedroom tidy or clearing up afterwards . Goal setting is only successful if both parties buy into it - boss and employee or parent and child . Agreeing on objectives , expressing them concisely as bullet points , and setting a time frame may take more than a minute but they can be reviewed rapidly and without dispute . The other two core issues - praise or reprimand - follow naturally and each party knows in advance what it will be . There are no surprises . You can easily read this book and map out your strategy in an evening . It is difficult to imagine that anyone could not find this book helpful in some part of their life .
4 #### After the 60 's and 70 's , the terms reinforcement and punishment held negative cultural connotations that seemed to equate people with Pavlov 's dog . Blanchard and Johnson 's One Minute method presented scientifically validated behavioral psychology in a way that managers of the time could feel comfortable with . Thus , if you apply these ideas , you will not sound like a psychologist circa 1950 . Instead , you 'll sound like a Politically Correct 1980 's management consultant . Despite its age , the method is simple -you can read it in half an hour- yet extremely powerful . First , define the behaviors or results you want ( One Minute Goal Setting/ Activator ) , then let your reports go out and perform . During the performance , you offer reinforcement in two forms , positive or negative . Catch someone doing good , you give them a One Minute Praising ( positive reinforcement ) . Catch a report doing something bad , you give them a One Minute Reprimand ( punishment/ negative reinforcement ) . The result is classic operant conditioning and behavior shaping . I use the concepts in this book regularly . They are simple and very effective . Once you know where you want people to go , the behavior shaping methods presented in this book will likely get your team there , and quickly . One Minute Managing is a surefire way to increase the quantity of actions which add value , while minimizing those which detract . I would recommend Aubrey Daniels ' ` Bringing out the Best in People , ' which goes into operant conditioning in more depth , as a very solid companion for this book .
4 #### This Johnson / Blanchard collaboration is one of the most synergistic and powerful of the Blanchard stable of management books . The principles are simple and may come across as intuitively obvious for most seasoned managers looking for motivational techniques for their charges . However , these time - tested techniques of appropriate praising and reprimands are often not applied in a timely enough fashion to achieve their maximal effect on staff and colleagues . As a result , managers sometimes wonder why their efforts fall short of producing tangible results . The authors seek to provide the Why s to the application of these techniques . This serves as powerful reminder to managers that although there is a price to pay in order to be a One - Minute Manager , there is a bigger price to pay if we do not become One - Minute Managers . The bigger price of course is the loss of the privilege to manage talents under our charge . This book deserves 4 stars for its creative , succinct parable - led coaching style which has served the readers well . It is true to its title of One Minute - Short , straight to the point , immediately applicable .
5 #### If you ca n't role model , you certainly ca n't expect others to participate in your surpassing your responsibiities . This is a small book , with a big message " Demonstrate that you are listening to each person who you want to influence to perform , on your behalf . " In one minute do you set a goal that all participants understand and voluntarily follow ? Do you also praise others in one minute ? What about reprimands - yes , one minute ? When you 've mastered this you do n't feel compelled to press against anyone 's mind . You also expand what Napoleon Hill called the benefit of your mastermind .
4 #### I had put off reading this book because of the idea that management ca n't occur in one minute . Wrong . While it takes much longer to become a good manager , the tiny minutes in a day gives us ample opportunity to manage people for positive results . This book is n't rocket science . It 's written in Ken Blanchard 's sensible , easy to read parable format that makes it as much fun to read as it is insightful . Managers , whether aspiring , new or old - hands will find something that challenges them to be better working with their people . I suggest you make it required reading for your management staff .
5 #### This is an excellent book for teaching simple communications in a typical business environment . The main theme is to provide meaningful communication immediately when an employee act is to be praised or criticized . The idea is to have an immediate association between the praise or blame so that much time does not pass between your recognition of the critical behavior and the quick assessment and communication of it . In rapid succession , the author poses many typical scenarios and the optimal response to the observed behaviors . This book can help you to assess critical behaviors so that corrective action can be taken at a point in time when you have the most control .
3 #### My whole family is a huge fan of the original of this book , and it 's become a tradition for us to buy a copy every time friends or family have a new baby . When I saw it available as a board book , I thought it would be a great option for little ones to handle . The description says it is abridged , and it is , but we are disappointed at what did n't make the cut . ( no party hats ? ! ) So , while it is a cute book for a little one , it does n't hold a candle to the original full copy . Wo n't order this again ( and actually , I ordered the full copy anyhow and the next baby is getting both versions ) . For those who do n't care about the content as much , it 's cute and sturdy and pages will easily wipe clean from sticky little fingers .
5 #### A favorite book for the learning to read child . Used in my therapy dog library visits . Kids love this silly book .
4 #### Don Juan , the hero of the Battle of Lepanto , conceived an idea for the invasion of England and got King Phillip 's approval . He drew up plans for the invasion and then died . Phillip appointed the Duke of Medina Sidonia to lead the invasion , and thus set the stage for one of the greatest naval disasters of all time . Some might argue that the venture would have turned out differently had the more capable Don Juan been in charge of the expedition , but Don Juan won his victory with galleys on an inland sea , whereas Medina Sidonia met defeat in galleons on the high seas . Howarth gives a catalog of problems , minor disasters , and inadequacies which Chester Nimitz might not have been able to overcome . The Spaniards had inferior Naval Doctrine , inferior ships , inferior cannon , inferior ammunition , and they were taking the battle to the English . Add to this some abominable luck , and they faced an almost insurmountable challenge . The English were inferior only in numbers , and they were fighting for their very existence . Howarth gives a compelling account of the disaster from the germ of Don Juan 's idea to the final landing of the defeated survivors . He critiques the Spanish effort fairly and insightfully . Anyone interested in the history of the Invincible Armada would find this book helpful .
5 #### A charming cat who does delightfully funny things on each page of rhyme and rhythm . The verses will remain into adulthood . Every child should have a copy of this enchanting little picture book , a must for the home library ! Evelyn Horan - teacher , counselor , author ...
5 #### This story is read on a nightly basis to my son at his bedtime .. He loves it ! For a long book like this , he actually sits still and is mesmerized by the pictures and that Cat in his Hat . Dr. Seuss was pure genius in the craft of writing for young children and there are scores of generations that appreciate his works . Simple words , rhyming times , and eye catching antics of the cat are all the ingredients to what makes this story work . He 's come back to visit the children from the first story , and proceeds to make a giant mess . We meet little cats A through Z , who are just as cute as can be . Then something called VOOM makes everything right . yes , it does . Then Mommy says goodnight . There is something about reviewing Dr. Seuss , that just makes me want to rhyme . This is a great addition to your child 's collection of books for years to come !
5 #### The cat in the hat is the most popular Dr. Seus book probably and it is a great teaching tool It taught me how to read . no wonder I was the first to read in my class ( I could read by preschool . Come on , the Cat in the Hat is perennial favorite for mostly all children . I have loved this book , and all Seus books since I ws very young . This book is highly reccomended as a gift to a little child . grade A+ ~Dan~
5 #### My kids gave me a copy of THE CAT IN THE HAT COMES BACK for my birthday a few years ago . I thanked them politely and that was that . Then I started reading it again for the first time in about 30 years . I was laughing out loud on almost every page ! I had forgotten how funny this story was . Or perhaps I just did n't get the humor when I was a kid . At any rate , this little book is now one of my all - time favorites , grown - up books included . --George Stancliffe
5 #### This is a very effective message in managing and communicating with people under your charge . It can be applied in any situation whether military or civilian . It 's more effectve when used in a small group in my opinion . You can see the one minute manager technique in action simply by watching shows like " ST : Next Generation " . Capt . Picard uses it consistantly throughout the series when reprimanding Worf or Data . It 's a short book and can be finished in one sitting . I remember to always give praise and encouragement after reprimanding someone . Works everytime ! !
5 #### A quick read because the concepts it describes are simple yet powerful . " The One Minute Manager " has evolved into a management classic since its first edition in 1981 . Managers will take three precepts from this book : Efficient Goal Setting with employees , Praise , and Reprimands . In other words , make sure your people know precisely what they are to do , and then give them feedback whether they meet those expectations or not . That 's it . Simple and effective . It takes an hour to read " The One Minute Manager " , consider it an investment .
5 #### I finally ordered this book to see for myself if all the hype was true . After reading through the pages very quickly ( it only took a couple of brief sittings ) , I was thoroughly impressed . Blanchard and Johnson truly have a classic here , a volume that fulfills its high expectations . The key to the success of this book is the combination of its simplicity and its practicality . Three lessons are given to managers : the one - minute goal , the one - minute praising , and the one - minute reprimand . The material is presented in a parable - like format , which makes the concepts even easier to grasp . I can not recommend this book highly enough . For the small price paid and the short time required to read it from cover to cover , it is a superb investment . If you are any type of leader or manager , READ THIS BOOK !
4 #### This is a good book for first - time managers . It 's short , quick and to the point . The biggest benefit is showing that reprimands and praise deserve equal time . Employees do n't grow if they do n't make mistakes , and some of the greatest learning opportunities come from reprimands followed by encouragement . Since the whole books takes about an hour to read , it 's well worth your time .
5 #### I have never had people working for me until recently , so I bought this book to help me get a handle on how to manage people . This book has given me so many great ideas and things to think about . It is simply written as a story . There 's nothing bad I can say about it .
5 #### Imagine a show where a whale suddenly emerges above the surface of the water , jumps over a rope to a thunderous applause from the audience who do n't mind being drenched by the splash of water . How was the whale trained to do this , one may wonder . The training had actually started under water , where the whale was rewarded with food each time it crossed over the rope . The rope was then gradually raised and the whale jumps over it even if is above the water level . Imagine the rope as the goal setting exercise in our organizations . We reward people for attaining their goals and we raise the bar every time to get the best out of every one . This book is about Goal Setting , Rewarding and Reprimanding . It also proves a very important concept . The normal confusion is that democratic managers sacrifice results while the result oriented managers sacrifice people . The One Minute Manager teaches us to be simultaneously good at achieving results and taking care of people .
3 #### Not what I expected . Should have done more research . VERY abridged version for VERY young readers .
5 #### My 6 yr old nephew loves this book ! He called me up from 2,000 miles away and read it to me . What fun ! He did a fantastic job !
5 #### ----TO SPEED READ THIS ! ! ! Seuss 's Rhymes are too addictive . It 's more enjoyable to read it slowly , listening to the rhymes . This book is also a good one for beginning readers to practice . They never lose interest . I 've got 8 children , and they all loved this one . --George Stancliffe
5 #### I grew up with Dr Suess books so I could n't wait to share them with my own children . The books are illustrated simply , the text is easy to read and creatively laid out and the silly rhymes make me and my children laugh . What I 've noticed from reading them Dr Suess books ( they are 1 and 2.5 years ) that it has really helped my 2.5 year old with increasing her vocabularly , saying words properly and recognising sounds that a letter or group of letters make . A wonderful series of books to read aloud to your children .
5 #### As a parent of a toddler , I occasionally find myself losing interest in some items in our collection , especially in those that my child wants me to read over and over . Not that I wo n't acquiesce , mind you , but some five - page works that are perhaps less imaginative than others are harder to approach with a high degree of enthusiasm . This book is not one of those . Thank goodness there is nothing in this book ( written decades ago ) that can in any way be deemed " politically incorrect . " While my experience is solely with a two - and - a - half year old , I assume that this book would be interesting for older children , and is also geared to those learning to read . I can remember the animated feature that used to run on CBS every year ( probably thirty years ago ) , but the book is far better . It is the tale of a cat who attempts to provide entertainment to a couple of children on a rainy day . A terrible mess is made in the process , but the Cat in the Hat " always picks up his playthings , " and I believe parents can get some use out of this desirable character trait evident in the titled feline . The Suess rhymes and rhythms are terrible fun , and I have have yet to tire of them . It keeps the attention of my two year old , which is pretty good for a book of this length . The pictures , while a bit bland , are amusing . I recommend the purchase of this classic .
2 #### The Spanish portion of this book does n't rhyme . I have seen other Dr. Seuss books in Spanish that do . This one is a direct translation of the English . I think it would have been a lot more effective to stray from the English enough to make the Spanish rhyme too !
5 #### This book is fantastic , of course . I ca n't say anything bad about it , except that THIS BOOK WILL EAT YOUR BRAIN . After reading it a couple times a night for weeks on end , I found myself * thinking * in rhyme . Everything I read entered my head in a rhyming rhythm ! I could n't stop ! It will drive you nuts , but at the same time it is funny . It 's only fair to warn your friends and family beforehand . Every time it rains you will think " I know it is wet / And the sun it not sunny / But we can have lots of good fun / That is funny " ! This book is a great way to start discussions with your kids about emotions and how their actions make other people feel .
4 #### Reward or punishment ! Is this politically correct now - a - days . You bet not , but the idea is worth looking at and thinking about . There are some interesting ideas contained in the very short read . It will provide the beginning manager with a good base to develop their own style , but should n't be copied outright . The words " reward " and " punishment " should be re - worked so as not to offend those PC fanatics who can not deal with older thinking . Also , comparing the trreatment of personnel to that of training a dog , well , it does n't play well anywhere . I say give this book a read . Find some concepts that you can think about , and see if they can be applied to your present situation . If you spend more than 2 hours reading it , I 'd be surprised . Use it as a brainstorming tool , not a How To book .
4 #### The one minute manager is a bit of an anachronism now ... when it was first published this book seemed simplistic - with recent research being published you 're going to find the notion of ' a minute here ' and ' a minute there ' is simply not enough for the needs and motivations of different staff . While the advice in this book is fine and you can only benefit by reading it do n't assume that this book has any real answers for real mangement issues . Any movement beyond docile staff who are satisfied with a one minute word of encouragement or ' feedback ' is beyond the depth of this book .
4 #### There are three simple precepts , which the One Minute Manager establishes with his employees : One Minute Goal Setting , One Minute Praisings , and One Minute Reprimands . This makes the basics of the book very simple to understand . I was quite stunned to find the content extremely useful . Strangely the simplicity of the book is deceiving . This book is good for those that are looking for a quick read and who are either currently managing people or wanting to manage people . Goal setting is all about making sure employees understand perfectly what their duties are , what is expected of them and that there are no surprises . The Praisings and Reprimands are simply managers acknowledging that the employees are doing there jobs or not and how to deal with the situation and how to convey it to the employee . In my opinion the book is pretty good but I think everyone should read Leadership and the One Minute Manager rather than this book as Leadership is essential and it is what differentiates great companies from good ones . The key , like most books that are self - help , is to apply these principles each and every day . Catch yourself when you slip and find ways to incorporate them into your value system .
3 #### my son LOVED the original Go Dog Go so we were very disappointed when this arrived to find it was a modified version . Nice size book but wish there was a mention that it was different .
5 #### My 18 month old grandson just loves this book . He asks for it to be read to him over and over again . He just laughs each time on the last page .
5 #### I got home to my Baby ready to read . He loves dogs and his was a perfect fit .
5 #### This has been a favorite in our house for years .
1 #### I received this movie yesterday for my niece and viewed it before giving it to her . I was VERY DISAPPOINTED . All it was was the book being read to me . No animation , just scans of the book . I can read the book to her and have more enthusiasm than the person on the tape and I can have the quality time with her . IT IS NOT EVEN WORTH THE SHIPPING LET ALONE THE PRICE OF THE TAPE .
5 #### " In a world gone horribly wrong , full of giant mutant cats attired in fancy costumes , baring boxes full of horrendous oddities , and overly dictative talking fish ... a young boy and his sister Sally , find themselves trapped , and under the spell of the want to do bad things!" ..... that 's how the movie trailer would read anyways . In reality .... this is the classic book that nearly every child , and adult should read , or have read to them . Two children left at home by their mother , on a boring rainy day , and told to behave . Enter the Cat In The Hat .... who 's goal in life , seems to be doing anything but behaving ! The childrens goldfish is the voice of reason , but he is easily out voted , by the want to have " fun " . But as we learn , fun that is without boundries , is fun that causes trouble ! I remember this book as a child , and we all delighted in a Cat in a Hat , but how soon we would wish we were as smart as a fish ! A great read for ALL , and a must for any childs library .
5 #### The Cat in the Hat is one of the best childrens books ever written for one basic reason ; it 's fun ! Sally and her brother are left home one day when their mother has to run out . Suddenly walking up the driveway comes The Cat in the Hat . And what a mess he makes . Inviting himself into the house a breaks plates , gets food all over the place , and much , much more . He then brings out of his hat Thing 1 and Thing 2 accompanied then by a lot more Things . They make an even better mess jumping into the goldfish bowl , breaking more plates , and banging pots and pans . Then all the Things go back in the hat and magically everything is put back to normal as the mother gets home . So there you have it . The Cat in the Hat is a great book that will be loved by all . Be sure to pick this one up and enjoy . HAPPY READING !
5 #### Dr. Seuss 's " The Cat in the Hat " is one of the great classics of children 's literature . I 'm sure that a less daring author would have left well enough alone . But the good Dr. Seuss had the nerve to write a sequel ! And , I 'm happy to say , " The Cat in the Hat Comes Back " matches the subversive lunacy and imaginative wit of the Cat 's first adventure . The story begins with our narrator , the same little boy from the original " Cat , " shoveling snow with his sister Sally . And , as in the first book , the Cat in the Hat arrives to turn their dull day topsy - turvy . But this is no retread of the first book . The wily Cat has some new tricks to share , and some new friends to introduce to us . Little Cat A , Little Cat B , and the rest -- including some brilliant surprises -- are wonderful additions to the " Cat " mythos . As in the original , the book has some unsettling nuances . Why are these kids home alone ? Just what is that bizarre pink substance in the bathtub ? But leave it to the psychologists and literary critics to debate the possible hidden meanings of the book ; kids will enjoy the delightful rhymes and wacky illustrations . Congratulations , Dr. Seuss : you have shown that the sequel to a classic can be just as excellent as the beloved original !
5 #### Dr Sues books are great for beginner readers . They use sight words , word family words , and descriptive pictures to read along . I would suggest this for any child after learning sight words . letter sounds and blending .
5 #### Ha ! A classic that every kid needs to have on the bookshelf .
5 #### Great quality on the cover and pages , got this classic for my niece and she really loves it .
1 #### This is my little one 's favorite book ! So when her copy got left out in the rain we had to replace it . I have recieved 3 different copies of this book trying to get one that looks the way it should with no luck . The colors are off as you can see in the pictures . Normally this would n't be such a big deal but when you are reading to a toddler and tell them the stop light is red but really it 's orange that can be pretty confusing . It appears that during the printing process something happened to the red pigment . All the red / orange colors are wrong . I compared the colors of the board book to the regular book so you can see what it should look like . I 'm disappointed and a bit annoyed with the whole ordeal . We will be returning the book ( for the 3rd time ) and purchasing it from somewhere else .
5 #### This book is astonishing . Teachings on leadership is truly applicable . Short book and story telling format allows one to read it in 1 minute and apply it right away ! Take it to action people ! I never thought this book would be helpful but it changed my perspective on managing people . At home or bussiness , this book contains infinite wisdom on how to make people truly happy and enjoy what they do . Whether you are a parent of a single child or an older brother of your family , this book will surely help you to bring your families and friends to happiness and success . " Be strict to yourself and only to yourself and mellow with others around you . " Enjoy ! !
4 #### If you ca n't take something directly from THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER to make you a better manager , you can take something from it and modify it . Maybe in reality your company ca n't run efficiently on the " one - minute " theory . But you could on a " five - minute " or " ten - minute " concept . Even that adjustment would cut down on the wasted prodution during those " costly " meetings . When I first looked at the book , I thought it too small to be efficient . However , this is a case of " good things come in small packages " being real . It 's a very interesting , though controversial book .
5 #### Bought the book for a management study group after having read it several years ago . Excellent tool for new managers . Easy reading in parable format . Lots of follow - up work available by Blanchard and others .
4 #### I love the simplistic yet important messages the authors project . A worthwhile read . Staff members require direction , support and responsibility ... and they / we will surprise .
4 #### Wonderful book . This has really helped me to perfect my management skills . Easily explained so that anyone can understand . Read it , you wo n't regret it .
2 #### After have been hearing about this book I was expecting something better . A couple of common sense ideas , nothing new . Obviosly a manager should be able to get the best from their people and that is only possible if you really rely on them and consider them able to supply ideas and knowledge . I can not understand how this book has so much hype . A couple of days after reading nothing new remained in my mind .
5 #### One might be tempted to say that the steps outlined in this book are " common sense " . But it 's full of wisdom I had not been using in my managerial position . And I know hundreds of other bad managers . This book is a gem . It 's ideas are simplly presented and simply apprehended but amazingly powerful . It 's no quick fix , though : you have to work at it to get results . A must for ever manager . It fits well with new - fangled ideas of organizational structure presented by Drucker , Peters , and other gurus .
5 #### Dr. Seuss was one of those rare creative geniuses who both entertained us and challenged us to open our minds . " The Cat in the Hat " is an indispensable part of the Seuss canon . A bizarre blending of Seuss 's trademark illustrations with an eerily Kafkaesque plot , " Cat " will delight both children and adults . The plot is simple : The narrator , a small boy , is left home on a rainy day with his sister Sally . But their boring day is interrupted by the Cat in the Hat , a weirdly anthropomorphic , talking feline who proceeds to turn their house into a chaotic playground . The illustrations -- think Salvador Dali meets Beatrix Potter -- are marvelous . This book is simple enough for beginning readers , yet full of subtle touches that could keep an army of literary critics and psychologists busy analyzing it for decades . And that is the brilliance of Dr. Seuss . Buy a copy of the book for your favorite child , buy a second for your favorite adult , and keep a third for yourself .
2 #### The literal , word - for - word translation destroys the flavor and fun of this classic . See Aida Marcuse 's translations to see what can be done with Seuss by someone who puts in a bit of effort . It is not hard to rhyme spanish !
1 #### Deservedly out of print . The spanish translation does not do justice to the story , being a literal word - by - word translation that destroys the rhythmic , poetic character of Seuss 's classic . Likely to make a child think English is fun , lively language and Spanish a dull , pedantic one .
5 #### This book is great ! The children in this story are certainly in a mess with this wild and eccentric visitor in their home while their parents are away . The story holds a readers interest even as an adult , and is complete fun from beginning to end . No childhood is complete without the cat in the hat ! Dynamite excitement ! Seuss created a masterpiece with this great children 's story . If you have n't read it , you should .
5 #### Sheer merryment . If anyone has ever read this book and not enjoyed it , they are n't really a human being ... Fun , easy to read , and entertaining for people of any age . The kids are n't bad kids .... it is the cat in the big floppy hat ..... When you 're little and first read this book , you then realize , yes , this cat could come-- but if he does , my parents wo n't believe me . And you realize , as such , do not let strangers into the house . Seeing so , it 's almost a moral tale in the tradition of Everyman ... your good deeds might never leave you .... and the memory of the cat wo n't either ....
5 #### High drama , thrills , spills , chills ... Uh , okay , not really . But if by some miracle you do not know of this book , perhaps if you have only recently learned English yourself , you really ought to know about it . It is so worth it . Everyone loves " The Cat in the Hat " , it is a major part of our culture , at least in terms of what culture we expose our children to . Very funny , very helpful as a beginning reader .
4 #### This book is as cute as the English version in its story line -- not in the flow of the language . Of course it does n't SOUND as good as in English -- it 's a direct translation ! It is entertaining nonethless and can make for great family bonding time in a bilingual household .
5 #### One of my favorites as a child . I was sorry this board book version cut out some of my favorite parts . Although in retrospect the girl dog continually changing hats to impress the boy dog is pretty foolish . Nevermind , I 'm giving this five stars after all . Cutting out that part actually makes it a better book for boys and especially girls . : )
5 #### Great children 's book a read again and again and again .
5 #### favorite book of my 44 year old son , his children and Nana Fast shipping Amazon is GREAT
5 #### I was a little disappointed when ' The One Minute Manager ' arrived in the mail and I saw its small size and large fonts . However , this tiny little fairy - tale is the best management book I 've read . I strongly recommend this book for managers in all fields , including professors in academia . ' The One Minute Manager ' takes less than an hour to read , and if you have any interest in becoming a better manager or a stronger leader , surely you can risk 60 minutes of your time ? The ideas are not contrived , artificial mechanisms that interfere with our natural personalities . Instead , the entire strategy can be implemented by following a few simple rules that feel natural and are easy to perform and maintain . Sound too good to be true ? Just try it ! A word of caution though , use of the strategy assumes the individuals on the manager 's team are intelligent , and the tools presented are designed to encourage subordinates to become more independent and responsible , not reliant on a manager 's approval , input or direction on minor decisions . Any manager who wants to be involved in all aspects of a project could n't possibly use the strategies of ' The One Minute Manager ' without driving his team nuts .
5 #### This book is required reading for the course I teach in educational methodology . The fact is that we all need to manage our interpersonal communications in an effective manner and both the ideas presented here and the manner in which they are presented exemplify how to do just that .
2 #### Do you have a good critical thought process ? If not , then perhaps you should not read this book . There are a few decent ideas in it , however , I found a great recommendation from another reader 's review : Read Dale Carnegie and Napolean Hill for more useful advice , techniques , and thought processes . Dealing with people is an art , not a science , and needs to be based upon an honest desire to assist others . Carnegie and Hill can help to develop those ideals .
1 #### What a pathetic and banal depiction of humanity . It 's nice to know that anybody with a pea - brain perspective on management can churn out a bestseller ; albeit sad to know that the brainless masses buy into it . Do yourself a favor and read Napoleon Hill and Carnegie for direction . This book is horrible .
1 #### Can anyone learn the complex art of management by reading fairy tales ? Probably not , and certainly not from this book . The book is the glib story of a manager who does almost no work . He isolates himself from his employees , forces them to make his decisions for him , and withholds useful information from them . On a regular basis , he manipulates their emotions through pre planned reprimands and praise . Bosses like the One Minute Manager exist in real life - the unproductive , poisonous managers who make everyone 's life miserable . In the story , of course , his employees display a cult like devotion to the him , and are eager to apply his techniques to their own hapless subordinates . The book is not a positive guide for managers , and is not recommended .
5 #### Think about it ... what author has most likely been read ( or read to ) by virtually every American Man , Woman or child ? This guy is a genius ! I enjoyed him as a kid and I still enjoy him now . I consider The Cat in the Hat to be one of the greatest existential books of all time . P.S. Thing One and Thing Two are the quintesential anarchists .
5 #### well , i do n't know what some of you may think , but the cat in the hat comes back is truly magnificent . little cat a and b and c ! by the end , you too will be in the land of pink cakes and $ 10.00 shoes ( supposedly expensive ) and most of all , that hat wearing cat . the idea is sheer brilliance ! it is n't far from genius .
3 #### Recently bought this for my daughter after she loved Cat In The Hat . However , I do n't find the story anywhere as inspired and the rhyming is weaker . It 's a pity he left out the fish . The proof is in the pudding : my daughter requests The Cat In The Hat more , followed by Green Eggs and Ham .
5 #### One of the times I like the board book better than the full length original . We love reading this book . It 's cute , has fun pictures , and a nice little story line . My 1 year old and 5 year old both love it .
5 #### My 6 year old loves this book also . Great book for beginners learning to read
5 #### This is a great classic and one of our children 's favorites . They all enjoyed it so much the each had it memorized .
5 #### This was my very favorite book as a child . Me and my brother would read it over and over and over . What was most appealing were the wonderful illustrations throughout the book . This is for very young children just learning to read . The pictures will keep them coming back again and again . I am delighted that this is still available today . I have given this as gifts to friends for their children .
5 #### My granddaughter and her papa Matt read this often
5 #### This is a classic . It covers the three essential elements of being a high - speed and efficient manager . I also like the " business story " format . In fact when I wrote " The Virtual Entrepreneur " ( BPRI Press , 1999 ) , I specifically decided to write a business fable due to my favorable experience with " The One Minute Manager . " Thanks !
5 #### THIS BOOK IS REQUIRED READING FOR ALL OUR MANAGERS WE FOUND THIS TO BE A BASIC , EASY TO READ AND APPLY DESK REFERENCE . THEY IS ALOT YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS BOOK AND APPLY TO YOUR BUSINESS AND HOME LIFE . ANOTHER GREAT BOOK THAT CAN TAKE YOU TO THE NEXT LEVEL IS THE 2000 PERCENT SOLOUTION . THIS IS ALSO AN EASY TO READ , EVERYDAY USEFUL BOOK
5 #### This is a no - nonsense book . The book is simply written , concise and walks you through the whole " one - minute " manager process . It is enjoyable and you walk out with some practical tools in your hand . Enjoy ! and share it with those who you care for and especially those " don't - care " ones !
5 #### This book is now going into the third generation of our family
5 #### Funny for toddlers , with additional visual and verbal to be done by the reader .
5 #### Love this coloring book . There are a variety of different kinds of pages to color . Mandalas , nature , etc . It is relaxing and I love it !
5 #### Best kids book ever . It 's a classic for a reason ! My kids LOOOOVVE it . When we 're in the car my 3 year old says " Go dogs go ! The light is green ! " and when asked her opinion on something instead of saying yes or no she says " I do like it ! " or " I do n't like it ! " just like in the book . Haha . Its been fun and educational for them . If I only bought 5 books ever for my little kids , this would be one of them .
4 #### Overall , good book . However , the word ' goodbye ' is spelled incorrectly throughout the book
5 #### I love this book . And so has every kid I have read it to
5 #### This charming book is not just for beginning readers but for the little ones who are leaning verbal concepts and love hats .
5 #### Great book from my childhood and I bought 4 the same day Go Dog Go , Put me in the zoo Cat and the hat and One Fish Two fish Thank you for all my great memories of my Mom reading these books to me as a child Thank You soooo much .
4 #### I like this abridged edition because my grandson will try to " read " it to me . However , I 'll have to buy the complete edition to read to him because this one is missing some really funny parts .
3 #### Well , it 's a cute book , but it is n't the original and beloved " Go Dog Go " that I remembered . But the board book itself it a great size for small hands , and the new version is a fun read - it 's just not the original .
5 #### I read this to my 11 - month - old grandson every night for weeks and he loved it . It was the only time he 'd sit quietly in my lap ! Now that I 'm back home his parents read it to him before bed . When my kids were 3 and 4 it was the most requested bedtime story . Babies have the same reaction to the board book .
5 #### I always loved Dr. Seuss as a child . Now I want my grandchildren to enjoy them . I plan on having a substantial Seuss library for when the grandkids visit , so of course I am not nearly finished collecting . So I will just continue to enjoy my Seuss expansion .
2 #### This board book is an ABRIDGEMENT of the real book ! The classic " Do you like my hat ? " scenes are n't even mentioned . Spend the extra 2 bucks and get the real thing .
2 #### I was very disappointed to find this book is NOT the Go , Dog , Go ! story we all grew up with . I will keep it and read it to my grand daughter but I 'm not terribly happy about it and WILL go find the whole story . I guess they thought a toddler would n't have the attention span necessary to sit through the whole version . UGH ! Just not true ! Even if they got distracted , that 's part of their learning process . I wish I had n't bought this one .
5 #### all of my kids love this book . all of them have it memorized . the oldest is 8 and the youngest is 2 . they beg for this book OFTEN .
5 #### A Classic DR . Seuss that my 5 year old son loves and wants to hear over and over and over again .
5 #### My son 's favorite book as a child . Now his twin sons ' favorite book .
5 #### This is yet another great book by Dr. Seuss . It is pretty small , but my baby likes it because she can hold it .
5 #### Not as good as the whole story , but a good choice for a newborn up to maybe three years , depending .
5 #### My four year old grandson loves reading this book .
4 #### I enjoyed this book . It had some third person insights that her autobiography could not contain . It also had many quotes from her husbands autobiography than rounded out her life 's story nicely . It is somewhat repetitive for those of us who have already read all of her books and her life story , but Charles Osbourn did manage to give me some further insights into her work . This work includes not only her life story , but also a lot of information about her books . It does NOT include how any of her books end , lest it ruin any of her books for any of the readers who have not read all of her works . This would be a fine addition to any Agatha Christie library .
5 #### I have read this countless times to my toddler . His bedtime requests always excitedly start with Go Dog Go ! I do n't get irritated reading it over and over either . It 's a fun , rhyming , learning , engaging book to share with your little one .
5 #### A classic . I loved it when I was younger and now my son does as well . The drawings are so fun and silly . My son cracks up when he reads it . This book is also great for teaching simple prepositions .
5 #### And I do like your hat ! I do , I do ! Who does n't love it ? ! ?
5 #### Amazing , and if you learned to read using this book , and have occasion to reread it years later , it is chuckle worthy . Definitely get the original version that has n't been changed .
5 #### Family favorite . Less of a headache to read than other Dr. Seuss books . My daughter requests it every night .
5 #### BEST CHILDREN 'S BOOK EVER WRITTEN . Not only is " Go , Dog , Go ! " a great book for kids , in the simplicity of the text , picture cues , context clues and how it teaches opposites , but it is highly palatable for the adult reader who will be asked to read it over and over and over again . I 've got this book memorized and I never get sick of reciting it . Best book ever .
5 #### My 4 year ol autistic great grandson loves to hear this story . My 4 year old autistic great grandson loves to hear this story . My 4 year old autistic great grandson loves to hear this story .
5 #### This was my sons favorite book when he was little so I bought it for a friend 's baby shower . It 's thick hard pages , so they do n't get torn by little fingers and you can write a note inside for a gift that wo n't get destroyed on the paper . Love these books !
5 #### In good condition and I bought it as a gift for my grown son who said it was always his favorite book as a child and our other book was in shreds . He was happy to get it .
5 #### My niece and nephew love when it 's story time . This is one of the more fun and up tempo books they have - for me to read to them and they love it ... I have to admit , so do I. Overall , a fun book to read ... Enjoy ! :)
5 #### My all time fav children 's book . I just bought a copy for my little one and he loves it too !
5 #### bought this for my son , he loves it . Its nicely sized for him and can withstand him tossing them everywhere .
5 #### Our little one loves when I read this book . Always engaged and excited to pull it out for me to read out loud Not sure who loves it more our 19 month old or me
5 #### I purchased this for my one year old daughter . This used to be my favorite book when I was a child and wanted to make sure the tradition continued with my daughter . However , when I was out once looking for the book , I noticed that there is a new version of this book . I did not like or want this new version so began the search for the original . This is the original book . I would recommend this classic book be added to any child 's collection . Pros : 1 ) This is a classic book that should be in every child 's library . The story is appropriate for children of all ages . The words are simple and the story teaches children about diversity . 2 ) This is the original version of the book ; not the new version . Cons : 1 ) The only con is that this does not come in a board book version . My daughter tends to be rough on books when trying to turn the pages , and the pages of this book can rip . Overall , I highly recommend this book for all families .
5 #### Hilarious children 's book . My two year old granddaughter laughs every time I read it to her !
5 #### This is really a fun book to read to a child . My ( almost 3 year old ) kid hoarded this book for days enjoying it all by himself and would let us read it . Now that he has finally let us read it to him , he quotes it regularly . In addition to this book being fun to read , I really appreciate how many color words exist . I feel like it 's a really good book to teach different color . I also really like all the spatial references ( under , over , next to ) . My only beef is when a male and female dogs repeated dialogue about if he likes her hat . It 's probably just fun silliness , but every time I read it , I find my self trying to analyze why the female dog keeps asking " do you like my hat ? " Does she care if he likes her hat ? Why does she have so many hats ? Is she trying to impress him ? Does she just like hats ?
4 #### This is thn thick cardboard book still a great book but I Wanted the one from when I was a kid where the one dog in the center of the big bed was wide awake at night
5 #### I am a Speech Therapist and I use this book all the time to promote learning verbs and basic concepts ( up , down , fast , slow ) . The kids love this book and there is so much great language in it . A gold standard on my shelf .
5 #### Well done book about James Hunt . A study of a man of great contrasts whose life is a great story . Driven by many demons Hunt 's story is told in an entertaining but straightforward manner . Props out to Ron Howard.for reminding us about Hunt and Lauda .
5 #### If you love cars / racing , this is for you ! Excellent read on a guy who worked his way up .
4 #### Good book . Interesting guy . Not in to formula 1 but I would of been back in hunts day . They put their life on the line every weekend they went out . Heroic .
5 #### simply a very good book of racing and life
5 #### The book focuses heavily on Hunt 's childhood through 1976 , his main driving period . Well - written , informative , entertaining , seemingly all of Hunt 's blemishes are shown . Both friendship and competition with Lauda are realistically presented , as is Hunt 's childish , uncontrollable temper along with his will to drive and win . Very importantly , his fear is exhibited over and over . Some would say that Hunt was not a ' real ' driver , his fear confined him to one World championship then he left racing soon afterward . I 'm not sure about that judgement . Lauda was far more systematic and far less emotional , was seemingly more professional . Hunt could never avoid looking for a good time , Lauda was apparently focused on winning even off the race course . I enjoyed the book immensely but can not identify with Hunt 's style and ways and certainly wo n't ( superficially ) pass judgement . There are many different ways to race and win , and I would n't fault anyone for dropping out before losing life or limb .
5 #### I saw " Rush " and became fixated with Formula One and James Hunt and Niki Lauda .... What an incredible story ! And what a unique and fascinating character James Hunt was ! ! ! ! He truly fit into no particular " box " and his exploits both on and off the track are astounding ...... And what a hottie ! The photos are great and the story just could n't be better . A truly fun and amazing story and book .
5 #### Very enjoyable read . A bit of a look further into James Hunt 's life and into Formula 1 racing . Was intrigued by him after seeing the movie Rush . Books tend to give you a better view of the person away from the Hollywood condensed version .
4 #### Those old enough to have followed Formula 1 racing back in the 1970s will remember James Hunt as the care - free , impossibly good - looking driver who shocked and entertained the racing establishment with the flaky , bombastic Hesketh racing team , but also as the driver who became Formula One World Champion with McLaren after an epic battle with Niki Lauda . Hunt 's career was comparatively brief , and , though an athlete and workout fanatic , he died early at just 45 . After watching the movie " Rush " that mostly dealt with that epic 1976 rivalry between Hunt and Lauda , it was interesting to read Donaldson 's biography the entire story of Hunt 's life , from start to end . It 's interesting , enjoyable reading , though there are some overlaps and holes . Donaldson fairly portrays one of the most colorful personalities Formula 1 racing has ever seen , not shying away from covering stunning excess and behavior that no one might get away with today . But that , perhaps , was all part of the charm and mystique of the man .
3 #### It would be hard to write a boring book about James Hunt 's life but this gets close . Its thorough and complete but never gets under the skin of the man and left me wanting to know more about this complex character .
4 #### Donaldson , writer of the great Gilles Villeneuve biography , wrote another very good about the unfortunately relatively short life of British 1976 Formula One World Champion James Hunt . There is talking , even today , that James would not have been World Cha , pion had Niki Lauda not suffered his terrible accident at the Nurburgring . Maybe so . Bu the fact was that he was there , battling even when the Ferrari won a lot of the first races of the season . His deeds with the Hesketh team are now legendary His career as commentator along Murray Walker also was great . Sadly , his heart caught up with him , and he died of a stroke in hishone , when he was already living more healthy . Very good book , very good indeed .
4 #### James Hunt was a unique character in the world of Formula 1 . A newbie to Formula 1 used to the likes of Alonso and Hamilton will be amazed by Hunt 's shenanigans back in the 1970s . This book is a very well written and emphatic look at a life of a self man who lived his life HIS way . It traces his impoverished beginnings and shows several glimpses of a determined man who would face adversity after adversity and triumph at the end . You get glimpses of the demons that he was battling throughout his lie - his addictions , failed relationships , etc . It was a pity that the Hunt finally conquered them all only to die from a heart attack soon after . Hunt is perhaps best remembered for his partying ways but he ought to be remembered for his speed . To win a championship at a time when you had drivers like Lauda , Peterson , Scheckter , etc . is no small achievement . This is a very good biography - well worth a read if you are an F1 devotee .
3 #### I bought this book becuse I wanted to relive the era when car racing was fun . This book is too clinical for me , just what I would expect from an Englishman . Too much amateur psychology and not enough of the fun stuff .
4 #### I did n't know much about James Hunt before reading this book , though I am a fan of racing and F1 . The stories of his partying and success were the reason I bought the book , but the its focus on James ' entire life is what kept me reading . The author Donaldson does n't just report what happened but he does a great job developing James ' character through his entire life , by all accounts , accurately . I particularly enjoyed the abundance of his contemporaries ' viewpoints . I plan to read more of Donaldson 's biographies and have recommended him to friends and family .
5 #### This is such a simple and easy to read book , but my 2 yr old son just adores it ! We read it constantly ! It was a favorite of mine as a child , and it 's hard to beat this classic book ! It helps teach colors , opposites , basic counting , and basic words for new talkers . It seems so simple , but there really is a small bit of genius behind this .
5 #### 5 stars , P.D. Eastman is a Jedi Master of early readers , enough said .
5 #### We love this book , even though it 's not Dr. Seuss it is very much along those lines . It 's fast paced and very fun to read . Your little ones will love it !
5 #### It 's Go , Dog , Go ! A childhood favorite passed down for four generations . I think it speaks for it 's self :-)
1 #### Little content , ok art , but absolutely no reason to choose this over real kids ' books . And no reason to prolong this review .
5 #### A classic children 's book that is a kid - tested favorite . Great for gift - giving . Charming and fun .
5 #### I have many happy memories of reading and listening to my little sons read this book to me . They loved this book and so do I now . It is a fun book to start an early reader on and easy to conquer . The pictures are a lot of fun , too .
5 #### I read this to my kids when they were little , and now my grandkids . Kids love this book !
5 #### Classic book for kids of all ages . No complaints here !
5 #### My Grandsons loved the board book and when I realized it was n't the full version , I got this for them . They loved this more
5 #### This was my favorite book of this style as a kid , and the one that my mom taught me to read with . Turns out that it was my husband 's favorite too - awww ! I did n't realize that this was the baby version , since I was in a hurry and ordered quickly without reading the full description , so it 's not quite as fun as the full length version , but perfect for the baby shower gift , as it 's nice and sturdy of good quality chunky pages that look like they can survive a baby 's love , at least for a little while . This is a really cute book for an infant or very young child .
5 #### Read this book to my daughter over and over . I loved it . Timeless . So had to get it for my grandson . Delivery was perfectly on - time .
5 #### Oh , yeah . P. D. Eastman rocks with Go , Dog , Go !
5 #### Great book from my childhood that both of my children enjoyed ! !
5 #### One of my favorite as a child . Now passing it on .
5 #### Great book that my children enjoyed as kids , and now my grandkids love as well .
5 #### My all time favorite children 's book - no I take that back - its my all time favorite book period . My girls loved this book as much as I do and hopefully I will read it to my grandchildren . It is perfect for either boy or girl and has so much going on . And it is a silly and fun way to sneak in a lesson for colors and counting . The illustrations are fantastic . It is just a delightful timeless book . And who does n't love dogs or a great party . Perfection !
5 #### Great book for children . Lots of repetition , which is great for small kids .
1 #### Shortened board book format ! Missed that in the review . Oops .
5 #### I bought this for my future grandbaby . Every kid needs these books ! Good guality
5 #### Classic early reader book . Fun colourful pictures . Excellent for older preschoolers and early kindergarteners .
5 #### Fast shippingGreat book .. Highly recommend it for reading to very young children .
5 #### My husband loved this book as a kid and gave it to my daughter as a Christmas gift at 14 months . It was immediately her favorite !
5 #### I think this book is great at 11 months old , we read it everyday , absolutely great read to teach basic adjectives ,
5 #### My husband loved this book as a child and loved reading it to his kids . It 's now my 4 yr old grandson 's favorite book !
5 #### Love this book . It is so cute and perfect by my boy that loves dogs and anything that Go 's !
5 #### When I was young it was my favorite book so I ordered it and it is still great fun ! ! !
5 #### My daughter is in her thirties and we still refer to this book . I always include it as a baby shower gift . It 's a classic .
2 #### I did not realize that this was not the original story . It focuses on the cars and dogs that ' go . ' I realize some board books are abridged , but I thought this was the original story in board book form . I did n't pay attention to the subtitle " Book of Things That Go " That should be the main title , without the original artwork , it is deceivng . I will read the fine print more carefully before ordering board books . As always , Buyer Beware , especially when ordering online .
5 #### My grand son 's and my favorite book . We love it .
5 #### My kid is obsessed . Loves these dogs better than Dr Seuss .
5 #### My 17 year old son learned to read well by reading this over and over between Kindergarten and first grade . A couple of years later he won awards for setting records at his elementary school for reading the most books ! I have a younger son that we just bought this for so that he can practice and gain confidence reading the book . It 's such a confidence builder ! I recommend it !
1 #### This is not the entire Go , Dog , Go ! book . It is abridged . I was disappointed .
5 #### Everything was greatthe story , the lion ( Aslan ) , and all of it ! The McKay kids all give a huge thumbs up !
5 #### A classic . I will read this to my kid / grandkids if I ever have any .
5 #### I wanted to introduce my little cousins to some of my favorite stories , so I purchased this and we all love it .
5 #### My children loved this book and ca n't wait for me to read it to them again !
5 #### My absolute favorite books as a child . A must read for kids that love adventures .
5 #### Read to second graders every year and they love it just as I do each time I read it !
5 #### I 'm writing on behalf of my toddler granddaughter , who was devastated when we could not find this book in the store . Her other grandmother keeps a copy to read to all her grandchildren , and my granddaughter fell in love . This is a great toddler book with funny pictures ( study the one of the dogs sleeping ) . After you read it to your favorite toddler , ask , " Do you like my hat ? " You 'll get some giggles for sure .
5 #### This book does exactly and very well what it was created to do -- help preschoolers and first - graders learn colors , contrasts , and simple words . Oh , and do so with FUN and RHYTHM ! That 's why my three youngsters loved it . I still enjoy having it around for the occasional " light reading , " and I mean light . I used to teach first and second - graders to read with DICK AND JANE . Books like GO , DOG , GO would 've been so much better and more fun .
5 #### One of my personal favorite children books . Reading to the children was a pleasure in this one . Good Book !
1 #### This is a very badly abridged copy of Go , Dog . Go ! . I have no idea why Go , Dog . Go ! Needed to be abridged at all ( it does nt ! ) and I was really disappointed to find that this was n't the beloved story from my childhood that I remembered . I will be buying the correct version now and throwing this version away . Its completely ridiculous to edit a classic and continue to slap P.D. Eastmans name on it .
3 #### I remember this book from when I was a kid . But , my kids have not interest in it at all .
5 #### This book is the classic of all Christian fiction classics . I love that it is very oriented towards children . The main characters are children , and Christmas is part of the theme of the book . I love that the Christian aspect of the book was a very clear picture of the Gospel message : that a Messiah ( Aslan / Jesus , the Lion of Judah ) laid Himself down on the stone table ( the cross ) and rose again to conquer sin and death once and for all ! This is the first of a series of books ( not counting " The Magician 's Nephew " , a prequel ) and those other books explore the fantastic world of Narnia , as well as exploring many principals of Christian living , and all of them are worth reading more than once .
5 #### This page - turner book tells of four English children who venture beyond their realistic world and into a new one from inside a wardrobe . The world they explore is called Narnia , an expansive place filled with mythological creatures and magnificent scenery . Some in Narnia have magical powers , such as the White Witch , who has cast an endless winter spell on Narnia . The four children must go on an epic journey to find Aslan , the ruler of Narnia , to help fight the witch and stop the curse . This book has a lot of interesting things that happen , most of which involve adventure . It got me really excited , although the writer 's style could be confusing-- he uses some old - fashioned English grammar and left some parts out . I think the author wanted the reader to experience the scenery of Narnia and not just the events , so it keeps the reader interested . It was exciting to picture the imaginary land and the violent events happening there . I think middle schoolers and people looking for a good fantasy book with adventure should read this . Sometimes the book felt rushed or incomplete , unlike the movie which showed everything . People who ca n't stand violence should back away from this story . If you have n't watched the movie yet , try reading the book !
5 #### One of my favorite books . This particular version is quite compact , but the traditional illustrations are still in here , I think all of them .
5 #### My 3 year old wants to read this over and over ! She loves it !
4 #### Sweet A bit too didactical for me My son loves it and it 's good for learning English
5 #### One of my toddler 's favorites ! I love this little board book more than the longer paper version of Go Dog Go - does n't take as long to read ( essentially when I have to read it over and over and over again ) , and it withstands a bit more abuse .
5 #### What can I say this is Dr. Seuss . Dr. Seuss is the best children 's books because it is imagination unleashed . These books are classics and no matter what generation all children and love and enjoy these books .
5 #### A great gift for a child who loves to read . She cherishes her books .
5 #### This tale never gets old ! Rereading it always feels like getting together with a dearest friend ! I love all the Narnia books but this is my favorite of the seven stories .
5 #### My grandson loved this story and reads it to himself over and over .
5 #### My son loved this book when he was a little boy !
3 #### While a nicely done board book it is a shortened version of the original - not what we expected . The story is much less interesting this way .
5 #### My son loves this book . I remember reading this book when I was a child .
5 #### My son adores this book ! He loves cars ( basically anything with wheels ) and dogs . Two of his first 5 words were dog and car . At 1yo , he flips through this book and goes " book , dog , car " . There is nothing i do n't like about this book .
5 #### bought it for my niece . One of my favorite books of all time
4 #### The illustrations are beautiful , however the text was abridged oddly in some places . It 's a good introduction to Narnia for my 4 year old and I look forward to him being older to read the unabridged version .
4 #### I read the first few chapters and I find it pretty interesting . I am eleven years old . I watched the movie , Narnia and loved it ! I have the book at home . This book includes amazing mystery . I would recommend this book to people who love mystery books and adventure ones .
5 #### Wonderful book to add to my C.S. Lewis collection . Coloring is great to add to the look of the Banes drawings . They are wonderful in their own way .
5 #### I love the illustrations in this book ! It does a great job of summarizing the story and the illustrations are so engaging . This will be a loved book for many years .
4 #### My husband and I love this series and ca n't wait to read the unabridged versions to our kids . In the meantime , I was looking for an age - appropriate version for our 3 - year - old son , who LOVES books and epic stories . We like the art work on this and think it does a fair job of abridging this work for a younger audience ( book advertises for ages 4 to 8) . Because we wish the story were a little better developed , I 'm only giving this 4 stars .
5 #### I have enjoyed C.S. Lewis as both an adult and a child . I find pleasure in again reading stories I enjoyed in my youth .
5 #### This is our favorite book for young kids ! All our grandchildren love it , and we ca n't wait to introduce it to the 2 youngest ones soon ! !
5 #### I was just blessed with a granddaughter and this is the very first e - book I downloaded for her ( though a bit early ! ) . I loved this book as a child and attribute my deep love of dogs to be due , in part , to the frequent reading of this book as a child . It is sweet , cute , and even educational ! A must - have for every child 's library !
5 #### Good clean copy . 4 year old LOVES it . Great for beginner readers .
5 #### Loved it as a child and now a copy for my grandchildren . Great .
5 #### I have the set of these books but was missing the first one . I will give these to my grandkids to read , they are great books !
5 #### Been reading a chapter a night to my 5 year old !
5 #### Beloved family Classic . My grandson loves books & this is the perfect size & durability for 14 month old hands .
5 #### My four year - old granddaughter has memorized this entire long book and feels like she can read . Despite repeated bedtime readings , I still enjoy hearing her " read " this classic .
5 #### Great silly memorable depiction of dogs on the go ! Dogs in the tree , in the car , going in - going out , and more . This is surely a classic and entertained my children more than a dozen time .
5 #### We were n't looking for anything too incredibly fancy , so the used option was great for us ! We have a 3 year old who just loves Dr. Seuss books , and we know he is going to put some wear and tear on them himself . Why buy new ? Same story , but with less heart ache if it gets scribbled on or torn . Thanks for the book ! :)
5 #### This was a hit with the grandkids . What a great way to introduce young children to great literature .
5 #### I love returning to the land of Narnia year after year . This was the first year I got to share the magic with my kids as I read to them every night before they went to bed . They loved it and already want to go back .
5 #### I could n't read it quickly enough . Its everything you heard about it and more . A must read for every one .
5 #### This is a very enjoyable book ! I can hardly wait to read the rest of the series and really see the correlation between the Bible and the Narnia series . While an easy read for children , this book offers more in depth understanding for adults .
5 #### Light , lighthearted , very fast paced , wonderful children 's fantasy tale ! Really efficient story telling that leaves you wanting more . Because its short . But very good .
5 #### One of my favorite books ! Ordered as gift with Advent in Narnia .
5 #### My children 's favorite book . Get the long , full edition , not the short one .
5 #### One of the best beginning to read books their is .
5 #### My favorite book when I was about 4 and now my toddler loves it too . " Do you like my hat ? "
5 #### I 've enjoyed this series every since I saw a movie as a little girl . This book is rich in character and teaching about pride and how it can quickly take hold of a person . A good adventure for young and old alike .
5 #### Excellent book to read to young christians . I read this to my four year old and we both thoroughly enjoyed it ! ! ! Awesome book ! I liked it way more than the movie .
4 #### The picture is not the cover of the book I got . I got the same book I would have gotten if I had bought the boxed set . I bought this particular one because I did n't want the set , I wanted the book with this picture on it . :(
5 #### This is a fun book with great illustrations . My grandchildren loved it !
5 #### I bought two of these for two friends with new sons . This book was a very favorite of my son and was a very favorite of mine 50 years ago . This is a classic , for sure !
5 #### Great classic book to read to your little ones !
2 #### Meh . I love C.S. Lewis . He is an incredible theologian and is very articulate when it comes to explaining doctrines and ideasI have loved reading some of his non - fiction novels . However , I just do n't care for him as a fiction writer . While the story has an incredible allegory to it , his ability to write a story is just bland . Beautiful ideas , but I do n't care for his writing style when it comes to fiction .
5 #### I really like the book it has beautiful pictures and i love the story .
5 #### The color pictures make a big difference . Nice quality book .
5 #### like the book i though it would be larger it could fit in your pocket
3 #### This is another classic timeless tale that has withstood the test of time , as I was reading it to my granddaughter memories of me learning to read from this same story came to mind . This is a great book to help a young reader start to read as it has many repetitive words along with simple illustrations that go along with the story . Helping teach " in , out , under , around , over , blue , read , yellow , green , go , stop " A good book to use for a pre reader ( as my granddaughter ) to prepare her to get ready to read ; or a good book for a beginner reader due to the easy repetitive words would n't take a long time for them to be able to read the story themselves or at least several pages boosting their self esteem for reading on their own !
5 #### A classic fun book to read and talk about with your little ones , and a great book for beginning readers to practice reading to you !
5 #### Classic book , hard back and small yet enjoyable . My kids 5 and it works great
5 #### This is one of our children 's most beloved books ! Great book for children learning to read . Illustrations are spectacular .
5 #### My little guy ( 1.5 years ) loves the original Go , Dog , Go , but he can sometimes be rough on the paper pages . I got the board book version for him to be able to have in the car , take to grandma 's house , etc . I knew that the board book version was different than the original , but I was surprised that the text is actually completely different . This version actually rhymes , and tells a cohesive ( if vague ) story from beginning to end . This version is focused more on things that go , versus the original which is vaguely focused on opposites . I quite enjoy reading it to kiddo , and he 's able to pay attention to the whole thing , whereas the original is a bit too long for him at this age . It 's definitely a fun addition to kiddo 's little library .
5 #### My children 's favorite . Bought this for my daughter to read with her students in Japan ,
5 #### Another great PD Eastman book that my grandson loves .
5 #### This is the original - the classic - and a great buy and read !
5 #### This book should be added to all beginning reading book collections .
3 #### This story is n't as great as the smaller , condensed version .
5 #### wonderful book and is really teaching my son about the concepts of big vs little and under vs over . I remember my mom reading me this book as a toddler and I hope my son has similar memories one day
5 #### I highly recommend this book ! ! I recommend starting it early ( even before your child turns 1 ) and reading it on a regular basis . My son started " reading " this book at around 15 months old . He loves turning the pages and enthusiastically saying , " Go , dog ! Go ! ! " ( as clearly as a 15 month old can say that ) . I am an elementary school teacher and value books that foster a love of reading and encourage a child to try to start reading on his or her own . I would love to buy more books just like this one that my son can start " reading . "
4 #### This is not a full version , this is very much cut down . I gave it four stars because it is my 18 - month - old son 's favorite :-)
5 #### This was a great book for my daughter when she was learning to read fluently . She would read this book over and over .
3 #### Neither my granddaughter now I were crazy about this book , but it was simple for her to follow when she was 2 and 3 years old , and it opens the door for discussions about number and color .
3 #### Please , used book sellers , do n't put your stickers on these books ( front and back ) . I know you need bar codes , but they are hard to take off , obscure the titles , and leave a sticky mess .
5 #### This was my son 's favorite book growing up . I purchased it for my new granddaughter to enjoy with her dad .
5 #### My little son carries this around saying " go , go , go ! " He wants to read it every too minutes , and I do n't have it in me to do the full version every time . The board book is short and durable .
5 #### Needed for a baby shower . It was my children 's favorite book . So nice I ordered another one for another shower .
5 #### My 5 - year old nephew loves it . Great book - Dr. Seuss 's genius . He could read almost the whole thing with no help , when he was 4 years old .
5 #### A favorite story of many kids , A good way to start early interest in reading .
5 #### I love Dogs and this is my favorite book to read to children . I am an animated story teller and live to proclaim loudly , " A DOG PARTY , A BIG DOG PARTY "
5 #### My grandson 's favorite story . I carry one of these in my bag at all times , and we read it at restaurants while waiting for our food to arrive . This particular story combines my grandson 's faves : dogs and cars . We ca n't live without this story .
5 #### Take two worlds my son can say like " dog " and " go " and you have the perfect combination for a story . I love the illustration and also the story . This is simple , straightforward fun . Perfect for the squirmy toddler .
5 #### This book has been around for a long time , but never gets outdated . It 's one of the best books for your child to learn to read .
5 #### This is a great book and no matter your age it is still funny . My grandson loves for us to read this book and for him to read it to us .
5 #### I am sure there are others that would disagree , but I believe Dr. Seuss books are an excellent way to get young children interested in reading , and to help them learn to read . Growing up Go , Dog , Go ! was always one of my favorite books , and has become on of my daughters favorite books as well . Eastman provides a great story with a good imagination !
4 #### I bought this book for our new great grandson . When his mother was little she had her grandpa read this every night . He would even hide the book at times and she would get mad at him . We bought the book as a joke so she can get her son hooked on it .
5 #### Teaches colors , numbers , up , down , inside , outside , above below , etc , etc , etc ! I loved it as a child , my children loved it and so do my Grandchildren ! !
4 #### This is book came in great condition . However , I was unaware it had a condensed text from the original book of Go Dog Go . I wish that would have been stated when I ordered the book . I would have most likely ordered the full size edition .
5 #### My grandson just turned 3 and is really loving having stories read to him as he learns to read himself . Can you ever go wrong with Dr. Suess ? ? I do n't think so . Dr. Suess has a great way of " speaking " to imaginations . Highly recommend all . In this particular story , he loves to point out and spell " Go " and " Dog " and " Stop " . Not to mention the story . His personal favorite because of the cars .
5 #### my 4 year old grand daughter can read this ! I remember reading this book as a child . It is timeless .
5 #### My grandson loves it ! Great price for this book . Ordered several others at the same time . Thank you very much .
5 #### I do n't know why this book has flown under the radar . It is masterful at showing relationships that can be very abstract to little ones --- in and out , up and down , over and under . The car goes on green and stops on red . Dogs play and dogs work . My son loved this book when he was a toddler and so did I. I try to buy a copy for every pregnant woman I know !
5 #### We bought this since the Dallas Children 's Theater was doing the play . We read this book several times before going to see the play to get her familiar with the story . After the play she loves the book so much and reads through it over and over .
5 #### I found it cheaper at my local K - Mark I should have waited before ordering from Amazon ! Fast Delivery though
4 #### This book should probably be in everyone 's home . It 's good for teaching kids colors and opposites . Might be the first book your child can read on his / her own . Recommended if you like P.D. Eastman .
5 #### It 's fun and teaches about opposites and color . Dogs are up , out , on , in , over , under etc .. Also stop / go lights . My 2 year old granddaughter has the book but she likes it best when we read it on my Kindle Fire .
5 #### This is my favorite kids book , and I buy it for every expecting mother I know . Great book and this one is especially cool because it is a board book ! Great find !
5 #### Love these books . Have to get these . So easy to read , so entertaining . Does not matter how many times you read them - go around again !
5 #### My youngest son loves when I read this story to him . I recommend this book to other parents of toddlers .
2 #### Maybe I am not the norm , but I felt in reading this book to my 3 year old I was suffering a case of ADD . The story felt so random . Yes it rhymed but there did not seem to be a logical progression in the book , it felt like they were just trying to cram in as much as they could . If my daughter asks , I will read it again , but this was not a book I would read again willingly . I like books with a story , this one lacked that .
5 #### We have this on our kindle . Our grandchildren are spread around the country , so this makes it easy for us to read to them and with them . We just call them up on Google or Skype and read their goodnight story to them . This is one of their favorites .
2 #### I bought this book to use in the READ program with my therapy dog . It only has a few pages , nothing like the original book . Very disappointing if you are expecting the classic Go , Dog , Go ! I know I should have read the description a little closer , but I never expected they would take out most of the book to make it a board book !
4 #### This is a great book for kids who are just learning to read . There are lots of sight words that my kindergartner has been learning so it excites him to see whole sentences made up of sight words that he has recently learned . It is a little long for a new readers so you just have to go into it with the mindset that it will be a 2 part read or share the reading with your youngster .
5 #### A must - have for 1 - 2 year olds - boys and girls alike . Even my 4.5 year old still enjoys and learns from it , after hundreds of readings . I admit I have a personal affinity for the girl dog with the fancy hats - such a cute theme throughout the story . We will always keep this book on our bookshelf !
5 #### My grandson LOVES this book and wants me to read it over and over . He knows it by heart . He asks me to read it to him when he goes to bed .
5 #### This is a great beginner reader . The pictures accentuate the words . Also , repeating the same words over and over assist the young reader in learning to sight recognize a word .
5 #### This was one of my favorites as a kid , and now it 's definitely one of my daughter 's favorites . " Go , Dog , Go ! " is one of her favorite things to say , and she is starting to memorize the book because she wants us to read it to her so much .
5 #### My six - year - old daughter says , " I like this book a lot . It has opposites . I like how the one dog says he does n't like the other dog 's hat but then likes her wacky party hat . "
5 #### As a very little girl , I remember loving the very last picture in this book . I would sit and study the dogs , having a big party on the canopy of a giant tree . I wanted to go to that party .
5 #### This book is a must for any beginning book collection . I have two boys , ages 2 and 4 , and we have read this book over and over . When a mom and dad like a book , somehow that energy gets passed on to the children . This book talks about opposites and colors , but in a fun way . There are plenty of things to discuss with your children , or you can simply read it . I agree with another reviewer when she said that she thought that it was a Dr. Seuss book until recently . It rocks :)
5 #### You can not go wrong with Dr. Seuss . It is a win - win for everyone . Good pics , good book , good deal .
4 #### great beginner book , colors , up and down , over and under , in and out . stop and go . like and dislike . night and day
5 #### I love this book . The same simple words and images are used over and over , so that even a baby will pay attention to them . I remember how much my small children loved it during the pre - school years . More recently , we started reading this book to our grandchild a month ago , at 2 months , and he stares at it , transfixed by all the things the dogs are doing ( even though he has no idea what a dog is ) . This is also an awesome book for young readers . Who can forget the classic words , " Do you like my hat ? " and " It 's a dog party ! "
4 #### This is a great book for my toddler . We keep it in the car and she really likes it . However , it is different rom the original . The conversation about " do you like my hat ? " Has been totally removed from the story . It 's a good version , but , unless you just want the board book , I would recommend sticking with the original .
4 #### My sister wishes we had never given this book to my niece because she wants to have it read to her all the time . It has held up well- being read multiple times a day and at the hands of a toddler .
5 #### For preschoolers , this book read at bedtime is an excellent way to familiarize one 's child with words and concepts . This is a great aid for an ESL student .
4 #### My son is almost 2 and this book held his attention for a good ten minutes . If you have a toddler I seriously recommend this saw fine book .
5 #### My wife and I have read , or helped our children to read , hundreds of books . There are many great books available that build the confidence of the early reader , but " Go , Dog . Go ! " has been the most successful for both of our kids . Each page features a humorous depiction that makes each of the core words intuitive to read . Big dogs , little dogs , dogs of color , and dogs at play are all represented in ease . The book is fun for parents to read and builds confidence for children just learning . Our two children have taken different paths in the early stages of reading development . Our daughter learned her sight words in the public school system ; our son is learning at home . However different both kids are , they both have gravitated to this one book as their natural selection . And selection they 've had ! Their shelves are full of Dr. Seuss and level one readers , but " Go , Dog , Go ! " has been a repeated favorite .
5 #### This book was part of my growing up . My family has quoted for years things like " Stop dogs , stop , the light is red now " and " Go , dogs go , the light is green now " . " Go around again ! " is also one of our favorite things to say when driving a traffic circle or roundabout or riding something at an amusement park . And if we are subtly trying to elicit a compliment from another family member we will ask " do you like my hat ? " . I had not realized until I just re - read the book for the first time in years how many phrases from this book slipped into my immediate and extended family 's lexicon .
4 #### If this story includes this saying to you and like it , do n't get the board book go for the hardback . I loved this story as my children were growing and just had to get the story for my grandkids . I knew from the price that board book would be different , but I did n't realize it would bug me like it does . LOVE the book and get it if you are not in love with the full story . I you know the whole story you may not enjoy this book .
5 #### this is a really great book , our school kids like this very much.and they want one more i think . amazon is great place order books too .
5 #### I love this book ! ! My three - year - old daughter and I have loved reading it every night . She laughs and giggles all the way through .
5 #### One of my daughter 's favorites . During bath time , since the day we bought it , this is one of the books she always picks . Always . She knows if I skip a page , she can even ' read with it ' sometimes in the slower parts . Sometimes I really just want this book to get lost , but that 's only because I 've read it so much . One of my daughter 's fave 's though . What I do for her sometimes . :)
4 #### I know nothing about this item it was purchased as a gift and sent to the repicipient without my seeing it .
5 #### It is one of her favorites and I do n't know why . It 's just a very simple story , but she enjoys it immensley .
5 #### My son enjoyed the book at the local library , so we checked it out , after returning it he would not stop asking for it . We succumb to the request of my son and spoiled him by buying this for my Kindle Fire HD . Now he can continue to enjoy it until he grows out of this book and finds something else to catch his interest .
5 #### Great book for kids . My students love the story and we even saw a play of the story go dog go .
5 #### OK This is one of my all time favorite childrens ' books ... A golden oldie . This book brilliantly demonstrates diversity and various contrasting objects in an entertaining and funny way . ( Over , Under , Up , Down , etc . Plus , different colored dogs doing cool things together . ) My Kindle copy is probably the tenth copy of this book I have purchased over the decades . The children I read this book to enjoy it almost as much as I enjoy reading it . If you do not have this book ... Get it .
5 #### At night I read a book to my son , then he reads me a book . As far as beginner books go , a book this long usually would make me cringe at the thought of it taking all night for him to read . However it was a very easy for him to get through as there were a lot of repeating and simple words . We have some more current beginner books based on Pixar movies but these kinds of classics are easier for him to read .
5 #### As a kid , I spent hours pouring over the scene in the tree top , as does my nephew now . And we always laugh about " I like that hat . " Fun .
5 #### I loved this book as a child . My grand son loves it . I was pleasantly surprised it was a board book . Love it .
4 #### I purchased this for my grandson for another Easter Basket Gift . I have been reading and purchasing Zeuss for 50 years !
5 #### Dr Seuss are her favorite books . She 's 6 in kindergarten and can read them all by herself :) thank you
4 #### It was perfect for my grandkids , I read the book to them and they loved it . It is one of their favorites .
5 #### I have 2 toddlers that love to be read to . They like all books and have really enjoyed this one .
5 #### This book is good for an early reader . The story is entertaining and nicely repetitive to reinforce new words . We will be reading m poo 're .
3 #### Surprisingly enough , I have to give the superior rating to the board book version . The board book version had more of a story feel to it . In general , I 've found the paper - page books to have content that the board book lacked , essentially making it the board book with extra material . Go Dog . Go ! is a classic ; I read it when I was small , and I got the board book for my son almost 6 months ago ( and he has n't let me put it down since ) . I was excited to get him this copy , thinking of the material that might have been cut out for the board book version . This does n't even resemble the board book version except for the illustrations . This copy seems simpler and less advanced than the board book version . I was disappointed ; but it 's still a P.D. Eastman , and Eastman books are always a good buy .
5 #### My 2 year old daughter loves this book . It 's probably in her top 10 books overall , but it 's definitely her favorite Kindle book . I like the graphics in the ebook better than the physical book - they are much clearer and more defined . The concepts in the book ( up / down , over / under , in / out , etc . ) are great for toddlers . I can always distract her with this book . I highly recommend it !
5 #### My children loved this book so much that even though they are now adults they , and I , can recite passages from it ! It is simple and fun for children from 1 - 4 especially , and for learning to read ( especially if they are already familiar with the book ) . Unlike some other children 's books , it is also amiable for the adults who have to read it over and over again !
5 #### I bought this to read to my 2 yr old son . It really surprised me how many images from the book I remembered from my own childhood . The important thing is that after a couple of times through , he is already repeating some of the phrases . We 're loving it .
5 #### do you like my hat ? Yes , finally I like it . Let 's have a dog party ! ! ! ! This is good for little active kids at night , before they go to sleep . A dog party in a tree
5 #### great book for kids . it was my favorite as a kid myself . I am expanding my childrens books even though i do not have a child . It arrived in a decent amount of time and I would recommend getting this to go with your other childrens books .
5 #### This book has been a favorite of ours for almost 18 years now . My original book was lost so I had to purchase another for our granddaughter to grow up with . Always a great read !
5 #### This is a perfect child 's book . I bought the Kindle version and it 's wonderful . Your youngster will love this book .
5 #### Loved reading this to my children . Used it to recognize colors directions ( up down etc ) Also great game while in the car watching for traffic lights " is it go Mom go or stop Mom stop " Bought it again for my granddaughter .
4 #### I bought this for my 18 month old twin Grandaughters . They love it , although I find it rather irritating to read ! This is their second copy as the first copy had to be left behind after one of the twins spent time in hospital .
5 #### Everyone should have this book for their little kids . Ages 2 - 5 . Ca n't go wrong . Engaging images , fun storyline woven into the repetitive vocabulary - building .
2 #### My kids do n't like this book because it has no story line . It does n't work in black and white as the text and pictures have connected in the original .
5 #### This book was a gift for my grand nephew . It was a request from his Mother , she had the book as a little girl and it was getting worn out and she wanted a hard back .
5 #### This is a family favorite and one that all the kids love to read and make up voices for added fun .
5 #### My first grader is struggling to learn to read . This is the first book that she could read all by herself . The words are all short and easy and repetitive , but this is exactly what she needs . This pictures of the funny dogs keep her interested in the story . Go dogs !
5 #### i bought this on my kindle for my niece and nephew and they loved it and were walking around reciting parts of the story.just do n't read it to kids near bedtime.its so much fun they get too hype shouting go dog go . LOL
5 #### I bought this book for my 3 yr old grandson for Christmas . I heard people talking about it on the radio as their favorite book as a child . Not only does my grandson and his sister listen intently , but everyone who reads it to them , loves reading it . the book is so clever . It gets exciting and the kids want to be able to read and want to join in . I wish i would have known about this book when my kids were young . It 's a MUST read .
5 #### I purchased many e - books for my ipad and iphone for my grandkids . I purchased them for my granddaughter when she started reading . She is now in the 2nd grade and loves reading on my ipad The graphics are great and if she needs to she can make the font larger .
4 #### My Sons Really enjoy it They want to hear the story every night , even as they get older they still listen
5 #### Fun for all ages . Bought this book for my grand children and they loved it . I would recommend this book
5 #### Got this for my 4 year old grand daughter . We took it to the live performance and had the performer sign her book . We both almost have it memorized .
5 #### I bought this as an addition to my daughter 's library . I remember it growing up and it was , and still is , one of my favorites . There are a limited number of words on each page which is great for the younger kids who get bored very quickly . It also deals a lot with opposites and can be a great learning resource .
5 #### Both my girls love this book . I have it on kindle fire , this book requires a floor screen . It is entertaining and educational at the same time . ( Teaches simple concepts for young children )
5 #### One of the strangest childrens books , but my 2 year old daughter absolutely loves it and asks me to read it all day to her . This is a long book , so I try to skip over pages but she now knows if I do and screams ! If I have to read it one more time I 'm going to go insane , but regardless I must give it 5 stars because children love it !
4 #### I read this book to my children . They really enjoyed this book and were laughing at many of the pages . They loved the dogs driving cars . The contrasting words helped them learn new concepts . I recommend this book to parents of small children .
5 #### i remember when i was 6 and being able to read this book by myself so i wanted my grandson to be able to do the same thing . he loves books and is always readign them . some i think he 's memorized cuz he ca n't do some of the words . because i sent the book to them i did n't read it . but i do know it 's about comparisions . tall / short , wet / not wet , fast / slow , etc the dogs line up for a race to the big tree . it 's a really nice surprise when you reach the tree at the end of the race .
5 #### I think this book is really funny . The pictures of the dogs are so silly . Two of the dogs keep meeting . One dog is pink and the other is yellow . When they meet , the pink dog always asks the yellow dog if he likes her hat . He never likes her hat until the very end . I think this book is awesome and a good first book . I can read it all by myself and I am only 6 .
5 #### I used this book when I taught English lessons at a primary school in the Shan State region of Myanmar ( Burma ) recently . It was a huge hit . The kids really loved the story , urging me to turn the pages faster and faster . They were eager to know what happened , and just what was going on at the top of those tree branches ! The marvelous illustrations were the real draw for those kids , most of whom have very basic English language abilities . But using this book enabled me to teach them some new vocabulary words and reinforce things like the names of colors and using " how many " and other skills . Before I used it , I was n't sure how this book would go over with these young kids , but I 'm very happy they liked it so much . And so do I !
5 #### My kids ( 6 , 4 , and 2 ) are fascinated by this book . My motivated - but - struggling 6 - year - old is able to read it on his own ( although , with his memory , he might just be reciting it by heart ) . And Mommy loves to read it to them because of the short sentences with small words , the funny story and pictures , and the ample opportunities for drama . But more than all that , I am just loving all the psychoanalytical reviews that people are writing here .
5 #### My three - year - old son thought he could read this book , but he actually had memorised it ! This was in 1971 . I am now buying this book for my grandson ! ! GO DOG GO ! !
5 #### I bought this book for my young daughter because of the great reviews but when I read it myself , I was quite disappointed . It seemed boring and repetetive . I read it to my daughter anyway .... And she loved it ! She made me read it to her over and over again . She likes reading the part of the poodle with the hat very much . It is now one of her favorite books .
4 #### This is my favorite Cat in the Hat style books ... dogs drive cars , climb tress , wear silly hats ... and along the way kids learn the words big , small , up , down , stop , go , colors , etc . In my opinion , functions very nicely as gender neutral . I am a girl and loved this book and totally wanted to learn how to drive a car ! One star was removed because the pages in this book are a little on the thin side so you can see through them a bit which can be confusing . In reducing the book to a smaller size , they also cut off portions of the original art and removed the empty space around the art which actually helped to accentuate and frame it . I prefer the original version which was a larger book . On the plus side , the smaller size is better for a toddler to carry and hold .
5 #### I like and admire the Dr. Seuss books , but at some point a little variety and a change from Seuss style of artwork and rhyming is nice . P.D. Eastman is sort of under appreciated given the wide appeal of his drawing style and the cheerful accessibility of his language . The story is simple and clear , and relates directly to the equally clear but fun illustrations . If I could only have one book available for an early reader , this would be it .
5 #### My 19 - month - old loves this book . I do n't know if it 's because he likes dogs , cars , or both , but I read it about three times a day at his request . No complaints ! It 's a cute book with basic , not - too - hard words that babies and toddlers can begin to recognize as they learn to read . Also illustrated are concepts of sleeping all night and playing during the day , as well as the difference between work and play . Numbers , sizes , and colors are also introduced . Classic baby literature that stands the test of time .
4 #### I loved this book growing up , it was one of my favorites , so I could n't wait to buy it for my son . I 'm really disappointed at how thin the pages are , the paper is so transparent you can see the image from the other side and it 's really annoying . I 've noticed this with other old books I have re - bought for my son . I guess they do n't print them like they used to . There is also some exposed glue around the edges of the inside of the front and back cover , which is sticky and I 'm contemplating sending it back . I give the story four stars , but this physical book gets maybe 1 and a 1/2 or 2 .
5 #### I remember loving this book as a kid , but even then I recognized one thing about it . Rereading it as an adult , I am still surprised by something . The book pretty much lacks a plot . Yes , there are a couple of recurring bits , but almost every page until the end is separate from what went before . However , the book has simple sentences and simple vocabulary . And the pictures that go along with the text are fun . Maybe it 's the fun of the story that appeals to kids and still appeals to adults . Or maybe it 's just the dogs in every day activities that works well . Whatever the case , I definitely do recommend this book for kids . It 's a picture book classic and sure to entertain kids for generations to come .
5 #### This is the first book that my 2.5 - year - old son has " read " to us . Given that this book is much , much longer than his board books , I think it speaks a lot about how much he loves this book ! Of course he has memorized it and uses the pictures on the pages as cues , but it is still adorable to have him read to us for a change . His favorite parts are the Ferris wheel and the party hat . He often references the book in regards to other things and creates setups from the book . For example , he put a toy tree across the room from a line of his cars and told me that the cars were " going to the big tree over there " . This book certainly has captured his interest . For that , I give it a full 5 stars . I ca n't say it 's my favorite , but that 's not the point .
5 #### Every time a friend of mine has a child , this is the book they get for their first birthday . I was taught to read at an early age , and this book is one I remember vividly . The pictures are colorful and the story is simple , and that makes for great fun . What kid does n't love a story that ends with a big party in a tree ?
5 #### Highly recommended . This has been a favorite book of all three of our grandsons . They generally really like it between the ages of 2 and 6 . They love to have it read to them when younger and like to try to read it as they get older . Originally purchased this book elsewhere ( years ago ) but had to replace the old book so purchased a new copy from Amazon.com .
4 #### This is the longest book that my babies would listen to before they were one year old . It is simple , with interesting topics for babies . Mostly dogs , of course . The pictures are not beautiful , and I do wish that the looks on the faces of the dogs were more positive , but it is a classic book that the babies ask for over an over . A good gift for a first or second birthday .
1 #### My daughter LOVES this book and read it til pages started falling out so I ordered this for a replacement and as soon as I opened it I realized that it was not the same . The story is cut short and is not the classic story that we love . I wish they would have said this in the description or on the book or SOMETHING . A bit dishonest !
1 #### I was so disappointed that this board book left out so much of the original story . Where is " do you like my hat " ? That was my favorite part as a child ! Buy the regular book !
5 #### My two year old loves this book and will call " Go cars , go ! " as we drive down the road . It has colors , sizes , on top/ bellow , inside / outside ... and for some reason the page about the different colored dogs on different colored trees makes my little one giggle every time . Love this book and read it often . Highly recommend .
5 #### Every now and then there 's a book from your past you just have to " re - read " . Somehow this one was the most recent ! I always remembered the party in the tree , and the lady with the crazy hats .
5 #### My little granddaughter absolutely ADORED Go - Dog ! Her mother and I were rather mystified , but she sure read it , on demand , for her daughter many , many , many times . I think my granddaughter was about three or so when she loved this book . The repetition enchants kids , I think . Both of my daughters really loved traditional , English nursery rhymes from the Real Mother Goose Book . Those nursery rhymes are the real deal and are certainly not PC , but both my girls loved the repetition and rhymes and the silliness of some of the words and phrases . They would laugh out loud .
5 #### This book is a must . I can not describe the feelings and emotions I was left with after re - reading it for the 49th time . " What will happen next , Red Dog ? " I found myself asking on numerous occasions . If you like weird dogs , buy this product for please thankyou . Though ... I thought " good - by " had an e ...
5 #### Absolutely our favorite family book for early readers ! Our children loved the sing - song phrasing and our grandchildren do too . Young children immediately identify with the dogs and all of their activities from mazes to boats , waking and sleeping , red lights and green lights , and definitely asking to " go around again ! ! ! " Children love it ! They want to hear it again and again . It 's funny and light and full of silly adventure . It is a must have for young children to enjoy listening to , and then it becomes popular again when beginning readers are looking for something to read to younger siblings .
5 #### Go Dog Go ! is a book by P.D. Eastman . In the story there 's lots of dogs . The dogs do amazing things like scuba diving , roller skating , riding bikes , and driving . They even put a three story house on a small boat . Near the end of the book all the dogs are going somewhere , but you do n't know where until the very end . I like this book because the dogs work and they like to play . I also think it 's funny when a little dog pulls a big dog . In the book there are lots of colorful dogs and my favorite is the red dog . I wonder what your favorite dog would be ?
4 #### If you 've read the original , longer , book this one might seem odd . It 's a couple dozen pics from the original book , with new text ( that - if you 've read the original - does n't seem to fit the pictures very well ) . BUT : my 17 mo old son does n't have the attention span for the longer version . This shorter one repeats two of his favorite words ( go and dog ) over and over . We read this book many times a day - it 's one of his favorites .
5 #### this is agreat book i remembered from my childhood . i 've been looking for it for a long time.i'm so happy my children finally have it .
5 #### This is one of the best books ever for early readers . It has rhyming , which helps , but most importantly , every page is just a written description of what is going on in the illustrations ( which are classic for good reason ) . My son could look at the pictures and say " yellow dog under a red tree " , etc . But at the same time , it is n't a boring " go , spot , go " repetition ... there 's lots of action and things in it that kids would be attracted to ; boats , cars , parties , and crazy hats . If only every story they give kids to read had this much fun and heart put into its creation .
5 #### My four - year - old son loves this book . We had checked it out of the library for awhile , and we finally just bought it for his fourth birthday .
5 #### A book my kids loved growing up . They liked when I read it to them and when they could read it themselves . Now the grandchildren will enjoy it .
5 #### Thank you so much for having this ! My daughter is starting to read and she can almost get through this one without any trouble . I do hope this 'll be the start of a lifelong passion for reading !
5 #### Wacky and fun , this book takes one of America 's favorite pet animals : dogs , and presents them in an adventure that children will love ( I certainly did , I read it at least 50 times ! ) . In this story we follow a boy dog who is riding around . He runs into a lady dog who keeps asking him if he likes her hat . The hats and the boy dog 's blunt answers are hilarious . Thru out the story we also see many other types of dogs and their daily multiple activities . They all do crazy things like having a party on top of a tree , and jumping out of bed at top speed when the sun comes up . This book is great for beginners . The color illustration really bring to life P.D. Eastman 's classic tale .

5 #### Our toddler absolutely loves this book . She is obsessed with dogs , so this is one of her favorites . She ( nor I ) have seen the original version and this suits our purposes just fine . It 's compact , durable , and has lots of doggie pictures . She giggles and claps when we get to the Dog Party page . When she 's older , we 'll definitely get the full version of this book . But for a 15 - month - old , this version is perfect .
5 #### This was my favorite book as a child and now my daughter can enjoy it as well . It is a wonderful and fun beginner book to read .
5 #### we love this book . My 2 yr son reads it constantly & loves all the Dr. Suess .
5 #### This was the first book I read as a kid and I loved it . After I bought a copy for my niece , I was surprised by how choppy it is when an adult reads it out loud , but it 's perfect for little ones . The pictures are very charming as well .
5 #### This is the only book my daughter seems to sit still for . She is only 20 - months - old and constantly wants to skip to her favorite pages of her other books , but this one she 'll read through in one sitting .
4 #### Go Dog Go is an easy reader portraying many kinds of dogs engaged in various activities . It introduces opposites and adjectives , as well as many human activities such as riding carnival rides , following traffic rules , sleeping , waking , working , and playing . These are all presented in brief scenes , with two main interwoven plots -- dogs driving to a dog party , and a male and female dog who become friends by the end of the story . The brief scenes make the book a good fit for toddlers with short attention spans , and beginning readers , for whom the task of reading can be arduous . The words are simple , but Eastman creates funny and imaginative scenarios through repetition and appealing drawings . The book was published before sophisticated printing techniques were available , and its charm is enhanced by its simplicity . It does , however , get old for adults around the tenth read - aloud .
5 #### During bathtime , I can offer my 22 - month old son no other book ; he will * always * ask for " Dog - Go ! " , and has consistently done so for many months . It 's a great book for learning the basics of language ... and the kids love it .
5 #### We all have this book memorized . One son wanted it read out loud every day , several times a day , for many months . It 's colorful , fun , silly , and has great rhymes . It also teaches color and direction ( like up , down , over , etc ) . Another wonderful read - aloud , but excellent for beginning readers to use as well . * taken from my review at goodreads
5 #### This is one of my three year old son 's favorites . We 've read over and over and over . He loves to point to the dogs as I read and sometimes jumps ahead and finishes the sentence for me !
3 #### Get the original version , it 's much better ! I wish I could find a full length Go , Dog , Go ! in a boardbook .
1 #### This is not the original " Go , Dog , Go " . It is an abridged version that leaves out all the fun . There is no " Do you like my hat ? " , or " Men at work " , " Work Men Work " . I was greatly disappointed !
4 #### So of course it thrills my heart that my two nieces ( 2.5 and 5 ) like it too . This book is really an early reader , it 's not * intended * for children under that age , though of course it can function as a read - aloud for little - little ones . ( Not always - my younger niece wo n't always sit through this one , it 's a bit long ! ) There are two running plots in the book , one about hats , and one about where the dogs are all ultimately going ; these two plots meet marvelously at the end of the book . ( For * months * , I could n't go a day without having to re - enact " Do you like my hat ? I do , I like that hat , what a party hat ! " with the older niece ! ) Most of the book , however , is caught up with just basic vocabulary words , mostly about dogs - " One dog going in , three dogs going out " or " The sun is up , the sun is yellow , the yellow sun is over the house " . This can be a little tedious , but I the kids do n't seem to think so - even at their fidgiest , they want me to say every word .
5 #### I loved this book and read it all the time when I was little . I plan on buying it when I have kids . The pictures are colorful and fun . The words are easy to learn and each page seems to come alive with it 's own story .
5 #### This book is an all - time favorite of my daughter 's . My husband and I read it too my daughter so much that we have the entire thing memorized . We recite in the car , while shopping and anywhere we are . I do n't really know what mesmorizes her about it , but it has been a lifesaver for us . I highly recommend these Bright and Early Board Books .
5 #### this was one of my favorite books as a child , and when i picked it up after 35 years , i remembered and recognized the illustrations and scenes as if i had read it yesterday . this is a pleasure to read with its simple verse - like writing , its wonderful drawings , its bright colors , and its loveable characters . i could n't reocmmend a book more highly , especially good for young dog lovers , like our son . do n't bother with the board book version , which takes down 76 pages to about 6 . this original is easy to read and a joy .
5 #### Review by Sherry North , Author,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Because - You - Are - My - Baby / dp/0810994828 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Because You Are My Baby</a > This is a short , terrific book that neither you nor your child will tire of reading . Toddlers love the idea of dogs driving cars , and beginning readers enjoy the satisfaction of reading the story without help . This makes the book appropriate for a wide age range . The ending is charming and will put a smile on your face as well as your child 's .
1 #### Thank you to the reviewer who warned readers off this by explaining that it is an abridged version . The real " Go Dog Go ! " was perhaps my favorite , and certainly my most rememebered , book from my toddler years . It is now one of my toddler son 's favorite books by far . This board book version takes about 6 - 8 images out of the original 60 + pages and is such a poor imitation that it must be an embarrassment to the heirs of this wonderful author and illustrator . Save your $ 4.99 and buy the original hardback for $ 4 more . Another classic by PD Eastman is " Big Dog , Little Dog , " whose board book version is a fine approximation of the original .
5 #### This is such a fun read ! The illustrations are great . This is one of my son 's favorite books . It teaches children colors and opposites . Out of the blue he will say to me , " Do you like my hat ? " Then we play the hat game for awhile ! I highly recommend this book .
5 #### I started showing this book to my daughter when she was 16 months old . It is her absolute favorite ( and she has about 30 books ) . She throws the book at me and shoves it in my face at least 4x per day . She loves pointing to all the dogs while I tell her the color of each . She is obsessed with bikes , so the dogs riding bikes really get her excited . She is now almost 18 months old , and she now understands that the sun is hot , and can say the word " hat , car , stop , and tree " from the repeated readings of the book . There are so many things that this book teaches ... colors , stop and go , up / over / under / in / out / around , day / night ..... It was my absolute favorite beginner book as a small child too , and I am 40 now .
5 #### This board book is my two - year - old 's favorite . He loves the fact that the pages go by quickly , and he has memorized most of it already and enjoys " reading " it himself . Here 's the CAUTION : If you are expecting this book to be the same as the regular hardback book , you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED . The pictures are taken from the regular book , and the title is the same , but the similarities really end there . The text is very different -- not just abridged , but totally changed in most parts -- and the story lines from the regular book are mostly absent in the board book . If you want a quick board book that your toddler will enjoy carrying around and reading repeatedly , this is your book . If you want a board book similar to the full book , choose a different title , like " Hand , Hand , Fingers , Thumb . "
5 #### This is one of the first books my son could read by himself . Lots of repetition in sounds and words .
5 #### I bought this book for my almost 3 - year - old son for Christmas . He absolutely loves it and has me read the book at least three times a day . The simple text and fun pictures keep his attention while teaching him colors , size , up and down , over and under , in and out , hot and cold , night and day .
5 #### This book is a favorite for my two year old child . Out of all the board books she has ripped up this one remained in tact . Kira , my daughter , points at it every morning and says dog dog , repeatedly . It has been very helpful for her vocals and also for her recognition skills . I highly recommend it for your child . The book is short enough that it keeps her attention and long enough to stimulate her mind .
5 #### this was a favorite when I was young , so when I found it in a board book version , I bought it immediately . Keep in mind , the board book is shorter than the original version .... but regardless , it has quickly become my son 's absolute favorite . In this version , it starts with all the dogs jumping out of bed then goes right into the various modes of transportation the dogs are using ( " go by blimp , by boat , by car , go dog go , it 's not that far . " ) . Like the longer version , this one also ends with all the dogs congregating for a party at the top of a tree . My 18 month old can practically recite the whole story and we can never read it just once . He loves to point out all the pictures he can name ( car , dog , boat , etc ) So , while I miss the longer story , my son loves this one . Plus , he can easily hold it in his hands , can turn the heavy cardboard pages , and I do n't have to worry about him ripping a page . I still rate this 5 stars . Maybe when we 're out of the board book stage I 'll buy the other version , but for now , this one is just fine .
5 #### My just turned 3 daughter 's favorite , she got 2 of them , so I returned this one to you since I had purchased it from you for her b'day ! She LOVES this book !
1 #### I bought this book at Target ( it 's smaller and sturdier than the one my kids had ) only to find that this is NOT the original " Go , Dog , Go ! " Some of the very best parts are missing ( for instance , the " do you like my hat ? " interactions - ) GET THE WONDERFUL ORIGINAL , not this bland revision . Bobbi ( ps : same with Are You My Mother - there 's a " revised " one - not as good as the original )
5 #### This book covers all of the prepositions so your child gains an understanding of what it means to be over something , under something , in something , out , etc . This covers the ground that many kindergaten classes are studying .
5 #### My 18 month old daughter loves this book and I enjoy reading it to her . We do n't have the full sized version of this book so I ca n't speak for how they condensed it , but I do know my daughter and I both enjoy this version quite a bit .
5 #### This a fun fast paced learning book . Toddlers love dogs and cars . They are a great combo in this book . Go , Dog . Go ! has great rythe and is fast paced . This a wonderfully delightful book . Go , Dog . Go ! a fun read ! I loved this book as a child . My daughter loved it as a toddler and now my daycare kids love this book .
5 #### My daughter is 5 and just starting to read . This book 's magic is that it delivers an exciting , funny story with such few and simple words . When I read it to her I read it like it is the funniest thing I 've ever read . We laugh and laugh . Now she is learning to read the book because she likes it so much .
5 #### This is a great basic concepts book for young children . They can learn colors , positional words such as over / under , on / off , up / down , opposites and more . The older child will enjoy reading it themselves . It is packed full of basic sight words . Besides being educational , it is fun !
5 #### Although my parents frequently tell me I was reading from cereal boxes and newpapers before this , the first time I vividly remember reading a book was sitting in my Aunt 's lap and happily stammering through " Go Dog Go . " The many colors of dogs and the way they got around intrigued me as a four year old and my ( no pun intended ) dog eared copy of P.D. Eastman 's Suess - like rhymes stayed on my shelf for a long time after I 'd grown out of this leavel of learning skill . Get it for your youngsters , it will make them happy to try and follow along .
5 #### This was one of my favorites as a child . It became a favorite of my daughter 's as well . Now my son is hooked on it . The book starts simply . " Dog " is the only word on the page . That sets up the theme . We quickly are taken through comparisons and colors . Black , white , red , blue , yellow , green , in , out , up , down , big , small , stop , go , over and under . Add some simple numbers and the book gains real substance . But then we have the two plots . First is the " Do you like my hat ? " story that runs to the book 's conclusion . The other is dogs on the go . They run around , go to sleep , wake up , drive away fast , and finally all congregate at the top of a tree . Great Eastman illustrations and fun vocabulary will entertain most children

Great Eastman illustrations and fun vocabulary will entertain most children
5 #### This book is timeless . I loved it as a child and I love it as an adult . The pictures are great for kids . As an adult , I love the pictures as much as my son . The text is simple , but in a style that is enticing to young children , and allows kids to recite the story aloud after a few readings . And for the few adult critics who say the text is not sophisticated enough for them but their kids love it , - gimme a break - it 's a CHILDREN ' book for crying out loud .
5 #### This book is an oldie but goodie . It brings back fond memories from my own childhood . Unlike other so - called " classics " that show their age with flaws ( such as " Pat the Bunny"-- which exemplifies the typical stomach - turning smarmy 40 's or 50 's household and bland illustrations ) , this one is fun and shows its age with STYLE and humor ( with 60's - style cars and poodles ) . But best of all , this is a great book because CHILDREN love it , and it 's a beginner book that they 'll start to memorize and read ! Despite all of the books we 've collected to read to our toddler , she requests this one again and again . The words are simple and easy to learn , and children are drawn to the lovable dogs . As an adult , dogs are so amazingly appropriate as the main characters . I mean , what other animals " GO " like dogs ? Dogs always seem to want to go somewhere or be busy , or join a " dog party ! " and they are all different and unique , just like the ones in this book !
5 #### I love this book ! The hats that the girl dog always wears are absolutely wonderful ! I especially like the one she wears when she is skiing ! It is taller than she is ! The boy dog is rude ! The dog party is wonderful ! I wish I could go to a party in a big tree !
5 #### A fantastic colorful book filled with wonderful illustrations and little sub - stories . It stimulates a child 's imagination while teaching him numbers , colours and social skills . How about the child is counting the dogs in the bed and the ones underneath the bed . Or seeing all the things the dogs are doing in their treetop party - the big dogs , little dogs , yellow , red , blue , pink and green dogs . This will be great fun for any child aged 4 - 8 , and will not only be educational , but it is something she will remember for the rest of her life .
5 #### I remember this book and the " do you like my hat " exchange from when I was a kid . I just bought it for my kid . I never remember getting tired of it . It 's all over the place and fun . I do n't even like dogs and I love it . There 's something about it 's organization that really appeals to a kid 's mind . It must be my kid memory but it seemed like the copy I bought had lower - quality illustrations than I remember . Every child deserves to be read this book along with " Where the Wild Things Are " and other classics .
4 #### " Go , Dog . Go ! " presents a simple , although somewhat disjointed , story that slowly , gradually builds toward " a big dog party " at the end . The book is filled with basic , fundamental adjectives ( big , little ) , colors ( black , white , blue , red , green , yellow ) , numbers ( one , two , three ) , prepositions ( in , out , on , up , down , over , under , around , to ) , verbs ( go , stop ) , and nouns ( night , day ) . It is a delightful 61 - page book for the beginner / elementary reader .
4 #### This is a great introduction to the wonderful world of Dr Seuss . It 's short , it 's fun and the premise is less reliant on a child 's comprehension skills than many of the other Dr Seuss book . My son has loved this book since the age of 18 months , when the likes of " Cat in the Hat " were too long or confusing for him . It always makes me smile too !
5 #### My daughter started liking this book around age 2 . Now at every traffic light I hear " Stop dogs stop the light is red " and etc . It is a typical Dr. Suess book , and they 're just classics ! I just bought a bunch of board books for a shower gift , and this book was one in the bunch .
5 #### This book is horrible ! It is n't realistic at all ! Dogs ca n't talk and drive cars ! Just kidding ! This was and still is one of my favorite children 's books . I learned to read , reading this book and others like it . I also learned to draw cars . Unlike the dog in the book , I actually did like the lady dog 's hat ! One of the ( lesser ) reasons I could n't wait to have children , was so that I could fill up my bookshelf with this and other cherished childhood classics .
5 #### My all time favorite children 's book . Big Dog . Little Dog . My son 's first word was " dog " . I loved this book when my teens were little and my little one ( currently 6 months ) will sit through most of this book ( sometimes all ) when I read it to her now . It is a great " first reader " as the words are common and the pictures offer help in that when one reads " One big dog going in . " and " Two little dogs going out . " the picture shows just that . There are red , yellow and green trees , dogs " over the water " , dogs " under the house " and lots more word pictures that are fun to read and easy to learn by . The three dogs having a party on a boat at night is just about my favorite line but I still get the most fun when it is night and the dogs are supposed to be asleep and one little one is laying in bed with his eyes wide open . Simply put every child should have this book in their library and reading it to a child should start at a very young age . My highest possible recommendation .
5 #### A few weeks ago , a friend of mine purchased this book for my son , after he fell in love with it at their house . My wife had previously told me about this book , mentioning that my 3 - year - old son loved it . After having this book for a few weeks , this is still a book that my son requests regularly . On an educational note , this book is a stealth teacher . It teaches , red and green , stop and go , up and down , over and under , asleep and awake , and even tries to touch on manners some . I highly recommend this book for parents that have children 2 - 3 years old .
5 #### This book has been taped and taped so many times because it is so loved . My Kinder boy loves reading it to my preschooler . Of course the very favorite part is viewing the dog party at the end , which I remember as a child . The simple illustrations offer visual clues to the wording of the book . After reading this a few hundred times , your 3 year old will " read " it to you . A good one !
5 #### ... The book is simply a metaphor for life , as we see dogs running , playing , relaxing , spear - fishing , diving , driving like mad ( hmmm , a none - too - subtle early 1960s promotion of America 's car culture & # 8211 ; or perhaps criticism thereof ? ) , but in the end , enjoying themselves and experiencing life to the fullest , as in the final big , dog party on the treetop . This is Eastman 's exhortation for us to get off the couch , go out and suck the marrow out of life . Of course , this is not a manifesto for unbridled self - fulfillment at the expense of others , as seen in the & # 8220;bird - crossing&#8221 ; episode , i.e. do n't step on anyone 's toes . Also , the hat interludes show that honesty and sincerity are always the best policies in interpersonal relationships . Very nice lessons for life presented in a simple format with gripping illustrations .
5 #### This is just the way my toddler likes it , LOL . A short book with lots of neat pictures and lots of dogs . She is currently in love with dogs at the moment . Her favorite part is the very end at the " dog party " .
1 #### Go , Dog , Go ! is one of the true classics for very young children . It is also unusually long -- 50 + pages . That clearly posed a problem for the creators of the shortened board version . Their " solution , " though , is dreadful . They did n't just shorten the book , they rewrote it from scratch ! This little board book has flat , toneless prose , with none of the effortless whimsy of the original . Treat your baby to the * real * Go , Dog , Go ! My 13 - month old daughter happily sits through the full version , and enjoys the way it builds up to its big ending . You may end up with a couple of torn pages , but it 's an honorable fate for a book to be loved to death .
5 #### If I can still remember my mother reading this book to me -- especially the dog party in the tree at the end -- after nearly 40 years , this has to be a fairly memorable literary work . Of course , now that I have a little daughter of my own , I can recite the entire book by heart , having read it at least 2,000 times a day for the past year . Granted , I have an excellent memory and ( as fans of my other reviews already know ) a firm grasp of what makes a book a true classic in children 's literature . As they say here in Tennessee , " This one 's a breeder ! "
5 #### This little board book is perfect in size and shape for toddlers on the go . We use it ( along with other Bright & Early Board Books ) for our 2 year old when we travel , go to grandma 's house or to a resturant . After several readings , our son delighted in telling us the story in his own words . It 's the perfect length that young children can both comprehend and remember the whole story . The illustrations are simple enough for a small child , yet detailed enough to give our two year old something to study . Our copy is well used .
1 #### This is a terrible adapation of the orignal Go Dog Go . When adapting it for a board book format , the editors lost most of the fun in the original language . Many of the pictures do n't make sense with the new words , and you 'll wonder how this ever could have been a " classic " Buy the original . It 's only a few dollars more , and well worth the price and the risk of a few ripped pages .
5 #### I was well into my 30s before I realized that this was not a Dr. Seuss book . Given that it 's issued in the same size and binding , I 'd always assumed it was written by Seuss . My realization that it was written and illustrated by P.D. Eastman cleared one of my largest childhood confusions : I * loved * " Go Dog Do , " and merely * liked * " The Cat in the Hat . " Years later I realize that Eastman 's art is funny , while Seuss 's is fantastic , and I prefer the former to the latter . As another reviewer mentioned , you can stare at these dogs for a long time -- there 's incredible depth to the expressions and postures of these seemingly simple illustrations . The insomniac dog who sleeps through the next morning 's reveille is a favorite ! The repetitive narration is similarly hypnotic , and you 'll quickly find some of the expressions creeping into your every day dialog . All in all , my very favorite childhood book , and one of the few that I still re - read a few times a year . [ 2000 hyperbolium dot com ]
5 #### This is the book I picked when my daughter Jesse showed signs of wanting to learn how to really read , and it was a great choice . The vocabulary is tight--71 words ( I wrote them out separately to help Jesse!)--and presented very well , with simple , exciting and fun illustrations . All the activity involves dogs -- blue dogs on red trees , big and little dogs , dogs in cars , in mazes , in boats and on rooftops . The text of the first five pages is : " Dog./Big dog./Little dog./Big dogs and little dogs./Black and white dogs . " ; this is perfect for a child learning to read , with the repetition building confidence very quickly . The artwork is good and straightforwardly entertaining ; perhaps not up to Dr. Seuss ' standards , but then very little is . Jesse loves this book , and recommends it as strongly as I do .
5 #### My kitchen is under construction - and all I have access to is a refrigerator and a microwave - and although I am handy with both - they are just not enough to make the recipes that are in this beautiful book ! ! ! So I ca n't comment on the recipes - but the pictures alone are good enough to eat ! ! !
5 #### Mr. Higgins can write in less pages and enter greater action and background than most writers can in double the pages . This book not only gives the real feel of the South American jungle , but it attributes to the competivness of man with a women tied in . There is no doubt in my mind of his ability and I will someday have read all of his books . This is now my twenty third .
5 #### Nice change from the usual Higgins fare . Very entertaining . Fast paced as always and the best of endings . I love Higgins , not just for his writing style , but the book is not overlong . Great rainy day read .
5 #### Anyone who flys or wish they flyer will like this book . Great adventure read by the master , Jack Higgins .
5 #### I love jack Higgins and all his books are great .
5 #### A good read . A lot of adventure and just enough intrigue to make it interesting .
5 #### The time is several years after World War 1 when former war flying ace Sam Hannah , while flying mail along the Negro River in Brazil comes across an old biplane literally coming apart in the air along his route . He directs Neil Mallory to a grassy clearing where the plane eventually is destroyed as it touches down . Hannah lands himself , hurriedly gets him in the plane and takes back off before their activity attracts the attention of hostile natives . From this point Mallory goes to work for Hannah to earn money to return to home in England . The story progresses to the native attack and massacre of nuns and the priest at the nearby settlement and two nuns arrive to return to the church and Neil and Sam find themselves on a rescue mission to save these nuns . The further into the book you go , the harder it is to put down . An excellent Jack Higgins thriller .
5 #### This is a dated story from the Cold War days involving Nazis , Communists , and a pair of lovers caught in the middle of a search for mysterious box which holds the names of former Nazi collaborators , some of whom are now living innocent lives . The collaborators want it so their pasts will remain secret ; the neo Nazis want it for blackmail in hopes the people named will be forced to help them again and the Communists want it just because they 're nasty ! ! It 's a good read with history thrown in and lots of suspense .
3 #### Liked the scenic descriptions . Had to smile at some of the old technology . Have read most of her books at least once .
5 #### Suspenseful and interesting journey back in time ... the navet is odd at some points reading in current times -- but a clear view into Helen McInnes ' knowledge of the methods & thinking of those years . Excellent read .
4 #### I 'm really happy I started reading her . I read Assignment in Brittany just before this one . I note that her reviews from readers are mostly excellent . In fact , of the three people who gave her one or two stars , one was clearly an accident as the book was praised by the reviewer . There is something comfortable about her writing . She develops her plot slowly , but builds suspense and the characters are interesting enough that you can wait . Her heroes are talented , but far from the unrealistic super heroes that are so common and overdone in modern action fiction . The ending is not forced but is part of a natural progression and it is not all happy endings all around . I like her and am going to read more .
5 #### What a joy to discover Helen MacInnes ! I stumbled on her name when reading a book review here . Although this book was written in 1968 it is as fresh and current as the most recent spy novels I 've read . This book is meticulously invented , clearly laid out and when discoveries are revealed , there 's no letup in the suspense . Innocence leads to discovery which leads to a complicated unraveling . And just when it seems resolution has arrived , there 's more to uncover . Totally engrossing and I recommend it highly to aficionados of spy intrigues ...
5 #### Still a terrific read even after all these years . MacInnes was a fantastic story teller with great character development and loads of plot twists .
5 #### Even though I read " The Salzburg Connection " when it was first published , more than 40 years ago , I enjoyed re - reading it as much as I 'd enjoyed it the first time . I loved being back in Salzburg , a city I have visited many times . When the Tomiselli Caf was mentioned , I felt homesick . The book itself is well written and suspenseful to the end . The characters are well developed and since the book was written 0ver3 40 years ago , the plot is interesting from an historical point of view . I enjoyed re - reading the book and I would recommend it .
5 #### Helen MacInnes writes great books . Have complete collection of her books in paperback but was wanting to get the digital ones for my Kindle . Am so glad they have finally digitized them ! Her books are a realistic glimpse into the life of those undercover agents who fight unknown and unrewarded to guard the freedom we accept as our given right . Or the underground fight during WWII in Europe often with amateurs walking the tightrope of an innocent abroad while helping those who worked to see the Allies won the war .
3 #### Too many characters to keep up with . Drags along . Kept waiting for the pace to pick up . Put it down half way through .
5 #### This was a great read . Exciting from page one to the end . I only put the novel down to eat and go to the bathroom . I recommend to anyone that loves thrillers .
5 #### No name is more closely identified with action thrillers than that of Jack Higgins , and this is Higgins at his best . With a solid plot and sharply drawn characters , it 's a hard book to put down . A hearty recommendation for anyone looking for a little literary excitement .
5 #### One of authors early novels which hold your interest from the first page . His early novels are some of his best work .
5 #### As always his work is great . His tale set in South America is a good change from the more stories of current times .
5 #### Jack Higgins can be always be depended on for a good story , a good read and every thing else that makes a top drawer writer .
4 #### Much suspense . A good read . An opportunity to read about the amazon of long ago in a novel .
5 #### A great read , of courage , the foolishness of love , and persistence aplenty ! Love and life of another time and in another place , few can but imagine .
4 #### I read this decades ago when it was first published , and I 'm happy to say that it still holds up well in the spy / romance department . Lots of twists and surprises , intriguing characters , some thrills and chills . The technology of s[y craft has definitely moved on from this period - as has technology in general - , so I admit to skipping over some of the exposition . But MacInnes is a master , and I stayed up several nights reading later than I should ...
2 #### Just a so - so read . Some nice character development but lazy plot management .....
4 #### A wonderful intriguing spy novel by a master spy author . I have read and re - read most of her work and recommend them all . If you have missed Helen MacInnes , please try any of them . She ranks with Greene and Ambler as the best .
5 #### another great book by Helen MacInnes - plenty of suspense , very well written , great description of Austria
4 #### I read all of Helen MacInnes books years ago . I loved them then and I am loving reading them all over again .
4 #### This 1968 novel holds up well in a world of Jack Bauer , fx 's The Americans , and Homeland . I could n't wait to see what happened next .
5 #### The cold war was a part of my growing up , and Helen MacInnes captures all the excitement and tension that went along with that period . It was a time of national pride and responsibility as a citizen . Great read !
5 #### Helen Macinnes is a superb writer . Her characters and plot are tight and well drawn . The action is relentless and full of suspense . Just a great read .
5 #### Love her books ; I rate her up there with Alistair MacLean . The plots catch me up in the story line and there have been times when I 've read all night to finish a book of hers .
5 #### This book brings the reader directly into the South American jungle in the earlier part of the twentieth century . With good descriptions , emotional impact and characterization , the book is very entertaining . The adventure leaves the reader wanting more .
4 #### HIggins is always a good read . May he write forever .
3 #### DON't know why I keep reading these as there is little character development , but the story is fast paced and holds my attention while it 's in my hand .
3 #### This book was okay , but not in the same area of intrigue Higgens ' is know for . It has a few good plots but nothing to write home about .
5 #### This was a great Higgins tale , set in the depths of the Amazon . It was such a change in scene for most of Higgins stories and painted that time in the vast Amazon basin with great realism . Then add the adventure and turns of events , and one has a truly " ca nt put it down story " .
3 #### Ordered this book for my personal collection . I 'm a big fan of Jack Higgins . This was an older book and I could not find it locally , but was able to secure a copy by ordering through Amazon . It arrived well within the alloted time frame and was well packaged . Thanks Amazon for being the on - line store I can alway count on ... EP
4 #### British pilot Neil Mallory would have crashed into the South American jungles on his Vega plane and ended his life had it not been for a coincidental appearance of Sam Hannah in another plane who guided him to a landing spot in the wilderness . Brought to remote town of Manaus , Neil had his money and passport stolen . He avoided being pressed into work - gangs only when taking employment under Sam as a pilot . Neil wanted to go home , and this seemed to be the only way . But nothing was certain in the jungle . Sam Hannah was one person who could be a hero one moment and the devil the next . Slowly , Neil found himself getting more and more involved in the local problems . Huna natives had massacred a missionary outpost . Neil found himself tangled in the official response , and in two women , one a missionary determined to revive the mission , the other in search of her missing sister who was a nun at the mission . Set in the lush jungles where humans had to live like animals to survive , Jack Higgins painted a very lively action with colourful characters . Each have a different raison d'etre , and for some , surviving was not one .
5 #### Helen MacInnes wrote many books . This " The Salzburg Connection ' and " Assignment in Brittany ' are two favorites . So much in fact that I want to travel to Salzburg in the area it was set .
4 #### This book , although written decades ago , is pure fun . Helen Macinnes had a great formula and never faltered . Reading them today is like reading a travel guide with a bit of a mystery thrown in . I read her books when I was a young adult and am enjoying them once again as I travel in Europe as an older adult .
5 #### I believe that I may posted a review elsewhere on Amazon . I read this during summer of 2011 when I had bought a used edition . I would rate this as one of her top four novels . I also enjoyed the Double Image that I read at about the same time . To me , the Nazi plot , still was interesting , and the cast of characters was quite good . The story involves a Nazi chest that is hidden in an Austrian lake and contains blackmail materials to the western sympathizers of Germany . The Russians , Nazis and the West all race to find the chest . I also enjoyed the atmosphere from Austria . I have always enjoyed HM 's writing style : it really brings the locations to life . Her books also have plenty of danger and tension but contain minimal violence and more romance than random sexual encounters . I liked her books as a teenager and would recommend them to yourself or your family members if they can get over no e - mail and i - phones issues . They are slightly dated . The male - female roles are more out of the James Bond era . However , I think her books do hold up better than I. Fleming 's do . The women are more interesting - smarter and more independent , although you get the feeling that every female character wants to be married before she turns 25 .
3 #### I read and enjoyed all of the MacInnes books when they first came out and now that they are available on for Kindle I thought I 'd try one to see if the books hold up . Unfortunately , this one has n't . Looking back , I suppose a lot of her books ' original appeal was due to the " red / nazi menace " and the locations which are n't as attention grabbing or exotic as they were at the time . But the biggest disappointment was the writing style . First , everything is told in a matter of fact manner without any tension or suspense . Second , a large share of the book is dedicated exposition -- people thinking about what to do , people describing why they did things and people explaining why other people did things . In one instance one of the characters is surprised in his home by two gun men and his internal debate about whether to run or jump the gun men goes on for two pages . I ended up skimming the last half of the book . The style of the book reminds me a lot of some of the TV series of the day such as The FBI or Barnaby Jones that went to extreme lengths to make sure the viewers never had any uncertainty about what was happening . Too bad .
5 #### I have read all her work once and am now going through them a second time . This is the best of a group of extremely good reads . Do n't mis it .
4 #### An exciting , plausible plot , good people you liked , villains you did n't and questions you pondered . Worth reading again and again .
3 #### I realize this was an old timer but it was very well done The characters were believable the plot was worked out with care and the . End was believable an enjoyable read
3 #### Three stars as the book was too contrived and it became too complicated . Not at all realistic . Difficult to even care what happens . Mel Hill
5 #### I am biased . I love all of Helen Macinnes ' books . This was possibly my favorite though , and still is . Her plots are constantly evolving . Just when you think you are nearing the end , the plot takes a turn .
5 #### I thoroughly enjoyed Ms MacInnes 's books many years ago and find them no less enjoyable now . How much is fact , how much fiction ? Who cares , this is simply a very entertaining book .
3 #### I usually love Helen Macinnes but this one , in my opinion , was not up to snuff . It was O.K. but I had no trouble putting it down There were too many characters , or , perhaps , the characters were not terribly interesting .
5 #### A good read as well as an accurate portrayal of the political climate of the times . I have enjoyed reading all of this author 's books !
5 #### Another great story . I would review all her books at once , if possible , with the same enjoyment and pleasure . Even though I reread her books once a year ! I just wanted to have some on my Kindle to read handily .
5 #### I have been waiting for a very long time to re - read Helen MacInnes 's books . They are wonderful stories , well written .
5 #### I wo n't spoil the ending , but this begins beside a cold dark lake in Austria in the early 60 's . The Nazi 's are still a hidden menace , the Eastern bloc is a big problem and the Western allies like England and America are n't completely trusting each other . Who can we trust ? What kind of people are around us ? A certain necessary degree of paranoia forms the backdrop of this thriller , and it is a page turner . The author does a great job drawing character out of the people in the book , no cardboard cutout types , everyone is both good and bad to varying degrees and everyone has their own motivation for what they do . They all collide of course , some die , some live . I love her writing , and I 'm so glad her books are coming out on the Kindle finally . I read this in hard copy years ago , and it 's one I like to re read as with all her books .
2 #### Hellen MacInness writes a wondeerful Suspense story , keeps you on the edge of your seat . Covers " current events " of the twentieth century . Excellent writing . Enjoyable read .
5 #### I read every single book by this auther . And I own them all in either hardcover or paperback . I was thrilled when I saw it in Kindle version . Helen MacInnes ' stories are all relevant to the era they were written , starting from pre - World War Two to the Cold War and more recent history . I felt like I was in the stories , which were full of intrigue , caring characters , and exciting plots . What I say about this book , I would say about every book she wrote . I am a huge fan of her .
5 #### I 've been waiting for some time for the Helen MacInnes thrillers to make it into e. My old paper versions are finally falling apart and I was reluctant to purchase them again . The Salzburg Connection is one of MacInnes best . It is post WW II but those Nazis are still active and causing trouble in Europe . All MacInnes stories are detailed and she has no trouble taking you right to the dark lake and making you go diving after terrible secrets in the icy depths . Much in the style of early Alistair Maclean novels , the Salzburg Connection is both horrifying and thrilling .
5 #### One of my favorite thrillers . I was delighted to track down a copy , since mine fell apart and was discarded years ago . Not great literature , but great entertainment for a cold , snowy winter weekend . I 've visited Salzburg a couple of times , and MacInnes captures the feel of the lovely city and the Salzkammergut region . I read all of her books back in the ' 70s , but this is my favorite . Too bad the movie did not do justice to the book . It probably would have worked better as a BBC mini - series .
4 #### Helen MacInees was the top - notch woman spy thriller author from the 1950s-80 's . The Salzburg Connection concerns a secret box hidden by the Germans at the end of the war , and it 's suspected reemergence 20 plus years later . But it acts as magnet for spies from Britain , the U.S. , Russia , Austria , Switzerland , China , Poland , and Czechoslovakia , as well as private citizens and old Nazis . All these s agents try to surveil and spoof each other , bump and run into each other , and shoot and dynamite each other . And needless to say , the enemy is totally remorseless in their evil doings . This may sound confusing , but MacInees compartments each person 's or group 's doings or being done in , very well . This is probably very much like Intel Ops from the past and up to today is run : that the " plan " does not survive its implementation , and everybody has to improvise , bouncing from one decision to another hoping your lousy luck holds . And the consequences of their actions , and their masters ' , as people start dying like flies . And just like the real world , the box 's contents are both boring and utilitarian . Enjoy .
3 #### this was actually pretty good . the opening is great . very detailed . interesting story . there was something about the way the characters acted that did n't convince me completely , though . but well worth a read
5 #### I bought one of MacInnes ' spy thrillers in a small drug store in Kentucky during Christmas vacation in the late sixties and then read them all . For a grad student locked into classroom and homework , it was perfect escapism , a way to travel to exotic places like old Europe and experience the flavor of the WWII era without getting hurt . After MacInnes , nothing else in the mystery category satisfied me , until I accidentally discovered Donna Leon 's Inspector Brunetti and his interesting wife ...
5 #### Certainly it is one of Helen MacInnes ' most suspenseful novels ! In " The Salzburg Connection , " MacInnes once again couples history with the present . This time , however , she does n't have to go back so far . In a deep lake in the Austrian Alps lies a chest filled with Nazi secrets and agents from a number of countries are most eager to get possession of such a potetntial " weapon"--it does n't contain literal treasure , but lists of " who 's who and who 's what " during the Nazi period . It is supposed that there are names in this chest of quite successful individuals who were able to escape their ( hidden ) Nazi past . You can imagine the urgency to get the chest . MacInnes is a master at being in control of her thrillers . Too , she is quite excellent in her description of the settings ; her characterization is also superb . Bill Mathison , a New York lawyer , has the inside track here and must face perilous times in his pursuit . Along the way , he also meets two beautiful women , both of whom are eager to help him , and one of whom is set to betray him . In the most deadly fashion!(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net )
4 #### My fellow fans rejoice ! I believe it was at least 100 pages before someone had sex ! ! Seriously , I just finished reading it and I feel that it was a decent book . I 'll read it a couple more times , so I reserve the right to change my mind . It had plot and action and spooky vampire powers . Good stuff . Still a bit short for me though and too many characters with too little spotlight . Therefore 4 stars .
5 #### Unbelievable , but same as Greg ( who is the other who wrote a review , and he read it in the same month ) , I found this book in a corner of my father 's in law house , I read it and it was a wonderful reading , it was printed in 1974 and is a very good book , if you see it at your parents house just read it , you will enjoy it .
1 #### Well , if it were n't for the continuity errors in this book , I 'd say it was just more of the same . Sex , talk , talk , talk , agonize over Anita 's lost humanity , sex , sex , sex , talk , destroy another formerly wonderful charactger ( Rafael ) , sex , talk , listen to Richard agonize over HIS lost humanity , sex . . . . you get the picture . Bad sex at that . Continuity . . . Willie McCoy 's life love was not some unknown . . . Candy ? ? ? It was Hannah . Reread Burnt Offerings Ms. Hamilton if you need a refresher . At the end of Obsidian Butterfly , Olaf did not take the heart of the vampire while Anita took the head . It was the other way around . Richard . . . what can I say . I do n't know who he represents in LKH 's real life , although we can guess . He has all the components of a very unhappy divorce and justification . Please . . . just kill him off . I 'm sick to death of scene after scene of the reasons why he and Anita are no longer together . You 've already destroyed every other worthwhile character in the book , just kill Richard off . I 'm sure Anita and Jean Claude will survive it .
5 #### People start acting differently when a mask is delivered to Anita and Nathaniel at a movie theater followed by a mask with gold music notes that is delivered to Jean - Claude . This is not normal because the Harlequin seems to know what is happening . They are also controlling the mental processes of those around Anita and Jean - Claude . Well - written suspension drama erotica with well - developed characterization . Adult readers due to violence and sexual content .
5 #### Outstanding book ! Morris West was quite the writer , I 'm just now discovering him . I 've loved every one of his that I 've read so far and want to get the rest ! Harlequin is what I 'd call a corporate thriller , start to finish , no boredom ! Great characterization !
5 #### A very good story . As Anitas powers grow her enemies become more and more dangerous . Many old powers seem drawn to St. Louis and to Anita . This makes for some very scary times .
5 #### Another awesome read . If you have n't read any of her books , start at the beginning of the series , it will make more sense . If you 've read her books before , here is another good one .
5 #### I am re - reading the series ... I ca n't believe Anita has anything to do with richard ! Ugh he is So Very UN - manly ! I do enjoy the vampires and all the animals are fun ! !
5 #### I actually like this book . A ton of Sex sort of repetitive descriptions for sex but it was cool . I like the end battle scene . Still hate Anita and Richard but I love Jean Claude , Asher , Micah and Nathaniel .
2 #### Ug what can I say - thank god it was 200 pages less than the last book - lots and lots of sex and the plot was very hopeful but dull sadly since the focus of the book was mostly all the sex and the build up came and went with a quick tie up at the end . Could have been better and felt like a narcissists masturbation of ego book more than anything -even the main characters were off their game and cruel and sadistic . I already skipped some books since it was not needed and will be skipping ahead again since the books after are reviewed about the same as this one was . Hoping it really does get better like everyone says the series will .
4 #### Definitely better than the last book . I was disappointed about the end ; I expected more . It is always a soapera when it comes to Anita and Richard ( he needs to get the together lol ) .
4 #### I enjoyed this better than her last three . The storyline grabbed me and would n't let me go . It was n't as boring as her last three had been
4 #### The Harlequins have come to judge . Servants of the Mother of Darkness , they corrupt feelings , bringing out the worst . In this book , they bring out awful truths . Anita nearly dies three times , and it forces them all to evaluate their world and their place in it .
5 #### I never put spoilers in my reviews . For adults . To me , a Master Storyteller is as a Master Bard who uses words rather than music to grasp your imagination and make their vision yours . When we had mostly oral- rather than written- history , Master Storytellers were revered . They traveled from tribe to tribe , settlement to settlement , etc . , gathering history - to - be and sharing news , history , tradition , and so on , bringing it to life for their listeners . Today this rare talent is shared in print and has the potential to reach millions . Ms. Hamilton has that talent and we are , blessed , is the only word that comes to mind , that she shares it with us . While great , these are n't easy stories , nor for the faint of heart . You do n't so much suspend belief as you just believe . They embody life and love and hate and death in a rich tapestry that simply takes you in and makes you lose time . It 's no wonder she is one of the top bestselling authors . Read , believe , and come away richer for the experience .
4 #### Ms. Hamilton creates such great characters and this chapter of the Anita Blake Vampire series , does not disappoint . New awesome vampires and characters introduced . Never get tired of the main characters either . Nice to have Edward back . Great read .
5 #### Still one of my favorite series I love it
5 #### I like these books a lot . I have reran them several times over .
5 #### I usually do n't review the Anita Blake series books .... though I 'm so in love with this wonderful character . But I really loved this book above al the others .... so far . What started out as a nice date - night with Nathaniel to celebrate his and Anita 's almost - anniversary ( do n't ask ) turns into a scary situation . While in the ladies room Anita finds a box with her name on it and in it is a mask .... hmmm , sounds innocent enough right ? We 're talking Anita Blake here , so no it is n't . She calls her sweetie Jean - Claude about it and the first thing he asks is .... what color is the mask ? Turns out they have been contacted by the metaphysical worlds version of the bogey - man ..... The Harlequin ..... sort of the vampire worlds police , only these guys are way scary . All Anita 's books are amazing to read , but this one was especially exciting for me . Plus we get to see Anita 's old buddies Edward and the crazy psycho .... Olaf .... who is now a U.S. Marshall too .... yeah right , what was the government thinking on that one ? Also Richard , another of Anita 's on again - off again boyfriends is in very rare form in this story . I so want to smack this guy sometimes ..... then kiss his pretty face . I found myself on the edge of my seat reading this and laughing out loud or saying .... oh s * * * the next . Anita Blake has quite the interesting - never - a - dull- moment kinda life . Kudos to Laurell K. Hamilton on this one ! !
5 #### I ca n't get enough ! My absolute favorite series . A must read .
5 #### Love it so much for the next few weeks I 'll be reading more of the series and I love it
5 #### I enjoy the Anita Blake Vampire series very much and have spent a considerable amount of time getting to know all the many characters .
5 #### Book came in good condtion.love this series.must read if you like true blood
4 #### I love Laurell Hamilton 's work . Anita Blake is such a compelling heroine . Sexy , tough , vulnerable and honorable . Quite a compelling combination . There were a few times in this book when her inner conflict seemed forced , but otherwise another worthy title in this long - running series .
5 #### she has done a great job with this charachter and I hope she can keep from falling down the rabbit hole .
5 #### Good read for the series . Looking forward to my next one .
5 #### This book is just as amazing as the others !
5 #### I love Danse Macabre one of the best ones yet ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Finally something a little down to earth Anita 's pregnancy ! Do n't lose out on reading this one . I have almost all the books that are of Anita Blake in audio . I am disappointed that not all the books , namely books 10 - 15 , are not in audible & I had to get them in kindle . I can not understand why audible canceled these . The way they do it is almost like watching a movie or going to a play . I just love all the sound effects & wish more of the audible books where like these . The lame excuse that they are no longer in print is annoying since it is n't true . Besides . what does that have to do with the audio ver of the books ? ? ?
5 #### Another great book and still liking where it is going . The back story or short lines about the other 15 books gets annoying sometimes but I guess if do n't read them back to back it helps remember who every one is . I am on a Anita Blake marathon and it is awesome to just keep reading instead of waiting for the next book to come out . I think this might be my new annual marathon of reading , kind of like having a Buffy the vampire slayer week end marathon . Happy reading !
4 #### Pretty good . I liked the earlier books better but ca n't seem to stop reading them !
5 #### This is a combination of a narrative poem and a collection of morality poems . The story of the narrative poem is that a wise man ( i.e. the Prophet ) , Almustafa , is about to sail away from his recent -- but temporary -- home on Orphalese , and he s asked to speak on a range of topics so the people of Orphalese can gather his wisdom before he goes . In 26 chapters , the prophet expounds on each topic upon which he is questioned . Topics include relationships , possessions , laws , religion , teaching , and death . The wisdom presented is practical , profound , and reflects a mystic sentiment ( i.e. the idea that the divine is within us rather than something separate . ) This is an extremely quotable volume . Among his responses , the Prophet says that one should not be too controlling in relationships , that one should not live life under the dictates of fear , that its not for one to determine what is moral for another , and that one should not engage in morality or worship for show . Ill keep my review short as the book is tiny and certainly worth your time . I d recommend this book for all readers . I think it has some insight to offer just about anyone .
2 #### I am VERY disappointed in this book . I have always love " The Prophet , " by Kahlil Gibran , and have owned many copies over the years . I lent our copy to my sister - in - law , and just decided to buy a new one . This one was described in this way : " This edition is illustrated with Gibran 's famous visionary paintings . " However , there are NO illustrations ! ! ! ! I would have NOT bought this book . I may still return it . SO upset about this !
4 #### A timeless book where Kahlil Gibran eloquently deciphers The Prophet and words of scripture through a personal way of reflection . The context however differing from Biblical scripture , is indeed parallel to the overall essence of who Jesus the Messiah , known as the Prophet or teacher truly was and remains to be .
5 #### I 've never read anything that expressed a more romantic view on life . If you like elegant poetry this is for you .
5 #### I Loved it Anita is my hero . I wait to see where she goes from here . Hamilton knows How to keep you wanting more .
4 #### This is really an excellent book , one of Morris West 's best books , and I 'm a bit puzzled to find myself giving it only four stars . Perhaps that is because it is so dense , so full of complicated plot twists , so sophisticated . I like my novels a little easier to read , a little less erudite . George Harlequin is erudition carried to its extreme ... the perfect European . His friend Paul Desmond , who narrates this reckless financial race for survival , is envious of Harlequin and in love with his wife . Yet he gives his all for his friend , risking much more than mere money . While his elite friend fights for his life in a hospital , Paul meets with a mysterious man " who sleeps in a coffin " , Aaron Bogdanovich , who " traded in terror and very expensive flowers . " It is a wild ride , reminiscent of the financial Crash of 2008 ; frightening , well - told , and a good read . You may not read it more than once , but it is more than worthy to be read . Savor it . The stakes could hardly be higher ... success or death . All for the sake of a man he envies .
5 #### This came as expected . No issues . I 'm glad I could find what I needed . Love this series .
4 #### Good read . I enjoy all Anita Blake 's except novellas . Short on action long on sex
5 #### Great story excellent writing . Morris West is the best storyteller of the modern writers . An absorbing read .
1 #### This series has turned out to have way too many sexual situations for my liking .
5 #### I love this series . I never get tired of reading . I love the characters because they seem real to me .
5 #### This should be given to every graduate or newlywed couple you know .
5 #### If you can spell " classic " you need to read this book .
5 #### I 've loved this little book since I was young . I am now going to give it as gifts to people I think would like it and could gain some knowledge from it
5 #### I will recommend this book to every ages .. This is one of the best book I 've read so far .. Full of wisdoms that we can apply in our real lives ..
1 #### Like some other writings , this is presented as though by a gifted , mystical prophet who has great knowledge . Actually , it is largely convoluted , flowery language which might baffle and intimidate some people . The book is only 96 pages long . The printed area on the pages is about 15 % less than what is available , and many of the pages are partial , owing to the end of a " chapter " . There are 28 " chapters " whose titles appear only in the table of contents , not in the text . The figures in the book are of naked people milling about . I 'm sure some people would say I 'm just not smart enough or dedicated enough to wring deep meaning from this work . I say the emperor has no clothes .
5 #### One of my favorite poets and philosophers of all time .
3 #### SPOILER ALERT-- One thing I never understand in the Anita Blake books , after the storyline in Narcissus in Chains : if everyone knows Anita is a succubus , why do they still give her s * * * ? If she literally needs sex to survive , and EVERYONE in the books knows it , why do they keep arguing with her about it ? ( i.e. , Richard , Jean - Claude 's guards , other preternatural beings in the series who know about it )
3 #### Although there was a lot going on in the harlequins that made it exciting , it still made me feel like I was reading the lyrics to the never ending song .
5 #### I like that there was finally some non - straight romantic partnering . Once more Anita kicks booty while being the succulent succubus .
5 #### Thank you , it 's a wonderful book , a good read .
5 #### I 'd pick this up if you 're looking for a good read . Definitely worth the money .
5 #### I never could really put it down . I am better for reading this wonderful book . I will undoubtedly read it again and again .
1 #### This is n't the worst book in the series , that 's Bullet , but it is the one that made me think the author had been hit by a train or car and she was writing from a deep coma . I knew the character of Anita was not coming back and I went looking for other readers who were trying to make sense of the series slide . Anita has become a terrible person . She goes a long way to prove that in later books . In this one she sentences the leader of the lions to death for the crime of not sleeping with her . Oh noes ! What an awful guy for wanting to stay true to his wife ! Anita is totally all about her lady parts and there is barely any plot . Check it out from the library ; it 's at least readable .
5 #### I ca nt stop reading these books I have no idea what i m going to do with my time once I finish the series ! ! ! I am totally in love with the characters and the story behind all of them and the love triangle going on ! ! ! !
5 #### A classic . I find new meaning in it every time I 've read it over the years . Beautifully written in Gibran 's inimitable , majestic style .
5 #### This is by far my favorite book of all time . The wisdom is timeless and poetic . A true guide for living a life of integrity told through a story of the Prophet . LOVE it !
5 #### WOWoWOW - Laurell K Hamilton just keeps getting better and better with each book I read in the Anita Blake series . I just ca n't put them down ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Another gem of a read ........
5 #### This was a book I purchased for my kindle , Not sure how this could be considered a good or bad purchase . Worked fine on my kindle and my iPhone kindle app .
5 #### As with all of Laurell K. Hamilton 's work this is another wonderful piece of literary craftsmanship . This series is one of the best I have ever read . Her Anita Blake as well as her Meredith Gentry series of books are great works .
5 #### book was exciting with all types of metaphysical twists and turns that held a gripping interest and unable to put book down . at times author gets too involved with explanation s but made up for it with adventures that makes an excellent storyline . I think Anita has too much on her plate but makes her more interesting for reader . good series for anyone who enjoys a story out of ordinary or " normal " life ( how boring ) .
5 #### I love this series ! Erotic , full of deceit , action , love , sex , female humor , match of wits , and so more ! Definitely one of the best of a great series !
5 #### GREAT READ ! HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE SERIES AND I CANT WAIT TO CONTINUE READING THIS SERIES . GREAT WORK HAMILTON ! Amazing
1 #### The last readable book of this series was Cerulean Sins . After that you better tell yourself that there are no other Anita Blake 's books out there , it is better for you and your economy , really , that garbage is not worth anyone 's time .
2 #### Less than exciting romances of Anita , who seems more interested in sex and the city than solving crimes . I 've been reading several of Laurell 's Anita novels and was jumping back into it after around Book 10 . It 's more of the same -- major force in the supernatural world , Anita might be able to handle it , some angst regarding who loves who the best . I remember with nostalgia the Anita of Book 1 , interesting , exciting supernatural detective novels ; the struggle between what society considers these beings to be and Anita overcoming her own prejudices . Alas , no more . Story : Once you slog through 200 plus pages of soap opera and softcore porn , you finally get some storyline . It 's a power struggle between Anita 's group and the vampires pretending to be Harlequin . Some characters die , others are inspired . Richard is just an idiot as one can see once one reads the book through . I wonder how his lack of courage will affect the Triumphate . Not really that interested . The true Hamilton fan will probably enjoy it . I believe this is the 15th entry . Laurell Hamilton needs to return to Anita 's roots as a supernatural detective rather than a Dark Shadows soap opera queen .
5 #### Love Hamiltion - Blake series - Love all of the Guys ! Micah and Nath are the best ! ! But - Still love Richard and Jean - Claude ! ! !
5 #### Absolutely my favorite book to read and give as a gift .
5 #### This is a classic . I kept a copy at the office and loaned it to anyone who was waiting for someone else . The Prophet always came back .
4 #### Classic spiritual text . Worth reading as it forms a basis for a lot of contemporary spiritual books . A book to come back to again and again depending on your stage of life .
5 #### I am spellbound reading Khalil Gibrans The Prophet . It is one of those books that a poet writes in rapture . When the higher consciousness murmured Her sweet nothings too close to a mans ears , and he was awake enough to grab a pen and jot down what She just whispered .
4 #### Love Anita and her weirdo abilities , and I love her group of handsome monster boyfriends . Always dark and always sexy .
5 #### The narration was proof that the story keeps growing . The series is good . A Lot of people complain that that she has ruin the series and spoiled this series but in actuality the series had to grow if it did n't it would have died . The series grew and I love it . If you do n't like it write your own . I have totally loved watching these characters developing and grow . I could continue rambling on but I will close my comments with this , keep on growing Anita .
5 #### I really enjoy Laurell 's Anita Blake books . The Anita Blake character is portrayed as a very strong person . Sometimes , I wonder if she is portrayed to strongly .
5 #### I thought this series was great up until about book 11 Cerulean Sins . Then it seemed liked it was all about sex and trying to see how many different ways Hamilton could come up with to introduce a new lover and a long dram out graphic sex scene . This one actually had a good story line and I think it 's easier for me to skip the sex and get on with the story . I had almost given up the series but this one draws me back into the drama . There 's still way too much back and forth over what 's right and what 's wrong when it 's clear to readers what 's going to be the out come but hopefully some of that ( Richard ) is cut out with the next books .
5 #### I am such a huge fan of hers . I do n't think she has one book that I do n't like . I hope she keeps going forever .
5 #### Beautiful writing . It is a comfort to the soul .
5 #### This book arrived almost immediately . Great service . It 's a gift for a granddaughter that I hope she will love as much as I do .
5 #### Laurell K. Hamilton does a nice job of not over summerizing the series up till " now " in her books so that it is both possible to read out of order but even better when reading in order you do n't have to skip a whole bunch of info you already know . This is a great series of " close to reality fantasy " if the modern world included vampires and were animals , and lots and lots of sex with multiple partners and a multitude of murders . Books are well written for " mind candy " .
5 #### I have already read this book in the paperback form , however , am happy to be adding it to my collection of the hard cover collection of this series . Laurell K. Hamilton is an amazing author and I would recommend her Anita Blake series and her Meredith Gentry series to anyone .
5 #### its a good series and i would definitely suggest that people read it . i have read part of them so far and love it .
5 #### great book I love this series . I do think she could have done more with the main part of the story .
4 #### The harlequin is a great book . Helps explain more about the mother of all darkness and how she fits into Anita Blake 's life .
5 #### It took me a while to get into the series but I love it now ! I recomend these books they are great
5 #### Purchased this book for my mom , who loves this series and has read every one . She even has the next one pre - ordered
5 #### Real Khalil Gibran .. a nice read ... easy story woven and audience inclusive .. recommended for anyone willing to be inspired and appreciate nature
5 #### It 's easy to see why he is one of the most read poets of all times . Just beautiful and thought provoking imagery throughout !
5 #### I have read " The Prophet " in bits and pieces over the years , but this was the first time I have read it all the way through . It does not disappoint ... until you come to the end , and you realize you are at the END . Such lovely prose ...
5 #### Excellent follow on in this series of Anita Blake and her cohorts . Good read to keep you wanting more of the chaos surrounding her .
5 #### Laurell K. Hamilton is a wonderful author ! The Anita Blake series is the absolute best . I wish it could never end .
5 #### Forget the teeny bop Twilight Saga and dive into the grown - up world of Vampires , Shape - shifters and Zombies . This book will have you going back to the beginning of the series and catching up on how the world of Anita Blake - Vampire Killer developed . Great entry into an outstanding series of books . Scary , sexy , a real page turner . Not for children .
5 #### I 've never read these type books . I live in SC and ordered it for a friend in Texas . She loves the series and raves about it all the time . She has said Laurell Hamilton writes with a lot of explicit sex in her books that I should n't let my teen vampire buffs read the series .
3 #### Ms. Hamilton actually employed the time - honored tradition of multiple plot lines . It is still heavy on the sex - capades and I do n't foresee that EVER going away given the way our heroine has developed ; but , there is more to the story this time around than soft porn imagery . I ca n't say there was a great deal of character development ( except for Malcolm ) but the book was n't drivel . I had to force myself to finish Danse Macabre , this one I did n't .
4 #### Though considered citizens with legal rights , Vampires are still by many named the monsters , evil and frightening . What scares even the baddest of the Vamps?The Harlequin . The Harlequin are not to even be mentioned unless contacted by them and then they are still considered the nameless ones , they are assassins , the Vampire police . Why have they came to St. Louis?Anita is left a mysterious box with a mask inside , seeking answers she goes to Jean - Claude , Master of the City and her boyfriend . Well one of them anyways with the list growing and the want to be added as well . Anita struggles with her feelings on the ardeur and her need to feed along with this new threat come to town . Seeking back - up she calls in Edward who unknown to her not only brings his 16 yr old stepson but Olaf , as if things were n't bad enough . This was a fairly good book with the usual violence and sex that you would expect from Hamilton . Look forward to the next one .
5 #### The Harlequin has to be one of my favorite of the Anita Blake series . I have all the Blake books in paperback , and I recently got the CD at the local library so I could listen to it while I was driving around on my errands . I , like many Anita Blake fans , miss the focus on her being a necromancer , and keep my fingers crossed that we will see more on her abilities as an Animator as the series continues . This book did a great job of twisting the plot line by throwing in the existence of The Harlequin , the super secret policing arm of the Vampire council . I like stories that include Edward ( aka Ted ) ; his character helped make this one of my favorite stories . I think the reason for the spiral [ downwards ] on the ratings from many readers may be due to the fact that the books made a huge plot re - direction in Book # 10 Narcissis In Chains , that drew the plot focus away from Necromancy & Vampire Hunting ( and a shyer , more reserved Anita ) and took a turn towards more sexual - metaphysical relationships . Laurell K Hamilton is a very detailed writer with complex , multi - level plot lines , she has a wonderful talent for building intense scenes with rich attention to story development .
4 #### I 've read all the Anita Blake books but the most recent . I have enjoyed them all and will read them again .
5 #### I bought these for my home bound daughter ( age 21 ) and she loves them . She now has the complete set thanks to Amazon . Definitely have to be a reader of vampire stories to enjoy these but they are a great set . I am already looking forward to future releases in this series .
4 #### I am really into the story line and the characters are well developed . I especially like the number of characters that reappear throughout the series . I would recommend reading the series from book 1 .
5 #### I just love the whole series . i do n't really leave in - depth reviews . I have liked all the books leading to this one and i was n't let down with this book .
4 #### It is difficult to review any of the Blake books as individual stories I find . They should rather be looked as chapters of a bigger story -the progression is less disjointed , and answers to the questions raised in one " chapter " is answered in the next and not left hanging . Harlequin sees a new enemy make an appearance , and Anita make some progress in accepting her ever expanding powers .
3 #### Although I promised myself I 'd quit the Anita Blake series after the [ Incubus Dreams - Micah - Danse Macabre ] fiasco , I found myself checking out " The Harlequin " at the library instead of paying for it because there simply was nothing else on my radar to read . Well the good news is that I actually kind of liked this one and it is light years better than those previous 3 disasters . Although it has all the elements that make her earlier works so good , it does not approach the quality of the first 9 novels in the series . You do have to get through the three preceding books to understand much of what 's going on , but it somehow does n't merit slogging through them in retrospect . ( Better to read the summary of the 3 and then read this one . ) There is much potential here if LKH sticks to what she does best , world - building + good - evil conflict , and if she stays away from all that horrid , tortured , self - analysis / psyco - babble and cheesy romance novel sex crap . Can somebody PLEASE KILL RICHARD ALREADY , and get rid of Nathaniel while you 're at it ! When is the last time Anita even raised a decent zombie , or fought ghouls , fairies and that ilk ? Jeez , LKH , do I need to give you a plot line ? Looking ahead I see bad reviews for the next book again , but I must be a masochist because I still enjoy elements of the Anitaverse . At least I know not to spend any more money on these books !
5 #### Thoroughly enjoyed this book - could n't wait to turn the pages to get to the end . Once finished I was disappointed there was n't more , but then , there is always the next book . I have really enjoyed all her books in the series - her dry humour and the fact that Anita is not a helpless whining " heroine " . She takes her job seriously and seriously manages to get in to trouble no matter what she does - damned if she does and damned if she does nt - and at least tries to do the right thing and follow her conscience and not just whatever is best for her .
4 #### I 'm a Hamilton junky . Though Harlequin is n't her best work it 's a solid installment in the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter Series . If you are new to Hamilton and the Anita Blake series I do n't recommend The Harlequin as a stand alone book . It was actually the first book I read a few years ago when it came out after having read Hamilton 's Merry Gentry novels . Harlequin did n't interest me enough to look into other books in the series . But after getting the first three books at a closing Borders I was hooked by the series . So when I read The Harlequin again it had a great deal more meaning to it than it had before and was really quite a good read .
4 #### I liked the book much better than Hamilton lately . But I sincerely hope that Richard dies in the next book ! He apologizes then keeps being an ass over and over . he needs to decide that he is gon na get better and do it . He says every book that he will try to get better to better the triumvirate then he does n't . He keeps having ephipanies then goes back to being an ass .
5 #### this series is basically my paranormal encyclopedia . . . it always seems like every book i read after is just a book but these are the " real way its supposed to be " hahahah . . . .definately the best vampire / paranormal series ever written i think
1 #### I am a voracious reader , I read all the time , just about everything I can get my hands on . Until .. Laurell K. Hamilton , she has ruined my record . I paid 50 cents for it from a closeout bin at Big Lots . I was ripped off . Her writing is juvenile in spite of the pathetic attempt at sexuality . She has all the creativity of a gold fish and the perception into the human condition of a head of lettuce . PLEASE PLEASE .. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK .. just about anything is better , those silly twilight books look like high literature in comparison , an ingredients list on the side of a can of diet soda , anything ! Any author : Atwater , King , Dr. Suess , George Bush , " how to hunt " by Dick Cheney .. anyone is better than her . I would rather have a root canal before reading another book in this series . I was going to use it in the fireplace but I have decided that it would be an insult to fires everywhere . It was so bad that I could not read for two days .. finally .. after reading the combined essays of George Orwell and " The Diary of Samuel Pepys " .. I began to recover . So .. do humanity a favor , do not read this book , do not purchase it , do not even acknowledge its presence on the shelf.it might just encourage her .
3 #### Great series . I love this author but this was not my favorite in the series .
5 #### SHE BASES HER BOOKS ON STRENGTH AND POWER COMING FROM SEX . LEAVE THAT ASIDE AND SHE PLOTS WITH THE BEST OF THEM . YOU KNOW ANITA BLAKE HAS GOT TO SURVIVE FOR THE NEXT BOOK , BUT YOU STILL WANT TO KNOW HOW SHE GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS ONE AND HOW MUCH DAMAGE SHE 'S GOING TO TAKE . HAMILTON GIVES YOU NOT ONLY A GOOD MAIN CHARACTER , BUT DEVELOPS OTHER CHARACTERS THAT YOU LOOK FORWARD TO FROM ONE BOOK TO THE NEXT . SHE GIVES YOU PARANORMAL AT THE BEST .
5 #### The name of this book may be off - putting to those who do n't want to be preached to . However , the prophet Almustafa does not claim to be the messenger of God , or even an exponent of a particular religious tradition . Rather , he tries to show people all the profound depths of their humanity . He speaks of the things and experiences common to all family , friendship , labor , houses , clothes , eating and drinking , and so forth , revealing their significance . The underlying theme of his discussions is unity . We are intimately connected to others through our love , through work , through acts of giving , and through our hopes , dreams , and aspirations . Even the things that seem to be opposites , like joy and sorrow , or life and death , are the integral parts of the great Whole . When you grow in awareness of that fundamental connection , life opens to you its secrets , and you discover new levels of meaning . Whether you agree with the validity of those concepts , you will surely appreciate the beautiful poetic language in which they are expressed . This book is a true masterpiece .
5 #### I bought this to replenish my lending library . It is a great place to go to when faced with certain of life;s challenges , like death of a loved one .
4 #### I liked this one better than the last . The plot was n't as thin , and there was a better balance between action / character development and the sex scenes . I also noticed fewer typos , and fewer repeated phrases . What I did notice a lot more of , however , was that the author got on her " moral highground " soapbox too much . The story / plot would be running along smoothly and suddenly everything would stop so she could get on her soapbox ( with Richard usually as the instigator ) . It was very jarring , and seemed like the author is working through something in her own life in this book . And speaking of Richard - enough is enough . He 's never going to accept Anita for who she is , and she 's never going to understand why he 's so bothered by her lifestyle . That horse has been beaten , dead , and should 've been buried wayyyyy down several couple books ago . Unfortunately , I bet we 'll read all about it again in the next book . Yes , I 'll keep going . For now . :) Due to the soapbox and Richard - dead - horse issues , I 'd really rate this as a 3.5 , but ca n't , so I rounded up this time around .
5 #### When this series began , I rated the violence content " R " , and the sexual content " PG " ; the violence has remained more or less constant throughout the series , but the sexual content has gradually increased until it got to the point , three or four books ago , that I would have to rate it " X " ; if you enjoy a fast - moving , well - written pornographic novel , as I do , then you 'll continue to enjoy this series ; if that 's not what you 're looking for but want to read books like the early ones in this series -- hard - bitten detective novels with a fantasy background and a bit of light eroticism -- you 'll want to stop somewhere around book eight in the series . That being said , this book is closer in tone to the older books than any book has been in a while , since " Obsidian Butterfly " at least ; there are still some pretty graphic sexual scenes , but they do n't dominate the book the way they have for the past few books . Still , I would n't start with this book , as it would be hard to keep track of what 's happening and who the players are if one had n't been following along from the beginning , nor would I advise skipping from the earlier , less sexually graphic novels to this one , for the same reason . But if you 've been reading the series all along , and have been considering stopping as the last few books have n't satisfied you , I 'd suggest reading this one before giving up on the series .
1 #### This has got to be the biggest bunch of crap I 've ever read . There is no one in this book who is fresh or interesting , and no one that I 'm pulling for ... especially Anita . What a twisted bizarre world this woman has created , where she obviously lives in her own mind . I am far from being a prude , and the sex stuff was not a problem for me at all . But it was the rest of the book that SHOULD have held the plot together that was a huge mess . It 's kind of like being privy to the inner workings of someone 's mind while they slowly go insane . And yes , the grammatical and sentence structure errors made me wonder if anyone had ever LOOKED at this book before publishing it . I mean , really ! ! ! [ ... ]
2 #### When I began reading the LKH series , I fell in love . Anita Blake was an engaging character who was a strong woman and kicked ass . As the series has progressed , I have found the dynamic plots of murder mystery and preternatural intrigue to be replaced by repetitive acts of sex and grammatical errors . I keep hoping that the series turns itself around , but I am sadly disappointed with the past 4 books in the series . What happened to the rich plots and imagery found in the earlier books of the series such as Obsidian Butterfly , Guilty Pleasures , and Bloody Bones ? I feel like the series has turned into a watered down version of soft - core porn mixed in with weak ( and short ) fantasy and thrillers . If Jean Claude can read this , please intervene ( lol ) ! ! ! LKH , I love you but please honey get back to your roots !
1 #### I started reading LKH with " The Lunatic Cafe " and enjoyed it so much I went back and read the entire series up to " Blue Moon " , which was new at the time . I loved it , as it was an urban - supernatural blend with a strong female heroine , and I had never read anything like this before . I lived in Oregon at the time , and found that LKH was very popular there , and several co - workers read Anita Blake . We shared books and had discussions . But as the series went on , I felt ... uncomfortable sharing these books . And all our discussions went , " Wow . More porn . Oof . " The Merry Gentry books were going the same way . Before long , I was trying to avoid buying the hardbounds , seeing them every time I was in the store . But I loved these characters so much , the conflicted were - animals , the damaged vampires . But the porn just got longer , and the stories were getting short shrift . I 've been LKH - free for two books now . I want to read them , but I just ca n't . I went to Patricia Briggs and read all her Mercy Thompson books . We 're very happy together , but I think about Anita Blake . She was my first , but she turned into a nympho .
5 #### These will not work for the purpose that I bought them , but I really like the copy I 've had for years ! ! ! Beautiful
3 #### This book is OK . Did n't really get that much from it . It just might not be a book of good resonance for me .
5 #### Bought this as a gift . The book is a classic and looks like it did when first published which is something I preferred .
5 #### This is one of my favorite books . I highly recommend if you 're considering purchasing this book or if you heard about it go ahead and get your copy . I first purchased mine years ago and recently purchased a copy for my daughter . This book has great teachings and is written beautifully , poetically and with true wisdom .
5 #### Lets not forget the vamps , wolves and assorted other interesting characters . I have loved the Anita Blake saga as much as anything I 've ever read . The sexuality has n't bothered me a bit . We invest nearly 3500 pages of the series getting to know Anita before she even has a date . The relationship dynamics are my favorite part . The Harlequin was very exciting with the evolution of Nathaniel and the realizations of Jean Claude and Micah . I must say that though I love Micah , I have a not so secret crush on Haven and keep my fingers crossed we will get more of him later . What can she do with Richard ? So many men .. so many questions , I ca n't wait for the answers .
1 #### I find myself reading her books because I am used to reading her . The state of the characters in the series have deteriorated to the point of being mere cartoon shells albeit very sexual cartoons . Main characters have not voice and we are basically viewing a walking breathing vagina ... it is reduced to nothing but sex and little points left over .
4 #### Another in the Anita Blake - Vampire Hunter series . This entry lead the reader to a believe that there was to be a huge fight within the vampire community . The resultant fight was ok , but not the big fight I was expecting . Anita and her friends win again , but the novel left the reader wanting a different ending . The sex scenes are fun to read , but are not suitable for youthful audiences . I had enjoyed the first one thinking that Anita was a prude ... boy , was I wrong ! Read this one only if your lover is near . You 'll need to spend some time with them as you read this one !
3 #### Good news ... no sex for 150 pages ... amazing , is n't it ? ? ? But plenty of talk about sex after that and some lesbian sex between Anita and Belle ( well , at least in their dreams ! ) Anita is laid up a lot of book ... uh , laid up in hospital and not laid up as in having sex every scene . But something is off nevertheless . I think the plot needs more work . And the ending was so abrupt ... right in the middle of a chapter , the author just wound the whole thing up . Edward was in this one but there were so many scenes where nothing was happening that I kept forgetting he was there . Everything is about Anita , and about Anita 's love affairs . I 'm beginning to get a little sick of her whining ways but the author seems to be trying to bring her back to the way it was in the first book . She should have done that a few books ago when everyone was getting sick of the series . But I hope she succeeds because the first few books were really good . This one is better than the last few at least .
5 #### This book was hands down my favorite out of the Anita Blake Series . It 's sexy and complex . The story line and events are creative and imaginative . I loved this book .
5 #### this is a sequel in the anita blake series and all i have to say is please go buy one of them any of them and start reading it cause you will love it and if you do n't then send it to me cause i ve about worn all my copies thin from reading them over and over again ..
5 #### Great price . Takes me back to my post teen youth
5 #### My aunt gifted me this book when I was a teen . What an amazing book ! Misplaced my copy and had to get another .
5 #### When my novel , The Transmigrant , was compared to The Prophet , I decided to re - read it for the first time in years . Of course , the comparison is humbling and I do n't pretend to agree with the comparison , but I secretly hope others will . The Prophet is a beautiful collection of poetic and spiritual essays more than it is a novel , but it 's a great read , nevertheless . I read a chapter a day before going to sleep , and at times it seemed like the advice was written directly to me . It 's so clearly channeled from the Divine ( Universe , God , whatever you choose to call the source ) , and I will go back to its words again and again . Everyone should read this book .
4 #### This book felt like a layover . Something bigs coming ... I ca n't wait to find out where it 's going . I 've read all of Laurell 's books , and enjoyed them all ( some more than others ) , what I do n't understand is the nastiness of some of the reviews . This is fiction , meaning " Not Real " ! These books are a product of the writers imagination . If you do n't like them , Quit Reading Them ! ! ! ! ! As for me , I 'm still a fan and ca n't wait for Skin Trade .
1 #### I used to like the series , but this book ( and the past few too ! ) left me wondering why I read them and how I managed to finish reading the garbage .
4 #### i love this series i probably will always like these books , but i do miss the way Anita used to be she fought and did n't sit around and hold hands with her lovers to kill some thing . she relied on her gun and her own magic to get out of ruff situations and she investigated stuff and had her own life . i miss that i am hooked on the characters and hold on to the hope that Anita may go back to the way she used to be i guess i should n't hold my breath .
5 #### The book I purchased was listed as used , but was in such good condition I would have sworn it was new ! A great deal !
1 #### I heard great reviews about the Anita Blake series and happened to find the audio version of this one at my local library . I probably should have started with the first book , but this one was available and I really wanted to check out this series . For the Audio version , the reader does do a nice job of reading the story , but that is the only nice thing that I can say . I got about 1/2 through the book and could n't continue . Nothing deep here . Lots of talk about herms , orgy sized beds , and Anita 's 7 ( YES 7 ) lovers that she has all at once . There was a story here , but hard to muddle your way through with all the other stuff going on , so I chose to put it down . I certainly do n't mind a book that 's a little sexy , but this to me was just plain sick . I hate to be harsh , but this was just plain bad . Her writing style is n't bad but the story is too much to bear .
3 #### This book seems like it was supposed to be quite the spiritual read , providing insight into life 's everyday mysteries , but in all actuality it did n't quite fit the bill . It has some good points but much of the lines were n't all that thought provoking . Nothing new was learned though others may experience something entirely different if they have no knowledge of the things written . Lastly , the words do run harmoniously giving the voice of the prophet a poetic tone .
4 #### I hv found in The Prophet beautiful lyrical language that I often use in inspirational dedications so wrote , paricularly the chapter on marriage .
5 #### I enjoy all the Anita Blake books including this one . I buy them and will read them over and over again . This is one of my go to series when I need something to read and have nothing new . The author is not the best writer , but these action filled books have me addicted . If the writer could improve upon her skills , cheesiness , and repetitive use of the same descriptions . The dialog can drag on and become nagging making you wonder how you can like characters in a book that seem so ignorant and lacking in sense .
5 #### Many reader 's of this series have become disappointed in the track/ path that series has taken . I have not . If one looks at Anita Blake 's " abilities " and considers those , then the series had no choice but take this path . I for one still enjoy it throughly .
2 #### When I first started reading the Anita series I loved it . I liked that Anita was independent , had a career , kicked butt and had tension with the bad boys of the city . I am so sad that she has turned into a whore who just sleeps with the whole city . Gone is the career she had , how she kicked butt and was independent and how she interacted with the police and the people that worked there . I 'm not a prude and do n't mind good , fun sex in a book , but this is just porn at this point with little plot to drive it . And now , we are back to considering dating Jean Claude and Richard again ? ( blood noir ) Seriously ? ? Now it 's just a re - hash of old plots and some porn . Boring . After 15 books , I 'm done with this series . I recommend turning to Patricia Briggs and the Mercy Thompson series or Carrie Vaughn and the Kitty series , who both offer strong , independent women , some romance , a whole lotta trouble and a PLOT !
1 #### And stop reading this series .... When you find that you HATE all of the characters in a book .... it might be time to let it go . I really wanted Richard to die .... I wanted Jean - Claude to shut up or just never wake .... And Anita to keep her clothes on or atleast tell atleast one creature / man no thanks ... Will this series ever get back to good old fashion kick butt vampire hunting and killing .... nope . It seems the author is a bit kinky and wants to prove just how kinky by messing up one of the most dynamic characters to hit the literary scenes in recent years .... Too bad .... I give up .
3 #### What can you expect after 16 books ? Her story line has become so thin , she can barely flesh it out with sex . She needs to end this series and turn her talents to another .
2 #### ' IF AT FIRST YOU DON'T SUCCEED , TRY TRY AGAIN ' . So said my Mother some 50 years ago , and so I applied this to Hamilton 's recent book ' The Harlequin ' . Finally last evening in utter disgust ( after getting two - thirds of the way through the book ) I threw it across the room and gave up and I will not try reading it again . What a pity that the ' muse ' has apparently deserted Laurell!!Her series about Anita Blake was so well - done , full of interest and creativity ; perhaps she should create a new character completely different from Anita . I do n't know , but she is now relying on REALLY far - out sexual activity and filling Anita with so many animals to call , that it makes one dizzy trying to keep track of ' who 's who ' . I have to compare it to a composer of music that has run out of ideas , so that every so - called new work is entirely predictable . BORING ! Although I read a lot of Fantasy , this book left me frustrated and bereft of any excitement . Oh well , ' c'est la vie ' .
5 #### Had this book in High School ( 60 's ) , finally found this copy to replace my lost one ...
2 #### This book was a favorite of mine when I was a young woman . I 'm older now I find I have incorporated many of the ideas into my personal philosophy . I treasure It because of that
5 #### I have loved this book since 1949 , when I first discovered it . Now I have purchased this copy for a great - grand - daughter and I hope she will find it as enchanting as I once did .
1 #### Remember that and do n't waste your money buying this book . I was n't able to finish TH as I was seriously afraid it would turn me off reading altogether . When will LKH learn that stories need a plot and that sex is NOT a plot . If the sex was well written and erotic then I could almost forgive the weak plots in the past 5 or so books . But it is n't . It 's simply bad porn - repetitive and boring . At least TH was consistent to her past few AB books as they have been : 1 ) consistently bad and 2 ) consistently inconsistent regarding characterizations and Anitaverse rules .
2 #### Okay - number 15 - running out of plot ideas , are we ? A few name changes and such , and ! poof ! you have " The Harlequin " , a book that eerily seems familiar to all the other Anita Blake books , and not to far off from anything written by Laurell K Hamilton . If you liked her other books enough to read them again , go ahead and read this one . For everyone else , there are enough books out there that do n't have that deja vu feeling to waste your time with repeat # 15 .
4 #### I was happily surprised by The Harlequin . It had a balance that has been lacking in the other books since the ardeur first appeared . Okay , yes , if I think hard enough I can pick apart all sorts of inconsistencies , but overall this book blended the old Anita with the ardeur . The plot moved , there was less arguing ( no you have sex with her , no you , no you do it , no you do it etc ... ) and a lot less ' therapy ' . There 's some serious peril in this book to Anita , Jean Claude and Richard that really ramps up the tension and suspense . And Anita finally tells Richard to take a hike ( which I liked , but really made me wonder about the fate of the triumervate and the ' rules ' by which it operates ) . The editing was much better as well . Or I was that much more tired as I have a newborn at home . Either way , I did n't find any silly typos or other gauche errors . I think LKH is on the right track . This was a really well - balanced story with strong elements from earlier in the series blended with all the changes Anita has gone through .
3 #### ... considering what the few previous books were like . I loved the Anita Blake series for years and could n't wait to get to the next one but lately it 's just another addition to my TBR pile . The Harlequin was enjoyable , even with its various scenes of repetitive sex , and the mysterious harlequin group featured as the villains made the story very interesting . If you were a fan of the series I would suggest you read the book , but do n't expect much progress with the ardeur or Jean Claude .
1 #### I used to love this series but I was hesitant to pick this one up because the emphasis has been so heavily on Anita 's " dating . " 65 pages in so far it has been 90 % about her boyfriends . So far absolutely nothing has happened , it 's all relationship stuff . Hopefully it will get better but I wo n't be taking a chance on one of the author 's books again .
5 #### have always loved his writings . i wish i would stop giving away my copies . he centers me with his logical way of looking @ life .
4 #### Read this years ago lost my copy and brought another copy Just to have when I find good reading material I try to hang on to it
5 #### One of my favorite books , if not my all - time favorite . My mom gifted this to me during a hard time in my life and it really helped . Now I read through my favorite parts at least once every year . It 's really , genuinely beautiful . I did not buy through amazon but wanted to leave a review here as well . I think everyone should read this book . I always plan on having a copy in my home .
5 #### A beloved book . Wisdom to live by . I bought numerous copies to give as gifts .
1 #### I loved the first several Anita Blake books . Anita kicked butt and was tough and admirable , and all the other characters gave the books so much flavor and intrigue that i could n't put them down . and the plots were very entertaining and original . at around the 9th book in the series , the focus of the books completely changed from action - urban fantasy - thrillers to bad porn . this last book was a little better than the few before it , but not by much . everything in the story - the characters , the plot , the drama , the romance , the humor - all get thrown to the side and the entire book is just one nasty porn scene to the next . and the porn is n't even that good ! i miss the old Anita Blake characters and stories ; they were classics . now , i doubt that i will even buy the next Anita Blake book at all .
3 #### I have n't bought a Hamilton novel in two years . For either of her series . From the rewiew that Amazon posted , about Hamilton responding to the cries of the fans about bringing back her skillful writing again - I was so hopeful . From other reviews , the plot sounds much better than the tragedies the previous four books have been . And I 'm glad to see that Edward is back with his own rich dramas . What happened , Laurell ? Bring back the old Anita writing style . Do nt end the series writing like this . Its so depressing to see a great writer with such a great imagination take such a twist like this . I will not be purchasing this book , nor the other four missing from my collection - but I will be checking this one out at the library . She made the effort to try and appease us , I might as well read it .
3 #### I was very relieved to have a good story present itself in " The Harlequin " . I was interested in the plot and the conflicts between the characters . The sex was minimal compared to the last few books , and generally made sense ( although throwing the Rat and Swan kings into the mix was ... odd . I 'm beginning to agree with Dolph a bit when he says , " Are n't humans good enough for you anymore ? " ) . Nathaniel is one of my favorite characters , and while I 'm sad that Micah got pushed to the curb a lot , I loved the growth in Nathaniel . It 's about time Edward came back , even if he was n't quite as fun as normal , and Olaf was just chilling . On to the things that bugged me . First off , LKH has Sylvie say that she " would stay , but when the ardeur spreads , she does n't do women " . WHAT ? ? ? Sylvie was like ... our token lesbian ! Since when has this changed ? Way to forget a major part of the plot of a previous book , LKH . There were a few other things that happened that I just went , " NO " to . Glaring errors make me cringe . Also , lesbian vampire dream sex ? Anita would SO not go for that . And has n't she been able to fight off the ardeur in the past when she gets too uncomfortable ? Overall , its working its way back to a good series , and this book helps a lot ... now we just need a better fact - checker .
5 #### A friend recently shared her copy of The Prophet and as I began reading , I quickly realized it was a reference book that must be purchased and referred to over time .
5 #### Very inspirational . I read it when I 'm in a " down " mood as well as an " up " moode .
3 #### A fan since childhood , I 've ridden out the funky turn that the Anita Blake series has taken . I always loved it for being a more adult Buffy the Vampire slayer meets paranormal investigation kind of thing . When it turned into soft porn ... I have to admit , I became morbidly fascinated , until I got bored with pitiful excuses for tons of mindless sex . So how 's The Harlequin ? Actually , it was a bit of an improvement . Hopefully my favorite character will gradually come back someday ... what can I say ? I 'm a glass - half - full girl .
5 #### You ca n't help but be totaly involved with the Anita Blake series and they just keep getting better and " The Harlequin " proves it- ca n't wait for the next one !
1 #### I stopped reading the series after it started becoming bad soft porn . Did n't read Micha , Danse Macabre or this one . Then I got an e - mail from Amazon stating that Ms. Hamilton has a new book in the series coming out . So while in the library picking up " No Country for Old Men " I picked up " The Harlequin . " Started it and by gosh Anita was in the office . Did n't do any work but she was there . I had hopes . Then I had hopes dashed . I basically started skipping the pages where Anita was either having sex , thinking about sex or having were discusions on sex . Started out skipping a couple of pages at a time . Then 3 - 5 pages at a time . Then it seems like whole chapters . The book in the edition I had was 400 pages and if you took out the soft core porn it 'd be less than half that . Even when a fight is in progress Anita now uses her " SEX " magic to vanquish the foe . It 's disgusting . A good character and series killed due to a writer just being lazy . I stopped buying the books and now I wo n't bother with a copy from the library either .
1 #### It 's a shame when a writer gets so lost they lose their readers along the way . I wo n't buy another book my Laurell Hamilton . There are plenty of really good books being written by some very talented writers . If I wanted porn , I 'd have ordered it . My biggest mistake was thinking that it would get better and we 'd go back to the Anita Blake of " Guilty Pleasures " days . Sadly , this is n't it . It 's over . I wo n't do it again - promise !
4 #### Finally ! The old Anita is back . Well , not exactly the old Anita but close enough . There is page after page of plot , not sex . Monsters abound with Anita and the gang fighting their way through super bad vampires . There are a few sex scenes and discussions about sex , which is OK , but maybe LKH learned you can have sex and the old elements of the series at the same time . She could probably win all of her old fans back and sell even more books now if she pleased everybody . This book is a step in that direction . The first half of the book is mostly dialogue but the old Anitas were like that , too . I was more than ready for Edward to make his appearance . It felt like old home week . Other reviewers have outlined the book so I wo n't do that . I just want to tell the old fans that they may want to give this book a try . If we show LKH how much we appreciate the old elements of the books , maybe she will include them in the next books , too . Heck , maybe we will even see a few zombines raised ;)
5 #### Perhaps the most wonderful book of how to live a good life I 've ever read . This must be the 10th copy I 've bought as it is always given away and not returned .
5 #### Great Product and fast delivery . Look forward to next time
4 #### Tons of wisdom ! I only wish some things were explained more proficiently
5 #### When I first started reading this series , I was so hooked , I had trouble getting my work done , all I wanted to do was read the books from end to end . Then the books started to dwell too much on the graphic sex , and not enough on the excitement and zombie raising , etc . the things that made them so good . This last one , however , got back to the basics and really made you want to keep reading so you could see what would happen . It was the best she has done lately and I hope she keeps writing this way , instead of dwelling so much on the graphic sex , orgies , and the stuff that was making her books just plain poronographic . This one was perfect .
2 #### This another Anita Blake novel and while it is entertaining , it is not engrossing . I was hoping that this book would take the series ' back to it 's earlier quality , but instead it is just another in Hamilton 's supernatural erotica . Bearing that in mind it is a nice way to blow and hour .
2 #### I bought " The Harlequin " only after reading several months of reviews ... but the magic is ' broken ' for me over the last few entries in this series . I loved Laurell Hamilton 's Anita Blake character and story in " Incubus Dreams " , and have been an avid fan through my disappointment with " Danse Macabre " . Sounds and feels like Ms. Hamilton is becoming the Barbara Cartland of this genre , as her story content slides into cookie cutter themes between her Anita Blake and Meredith Gentry series . Although I find her faerie writing still sparks with a sweet creativity , I 'll be taking a long vacation into other writers ' works with my my hard - earned consumer dollars .
5 #### I read this book first and was so impressed with the imagery and the original story line that I went back and bought the rest of the series . I ca n't wait for the next book to come out !
4 #### gave as gift .... I luv this book , have reread for yrs , my library does n't go w/o a copy ! A must read .
1 #### I 'm going to make this quick . While this book is a little bit better than the last two or three , it 's still almost complete drivel . The series has degenerated into a formula . Sex , argue , fight , sex , fight , argue , degrade Richard , sex , argue , argue , argue . And , the spelling errors , lack of continuity , and lack of attention to prior detail negated any possibility of salvation of the characters . This series is doomed . Save your money . Anita died around the mid part of Book Eight . Todays Anita is not the heroine we loved and respected . And , if I wanted to read good porn , I would buy it . Titillation is one thing . Pointless porn is another . And this is BAD pointless porn being read by a Tijuana hooker . The whole fiasco makes my hair hurt .
3 #### While I am all for eroticism and metaphysical jargon , I purchase the Anita Blake series for the action and the supernatural detective work . I 've been in purgatory the last few books while Anita slogs through her boy toys . Ms. Hamilton infuses enough plot to keep me buying the next book , but I would prefer some serious action and less angst . When Edward is on the scene , it usually means less relationship BS and more plot . If that 's what it takes , I would prefer an entire series based on Edward . Otherwise , I hope Anita gets her ducks in a row quickly , so she can concentrate on being who she is : A kick - butt federal marshall & zombie raiser who solves crimes . One last note : It 's high time to kick Richard to the curb or make him a respectable character .
5 #### Great story line with interesting crime investigation . still the the occasional steamy sex scenes . I am was a little worried after the most recent Anita offerings but I am once again eagerly awaiting the next novel .
4 #### what do you say about a writer who you ca n't wait until the next book comes out . it was excellent . i always recommend laurell hamiltons books
4 #### There is much that is lost in translation from the original language but still one of the best books I ever read . Wisdom , passion , romance and poetry all in one book . Gibran was uniquely gifted
5 #### I first read this book at 15 years old and fell in love with it ! The Poetry moves my spirit so ...
5 #### First time reading this book , heard about it from Les Brown and decided to buy it . Great parables , easy to read , and short .
5 #### This is my favorite gift for graduating seniors . My parents gave me this when I graduated from Nursing school and the poetry is very thought provoking and life changing . Kahlil Gibran is a great author and should be in every person 's library ...
5 #### My second copy , the first one os unreadable due to overuse . Should be required reading ...
3 #### I 've been reading the Anita Blake series for years . It was the original confident and self - sufficient Anita who had me loving these books . She knew what she wanted and what she was about , and she went after it . I know that people / characters evolve . Stories stagnate if no one ever changes . Her changes , however , turned her into a shadow of her former self , and it was painful to see this persist over the course of several books . I was ready to throw in the towel and write Anita off . The last book that I truly enjoyed was book 9 , Obsidian Butterfly , which also happened to feature another of my favorite characters , Edward . I slogged my way through the next 5 , hoping to see Anita find her way out of her circle of self - doubt and endless sex . This book took a turn for the better . The plot was tighter and there was less of an emphasis on Anita needing sex to feed the ardeur . She 's still agonizing over Richard though . UGH ! Hamilton is at her best when she 's crafting action scenes that have Anita tackling bad guys coming at her from all sides , and there was some good action in this one . The Harlequin will not rank among my favorites in the series , but it gives me hope . I 'm not going to give up on Anita or LKH yet .
3 #### Finally , an Anita Blake novel with 15 chapters before actual sex ! Of course , a lot of those 15 deal with talking about sex , but there does seem to be an actual story this time . After the last few I waited until now to get the book to see what other readers had to say ... and for the most part I agree - the story is better and the sex less frequent and graphic . She 's almost like the old Anita we knew and missed . Here 's hoping for the future .
2 #### This is the first book of the series that I did n't buy right away ( or at all ) . I waited to check it out of the library after shelling out big bucks for the last Merry Gentry book and feeling really ripped off . Spoilers ! ! ! ! ! I was pleased to see that there was less sex and it was , for the most part , less graphic than in the past , although reading that she is bleeding after sex and that her partner is turned on by it was just gross . That said , this book felt like a rerun . I can not stomach another argument between Richard and Anita , much less one that comes in the middle of a scary situation when their lives are in danger . I think a good editor could 've tightened this book up a bit and improved the flow . The relationship stuff , while very important and interesting , constantly took over and stalled the action . The internal dialogue of Anita 's thoughts and the external dialogue she had with other characters was frequently repetitive . We , the readers , only need to be told the facts of a situation once . My final complaint is that what could easily have been the most emotionally dynamic scene in the book , the fight between Richard and Jean Claude , was only written as the aftermath , because Anita was in another room at the time . Could 've been brilliant , shame it 's not .
1 #### The bad part is that Hamilton 's books do n't even begin on the library 's hold shelf like they use to . They 're placed directly on the shelf like any unknown , poor writer . It seems most everyone has given up on her . I checked this out from the library when it first came out , brought it home , stared at it , then brought it back to the library . I just did n't have the stomach to read it . Then , a few months later , when I had nothing else to read , checked it out again to give it a try . After reading the first four pages and reading Hamilton sprouting her holier than God comment about how he has not forsaken her ( because , obviously , Laurell sees herself as Anita and lives vicariously through her ) I begin skimming the book . Even skimming , it was horrible . When they stop supposedly life - threatening situations to have philosophical spats between Anita and Richard , geez , I mean come - on ! I know it 's fantasy , but it is so far over the top it becomes just trash . I absolutely HATE the Anita character now . She is disgustingly nasty in appearance , attitude , and life - choices . I 'm through . NEVER AGAIN !
5 #### FINALY , less sex more action and mystery solving , too much sex in last 3 books , glad anita is back in action ( not in bed )
5 #### The most basic wisdom . Important reading for every body in the path of life . Guidance on every aspect of life on earth . Should be compulsory educative material
5 #### A classic . A poem for the soul . Your spirit will soar with the words and beauty . World - class literature . Enjoy . Read it many times .
3 #### I 'm so pleased that the Anita - verse is starting to climb out of the emotionally introspective , sex - obsessed quagmire where it 's languished for lo ! these many years . Not that I did n't enjoy to some extent the direction it took , but the politics , crime scenes , and mayhem are more compelling for me . I do n't mind the characters having softer edges but I do miss Anita 's sociopathic ruthlessness from time to time . Admittedly there 's a long way to go but I feel some forward momentum again , instead of entropy .
5 #### This has been a favorite of mine for years . I love the short , poetic sprints of wisdom . It makes a wonderful gift for those who like to think but do n't want to spend a lot of time reading .
5 #### I learn something every time ! I 've read the book at least 32 times . I have listened to my Album , over and over until my record player died . I have purchased at least a dozen of the books and a dozen of the cassette tapes for friends in need of his words , his explanations or given them just as gifts . I have worn out 2 cassette tapes and now have a third which I have put on a CD ! Such beautiful words .
4 #### The Prophet ( A Borzoi Book ) Hardcover September 23 , 1923 by Kahlil Gibran Afriend reccomended this author I ca nt put it down .
5 #### Very much back on track . Yes , lots of sex , but also back to the detective work , the sardonic humor and less angst all around . Definitely worth the read . Brings back alot of what was good about the early books .
3 #### This is starting to get back on track . The characters are all well drawn but Richard is still being a goop and the long scene between Anita and Richard does n't forward the plot . Anita is having to rethink her attitude to Ds especially where Nathan is concerned . We are back to nasty vampire takeovers complicated were politics and general mayhem . You can skip all the books between&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Narcissus - in - Chains - Anita - Blake - Vampire - Hunter - Book-10 / dp/0515133876 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Narcissus in Chains ( Anita Blake , Vampire Hunter : Book 10)</a>&nbsp;and this book without missing anything . Lots of Vampire politics and meta physics . Overall the plot is n't bad but kind of linear ; very little humor but some . There are a few annoying editorial errors mostly pluralisies ( plural singular errors ) but some consistency errors as well . Hopefully the series will get back on track and start progressing . At this rate we will be at a hundred books before mommy dearest wakes up ! LKH needs to go back and reconsider her sex scenes they are getting boring and are often not germane to the flow of the plot Overall a decent read , better than average for the genre ; but I am glad that I picked it up used .
3 #### The Anita Blake books long ago devolved from super natural mysteries ito sexual soap operas . The main plot points focused on " Anita does n't want to do something sexual that she is being pushed toward by magic or vampire / were - animal politics . " Each book is effectively over when Anita finally overcomes being a prude and sleeps with whomever she has to sleep with . ' The Harlequin ' is more of the same , but interestingly Anita has become aware of this repeating plot point and is more willing to " take one for the team " . This forces the energy of the story away from the sex and towards the plot , and ' The Harlequin ' is better because of it . Not within a mile of how good the books were in the beginning of the series , but better than some of the recent train wrecks . 3 or of 5 .
2 #### Maybe Anita & Edward , et.al . , should sue LHK for slander , defamation of character , and psychological damages ... I 've stopped buying Hamilton ; I 'm not paying for pornography . But I did pick this up from my local library , and it is a tiny bit better . Still focused on erotic death with not a single zombie raised --- I thought Anita said she " had " to do that or she would start raising the dead by accident . Just like Anita " had " to have graphic sex to feed the ardeur . Well , evidently , her sales have dropped enough that Hamilton decided she had to go back to the who - done - it side of Anita , because she sets it up for the ardeur to be fed with true love . So , maybe there is hope , but I doubt it . Edward was back , but was a mere cut out shadow of himself , which I REALLY resented ! Argh ! no more , no more .
5 #### Way to go Anita!!(LKH ) Finally Anita gave Richard what he had coming .. Yes ! ! To think the Ulfric is the weakest link in the tangle of men . Those of us who have read them all ( books ) know he had it coming . I love all the books . And I personally think the sex was part of her was character developing , accepting her reality and learning to control the Ardor . We have all seen the benefits of the Ardor now in this book . I can wait for Asher to finally feel and be accepted . Nathaniel which I adore can wait till Anita gives into him . All our favorite where back . We will have to wait for the next book to see the consequences of the last 5 chapters . Hum mm ... Is Anita A Master Now ? Happy Reading
5 #### This book had twist after twist like only in a Laurell K. Hamilton book . Also some past characters from previous books updates their lives and brings them in with a new cast of villains . I ca n't wait for the next one after this read .
4 #### For fans of the old school anita blake , this one has the return of Edward , and while it has plenty of steamy sex , there 's much more to the story . It actually has a plot . One thing that bugged me is that one of the big bad vampires ' names seemed to change , from Nivia to Columbine ... maybe I missed something ... it confused me but the overall story was very good .
3 #### So much better than Micah ... But I still ca n't forgive LKH for that ... uh ... book . The Harlequin gives hope to this series that had become little more than boring soft - core porn . Yes , boring . I do n't mind sex in my books - in fact , I encourage it - but LKH has written some of the most lackluster sex I have ever read . And I understand what she 's trying to do ... the reasoning behind Anita 's behavior ... and yet ... the execution of these scenes are just terrible . Even in this book ... But at least the scenes were fewer here . Ah - but these are all my complaints ... The good : the series has characters I love and this book was n't bad - there is a PLOT ! An actual plot . And thank god for Edward ... He 's back . I missed him . We get to see how is " son " is doing . Vampire politics takes center stage . Richard and his complaining is brushed asside and the sex is toned down . It 's a good book and could possibly take us to a better place in the series . There is no going back as Anita has developed ... she just is n't the hard character she started out as - and honestly , I 'm happy for that . She should move on . I 'll go along for the ride even if I do n't like every stage - the characters in this series are just too engaging .
3 #### I started reading the Anita series way back with the release of the first book . I enjoyed them for quite some time , but , like almost everyone else , the gratuitous sex and lack of plot were starting to get tiresome . I am like a faithful dog though , and was hanging on in hopes of a return to the old Anita stories . This book has given me hope - a step in the right direction when I thought all was lost . Looking forward to the next installment .
3 #### This series had deteriorated into interminable , boring sex scenes , wraped around a minimum of the kind of story that drew me and so many others to this series . The two books before " Danse Macabre , " had crossed the line into porn . Not erotica or romance , but porn . Before " Danse Macabre " came out I had told myself that unless there was improvement I would stop reading thses books . " Danse " improved just barely enought for me to give the series one more chance . " The Harlequin , " is a significant improvement . This is the second book in the apparent reocovery of the series . It is the first one in 4 installments that may be labeled a horror story rather than a porno . I suppose what I am trying to say is that as long as the trend continues I will keep reading . There is one problem in the series unrelated to the sex . It is the fact that Anita and her crew are powerful enough that LKH may be having difficulty coming up with opponents that are true challenges . Once the mother of all darkness awakens and LKH has Anita and crew deal with that , what else will there be ? I think this why we are getting a gradual introduction to the mother of all darkness . Our heros are clearing away the opposition . Finally , this is the first book in the last 4 installments that I can recommend to people .
5 #### finished reading it in one night - good read for sure
5 #### One of my favorite books . I ordered a copy for Kindle
3 #### OK - but not what I expected - Not really into " zen "
5 #### Page 74 . And the poet said , Speak to us of Beauty . And he answered : Where shall you seek beauty , and how shall you find her unless she herself be your way and your guide ? And how shall you speak of her except she be the weaver of your speech ?
3 #### Spoilers ... You have to read this book , because there is no other series where the heroine ( ? ? ) , OK , main character , is a psychopathic , nymphomaniac , but - not - yet lycanthropic serial killer . Where else are you going to get a plot line like this ? She stopped being likeable books ago , but she is still * * interesting * * . About this book , it is a lot better than Micah but not as good as Danse Macabre . You see a pretty good plot but a lot more of the petulant , narcissistic " my way or the highway " Anita -- but the book gets an extra star because Anita does n't kill anybody in this book ( I do n't think so ) or do any shockingly psychotic things like have a food fight with the remains of a child with a police officer . However , relatively sane Richard gets the boot again for ( predictably ) not being a yes - man . Still , the book has a plot that goes somewhere , and this book is showing that the Anita line might have some life left . C'm on , you got ta read it . You just ca n't look away .
2 #### Readers of the previous Anita Blake novels know the drill by now : Just as Anita & Co. are coming to terms with their increasing supernatural abilities and increasingly complex relationships , a new , mysterious and dangerous threat arrives in St. Louis that they must deal with and ultimately defeat . Anita 's internal dialogue has become more and more annoying , and her companions have an irritating tendency to comment aloud on what she is thinking - not because of any psychic abilities they have , but because the author has allowed her train of thought to intrude , making for sloppy and unrealistic conversation among the characters . The only reason I continue to torture myself with this series must be the eventual sense of completion I foolishly hope to attain . I suspect I 'm also holding out for the series to redeem itself somehow .
2 #### There 's a good story in here if you can get past the sex & the navel - gazing .
5 #### All 15 of the Anita Blake books are on my keeper shelf . I absolutely love Anita 's world and eagerly anticipate jumping into it again . If you like a paranormal read with plenty of kick [ ... ] action , and very hot / totally spicy relationships then this is for you . LKH 's writing is explicit in all details and is one of the many things I love about her books . Check out her Merry Gentry Series for more great paranormal reading !
5 #### Have loved this book for over 40 years . Beautiful , touching , and meaningful insights on major topics of life .
2 #### Obviously most fans have forgotten what a great LKH book goes like . It 's not one where Anita plays thumbsy with a serial killer in the chest cavity of a dead vampire . Nor does one half way decent book bespeak a major come back for LKH . It took her five aweful books to trash the entire series . Maybe it 'll take that many for a truly great book to be published again . I do n't know . I just know it was n't this one . Until said time , she ai n't getting any of my hard earned money , I 'll continue to get my books from the library .
5 #### This is one of the best books from the Anita Blake series , that I have read so far I could n't put it down .
4 #### This book is definitely better than the last one . There is a story line and not just sex . I really appreciated the concentration on the story , because I was disgusted with the last book but I did n't want to give up on Anita . Since she has learned more about the ardeur , perhaps we can dispense with the fascination and use it in a better way than sleeping with a multitude of guys .
5 #### I do n't know how I 've lived 21 years without this book . It 's absurdly beautiful and will move you beyond words . I first borrowed this from my library , but before I even got a page through I knew I 'd have to buy a copy of my own to reread and study . It 's definitely one of my favorite books . I 'm honestly thinking about buying several copies to give to my friends and family so they have no excuse not to read it , it 's that good . This should be required reading for everyone on Earth . If you 're wondering whether or not to read it , I 'll make a decision for you : DO IT . You wo n't regret it .
4 #### It 's not what I thought it 'd be but ok read .
5 #### Gibran is from my home country , I am proud to learn from such a profound and spiritual being like him . The book touches upon so many topics in life . Sometimes just a paragraph can provoke your soul and awaken your being to a lost or forgotten truth within .
3 #### I have to admit I felt like I was holding my breath up until the last few pages of this book . I say this because I kept expecting the gratuitous sex to " rear its ugly head " and move in for the kill . So , I was pleasantly surprised when there were only a few sexual escapades and even they were not as long and as drawn out as they have been in the past books . Although I believe this book has the feel of what had originally lured me to read the first few Anita Blake books , it is still filled with too much whining and talking about the morality and immorality of Anita 's current lifestyle . I still want to know what happened to Anita Blake the animator . Afterall , the character was born to the life of an animator . This whole thing with the vampire politics and sexual adventures has gotten to be tiresome .
5 #### I do n't know about you guys , but Richard keeps getting on my nerves with his issues about who he is and the whole " sharing " thing . I am glad this book finally gives him a little payback ! ! But just a little . I am still hoping for a turn - a - round ! !
4 #### I hoped that Nathanial would be more prominent in this book . Edward was nice to hear from but his character seemed weaker to me in this book . Anita really needs to slim down the little black book a bit , I ca n't keep track anymore . Where the hell has Damien been ? The book was good but it made me dizzy sometimes trying to keep things straight .
5 #### I think the title says it all . The last few books in the series were wonderful in depiction and scenes of passion and magic , but it seems as if with Edward returning that the series is leaping forward at highest speed . I ca n't wait to see what happens in the next book . Will we see more of Edward , the Harlequin , and Mother Night ?
5 #### ONE OF LAURELL HAMILTON 'S BEST CREATION TO DATE . I KNOW THERE WILL MORE TO COME . YET SHE CAN WRITE WITH GREAT EMOTION AND WONDERFUL CLASS .
5 #### Nice book ... currently using if for a Faith based book - study topic . Thanks !
5 #### This was given to me as a gift so I purchased one to give as a gift . The writings are amazing , I 'd give it 5 stars . I have read it several times already
3 #### This book was very suspenseful and left you on the edge . Non - stop action was plentiful . It did however lack the passion I am used to with this author . Anita has so many lovers now , it is becomng unbelievable . When will she ever get to the passionate scenes with her boyfriends , and if she does will she ever have time to do her duties as executioner and servant to the master of the city . I ca n't wait for the next installment , and hopefully it will be a little more fulfilling than this one .
4 #### I used to eagerly anticipate anything with Hamilton 's name . Now I find myself buying Hamilton 's Anita Blake series with trepidation . I loved the earlier Blake series , all the way up to Narcisus in Chains . However , I feel that Hamilton got a little bit lazy in the charcter development when she began filling her pages with sex and Anita Blake 's constant issues . Not that I do n't enjoy the sex ; but , it has gotten a little old . Harlequin did have improved character development ; but , I still found that many of the battle scenes were disjointed and not well developed . I used to be able to easily picture Anita 's world now I find myself slighlty distracted . I liked this book better than I thought I would ; but , COME ON Hamilton I KNOW you can do MUCH better . I still LOVE her Merry Gentry Series . If it does n't go the way of Anita ....
4 #### When I first got this book I raced right through it and was supremely disappointed . I was comparing it to Obsidian Butterfly ( the last book Edward was in . ) I found out through some research that some of the mistakes in the book were not the fault of Ms. Hamilton , it was the fault of some moron editor . Then I read the book again . I owe Ms. Hamilton an apology . This book IS more in line with the mystery and violence of Anita 's earlier stories than the past three books . No , the sex is not going to go away . She is still a succubus . But her ruthless streak has definately re - emerged . She turned her back on Joseph , the lion 's Rex , and she 's finally reached her ultimate limit with Richard . There is murder , mayhem , mystery , treachery , self - sacrifice , and a whole slew of other turbulent emotions . I bought the book . I 'm keeping it . I will read it repeatedly until the next one comes out . I guess I 'm just on this roller coaster until the ride ends .
4 #### The novel was a bit short more like her Merry Gentry titles . The story line could have been fleshed out more ( Haven and Asher were short changed ) . I would have prefered her to have taken more time and released it later with richer detail . All in all it was well written and fast paced as always ; ca n't wait for more .
4 #### i liked the harlequin - it goes into the vamp politics , which i enjoy more than the blood & guts ( see enough of that in real life ) - i agree with one of the new lovers she takes and understand why he volunteers , the other new lover was asked what his deepest wish was and , i am not entirely sure but the way it was written seems like he got that wish - i hope so . the 3rd new lover was a dream and it was not written very well at all ( i skimmed that part ) it should have been way more erotic than written . i liked edward and olaf ( sick , sick man , kinda reminded me of american psycho ) i wish edward would have had more things to do in this book . the harlequin 's power is to intensify the emotions and doubts you already have . that plot should have been explored more . the thing with nate - we will see where that is going - it takes more to being a " top " than just slapping around your lover . this book seems to be going into more " were " politics and that within it 's self is very interesting . i have recomended this book to 4 people @ work and they have read it all with diff . opinions . i gave this book 4 stars because i did enjoy most of the book . thank you for reading this review and happy reading ( all books )
5 #### I have read several books by this author , and his writings have had a good influence on my life . My son recently asked me to purchase the book for him . I 'll be waiting to hear how much he enjoyed reading it . I think it is a classic and one that everybody should read at some point in their lives .
5 #### My high school boyfriends mom gave me this at graduation . I love this book and have literally read and reread it over a hundred times ! But that was over twenty years ago and i lost the oriinal copy I had . Luckily I found it in Amazon . This will always be one of my favorite books . Deep and profound ! ! !
5 #### What can I say ... love this book ! It arrived in perfect condition !
5 #### A very in depth , beautifully poetic and down to Earth description of life , morality , right versus wrong and seeking objective reality .
5 #### Great book . Ca n't believe it was written so long ago .
3 #### I was a late commer to the anita blake series . I ordered Narcissus in chains by accident and it was months before I read this book ... afterwards I had to have all of her books ... until the horrible Incubus . Trust me when I say , I have no problem with sex in a plot(even if there is no plot) ... but as E.A. says all of the hipocritical crap , the teenage angst from anita who is a federal marshall , and a powerful supernatural chick is getting very very old ... how many books before she realizes her powers and controls them , how many books before she gives up the guilt of sex , how many books before she just settles into who she is and kicks the bad guys from here to there , and HOW MANY BOOKS BEFORE SHE KICKS RICHARD THE PRICK TO THE CURB? ... I know he is a favorite character , but he is just as repetitive as anita . I do n't care how good looking he is he is holding back the train ... I am sick to death of him . Will someone just kill him , let Olaf do it and then she can finally kill his sick , sick butt ... lol . p.s . I am the only one that was shocked that Belle Morte helped the group with out any payment , what was up with that ? ! ! ?
3 #### Hurray ! There is a plot this time and the sex scenes were not the multitude nonsense that have been in the more recent Blake books . I almost gave this book a 4 star rating . Why not ? ? ? ? I still wanted more in the plot . I still wanted less talking and sermonizing from the Blake character and more action in the story . I 'm still sick of the Richard character and would like more from Asher or anyone else . I still want Blake to stop the mental angst over Nathaniel 's ( ? ) sexual needs and just give him what he wants for crying out loud . For a character who will shoot , decapitate and have sex with almost anyone for any reason to be squirmish because someone she " loves " wants a little rough treatment is getting to be absured and tired . If LKH worked more on the plot aspects regarding the mystery of the Harlequin and who sent them she would n't have to spend so much time on the social / sexual interaction of her characters . This was a missed opportunity for LKH . She could have done so much more but because of this-- I 'm eagerly awaiting her next attempt .
4 #### This book has a plot . I like that in a book . Anita did n't do all her fighting on her back . The characters like ( Olaf ) was scary . I would have like to read more Asher and less Richard . Jean Claude was a little stronger personality wise . This book had more action than her last two books combined . Now that Anita is getting the aduer under control we may start having more action and less bed play.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Dead - Witch - Walking - Rachel - Morgan - Book-1 / dp/0060572965 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Dead Witch Walking ( Rachel Morgan , Book 1)</a >
1 #### I had to force myself to read this book , which I checked out from the library , and I only read it because I was curious how far Hamilton has fallen this time . Instead of endless repetitive sex , as her other new books , we get endless repetitive TALKING about sex . The result was so boring that I bailed halfway through the book . She has lost me completely as a reader , I wo n't even check out her next one from the library . Complete waste of time .
4 #### I was about to give up on Laurell Hamilton after Danse Macabre ... Okay , that 's a lie . I WANTED to give up on her , but I just could n't because I love Anita Blake . The Harlequin was very satisfying . I felt like there was a good balance of sex , violence , humor and everything that makes Anita such an amazing heroine . Edward is back in this book . Hooray ! The Harlequin tied a lot together and was very solid in its story line compared to Danse Macabre . I 'm looking forward to reading the next one !
2 #### It feels like I 've been listening to richard whine since the 2nd or third book , everytime he makes an entrance its like nails on a chalkboard . not sure if I 'll be able to finish this book . I 'm about halfway through and so far its been almost all plotless fluff with a whining richard constantly thrown in for more tedious pointless dialogue . i ve liked every book so far , but please for the love of god find a way to kill him off .
2 #### The series is getting a plot back , however the problem is now that Anita is out of the bedroom , Laurell does not seem to know what to do with her . There are so many distractions and it seems like the book encompasses only a couple days of the character 's lives . Why does Anita get the first mask and not Jean Claude ? That never gets answered satisfactorily . Laurell , please re - read your first books , bring back the kick butt Anita that we know and love . If you are looking for more murder , mystery , and magic , that was Anita this is not it .
5 #### Beautiful poems , very deep . I would highly recommend it to everyone . This is the kind of book I would read again and again and again .
5 #### My second copy in my lifetime ! I am glad I have it again !
2 #### I long for the days when I was frustrated with Anita because she was having no sex ; then the downward spiral .... This installment has a tiny bit less sex and a bit more plot , but not enough to really matter . I think LKH believes we the readers must want all these sexual encounters with new men as she does it in both of her series . I 'd actually like to see Anita w / Jean - Claude more if its all erotica . Richard is a tired character and we are tired of him - wo n't someone just kill his self - centered tookas ? I also got this from the library as I do all LKH 's books as I refuse to pay for a book I can barely finish . After 15 books there needs to be more content and time - almost all her books span 1 day now . LKH and her publisher think the readers do n't notice - yet we do . We notice poor writing , bad plot and no progression of story arc . Do yourself a favor and read Anne Bishop's&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Black - Jewels - Trilogy - Daughter - of - the - Blood - Heir - to - the - Shadows - Queen - of - the - Darkness / dp/0451529014 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Black Jewels : Trilogy : Daughter of the Blood / Heir to the Shadows / Queen of the Darkness</a>&nbsp;for a new take on vamps and a heady story with a beginning , middle and [ for gosh sakes ! ] end .
1 #### Finally a bit of a plot ; the series needs more plot less sex . The books started of as crime / mystery series and have become soft porn . I 'm surprised the author is number two on the New York Times List . I would n't pay the paper back price for LKH 's newer works . I checked mine out of the library . I keep reading in hopes that the old Anita will come back and the crappy sex will stop . The author needs to kill off characters and Anita needs to go back to work . Tracking the killers was interesting . People showing up to kill / do the main female character not interesting .
1 #### The first few pages gave me hope that the series was back on track instead of just page after page of Anita having sex with everyone . Was I wrong ! This book is full of horrible , corny dialog and everyone sounds like they 're in a therapy session . All they do is talk about their feelings . Returning characters such as Rafael the rat king , Edward & even Jean Claude are mere shadows of who they are in previous books . And yet again , every single male creature is in love or serious lust with Anita , even the serial killer . Not to mention that Anita has become so strong metaphysically that she hardly seems to need anyone else ( Jean - Claude included ) . These books have become a homage to a character that we once loved because of her insecurities , hang ups , and morals . For example , the sex scene between Anita and Marmee Noir seems like no big deal . The original Anita would have been freaking out about that for days . Not to mention that the new Anita is comfortable with beastiality ( yep ! ! ! ) . Ms. Hamilton : Please , please , please bring back the old Anita , Jean Cluade and the rest of the original crew . The fun was in seeing them track down & kill the creepy - crawlies , the sexual tension that added sparks , and wondering if Anita & crew would be strong enough to overcome a " Goliath " in their midst .
3 #### All of the other reviewers good and bad have discussed The Harlequin at length , so I will only say this is not a great book , it is not a good book , this is an Okay book . It had moments of brilliance and moments of mediocrity . I think this series is like a T.V. show that has been on for years and it 's time to end the series . I have read all the books in the series , and like so many others mourn the loss of the Anita Blake character as the tough and resilient Necromancer . My main problem with these later books is too much dialogue and not enough action . I would n't mind if a few of the characters were killed off . I have a hard time remembering them all from book to book . So , when a character was killed off I really did n't care . I really did n't remember that much about them . But , suffice it to say , I still read the books . They are n't what they use to be , but I still want to see what happens . Call me crazy ! That 's just the way it is .
1 #### I 'm in the middle of The Harlequin ( page 189 ) , just put the book down and signed on to save prospective buyer 's money . LKH has accomplished what I would have thought was impossible . In this her latest offering Vamps , shapshifters and sex are made mind numbingly BORING , SLUGGISH & SLOW .
1 #### this book is bland , horrid at best ... proving that yet again laurel , i mean anita , is the center of the universe and all life , such as it is , revolves between her spread thighs . i made the mistake of purchasing this worthless pile of papers in the hopes that something would catch my waning interest only to be horribly disappointed and rather ticked off . I apologize to Ms. Hamilton if my lack of ego stroking offends her , but this series has moved from brilliant to bile inducing . as it stands now , i will not purchase another laurel k hamilton book . As it was so aptly put in ( of all movies ) SheDevil : " fans are fickle , disappoint them once and they 'll never forgive you . " Lament all you 'd like about your true fans . Your true fans were the people who were shelling out their hard earned money for your work . I no longer count myself amoung your true fans and I am sure there are other writers who would like to have my support and my cash .
2 #### I stopped buying AB book in hard back since all the sex started . I was tempted back to buy this book because the first few reviewers said that there was less sex and more action . This part is true . This book is better than the last 2 books . Still not worth the price . It is the same all theme recycle . Richard still torn about AB . AB still getting offers from every were species for sex . The main problem with this series right now the only central story line having problem with sex , solving problem with sex . I still would buy this series , but only in paper back .
3 #### The content was great . The copy was horrible . No table of contents ? ? WTF .
5 #### This is a book of great knowledge and insight to be read during our lifetime for guidance .
5 #### Beautiful does nt even begin to describe Khalil Gibrans The Prophet
5 #### One of the coffee table books of the 60`s , amazing poetry for the soul , for all .
5 #### Small compact and easy to carry and read . Very good quality .
3 #### this was so much better than more recent books , but still not up to par with LKH 's earlier novels . the good news - this book mostly has a plot - we are returning to books that have a plot , how great is that ! the bad news is that the plot kind of fades in and out around having sex with anita and just plain boringness ... * * * SPOILERS BELOW * * * so , we see where the next books are going - we see peter growing up ( hopefully he stays away from anita ) we see more of edward ( great ! ) and we see olaf again ( good for plot , bad for anita ) and we see a plot that can continue . however , we see where more sex is going and to be honest it is getting old . but , there may be a reprieve from some of the sex - the adeur can be friendship now - hopefully that goes somewhere positive ..
4 #### All I have to say is thank you LKH for finally bringing back Edward and getting this series back on track ! This is the first Anita Blake novel that I 've really enjoyed in quite a while ... now I 'm sure someone is going to rip me for that statement so let me qualify it - I 've enjoyed all the books , however when the sex scenes run beyond three chapters at a time , it gets a bit old ! LKH seems to have picked back up on the vibe of the first few Anita Blake novels and given her main characters back their spines , which makes the reading oh so much more enjoyable .
2 #### Better than the last one , still not good . And typos nonwithstanding ( and they are there ) ... I thought her name was Hannah , not Candy , and did n't Silvie have a girlfriend earlier in the series ? I do n't want to go into more detail because I imagine many people reading the comments have n't read the story yet and do n't want it spoiled , but at this point I would think this series would have better editing / reviewers .
5 #### The Harlequin is terrific read ! Definitely going on my keeper shelf ! Thanks for a great read Laurell !
2 #### Of LKH to compare herself in the blog above to Khaled Hosseini ! Let alone Stephen King , Nora Roberts and Janet Evanovich who even they do n't exactly write literature , at least manage to put out something with a consistent plot , correct grammar and spelling . Well , The Harlequin may have been better than the last few novels , but I do n't know since I had to stop reading after about 3 chapters . It was just to stupid for me . I think I am going to give up on LKH .
5 #### Before you read this please take note I HINT at a couple of concepts in the book so if you do not want to know anything about the novel , wait to read this review until after you have read the book . I must admit , the last few books have been lacking slightly in action , but this book brings it back ... with a bang ! ! ! An added plus is Edward ( one of my favorite male characters for this series ) is featured in this book . Plus , Olaf , Peter , Dolf , and other characters are also shown as the plot progresses . The Harlequin , the vampire police are causing trouble for our main heroine and Anita must seek the help of friends in order to combat this enemy . Richard , unfortunately , is in this story alot and he is just as annoying ( possibly even more ) in this novel as in the previous ones . Sorry Richard fans , but even you will feel ready to kick him to the curb as you near the end of the book . I was so happy with this story that I have recommended it to my other friends . I can not wait for book 16 . I hope Edward is in the next as well ! ! ! I urge people who are or were a fan of Laurell K Hamilton to try this one .
5 #### Classic book . Nicely formatted for reading on the Kindle .
5 #### Was a gift replacing a book that was well lent out andnever returned to origional owner . She was very happy to have a copy again .
5 #### I 'll be uncharacteristically brief : this was the best Anita Blake book since " Burnt Offerings " - the return of Edward ( and yes , Olaf as well ) was worth the wait and I savored every little detail . I especially , surprisingly , enjoyed the scene between Raoul and Anita . I have one tiny little nit to pick : When Sylvie visits Anita in the hospital and says she does n't do women . I think that line may have been intended for Claudia because I have always cherished Sylvie as the sole preternatural lesbian in Anita 's world . Or maybe she should have said she knew Anita did n't do women .
4 #### I have to say the past books I have read in the series did n't interest me as much as this one . I loved the fact that we got to see a definite plot and more about Anita struggling to convince herself its okay to love more than one man . I actually had a hard time not finishing it one day because it was that good and reminded me of how I felt when I first read Anita . The character development in the book is something I can relate to and enjoy . Good going on this one such a great read for long time fans of the series .
1 #### A faint hint of plot encourages true believers in the series , but does not redeem the poor writing and editing of this novel .
5 #### I admit it , freely - I 'm one of the fans Ms. Hamilton hates . The ones who read every book , then gripe because it 's not what I hoped it would be . Why keep reading ? On the off chance that my patience would eventually be rewarded with a return to the way Anita used to be . Finally , the book I 've waited for is here . There 's still plenty of hot , steamy sex - and I never had a thing against that . In this book , unlike recent outings , it 's all in service to the plot , or furthers the emotional development of the characters . Speaking of characters , some faves we have n't seen much of in a while return - Edward , Dolph , Zerbrowski , Malcolm , the gang 's all here . The only person I 'd have liked to see more of is Asher . As to the plot ? There actually IS one , involving Anita 's vampire executioner job AND vamp politics . In a special treat , the whole Anita / Richard relationship actually changes a bit , instead of staying in the same " what are we going to do ? Oh woe is me " mode that we 've been reading for ages . To the author - thank you . While you dislike us " negative fans " , clearly some of what we were saying made sense to you . I 'll happily read through a batch of just - okay Anita books any day for the possibility of a treasure like this .
5 #### As others have mentioned , there seems to be more to this novel than the other recent ones . That has to do with a much stronger story arc , both identified and unidentified bad guys , and a main character who knows what she wants . My one complaint is the way LKH describes why one of the characters was n't at the big battle ; it was too short and too easy .
1 #### You may not have noticed this , so I thought I 'd draw your attention to it . There 's a fairly obvious gap between what star rating this book is getting and what some of the reviews are really saying . Many people here seem to want to give Hamilton a pass , since some of her books in the past where good they do n't feel like giving her the real marks this book deserves . You can see it all over the place , a review with a 4 or 5 star rating that never the less indicates the book was a fairly big dissappointment , which should bring a 1 or 2 star rating . Even the people being gushingly positive often are n't telling you that this book only scores between when compared to the previous two books in the series ; Incubus Dreams and Danse Macabre , which may well be two of the worst books ever published . Not mention they are so ineptly written they should bring shame on anyone who reads them let alone the author . If a review mentions less sex , less grammatical errors , what they are really saying is that this book is better than the last two . Which sadly is n't much of an accomplishment . The phonebook is more rivetting reading than the last two . Do not expect a return to the better books , unless you actually like the train wreck Hamilton has made of this series .
1 #### add a flimsy plot device with a potentially cool sounding name , a pinch of a great character we have n't seen in far too long , an American cheese bland ending , mix & serve and you have LKH 's ' The Harlequin ' . To say that this book was more of the same is overstating the obvious ... but if the shoe fits .... I 'm tired of Richard 's whiny angst , put a silver bullet in his brain and be done with it . I 'm tired of pages and pages of book being devoted to Anita arguing about / defending her lifestyle choices with her friends , peers , professional contacts , the milkman ... etc . I 'm tired of her personal hangups about sleeping with multiple guys but still finding man 2 man sex uncomfortable and squicking about bondage play with Nathanial . Deal with it or cut him loose so he can be truly happy . Perhaps if the author spent less time dwelling on these issues ( private fanatasies put in print ? ! ? ) she might have more time to write the Anita that we all came to know & love . Back in the days when there were zombies to be raised , real threats to be fought and some moments of fun humor in her books . Are those days truly gone ? Should we send flowers ? I 'm not holding my breath waiting but hope springs eternal !
5 #### This is Laurell K. Hamilton at her best ! The Harlequin is engrossing from the first page on . I , for one , am thrilled she has n't allowed her vocal nay - sayers to sway her from continuing this series in the manner it is currently flowing . I 'm spellbound !
5 #### One of the greatest reads I 've encountered . A true masterpiece !
5 #### Should be required reading for everyone . Lessons and words of wisdom for life , love , marriage , children , and more .
5 #### There is not a single sentence that is n't so filled with beauty it breaks your heart . Stunning insight into the dreams our hearts long to experience as reality in our lives , and much wisdom to be found here . His writing makes my heart sing and my spirit recognizes the truth in his words . This is one I will read again and again .
5 #### A book for the ages . I received it as a graduation gift in 1967 and have reread it at least once every year since then . I have given the book to my children and grand children .
3 #### An interesting read to say the least . I struggled with rating this work and found that fewer passages worked for me than did not work for me . This bears a second reading and possibly a higher rating later on .
5 #### i loved it ! what can i say?i adore nathanial&micah , i'm fascinated by edward and boy was olaf horrifying!!i read this book in one night and do n't regret the lack of sleep.please , don't miss this great book by LKH !
3 #### Please , Hamilton write Richard into a car accident or something . The rest of the story was pretty good , but Richard manages to screw up everything ! He is such a crybaby . Finally , Jean Claude issues the smack down on Anita and Richard but it does n't last . Thank god very little Asher in this installment . Intersting introduction of a new villian , but too much time spent in the hospital for me . Rafael was a friend in earlier books , what happened ? A good read but still a little too much sex and too much of Richard and Nathanials problems . Grow up boys and act like men or go find a new vampire slayer to shag .
1 #### There was a time when you picked up Anita Blake books and actually had plot and action . That has been disappearing now for a while . I can handle the typos . And if LKH wants to go in a direction where the main villain does not even appear for the first 200 or so pages that is her choice . ( I gave up after about 200 pages ) . Anita belongs to LKH not to me . However I do not need to waste my time on this series when I could be reading nightside or dresden or sookie stackhouse to get my supernatural mystery fill . I wish Ms Hamilton luck with her series but I will no longer participate in reading it .
4 #### I gave this book four stars mostly because I could n't give it a 3 1/2 . I thought the book was a little more that ok but not great . The Harlequin reminded me of why I used to like Laurell Hamilton in the first place . I thought the story was pretty good in general . Sometimes I thought there was too much talking and explaining and not enough action , but it did n't turn out to be just a sexfest and that made me happy . Maybe this book will be a start of her getting back to her good storytelling . Oh yeah and she brought Edward back , one of my favorite of her characters besides Anita of course .
2 #### Harlequin is better than the last few books , but it still falls far short of the old Anita Blake . Romance and sex are one thing , but going on ad infinitum into the history and agonizing detail of every single one of her current and previous romances and liaisons is excruciating . There is a little arc plot development towards the final Marmee Noir showdown , so that is at least something , but it 's pretty hard to get anywhere when everything happens in a single 24 hour period . And Hamilton 's whole rush to finish out the plot resolution of these books in a page or less is ridiculous . She will rehash relationship arguments for pages at a time that go nowhere , but when it comes to what actually happens in this book , it 's like she ca n't be done with it fast enough . ' Pete did n't get the shot . Who knows what Donna said . Maybe I 'll top Nate . Dolph 's still angry . ' It 's like she re - read her own book , realized that nothing was resolved and decided to tack on 2 pages at the end . And this is pretty much the case with all of her books . sigh
5 #### Love this book always have one on hand to give to people I like . Such an insightful book .
5 #### I bought this for my daughter . She is enjoying something that I read 40 years ago !
4 #### I 've always loved this book . The binding and type - setting looks kind of unprofessional but the content is what matters . I gave this as a gift to my spouse .
2 #### I have the same concerns you 've already read in other reviews : good plot that was smothered by gratuitous sex and excessive angst ; superfluous characters that only confuse the reader and do not move the story ; characters that do n't develop ( esp . Richard ) and should have been dropped long ago ; great characters that were quickly killed off and not developed ( the Harlequin ) and tedious , self - absorbed descriptions that slows the reader ; and it ends with a single summary paragraph for each of the survivors . Yes , this book was better than last five or six . They were sex , gain an animal or power , sex , add several new characters , sex , kill off characters , sex , change the metaphysical rules * again * and usually all in 24 hours . You would have to be supernatural to get all that in during a single day ! The Harlequin * is * an improvement over previous Anita Blake books but not enough that I 'll pre - order any more LKH books and eagerly await the UPS driver .
4 #### At only 422 pages , I found myself surprised how fast I read The Harlequin . Great news , Ms Hamilton is in the process of reducing the amount of padding sex and making Anita Blake a stronger character . The first 3/4 of the book is Ms Hamilton at her best , but the ending feels shorted by about a 10 pages , thus only 4 stars . As a reader of her blog , I am aware that Ms Hamilton is writing a new novel to give one of my favorite characters his own novel and this may have lead to the abrupt ending here . I guess my complaint of the abrupt ending is the book 's failure to deal better with the scene stealing character that Edward brings with him . Edward brings his new helper because they both need advice from Anita . Anita is at her stubborn best as she quickly realizes that Edward is passively trying to force her to give that advice & guidance . Or , the abrupt ending is because of the strange use of the PRIT , the local police special task force . On her blog Ms Hamilton explains her reasons for NOT having PRIT at the ending ` shoot out ' , but why have PRIT in the story at all ? Again , a mostly excellent read and well worth the time . It is still an almost excellent novel even upon multiple re - reading .
5 #### In the Harlequin , LKH goes back to Anita 's roots - violence , ruthlessness and not all about sex this time around ! Not to say there is n't some pretty darn good and steamy scenes ( LKH would never let us down ! ) , but it does n't dominate this book . ALL your favorite characters from previous books make an appearance in this book and you will love visiting with them again . Plenty of the questions posed in previous books concerning the 2 triumvirates ( sp ? ) Anita is a part of will be answered and you will definately be waiting for the next book with plenty of impatience ! ! Well worth the time and money to read this installment of Anita 's world ! !
4 #### I have been an LKH fan since I started her Anita Blake series ... and then kinda feel off the wagon for the past 3 or so books ... but this one I was actually suprised with . Not too much sex at all in it and an acutal story line to boot !
3 #### I believe Ms. Hamilton is one of the finest writers today . However , despite my complaints that the previous few Anita Blake novels are too full of sex , the lady 's newest novel , which did reverse that trend , is boring . At least when she let herself write sex scenes when she wanted she also followed all the other possibilities that her complicated plots allow . That 's what I love most about her work : The ability to write ridiculously complicated plots and have them make sense . She can write better than this , but I think the heart went out of her work in this last effort .
1 #### This is a great collection of aphorisms and short free verse ruined by the presentation which fails in formatting these as they were written ( Kindle Version ) . It has been somewhat arbitrarily divided into chapters . If you are unfamiliar with the work the first " chapter " is worse than useless as these are run together and successive text is not related . ( In subsequent " chapters " there is at least a line feed between the aphorisms . ) An absolutely terrible presentation of a really good work and it would have taken so little effort to make it useful ..
5 #### most incredible perspective from the heart of all matterrs in this earth experience as humans . TRULY loving way to understand life & how man creates his own world within & wthout . in such small easy to read writing . I read this in my twenties & now 66 , has even greater , deeprr understanding for me . I AM SO ANGRY WITH AMAZONS KINDLE FORMATTING LIMITATIONS AND THEIR FAKE PERFUME THAT I CAN NO LONGER RETURN THAT I WILL NEVER BUY FROM AMAZON AGAIN
5 #### Even if you read it as only a story , I think you will enjoy it , even though it is intended more of a think and realize book than a story book . I first read this book most of 50 years ago . It helped me understand life better . I lost that copy over the years and just bought me another . Book is even better now . Buy it . Read it . You will enjoy and learn something .
4 #### A book I first read in high school . I had remembered it more thought provoking and maybe even a little radical . Amazing what fifty years and changing times can do to change one 's opinion .
5 #### I buy Hamilton blind , do n't care what it is . This one has more plot and less blow - by - blow sex . Loved seeing Edward and Olaf again . I love seeing Anita 's life less compartmentalized .
5 #### Not once has Laurell ever disappointed me and this book was no exception . This book was action packed and full of suspense ( Yes there was some sex , but you do n't have to read it ) . I will say that I have never disliked Richard more and never loved the others more . * Small Spoiler ahead , sorry ! * It is about time that everyone turned on that childish insecure uncompromising twit . It could n't have made me happier . It is just too bad he ca nt be replaced in the triumvirate . Anyway , if you like her work you will LOVE this book ! It was really hard to put down . =)
4 #### I wo n't go into story line too much - enough of the other reviews have given a lot away already - I hate that ! Any way ! Good story line - more of the old Anita is seen . A great improvement over the last book or two . Is there sex ? Of course ! Dah ! You are dealing with a story line that involves incubus / sucubus type characters - soooo - then you are gon na have sex in the story line . Gon na happen just get over it and adjust ! This book does improve greatly in that the sex is not the ONLY story it is once again in a supporting role . And although there is a complete story in this book there are still plenty of questions that are left open and set you up for the next book . I ca n't wait ! R Walker
4 #### I appreciated this one more than most of the past 4 or 5 books . She gets 4 stars alone for bringing back Edward , even if he did n't get to do much . Did n't much see the point of the cops . Almost like they were back because there was n't much to transition one scene to the other . But Edward came back , so i 'm happy . It 's a good read . The sex is the sex , it 's just a part of LKH 's books . Either get used to it , get over it , or skip them , but let it go folks , she 's not going to change .
4 #### I enjoyed this book & I own all of the Anita Blake series a few sucked but this one kept me glued to my seat reading , there were a couple places in the book that you could of skimmed over and would n't of missed anything significant , like when she dreamed of jean claudes ' creator who is a woman and had sex with her that kinda lost me . What I do n't like i just look at it has personal development and Anita is been doing alot of that , it may not be the way I 'd do it but it 's not me . I enjoyed getting back with the gang and visiting and ca n't wait for the next . Nothing like takeing a break from the real world and visiting a different one .
4 #### I liked it a lot more than the last few and I think she 's finally getting Anita back on track . What I had the most trouble with was too many characters . I could n't remember who was a werewolf , who was a wererat or who was a vampire . All the characters were just a little confusing . But , all - in - all , I really enjoyed this book , am still a fan and will purchase then next one that comes out .
4 #### I do n't want to reveal too much about the book because that would spoil it but I am going to list the good & not - so - good things about it . Good news = Anita is back ! Ms. Hamilton did reduce the number of exotic scenes and filled it with dialog and a little bit of action . The dialog is A LOT better than the last Anita Blake book . I really like that Ms. Hamilton answered the question of : What happened to Olaf ; the serial killer that assists Edward sometimes ? Bad news = The shapeshifters had more of a role than the vampires . Vampire Asher maybe had 2 sentences throughout the whole book . ( Asher is my favorite of the vampires so I was disappointed with that ! ) I also felt that Jean - Claude seemed a little bit too weak ; considering that he is the Master of the City . I would 've also liked to see the vampires have a knock down , dragged out battle scene . ( Which has n't been done lately with the Anita Blake series . ) In addition , I think that there should be a resolution with Anita being infected with so many different kinds of lycanthropy . I think that she should be able to shapeshift . That would open the door to so many more opportunities for the character to grow . = = = = Overall , I did like this book and would recommend it ; however , just make sure that you read the series from the start or you will be lost . This IS NOT a stand alone book .
5 #### I give many people this book as a gift . It is not only spiritual , it is poetic . It is something I grew up reading in my house . Where ever we lived , there was a copy of The Prophet . It strengthened my faith as a child . Although not specifically religious , this book speaks to the spiritual on a profound level .
5 #### Purchased for my kindle . Love this book & want it available @ all times .
5 #### I did not personally see the book sent as I had it mailed directly to my friend . I trusted from the information , that the book was in the very good as described . My friend said the book arrived and did not express any problems . I do love this book and give it to people I value . I believe the message is timeless and actually very suited for today 's world . All should read it
5 #### I was given this book when I was a teenager . I loved it then and continue to so do . My original copy got lost through the years so I purchased it for my book collection .
5 #### This book changed my life . I buy copies often to give to my loved ones because I think there is so much insight , peace , and healing found in Khalil 's words . Be open and humble to its message and I assure you will be invigorated by love and to do and be better .
5 #### Classic book that I love . Scientific understanding of artful things , with lots of detail . This and Castle are my favorite from the series .
5 #### Macaulay is the master of simplifying complex topics . He 's easy to follow , extremely well illustrated , and gripping -- which is a lot to be said for an historic architecture series ! If you like to know how things work , buy any of his books .
5 #### The four books : Pyramid , Mill , City and Castle . I learned a lot about line drawing as a kid from these books . I copied his style and made my own subject matter , usually medieval towns . Inspiring and to be honest I 'm not that into his full color ones from later years .
5 #### Mr. Macaulay has written a series of these wonderful , educational books showing how fascinating structures are designed and built .
3 #### Not what I expected , for sure . Written for junior high age readers , apparently . Illustrations were difficult to read even when opened up on my tablet . Just when I thought I had finished chapter One , I discovered I had finished the entire book ! I saw other titles by David Macaulay , but I 'm kind of gun shy now ! It 's not a bad book , just less than what I had hoped for .
4 #### After the last couple of Anita Blake books spent so much time exploring the ardeur , it was nice to get a real adventure this time around . It 's been interesting , although not always exciting , to follow the development and changes of the many characters in this series , but I have missed the feel of the earlier books ... physical , external conflict instead of emotional , internal conflict . This book takes a decent storyline and applies the evolving characters really well . Putting Edward in the role of father is one of my favorite developments . The characters certainly are n't stuck in the roles they were given at the beginning of the series , and it will be interesting to see where they go next .
4 #### Finally ! ! This book was more than just sex scene after sex scene . There was more meat to the book . I enjoyed the story , and it was nice to see a bit more character development with some of the other characters -- like Edward . I am hoping that the Merry Gentry series will cut down a bit on all of that sex . It must get tiresome writing it . The story lines are good , but they get way too bogged down with the Erotica . This book was refreshing after the last few books .
4 #### I have to say that this book takes a giant leap in giving us back the Anita we loved . There was a plot in this book , not just a lot of sex and over analyzing of the sex . It left me asking questions about the next book instead of just questioning when the torture of this series will be over . It took me to a new level of loving Edward ( I would really love a new series on him and Peter ... ) . It left me with new questions about Richard and JC . I found it strange the direction LKH is taking them in Anita 's life , but I ca n't wait to see where it leads . I think we see that Anita is getting the much needed control we have been hoping for . I hope this is the first step in welcoming back Anita , our ( ... ) kicking vampire slayer with a heart and honor .
5 #### Always sweet Gibran . I suggest " Jesus the Son of Man " .
5 #### Riveting ! Brings me to both tears and laughter , alternately !
5 #### My husband wanted a book on Pyramids . He had a doctor who was from Egypt and got interested . This book explained the way they built these pyramids . Very educational .
1 #### This is an awesome book let down by a terrible digitization . The beautiful drawings are poorly scanned , leaving them looking like crap . they are tiny on the page and when you zoom in , thry become a hot mess of pixilation . save your money - buy the physical book instead
5 #### This book is not a story as I was expecting but it was still pretty interesting to read about how they think the pyramids were made . The illustrations are very impressive and even my 3 year old was following along with the construction . Worth adding to any study of Ancient Egypt .
4 #### Even without the story this book provides drawings to mesmerize and inspire . We keep this book in a basket in our family space to encourage our sons to browse at will . I have seen them drawing up their own scenes inspired from this book .
5 #### We got this book for our homeschool since we were studying Ancient Egypt . It had great pictures and really informative facts .
1 #### I 've always loved this book , even as a child , and was excited to see it on Kindle . Unfortunately , the publishers just scanned in pages , making the illustrations hard to see and impossible to read . If they had taken the time to format this book for Kindle it could be amazing and a great way to illustrate Macaulay 's extremely detailed illustrations . Ancient Egyptian works are extremely intricate and by having the illustrations small , you miss a lot of the detail that really makes this book wonderful . Great book , horrible e - book .
5 #### Show and tell , this book has it all . My kids are visual learners , and this book SHOWS them how the work got done . It will knock your socks off .
5 #### I bought this and the other David Macaulay books because I loved them as a child . I used this one for a research paper in 7th or 8th grade and fell in love with the author 's visual and to the point storytelling style . Just as I remembered !
5 #### As with most Macaulay books , the strength is in his detailed designs . Excellent for gaining and keeping the attention of young readers as well as older folks . Illustartes pyramid construction through an engaging story . Highly recommended for shared reading for families .
3 #### ` Pyramid ` ( 1975 ) is Macaulay 's third book . It shows the building of a hypothetical pyramid similar in size to Giza . Unfortunately Macaulay took on a difficult subject . There is still controversy about how exactly the pyramids were built . The 4 - ramp model shown in the book is just one of many ideas , and not even proven to work . The latest theory is described in&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Khufu - The - Secrets - Behind - the - Building - of - the - Great - Pyramid / dp/9771730614 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Khufu : The Secrets Behind the Building of the Great Pyramid</a > , involving a series of internal and external ramps ( see a BBC article about it in the note below ) . Given this , it 's hard to know what else in the book is accurate , or conjecture . Macaulay is at his best when he demystifies the world around us , but in this case the pyramids really are a mystery , and so it leaves the impression of inaccuracy . However we can probably assume some of it is right ( the tools for example ) . Like all Maccaulay books , it 's an enjoyable and impressive journey through history . Just do n't rely on it as a blueprint for building your own pyramid !
4 #### Visual explanation of how Egyptians living nearly 4500 years ago were able to construct such large and magnificent structures . Shows the construction from conception by the Pharaoh 's architect , to clearing and leveling the site , transporting the stones , tediously dragging them up and placing them to create the 124 layers of the pyramid , and finally chipping them down the form the distinctive triangular sides of the pyramid . Of course Macaulay goes further to show construction of the underground tombs , and nearby temples . This book is not quite as interestsing as Mr. Macaulay 's City book , but the subject matter was not as interesting either . Drawing men hauling stones up ramps does n't compare to the richness of the Roman architecture and bustling city life .
5 #### Following in the tradition of other terrific books about complex construction projects using simple technology - such as Castle and Cathedral - Macaulay introduces children to the pyramids of ancient Egypt . And once again he hits a homerun , with a storyline that 's just informative enough to create context but simple enough for young children to follow . Oh , did I mention the outstanding illustrations ? This is a terrific book for kids and children alike . I bought it for my four - year - old son but I ended up learning quite a bit myself .
5 #### This book is based on extensive research on how the Egyptian pyramids were made . RISD professor , David Macauley , author and illustrator deserves the many national and international awards this book has earned .
4 #### The Harlequin is certainly better then DM . The book had a lot more plot and alot less sex , so it is an upgrade from her last couple of books . Though sex was a repetitive conversation topic for feeding and power gain . LKH attempted to transform the adeur from lust to love and I hope she can put an end to the whole food / sex entity all together . Richard 's character was a complete disappointment and I hope LKH can figure something out , besides him coming off as a constant failure . Is friendship not an option ? I am also slightly disappointed in the Lion Rex situation . AB wants monogamy from her men and has condemned Joseph and his WIFE for the same thing . I realize that the AB series is LKH 's world and I 'm just along for the ride but my opinion would be to maybe tone down the sex for food and power a little more . In retrospect , I think The Harlequin is actually a 3.5 . But I thought that since I 've been reading the series from GP , what 's an extra point ?
4 #### THE HARLEQUIN , for me , redeems the Anita Blake series . Although there 's still sex ( which in itself has never been a problem for me ) , the ratio of sex to story has finally turned . There 's an actual plot in THE HARLEQUIN , and it 's a pretty dang good one . The Harlequin , what is akin to the vampire police , has come to town -- presumably just to observe . It soon becomes apparent , however , that at least some members of this elite and uber - scary group have harsher things on their mind . The usual characters are all here , as well as reapperances by Edward ( aka Tod Forrester ) and the serial killer , Olaf . Peter , the teen who was rescued several stories back , is also there . Some typical things happen -- Richard ( once again ) has serious problems with Anita and the ardeur . Some new plot lines develop -- the local lion king refuses to help in a moment of need , and the swan leader comes to the rescue . Overall , THE HARLEQUIN was a quick , satisfying read that I totally enjoyed . I have renewed faith in the Anita Blake series , and hope that the next book does n't take away that feeling .
5 #### The city 's vampires have a secret . Even scary monsters can be afraid . Afraid of the harlequin : neutral vampires , with tremendous powers , hiding behind masks and out to get you when they hit your town . Anita 's in trouble . The harlequin show up and no one knows why . Rapidly people get hurt . Seriously hurt . Which makes Anita pretty angry . And angry is when she fights best . This Anita Blake is excellent . Not only because of the good , solid story . Also because its author addresses one of her most important themes explicitly : what makes a monster a monster ? Is it acting immorally ? Is it acting unlawfully ? Anita 's answer is clear : everyone who hurts the ones you love is a monster . And you ca n't love enough , as long as you can make it work . I think these are ( maybe only equaled by Terry Pratchett ) the best books fantasy has to offer and Harlequin is a very fine book in this series . Funny is the link with the continuous ' too much sex?'-discussion here : are reviewers the harlequin ? Like them , they pass faceless judgments from the balcony , meddling moral verdicts with artistic taste , preoccupied with the physical expression of love rather than the essential gift of love itself . This book is excellent . Really .
5 #### I was beginning to wonder if we had lost Anita . It seemed with the recent books that Laurell was getting distracted like some long running series writers do and lost the thread of her narrative . Now I think she was working up to this one . This is Anita Blake at full stride as strong as ever . Lots of action , lots of sex but balanced and rolling right along to the end . She keeps growing and learning and the adventure gets ever stranger , but there is no one better . Anita is back and thank you for that Laurell Hamilton . Have fun .
5 #### I got this book on the first day it came out . Finished on the same day . Read it twice in one day actually . (*_*) Love it ! I know lots of you out there have reservation about this book but you have to give it a chance . LKH is back on track ! I actually love the whole series , well .... except for the last two books . I still do n't get why people complain about NIC . That was the very first book I picked up from this series . I loved the stories so much , I actually ran out and bought the whole set from GP to CS . In this book , you will get the suspense thriller ride until the end . I wish the book could be longer . Now , I ca n't wait for the next book . Richard still frustrates the heck out of me , specially toward the end . I was so glad of the action Anita and JC took to deal with Richard . Glad Cookie Monster is back . Want more of Asher , Jason and Damien . Love Micah , Nathaniel and JC . I love the scenes between Anita and Edward . Ca n't wait to pass this book to my sister . We both love this series aside from the last two books . So go out and get the book ! If you do n't want to pay then go borrow it from the library . It 'll be worth it .
3 #### At this point in the series any improvement is a relief . Much less sex in this book , but with people I would have rather respected . No sex with the people I disrespected . What a surprise . Anita is on her way back , thank God . She is screwing less , dealing with vampire politics , is rapidly losing ( not loosing ) any qualms about being a vamp servant , and seems about over Richard and his hand wringing . The scenes all seem to be written fast , not well , but still I see more effort and content than has been offered in a good while . The best news is given almost offhandedly as one of the characters drops the information that the ardeur can be changed to platonic love , or friendship as well as sex , or desire for food . YAY ! We may hope at last to see that crap put to bed somewhat.(No pun intended ) It would be nice to return to a series where sex had feeling , and meaning , and emotional content , instead of being fast - food . I realize we will never see Anita as she once was , focused , hard , and chaste , but focused , hard , and respectable with a love life would be a nice outcome . It is interesting to note that more and more of the preturnatural and mundane community bring up words like whoring , slut , and other disrespectful appellations when talking with , about or to Anita . Sounds like the books characters on both sides of the metaphysical blanket are beginning to echo Anita 's fans .
1 #### Do n't waste your time or money . I do n't get all the good reviews that say The Harelequin harkens back to the earlier book in the series . Maybe they 're reading something different than what I read . Yes , there are only three love scenes in the book , but they are very long and dull -- and this does take place in a 24 - hour period , so that 's a lot for one day , esp . with three different guys . When the characters are n't in bed they spend an inordinate amount of time angsting and whining about being in bed . Edward and Raphael seem to have gone the way of Dolph and Ronnie -- characters that used to be fascinating but are now one dimesional . The writing style and sentence structure is not very sophisticated either . Plus , there are major errors that should have been fixed prior to the book 's release . I continue to be saddened by the rapid decline of a formerly fantastic series .
5 #### Um livro magnfico que propicia a reflexo e a introspeco . A magnificent book that takes us on a journey of reflection and introspection .
5 #### A great book written by a wise man . Excellent addition to one 's collection .
5 #### Mr Gibran invites us into that kind of spirituality that demands total honesty of the practitioner , which is the basis in the search for true freedom .
4 #### Though this was written nearly thirty years ago , this is still one of the best introductions to the building of the pyramids out there , as he distills the basics down to the bare minimum without sacrificing much detail . The drawings , too , are superb , though the one page showing the various bald - headed workers made me think of Blue Man Group . I do have some minor reservations , however , which are not necessarily Macaulay 's fault ( I am not going to go into alternative theories about how the pyramids were built , or speculation about the " real " purpose of the pyramids ) . One , to have built a pyramid of 2 million blocks in 30 years ( working 5 months of the year ) would have required that over 400 blocks be cut , finished , transported , and set into place EVERY DAY . Two , he does n't state how the ramps were built so they could withstand the weight of so many tons of blocks day in and day out . And third , how was this enormous operation made to run so smoothly despite accidents and other problems that had to have occurred ? Despite my reservations , this is still a wonderful book to teach people , especially children , how such a massive undertaking was accomplished .
5 #### Who has n't wondered how the Great Pyramids came to be ? In this stunningly illustrated , richly detailed book , David Macaulay skillfully shows one way they could have been built . I had ordered the book for our family 's study of ancient Egypt , based on a recommendation in The Greenleaf Guide to Ancient Egypt , which raved about it . I was not disappointed . In fact , I was stunned at the detail and care of the drawings and fascinated by the accounts . Although the long descriptions were daunting for my then - first grader , the illustrations caught her eye , and her older siblings dug into it with enthusiasm .
5 #### David MacAulty 's book discusses and illustrates " one method " by which the pyramids of Egypt may have been built , and follows the construction step by step . His pen and ink drawings are excellent . The book may have been written for children ( ages 9 and older ) but , I enjoyed the book . I highly recommend it for adults and children with an interest in the pyramids . My eight year old son was fascinated by the book . Hopefully , his interest in Egyptology has been sparked by this fine book . I tend to disagree with the author when he refers to the pyramids as tombs . No bodies have been found within the pyramids . Its more likely the pyramids were used as structures for initiation ceremonies . Although , not specifically stated the entire book , except for a brief discussion of the Queen 's pyramid and the mummification process , is devoted to the Great Pyramid of Khufu . The brief discussion of the mummification process is just the right amount of information for a child 's book .
5 #### David MacAulay 's book illustrartes " one " method by which the pyramids of Egypt may have been built , and follows the construction step by step with text and drawings . His pen and ink drawings are excellent ! The book may have been written for children , ages 9 and older , but I enjoyed the book ! My eight year old son was fascinated by the book . Hopefully , his interest in Egyptology has been sparked by this fine book . I tend to disagree with the author when he refers to the pyramid as a tomb . Although , not specifically stated , the entire book except a brief discussion of the Queen 's Pyramid and mumification are devoted to the building of the Great Pyramid of Khufu . The brief discussion of the mummification process is just the right amount of information for a child .
4 #### One of a series of books about the engineering and technical aspects of the great buildings and marvels of history , Pyramid is a worthy effort , but not as interesting , compelling and funny as City and Cathedral , two of the other books in the series . Though just as well illustrated by the dazzling drawings found in the entire series , the text is not as appealing as it could be and the attention of younger readers may be lost in a short time after some of the major questions about pyramid construction are answered . Not verbose or over - written , the text is understandable and concise . As with the other offerings in this series , the reader is taken from the very beginning of development to the completion of a project , in this case a massive Egyptian Pyramid within the pages of the book . Though not the very best in the series , Pyramid does instruct and would be a very valuable asset in any classroom or home library .
5 #### This is a fabulous book for anyone looking to learn more about the pyramids of Ancient Egypt without the burden of scholar - like vocabulary and disturbing depth . But at the same time the book conveys the mysteries of the pyramids with a keen intellect of the topic . The author knows his topic but writes his book so anyone can enjoy the knowledge and enlightenment a deeper understanding of the past can provide .
5 #### Best book ever written in my opinion . I gift it to all the high school graduates - friends and family . I am 62 and still have my original copy on my nightstand that was given to me by my best friend when I was 19 .
4 #### After 12 years a prophet awaits the return of a ship that will take him home . some locals gather and request he share some final words about love , marriage , children , employment , charity , justice , commerce , and other topics . Insightful .
5 #### Need I really say anything . No words to describe the words of Kahlil Gibran .. ! !
5 #### One of my favorites . I give often as a wedding / birthday gift .
5 #### Everyone in the universe should own a copy to keep by their bedside . I was first introduced to The Prophet as a girl of fourteen . My father loved it . Many years later I bought my own copy . I had some of the verses on love and marriage read at my wedding . There is much wisdom about love , life and compassion contained within the framework of these verses . I have given them as gifts many , many times over the years . I bought this copy for a new friend who , astonishingly , had never heard of Kahlil Gibran . Do yourself a favor and buy your own .
1 #### I could n't stand to listen to this because the narrator sounded as if he was totally bored , his voice dropping off to almost unhearable at the last word of each sentence . I used to own a tape version years ago , narrated by Paul Sparer , that set the standard for The Prophet . This narration is n't worth the money .
2 #### I istakenly ordered paperback and I wanted hard copy so I re - ordered .
5 #### I love the messages in the book . Yes , they are some that are slightly antiquated , however the insight into everyday life is wonderful . I highly recommend this book to people who are just interested in philosophy as it is a great gateway book .
5 #### If I was only able to own one book , this would be it .
2 #### I could not get into this book it was all over the place ..
1 #### Displayed like a children 's book ... returned because the presentation stunk !
5 #### Beautiful language . Feels like biblical psalms or Buddist koans . Read it on a short flight . perfectly sized bites of wisdom . my teenage daughter also thought it was cool .
5 #### An idealized view of living the perfect life . So much truth in so few words .
5 #### Easily one of my favorite books ever . Profound truths found throughout .
5 #### quite interesting insightive makes you question things about life love marriage death all kinds of feeling i have read this book many times i have some parts underlined to reread
4 #### Well known poetry worth rereading , especially with a remarkable animated movie recently out .
5 #### I am from the old school and like to have reference manuals available at my fingertips when I need clarification on a particular matter having to do with home remodeling or just plain home maintenance . His manuals assist the homeowner when evaluating the quality and safety of previously made repairs or when planning future projects .
5 #### For remodelers , purchasers of older homes and those who hope to build , this book is the best checklist one could possibly have . For those who are familiar with the innards of home construction ( even a little ) , I strongly recommend this version ( Collins / Harper Collins Publishing ) over the less - detailed , more recent one ( Holmes Publishing ) . I did n't know about either five years ago when we started planning a remodeling project . Fortunately , the contractor who eventually won the job was a Holmes devotee ( he admitted this later ) and did an absolutely fabulous job . We had ALL of the details - before , during and after completion - and were able to keep the lines of communication open and amicable , even during disagreements . Now that we 're getting ready to move out of state , this trusty book will be right there with me as I question realtors , home inspectors and owners . Many thanks , Mike !
3 #### Anyone who watches home improvement shows is familiar with " Holmes on Homes" . The show brings expert craftsman Mike Holmes into " bad renovations " and corrects them appropriately . The book " Make It Right " follows a similar format --- by discussing a home improvement issue --- the pros and cons ans tips to consider .... worth the money to make yourself better informed .
5 #### My Bride and I watch Mike Holmes as often as we can --- record most shows , and I have personally learned what to do and not to do regarding contractors . I highly recommend Mike 's book to anyone who owns a home , planning on having work done , or preparing to purchasing a home ( repeat or first time buyers ) . Just watching Mike 's show will give you a considerable insight into the world of home inspections . The book is worth considerably more than the actual cost .
5 #### Excellent quality just like the work Holmes does on his TV show . Very well written and illustrated . High quality paper and binding . Will expose you to methodology for home remodeling which produces surperior results . You will get more out of this book if you are a do - it yourselfer , however , you may just save a ton of money if you just aviod one of the pitfalls revealed inthis book .
5 #### My granddaughter really liked this condensed version of the book .
5 #### The words in this book are raw and ring true . They resonate with something deep down inside . A quick read that commands me to pause every few pages and sit with what was shared . Must read !
5 #### Good copy . Should be in every home , next to the bible .
5 #### Having become hooked on his TV program , I was interested in reading Mike 's books . Mike Holmes writes as clearly as he sees problems with rennovations . To the point ! No pulled punches . Even though Mike is a general contractor in Canada , his lessons are just as applicable in the US ... heck as far as I can tell , the building codes are extremely similar ( check your local codes before using any " generic " codes you may learn in books or on TV ... they are constantly being modified ) . If you are buying a new or previously owned house , rennovating an existing home , or building a fresh new home , the information in this book and Mike 's other book are critical to know and apply . BUY THIS BOOK !
5 #### Mike Holmes is a reknowned Contractor with integrity . As a fan of his televised HGTV program , HOLMES on HOMES ... Make It Right , where he extolls / displays proper procedures in home improvement / landscape contracting ( along with a reliable team of professionals ) , by correcting the wrongs of unethical builders , etc . This marvelous book is an extension of his advice !
5 #### The book arrived in perfect condition and well within the alloted time frame . Hopefully , his books and knowledge will offer me the knowledge I need to hire and work with the right contractors .
5 #### I am a real estate agent and part time handyman . The book is good on selecting & managing a remodeler , but less usefull if you are a do - it - your selfer or a handyman . I would like more enough information that I could duplicate some of the jobs which Mike does on his Holmes on Homes show . Such information would include product names , where to purchase , special tools required , tear out / install details which are particular to insure Holmes quality . Went to his website and suspect that some of this was there , but it was not found easily . Nevertheless , the book is excellent for what it does . The most important aspect of te book is Holmes recommendaton to never pay the whole amount before the job is finished . I recommend that you pay enough to cover the builder / remodeler 's costs as they are incured and withold the profit ( estimate to be 20 - 30 % ) till the end . If the job is big , I would have the work inspected by an inspector who adhears to the Holmes inspection principles prior to payment . Have it in writing that you can fire him / her at any time based on your sole judgement and that your expenses are limited to the actual expenses from the last payment . I have had many contractors do work for my clients and some for myself and have had mostly good experiences with contractors . The bad ones are usually weeded out when I explain my payment policy which includes tipping and recommendations for good results .
5 #### I first read " The Prophet " over 35 yrs ago when in college . The wisdom in the words moved me . My husband and I used some of it in our wedding . I decided to purchase and read it again and to give a copy to my daughter . I had the same wonderful experience I had decades earlier . My daughter had the words the prophet spoke on children done in calligraphy , framed and it hangs in her twins nursery .
5 #### Have loved this book for years.mwhat a beautiful understanding of life Kahil Gibran had .
5 #### Good book to have if your going to do any home improvements .... this guy is the real deal .
5 #### Mike Holmes is a superstar in Canada and is just starting to become well known in the U.S. ( he 's been on the Ellen Degeneres show , etc . ) . This is a super book , well thought out and gives lots of great info and tips on how to work with contractors and do repairs and renovations on your home . Highly recommended .
5 #### This book deserves the much - maligned , oft - ignored description of " holy " . I do not always hope so very much - for myself , for the world , for the future - but words like these transform my perspective . I look at the world , at myself , at the future , and laugh for the joy of it .
3 #### This is one of my very favorite books and was very excited to get it . However I did not realize by the description that it was a " pocket " book . Should have looked closer at the picture .
5 #### Classic . Insightful . Thought provoking . I read and/or refer to this book several times a year and have since I received my first copy in the 80s .
5 #### I actually got the book to replace one I had given away years ago , that 's how valuable it is for me . Great book to have around anytime for inspiration . Rosemary Salinas
5 #### The book is awesome . the package was ok but book arrived in good shape .
5 #### I 've loved this beautiful book , The Prophet , since the early 70 's when I discovered it .
4 #### Some are great ... Some are not . But the good ones are really worth the while .
5 #### A classic for all times . A comfort in times of trouble , a lift - up when you need one . A magnificent gift .
5 #### I had this book many years ago and loaned it to a friend . Never did get it back , so I finally ordered another copy . It is just as wonderful and spiritual as I remembered . I will not , however , loan it out this time .
5 #### Lovely and simple . The story is one in which many people can draw parallels from to their own lives . The condition was great and no pages missing or excessive damage .
5 #### My review is biased because I love Gibran ! I 've gifted this book at least ten times !
5 #### I 've always loved this book . I always end up buying a copy because its a great gift and friends usually love it and I give it to them . I 'm hoping to be able to hold on to this copy a little longer than the rest .
5 #### Timeless truths told in a simple yet powerful way . I love this book because it grounds me and calms my spirit .
5 #### One of the greatest all time masterpieces ever written ! I have given dozens of copies away since i was 18 and today I love it just as much at age 56 ! !
4 #### I enjoyed this book even though a bit dated . The story theme is interesting and creative .
5 #### The book is good , and although it 's not MacLean 's best work , it 's certainly worth a read . I recommend it .
5 #### A great storyteller . Very fast paced books . I enjoyed them as a kid and loved him as an adult .
5 #### Reading Grandmother , who 's sight is failing , really appreciates that she can read a favorite book in large print .
5 #### A great story that will keep you glued to your seat . You wo n't be able to put it down .
5 #### I am happy to see that Alistair MacLean 's books are now on Kindle . I am enjoying reading the books again .
5 #### I 've always loved this book .. so happy to own it now and in hard back too . If you love poetry and you have n't read this then you need to buy it now ! Must have !
5 #### I read this as a kid and bought it for my own kids . They love it as I did . They 've commented that its kind of " rough " . There is no political correctness . The roughness of espionage and warfare was not suppressed in the era of this book . The realism is refreshing .
5 #### They just do n't write mysteries like Alistair MacLean did anymore . This is one of my all time favorite books . I first read my dad 's copy as a teen , and was excited to find this edition , the same as the original I read , on Amazon . The story is gripping and engaging , and the twist at the end ( a signature MacLean move which he save literally to the last page ... no cheating ! ) will have you going back and re - reading it just to experience the story with that knowledge ! The book was in excellent condition when it arrived - thank you seller .
3 #### The United States secret service is attempting to steal the plans of a new weapons of mass destruction developed by the USSR . To do that , the services of an international trapeze artist are required . Very early in the plot it becomes clear that the Americans have an infiltrator in their midst , whose identity remains unknown , in the best tradition of MacLean , until a very late stage of the book . Why I thought it is good enough ? Old readers of MacLean will identify most of the artist 's motives and techniques , but they are used with literary skill and the reading is fluent , the reader feels thrilled and intrigued most of the time . Why I thought it is not 4 or 5 stars ? Alistair Maclean 's best books are much more compact , the level of tension is much higher , the images more detailed and reliable , and the whole experience is unlike anything other authors are capable of copying . This book could have been written by someone else . It is not a MacLean Gem . But overall , one still has a good time reading it .
5 #### C.S. Forester has always been one of my favorite authors . This book was ordered 23 August and delivered within 5 days . It is like new . Due to the decline of libraries it is harder to find older books to read
5 #### I consider myself very picky when it comes to books . They have to be pretty exciting and well writting to hold my attention . Maybe I have A.D.D. or something . As the other reviewer said , there is a little " they know we know that they know " business in this book , but that did n't stop me from zipping through this book in about 2 days . I give this book 5 stars because the style of writing just allows you to literally sprint through the pages without realizing you 're even reading . it 's seamless , and a breeze to read . i never once stopped to question something he wrote , and never once felt like i was " outside of the story " . i 'll be purchasing more of his books pronto .
5 #### Three brothers headline the circus of Tesco Wrinfield as aerialists who perform in masks and hoods . The oldest bother has powers of total recall and attacks the attention of the CIA who need someone to enter an Iron Curtain prison to retrieve information about anti - matter . CIRCUS by Alistair MacLean in a spell binder that keeps you glued to your seat til the end of the show . Nash Black , author of QUALIFYING LAPS .
5 #### I had read several of Alistair Maclean 's novels , and had an 8 year break when I got a hold of this . This novel is a prime exhibit of why I enjoy him so much . A mystery , revealing tid - bits here and there , leaving you guessing who the good guys are and who are the bad guys . If you want to be on the edge of your seat for a while , this book will do it .
5 #### Another great MacLean classic . In this book the hero is an American athlete , an immigrant from eastern Europe . He is recruited by the CIA and is to undertake and unimaginable mission . He , of course , succeeds , but not without the extreme difficulties that macLean 's heroes always face . The story twists are awesome and the ending is both expected and surprising . A great read .
5 #### There are lots of surprising twists in this story including a final surprise in the last sentence . MacLean did a very good job when he wrote this book .
5 #### It arrived earlier than expected and was just was I was looking for . It 's in perfect quality and I ca n't wait to start reading it ! Thank you !
5 #### This us a timeless book . I first read it in 1968 , and still love 47 years later . Sha
5 #### What a great book ! So short , you could easily read it in an hour ; and yet , a book you could also spend a lifetime pondering over , soaking in .
5 #### If you like the more fulsome copy of The Prophet , purchase it . This one is bare bones .
4 #### This book has been around for decades and is very insightful .
5 #### Very enlightening book . I am non - religious , and I still found many profound thoughts in this book .
2 #### disappointed it is written in , and has different cover than on purchase order third style and looks old .
5 #### The most beautiful book .Bought many as gifts .
4 #### In good shape , bought as a gift and it was a little more used then I thought but I think part of it is the age , Not abused but just very aged . Would buy from seller again . Prophet along the lines of Buddha or similar ideals . Not so much prophecy as a way of living and thinking about life .
5 #### Not sure about this one , still gathering my thoughts about this book is not what I expected .
5 #### This is unique book for living souls and for those who starve to awaken . Every phenomena of human 's life is discussed with pure divine wisdom ! I loved the way he teaches and illustrates ! This is a book from Infinite Intelligence of God ! Thanks to Publishers
1 #### What a stupid book . It felt like torture reading it . I 'm glad I bought it used and spent very little money on it , otherwise , I would have been quite upset . Do n't waste your time with this one .
5 #### Have not received it yet but have had several copies . This is a great book and parts helped me deal with myself in raising my children . I have given several as gifts . The Prophet should be in everyones bookcase or bookshelf .
3 #### Just started the book . A little hard for me to understand . Maybe someone else will , I 'm sure .
5 #### This is a classic work that I return to again and again . Its thoughts about life , death , having children , food - all aspects of life really - ring very true and give so much insight from angles you might not have considered . The chapters are short and can be read in a couple of minutes , and out of order , so you can pick it up any time for a quick read . I think this book and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Power - of - Now / dp / B00005AAPL / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Power of Now</a>&nbsp;are my two favorite books of this type that return to again and again . ( If you get The Power of Now I recommend the audio version , read by the author , which I like a lot better than the print copy , which I also have read . It 's more " absorbable " for some reason ) . I 'm glad to finally have it on Kindle so I can access it anywhere , any time on any of my devices .
4 #### makes you think and brings your mind into a new way of looking at things
5 #### I have been wanting to buy this book for a long time . I finally bought it and am very glad I did . The book , although softcover , is very nicely constructed . The pages are thick and do not stick together . It is a decent size and the font size is perfect .
3 #### It took awhile getting into this one , but it 's a classic so I probably should n't complain .
5 #### I 've read and listened to audio versions of the Prophet for over 30 years . Gibran filled it with invaluable lessons that still resonant even though it was originally published in 1923 . I buy these regularly to give as gifts and this version is nicely done and I like the cover . There is so much that , even though you can easily read it in one sitting , you ca n't grasp it all . I still have a CD version of it that I play in my car once in a while . The language is beautiful and I recommend it as life lessons to anyone .
1 #### Foolishly thought this was the official paperback from a reputable publisher . Turned out to be a quickie print - on - demand knockoff . Buyer beware .
5 #### I 've read this at least 10 times . It is beautiful .
3 #### Introduced my granddaughter to the book . No comments yet
5 #### Thirteen chapters matching the thirteen programs of the BBC series on which it was based . Follows the evolution of life on earth , presenting fascinating observations about the likely functional reasons life unfolded as it has . Offers the grand sweep of life in an engaging and integrated presentation , with a very readable and even charming tone , and including more than 100 excellent color photos . TOC : 1 the infinite variety 2 building bodies 3 the first forests 4 the swarming hordes 5 the conquest of the waters 6 the invasion fo the land 7 a watertight skin 8 lords of the air 9 eggs , pouches , and placentas 10 theme and variation 11 the hunters and the hunted 12 a life in the trees 13 the compulsive communicators
4 #### Gaskin previously write this 30 years before under the title This Other Eden , she has referred to ' This Other Eden ' as the Skeleton of this book . I ve noticed that in the first books that Gaskin wrote the characters were not always very likable , in her later books she s developed the characters more and in this book she 's went into far more detail than she did previously with ' This other Eden ' . This story starts out where we meet Russian Anna and her daughter Nicole living in America . Anna wants everything she never had for her daughter and Nicole does everything she can to make Anna proud of her . When Nicole 's English grandfather die 's his will changes Anna and Nicole 's live for ever . The story goes through Nicole 's whole life and how she survived during world war 2 . I enjoyed this .
5 #### Read this with my dad , a WWII vet - we both learned a lot and enjoyed the characters woven into history ,
5 #### Herman Wouk is such a wonderful writer ... I have read this and War and Remembrance twice over the years . The reader is drawn into the period leading up to WWII and then the war itself . We see it through the lives of the Henry family both in the US and in Europe . The 2nd book continues the story through the end of the war and its aftermath . I am fascinated by this period in history , and that incredible generation that lived it , not just in the United States , but those who fought and died in Europe as well . Highly recommend .
4 #### I used to read this book ( and its sequel ) once a year . Have n't know for a while , so was glad to see it on Audible . It seems dated ( Pug and the other male protagonists are quite misogynistic , and Rhoda is made out to be quite a harpy ) , but the description of the war continues to be interesting .
5 #### Historical fiction . As one who immigrated to the United States as a small child and one from a Jewish background , it gave me a realistic viewpoint of the people who lived in that era . In addition to reading the history of that time , I would recommend that people read this fictional account . It gives a realistic picture of the people and events that occurred during that time in America .
1 #### Reading this book through to the finish was very difficult for me . It was almost like eating a crabcake with too much bread and filling in it . There is so much irrelevant details that at times I lost the gist of the story . I think I 'll stick to documentary books from now on .
5 #### " Winds of War " and " War and Remembrance " are two of my favorite books , both good for re - reading and travelling . I find something new each time I re - read . Definitely a classic WWII novel .
5 #### Read many years ago re - reading it was still a terrific and totally absorbing adventure and a powerful history lesson .
5 #### We all know the Mini - Series based on the 1970 Herman Wouk The Winds of War book . I thought the series was just so - so , but this book was an excellent introduction to the pre- and slightly post- Pearl Harbor attack . This starts around 1938 with Pug Henry as our central character . Pug is a Navy captain that finds his way to meet with all the European Theater leaders and has a role advising Roosevelt . There are family issues and Pugs son , Byron , winds up rescuing his Jewish girl ( who he wants to be his girlfriend ) during the early Warsaw German takeover . This book has a good balance between the soft storyline and the core WWII history . Wouk seems to get all the facts right , such as the Japanese missing out on the opportunity to take out the oil farm near Pearl , which would have rendered the island useless to our Navy . I thoroughly enjoyed this book and give it a must read .
4 #### it was fine but i thought the book would be smaller and easier to carry around
1 #### Poorly transcribed into digital format , too many typographical errors . Back to my hardcopy .
1 #### Of all the " classics " that I downloaded from free on my new Kindle , this one was absolutely un - interesting . There must be something the rest of the world saw in it that I missed .
5 #### A great book with profound thoughts on various topics . I 've loved this book for many years and now I 'm glad to have my own copy .
4 #### I enjoyed this book but found it a bit long and the end felt a bit rushed . Overall , it had a strange pace . The story was interesting but not great . I enjoyed Property of a Gentleman much more .
4 #### A well written book , well constructed and moving easily between time periods . Catherine Gaskin is a good writer and I really enjoyed this book . Some of the characters were well before their time . A good read .
4 #### Very pleased to see more novels by Catherine Gaskin being made available for kindle , and hence to a wider reading audience . This is a vintage romance with a strong and fascinating historical component . The great strength of this author lies in her wonderful characterisation . Her characters are shown with all of their strengths and frailities . Even though this is a romance ( that may seem a bit dated ) there is still a well developed storyline and enough intrigue to keep the most jaded reader engaged . I 'm a bit biased when it comes to these vintage novels but they are true " gems " .
5 #### This is one of the great , all time romanctic novels . Gaskin is a wonderful writer , very like Mary Stewart , another great romantic author , in terms of atmosphere , plot and character . Lucciella
5 #### I recently discovered that I had held onto this book for probably 40 years . I had read it several times then it got lost under some stuff for years . Recently found it and read it again and it is just such a good book . A wonderful read . I wo n't let it get lost again for sure .
5 #### Many parts caused me a great deal of stress . I was very involved in the lives of the characters . The book is a history hidden as an adventure .
3 #### Excels at capturing the gstalt and lingo of the 1940s . Somewhat predictable and formulaic in its shifting narrative among the protagonists ... the storyline shifts with regularity . Almost made for TV before TV . wouk has clearly read and admred Tolstoy , but lacks his aesthetic sensbilities
5 #### I learned so much history from this book , and it was brought to life by being wrapped in a compelling , well - told story about a family who are all affected in various ways by the coming of WWII . Highly recommended !
5 #### A great historical fiction book that I reread after 20 years . The book is well researched and has compelling characters and plot . Great book !
5 #### Five stars are n't enough . This is book one of a two volume family epic ( the second is War and Remembrance ) , two historical novels taking you through the entirety of World War Two . Just awesome .
5 #### I did n't read this book in school so I when I heard about Salma Hayek 's movie I read it before going and it made the movie so much more meaning . A lot of his poems are in movie so it was nice to have read them in advance . It 's a beautiful story about a poet 's philosophy on life 's questions .
5 #### I never tire of reading this book , always relevant ... i keep buying copies to give away to family and friends .
5 #### This is a shorter book than I expected , and not exactly what I thought I was buying : but I 'm happily surprised . I have spent a few days reading this slowly , as I want to really digest it and not just power through it . I will keep this book , and probably read it a few more times as my life changes . Having had a rough three years , some parts made me bitch - cry and are very practical to my life .
5 #### What an amazing book . This is truly an epic work of historical fiction , and Wouk obviously spent a lot of time researching his material . The story was complex , first - rate , and original . It is really an unforgettable read .
5 #### I have watched the mini series several times and loved it . The book is great and while it mostly is the same as the show , there are some very interesting details that the book provides that are not in the show , and those details greatly enhance the story
5 #### Destroyed his copies from other women & replaced it with this . Always a provoking read .
5 #### A great way to learn the history of WW2 at eye level , at the pace of the events . I really enjoyed the book , and I 'm almost exclusively a non - fiction reader .
1 #### Could n't figure out if this was history or fiction . The Henry family is unbelievable . Scratch that . Maybe believable but unpleasant . Pug sleeps with a twenty something Rhoda with a whatever but somehow they are upstanding folk ? Puleeze ! if you know the chronology of the prewar era you could map out Henry 's itinerary blindfolded . The characters of hitler and Stalin are carbon copies . Marshall does n't even exist in the book . Old man jastrow is a fool to the very end . I could easily write the sequel . Only question : How do I manage to get pug from Guadalcanal to North Africa in time to consult with Ike ? what a waste of time .
5 #### Thirty years ago , a friend gave me a copy of War and Remembrance . I have , several times , tried to read it but it was missing the beginning of the story . Now I have read the beginning and I enjoyed the characters and their relations with each other very much . I especially appreciated that the author presumes the reader knows the history of those times and does not beat him over the head with it . The story simply flows . Time to read War and Remembrance now .
5 #### When one reads Mr. Wouk 's first of his books about the Second World War , one is n't aware that the characters are fictitious because he immerses them with events which actually took place during the war .
5 #### He develops complex characters in the first 20 pages of the book . One of my favorite reads of all time .
5 #### If you have ever questioned time , life , freedom , pain , friendship , love , marriage or pleasure I recommend this book . The lessons in this book can positively impact your life . Very simply written , this book speaks to everyone .
5 #### One could read portions of this beautiful book daily , and find something relevant to their life .
1 #### Quoting the Dalai lama by Bill Murray in Caddy Shack " goon gala a goon gala " . This book makes just as much sense .
5 #### reading this again after 50 years brings home how important it is to meld the cultures of our world and how eternal and universal truth , beauty and love are . This book was not in great shape bit was as described and will last at least as long as I do .
5 #### The poetry and sayings/ quotes are beautiful . Makes a great gift idea after you add one to your own shelf !
5 #### A well thought out history of World War 2 .
5 #### Excellent read ! Saw the movie and had to read the book ! Herman Wouk is a wonderfully talented author !
5 #### I 've been a fan of history since high school , but this book , and its sequel , " War and Remembrance " bring WWII to life like nothing I 've ever read . I 've always enjoyed historical fiction and these two books are two of the best , especially the recounting of the luck ( it can be described as nothing else , except , maybe , an act of god ) the U.S. experienced at the battle of Midway , where the U.S. essentially destroyed the Japanese Navy , or at least its ability to ever win again . I read these two books as a high school student , then again about five years ago and am starting a third re - read at this time . These two novels never get old .
5 #### This is both a story of a war and a story of a family caught in it . It begins with a demented dictator in Germany and ends as with the attack on Pearl Harbor so the American war is yet to unfold . The war in Europe is the main thread and the American Naval Officer caught up in with his maturing young family . While Captain Henry Is assigned to desk jobs in the effort to save England and later Russia from the tide of the war he longs for a command of a sea going vessel . The book gives fascinating insights into the the powerful rulers involved in the War and the Peace and the roles each must play in this largest war in history .
5 #### Always enjoy stories about Second World War ! Plan to read War and Remembrance !
5 #### Great combination of romance / adventure novel and history lesson . I enjoyed it immensely and got an inside look at World War II preparations and actions in England , Germany , Japan and America . It includes fictitious figures , but also a great deal about Churchill , Hitler , Roosevelt , Stalin , etc . I have just started War and Remembrance , which continues the saga after Pearl Harbor ..
5 #### Must read the second book in the series , War and Remembrance , if you liked this one . Very well written . An epic along with the sequel .
5 #### Easy to read and a spellbinding story of lives that were affected by events leading up to WWII .
5 #### reread this timeless masterpiece as I just did . To be kept by your bedside and savor the poetry , philosophy and artistry of this great artist .
5 #### I am a 70s guy so Kahlil Gibran philosophy for me goes way back
5 #### Everyone should own and read this book every few years . It is a masterpiece that is worth its weight in gold ... love ... fill in the blank ... to what is most important to you .
3 #### I read the book 50 years ago and just wanted to read it again but could n't find the original copy . I enjoyed the plot and remembrances . But , very disappointed in the Kindle edition . Many misspellings , dropped letters , and punctuation . It was n't so bad that I could n't figure out what the intent was but thought it should have been a better rendition than what I received .
5 #### The first time I read this book I was an undergraduate in college , I liked it then and I still enjoy it .
4 #### I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT IT AND IT WAS INSPRIATION FOR A WEDDING SOME OF THE READINGS .
2 #### In the first 100 pages I learned a lot about Presidents and Arab Kings . Who knew they were into the RV - ing lifestyle ? Next thing you know they 'll be spotted at a KOA . A big disappointment , sorry to say .
3 #### I agree with most of the foregoing reviews for this book . I found it in a beach house we rented and got through it quickly . It 's entertaining and works in spite of the unlikely happenings . I almost jettisoned it unfinished , however , because of one bizarre quirk . Someone else in this forum remarked that one of the characters speaks in British idiom - with a convenient excuse about going to school in England - but it 's worse than that . ALL of the characters talk as if MacLean had never set foot in the USA ! Did he ? I mean , we are talking about the Golden Gate Bridge , at the entrance to San Francisco Bay , right ? But the characters all talk as if they came straight out of borstal , Wormwood Scrubs , and Scotland Yard ! At one point near the end , there 's a real howler : one of the local lawmen on the bridge mutters something about calling in the armed police . The Armed Police ? That was the last straw . Obviously , MacLean was unaware that there are no " Armed Police " in America , and really could n't be bothered to get it right . Sloppy work , MacLean . The weird dialogue made suspension of disbelief difficult . If he could n't manage American idiom , why set it in the US ?
2 #### With a surgically military precision Peter Branson and his men plan the kidnapping of the President of the US and his two guests from the Middle East , a prince and a king . The kidnapping is to take place in the middle of the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco and Branson is expecting a large ransom if everything goes according to his plan . A rather unrealistic adventure story .
3 #### Just a comment regarding ' Mary Agnes D Faderan 's ' review below : Her review is not for this book ( GoldenGate ) but rather for another of Alistair MacLean 's books known as ' The Golden Rendezvous ' . Of the two books , ' Golden Rendezvous ' is easily superior , though I like both .
5 #### I think James Bond should take a leaf from Alistair Maclean 's books . His hero in this " yarn " defies description , someone who is smart , a little cynical , unwilling to give in to the momentary distractions of injury or beautiful spoiled women ( who are actually great heroines in disguise ! ) in order to force the hand of the blackguard holding the world in thrall . My most memorable scene in this book is when the protagonist is suffering from a bullet - ridden leg , yet hanging from the side of a porthole in high wind , trying valiantly to get past the villains that have hijacked this ship which has precious lives and gold cargo . It 's a real treat and an engrossing read , especially because it is so fantastic ! I would rather take a hero of Maclean 's stamp than Ian Fleming 's any day of the week !
4 #### Almost every major thriller plot has been written in some form by Alistair MacLean , from the commando team sent on an impossible mission ( " The Guns of Navarone , " " Where Eagles Dare , " " Force Ten from Navarone " ) , hijacking on the open seas ( " The Golden Rendezvous " ) , the killer virus in the hands of an insane terrorist ( " The Satan Bug " ) , terrorists planning to cause a super - quake in California ( " Goodbye California " ) , and various undercover secret agent missions . In " The Golden Gate , " a crack team of criminals led by mastermind Peter Branson executes a daring plan to kidnap the President of the United States on San Francisco 's Golden Gate bridge . Branson and his men block off both ends of the bridge , wire it with explosives , and demand millions of dollars . . . plus a pardon . Any rescue attempts will result in the detonation of the explosives , killing the President and destroying the Golden Gate Bridge . But Branson is an ego - maniac , and he ca n't resist attention from the media . So he not only lets , but actually invites , the press to stay on the bridge and cover the story . Too bad for Branson that one of the journalists is actually FBI Special Agent Paul Revson . The game is underway : Can Revson disable the explosives and stop the plot ? Will Branson discover that Revson is really an agent ? There 's no characterization to speak of , and as a writer , MacLean is passable but nothing special . Still , read solely for its plot , " The Golden Gate " is fun and diverting .
5 #### To engaging have to force myself to put the book down Otherwise I would not get anything else accomplished
5 #### Nothing I read gives you the feel for this period leading up to the war like the Winds of War .
5 #### Ca n't believe I missed this one for so long . Good story , with important world events weaved through the fictional characters . Looking forward to reading the sequel .
5 #### This book rose up to my expectations .... Its the kind of book you will read in a very short time and will look forward to reading it again ... one of the top 5 books I have ever read .
5 #### I like to read this book often and always find something new with every reading . Many wonderful nuggets of truth here as a wide variety of life topics are explored .
5 #### This book is one to be read over and over . It encompases philisopical / poetic views on the most important issues in life . My favorite is the chapter on children ... that they are the arrows and the parents are the bows shooting them into the future . LOVE THIS BOOK . Intellectual , spiritual , comforting .
5 #### It gave me altogether new insights into the early stages of World War II up to the United States entry in it .
5 #### A delightful blend of historical chronology , cultural anthropology , and soap opera . And i just looked and was surprised and delighted to learn Mr. Wouk is still alive ! It made me think more about the core motivations of the nation states of WWII .
5 #### I highly recommend this classic book . Hard to put down . Holds your interest from page one to the end .
5 #### Excellent book ! I have read dozens of books about WWII ; this book is so very informative , very different from what I have already read . Most of the books I have read tell the stories of the atrocities , along with some of the war strategy , whether non - fiction or historical fiction . This book is very well written and goes into depth about Churchill , President Roosevelt , Hitler and the " goings on " at the beginning of the war . I have learned more about the politics , about the people - than in any other book I have read on the war . I read it many , many years ago and decided to read it again , having forgotten it , but remembering how much I enjoyed it in the past . Yes , it is historical fiction , so you do n't know what is factual and what is not ; however , there are some details and information - that you know Herman Wouk would not " make up . " Loved it so much , I am now reading the sequel - " War & Remembrance . "
5 #### One of Alistair 's later books that holds up under scrutiny .
5 #### I read it every few years-- yeah I am that guy . ;)
1 #### All I can say is that this book sucked . I barely got 20 % into the book before i ditched . Unfortunately I could not return it , so I had to eat the cost . All of MacLean 's books on my wish list I went in and deleted . I honestly do not know how he gets published .
5 #### excellent conceived story and enjoyable reading throughout with many twists and turns
5 #### A really gripping story , very well - told , and eminently feasible , set against the background of the well - known landmark in San Francisco . A great read !
5 #### A classic purchased as a college graduation gift . Thoughtful , sage life wisdom imparted in non - religious poetry . I 'll purchase this title again and again for high school and college graduation gifts .
5 #### The Prophet conveys the attitude that all men ( persons ) should have for one another . One could call it the parables of Christ written in our time . Gibran waxes philosophical about issues ranging from trade , to marriage , to love , to death . Hard to think of this as fiction . Seems as real as Sunday morning preachers but with a better message .
5 #### it 's such a short read but packed with some heavy knowledge . The topics are so grand that they are still discussed today . But with a flow as easy as a children 's story Gibran is able to deliver this wisdom with smooth majesty . A definite must read .
3 #### It 's poetic in style , seeking to give some moral lessons on basic life issues .
5 #### For over 6 decades , this book continues to comfort and inspire . Now a film Kahlil Gibran 's The Prophet has captured its words and made them visible . Its message is universal ; its meaning , for everyone .
5 #### Used for readings in our wedding . Gave as gift to our priest . He had never heard of it before & fell in love with the beautiful poetry of it
5 #### German Wouk 's The Winds of War is as relevant today as . they remain . This work is personal and professionally written . It explains the vast changes going on in the world both politically and culturally . Exchange Nazi for ISIS . Pay attention to your surroundings . READ LEARN
5 #### Great book , lots of history but a good story line too . Total throw back , but very worth the time it took to read .
5 #### Reading " The Winds of War " and " War and Remembrance " makes me wish Herman Wouk had written more about the Henrys and the Jastrows after the war ! Riveting story amidst accurate history !
5 #### I 'm a Herman Wouk fan , so I was glad to get this book as a replacement for one that was lost .
5 #### If you love history this book is a must . It 's long , and detailed . I came back to it recently , and found disturbing parallels to modern history . In the Kindle edition Wouk has added an Introduction that is essential reading . Five stars and well worth them . James R. Preston Author of The Surf City Mysteries
4 #### they talked about it on the talk and purchased it because of that
3 #### I read this many years ago in High School , and really liked it then - later , recommended it to my high - school- age son , and he found it worthwhile , as well . I chose the book to re - read and it is worthwhile again .
5 #### A book that all should read . Helps bring your perspective back to its beginning . Beautiful words that touch the soul .
5 #### Winds of War reads like a dated soap opera but the reason it can be given five stars is the intricate way the characters are woven into the reality of the time and the excellent writing itself . The author has an amazing grasp of the historical time - line in which he s writing and a great knowledge of the causes and results of the actions depicted . I read the book and then discovered that a seven - part mini - series had been made of the book and that the author had written the screenplay for the series so that there was no blurring of the writers intent in the filming of the series . It is available on YouTube and was meticulously filmed in a number of different countries and settings over the course of three years and at a huge expense . The acting is pretty bad but the book is brought to life quite well .
5 #### I read this years ago ! I remember how much I loved it so I am going to read it again .
5 #### The prequel to the US entry into the Second World War from the epic storyteller Herman Wouk . It primarily follows a US Naval family as they weave their way through the world . The events of the growing war seemingly blow the elements of the family about the world stage like tumbleweeds , and as more nations join in , more people are moved about the globe by the growing storm . This was followed by the two volume saga War and Remembrance , which chronicles the US participation in the war . Both novels were made into min - series .
5 #### An amazing book . Our heroic men were recognized for their courage .
5 #### A powerful look into the days before , during & after WW2 and you will never forget the family members who experienced these years . It is as powerful as the book , " Exodus " by Leon Uris . Once you start reading " The Winds of War " it is hard to stop .
5 #### A MUST READ IN LIGHT OF THE POLITICS OF TODAY . INDEED PRESCIENT .
5 #### I received Prophet as promised by Amazon ans have read it and enjoyed it very much . There is a movie coming out of the story and I wanted to review the story before the movie .
5 #### I know this book for 40 years . I have read it in Spanish and English several times . It is a classic . In many ways is based on Jesus Sermon of the Mount and it 's teaching is beautiful , deep in knowledge and tender . The English version is obviously higher in translation quality than the Spanish one . now I buy it to give it as a present to my good friends . I already have it in my e - books . No doubt , the best of Kahlil Gibran
5 #### My favorite book of all time . I bought it for my granddaughter to help her through a period of confusion about her faith .
5 #### Most beautiful prose / poetry . I 've purchased additional copies for my family members .
5 #### I bought this book for a friend because I love my copy so much I could n't let go of it !
5 #### Historically informative along with being relevant in present times . History will repeat itself if we do n't study it and learn from it .
5 #### I love books like this and am sorry I have n't read it sooner . I promptly downloaded the second book as I felt like I was missing a good companionfar ... when I finished The Winds of War . The second book is equally as good so
5 #### I read this book when it first was published . This is probably the second or third time I have re - read it . As my life has changed over the years so has my perspective of this book . It is written with a backdrop of pre - world war II , from the perspective of a Naval career officer and his family . Set on a world stage , of how America and its allies viewed the world at that time . All in all a good read . It is a romance , a historical novel , a coming of age novel .
5 #### This is an outstanding book that gives many details about events leading to WWII . What makes it even more interesting is the story of the Henry family that weaves throughout the book .
2 #### This 800 + page boom would have been just fine with about 400 + fewer pages . Good God . I 'm so glad I 'm finally done
5 #### Always a wonderful read for those who find Kahlil Gibran ' interesting . Gives the reader a chance to read at a slow pace and think about what he says in order to implement positive in your life .
5 #### What can I say ? Each page is a mystery to unfold ... Like us ...
5 #### A fantastic read ! I read it all the way to the end as soon as I started reading it .
4 #### Profound and timeless . If more people were open to this type of philosophy , the world would be a better place .
5 #### I had a copy of this book in my home since I was maybe 11 years old . Every single time I read it , I find a new nugget of wisdom , a new perspective and a new insight . That being said , I 'm 33 now , and so much of who I am and how I think stems from this book , so I bought a copy for my son for his 14th birthday . I hope it has as much of an impact on him as it has me . Very spiritual ( NOT religious ) and enlightening book . I 'd recommend it as required reading for all teenagers , and that they keep a copy for the years to come .
5 #### It seems cruel to review this book because you ca n't get it anymore . My old copy is held together with rubber bands . I liked everything about it . All the characters were wonderful ; the history was accurate ; the mystery and intrigue were mysterious and intriguing . The secondary characters were almost better than the main characters . Good was n't always pretty and Evil was evil with reasons and , sometimes , even strengths . You could hiss the villians and cheer the good guys but you knew that these people lived and you mourned and rejoiced with them . When the hero finally wins his lady 's love , it 's a timeless moment . Her love is an achievement ... not a casual tumble in the normal historical bodice ripper . My only complaint about this book was it was too short and there 's never been a sequel . If you can find a copy , read it - you 'll love it .
5 #### I , too , am desperately seeking a copy of this book . I read it when I was in high school , and it really turned me on to reading . It was the first time I realized that reading could take you away , provide an escape from reality . It meant so much to me . I read that book 5 or six times - it was totally dog eared and worn . Now , 20 years later , I still think about it ... and I ca n't find this book anywhere . Reading this story was like stepping back in time - into a romantic and charming and exciting time ... I really wish the publisher would re print this book ! I would love to have my daughters read it now . Why ca n't they get it onto Kindle - certainly it could be done inexpensively . And it is a timeless tale - never will be " out of date . " I 'm not above begging , here ...
5 #### Many years ago I saw this story on a made for TV series . I liked the TV program so much that I planned to read the book , but never got around to it until recently . Long and detailed , " The Winds of War " is well written and is excellent overall ... definitely worth the time to read this 800 + page book . The story is immersed with factual history . Loved it !
4 #### implausible plot but an interesting read , I am a WW II buff so the back room scenes were well written .
5 #### Great historical fiction covering the beginning of World War II . More about the lives of people than actual battles although you will find some military content .
5 #### Excellent book . The story is based on well researched historic facts . It is well written and very captivating . I strongly recommend it .
5 #### This is the fourth or fifth time I have read this book . Each time I love the people and their stories . However , that is just a small part of the value of the book . Reading the book the last few days of 2016 into 2017 you see that time happening now . we need some Pugs !
5 #### I love Kahlil Gibran so much I named my son after him .. and this is a relatively unknown work of his . It 's my all - time favorite book by Gibran .. like " The Prophet " , it 's deep and profound , but this book is even more eloquent and poetic and easier to digest as the aphorisms are shorter . A " must - have " for all Kahlil Gibran fans :))
5 #### got one for my son and one for myself . Makes a nice coffee table book and is filled with wisdom .
5 #### I first read this when I was in junior high and got it from the library . I later got the book from a library sale -- I love the book . I go back to re - read it frequently when I get tired of the current crop of historical romances . Grace Ingram spent a lot of time developing her characters and you can tell when you read it . Julitta is a strong heroine of the middle ages who is mistaken for a vixen . Red Adam has inherited a castle that is in disrepair and where people are plotting to take his inheritance away . Red Adam and Julitta are forced to marry and he sets about winning her love and together they are able to take back his castle . The secondary characters ( both secondary and not ) are well defined . My copy of this book is worn out and I wish it was available for the Kindle ! !
5 #### This is a book that I return to every couple of years , it 's unashamedly one of my very favourite books for this genre . It 's a stirring historical romance set during the 12th Century in England . The heroine Lady Julitta de Montrigord is no shrinking violet . Julitta is a young woman who has learnt take care of herself , she 's feisty but also vulnerable . She meets her match in the new lord of Brentborough , Lord Adam . There 's mystery , treachery , rich historical detail and a fine compliment of supporting characters in this finely wrought historical romance . It 's a wonderfully written love story . Copies are as rare as hen 's teeth but well worth sourcing .
5 #### I bought my local library 's copy of Red Adam 's Lady probably 25 + years ago when it was purging its shelves ... I got it 's copy of Miss One Thousand Spring Blossoms the same way ... lucky me ... I even have a second copy of Red Adam 's Lady in case my first one disintegrates ... Love this book -- probably never have an e - book because of heirs and getting the electronic rights signed up so I am glad to have my copy ... will get it out of the box it and several of my all time favorites are in tomorrow and maybe read a true book vs an e - book for a while ... This is a wonderful novel of strong , unique lovers vitalized in a time of crisis in north England ... very historically accurate and very humanly insightful ... love how it plays against many of the troubadour ballads of that time and the inaptly named historical novels of ours--
5 #### I bought this book when it first came out and LOVED it enough to read it three times in a short period . I do n't know what happened to it , and I would LOVE to get another copy of it . However , the prices here are WAY out of my price range and I would love to see it come out in ebook format .
5 #### Not in the least liberated or politically correct . Very old school man resues female but yet the female is reallt the stronger of the 2 . Still for old school escapist romance . Great
5 #### And to me , there 's a big difference between the two . This is one of my favorite books ever . I once owned a hard copy , and it broke my heart when I lost it . This is not your run - of - the - mill bodice rippers ; this is actually a historically correct , realistic , and totally fascinating story . Ingram takes you right into the details and politics of what life was like for the real people , not the perfumed toadies in court . The times were perilous and things could ( and did ! ) change in the blink of an eye . Julitta is one of the strongest fictional heroines I 've read , and I love how the relationship between her and Red Adam develops . They 're not perfect people , but they are honorable and they are perfect for each other . Even if Julitta does n't believe it for quite a while -- maybe because she does n't . This is not a hot , lustful romp ; it 's a love story set in a dangerous historical time , and it 's really the best " historical romance " I 've ever read .
5 #### This is a gripping story that kept me awake and reading past midnight several nights . The background is World War II as seen through the eyes of a family involved at the highest levels of politics and policy as war becomes inevitable and the war years roll on . I ca n't think of any other book in which the principal character meets and talks with FDR , Churchill , Hitler and Stalin . Pug Henry is likeable and I cared about the problems of friends trapped in Europe and family members fighting the war in the Pacific . I read this book in the 1980s when it was first published and enjoyed it so much that I purchased it again for my Kindle . For those who are a bit vague on WWII history , it 's all there and goes down with a spoonful of sugar because the characters are so interesting . War and Remembrance is the second volume of this story , and also well worth the purchase .
5 #### Book was fantastic , almost . 1500 pages and One of the best I 've ever read about before the 2nd . WW started and why . This . focuses on the Henry family , of which the father is high up in the/ Navy . He had one son that followed his lead and became a Navy pilot and the other a Submariner . There is also a daughter for which you 'll have to read the story to find out about her . There are/ lots ! of Political views . And a great deal of personal pages about : Roosevelt , Hitler and Mussolini . I 'm getting ready to start on the 2nd . Book of the set called"War and Remberance . " This is also another challenging read of over 1000 pages .
5 #### I have read this book at least two other times and have enjoyed it every time . It is a great read . I am just starting War and Remembrance for about the third time and expect enjoy it just as much .
5 #### It 's definitely not War and Peace , but it is a very faithful snapshot of the times before Pearl Harbor . Full of interesting characters doing the best the can or deny the reality of the winds of war that are coming and for many have come before US enters WWII .
5 #### The Winds of War was turned into a TV miniseries , one of the most popular of all time . It was fantastic , but the book is so much more so . This was my 3rd or 4th time reading it , and I discovered somethings I 'd missed before . For history enthusiasts , this book ca n't be bea
5 #### A must re - read of Herman Wouk 's epic Volume I ...
5 #### After reading the hardback some ten years ago I find the new updates and Kindle version so much more comprehensive and easy to understand with much more detail .
4 #### Gibran , centuries ago / at such a young age , can write in few words , what one FEELS but unable to express it !
5 #### There are only a few romance books that I would even consider giving five stars , but this is certainly one . Like many of the other reviewers , I read this as a teen and still have my old ragged copy . I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good historical romance where there is more emphasis on the emotional relationship between the main characters and less on the sexual relationship .
5 #### My copy is so worn out it 's taped to together ! Really great read , has realistic history , romance , adventure and everyday life . The author paints very vivid images that really draw you into the story and while it IS a love story , she does nt choose to rely on sex scenes to pique your interest . ( a plus in my opinion ) One of my all time favorite books .
5 #### I was looking out over the ocean and I thought of this book that I had read 30 years ago . I went over all the details in my mind that I could remember and wished I still had this book to read . I grabbed my mac and went to amazon.com in the hopes of finding a copy . I read all the reviews and I was amazed at how many women are out there who remember this book as I do . The other reviews are all accurate . In one scene Jullitta and Adam are on the run . They are in getting ready to go to sleep and she tells him that if she ever calls him husband he will know that she is his . Which really matters at a later time . There are deer flapping at the oat cakes they were going to have to breakfast , and wild painted scots bent on murder . It 's really a beautiful story . I hope they offer it on kindle soon .
5 #### I read this many years ago , and have re - read it many times since then . The story is gripping , the characters vivid and engaging , and it is just a satisfying read in every way . Look for it in used bookstores and library sales -- the prices online are unreal . Whay has n't some clever publisher reissued this gem ?
5 #### From the dust jacket : ... Red Adam 's Lady is a boisterous , bawdy tale of wild adventure , set against the constant dangers of medieval England . It is a story of civil war and border raids , scheming aristocrats and brawling villagers , daring escapes ... Its vivid details give the reader a fascinating and realistic view of life in a medieval castle and village ... The reviews here are excellent . There are times when I cringe at the brutality of an era but the writing here is so fast - paced I found I did n't have time . It 's a wild ride and highly enjoyable .
5 #### I am thrilled to see others know how good this book is ! I read this years ago and kept the copy for a long time . Then because I was crazy I got rid of my copy . I kept thinking about it though and a few years ago paid about 40 dollars for a used copy . Money well spent ! I read this book at least once a year and enjoy it every time . I keep hoping it will be reprinted so more people can enjoy reading about Adam and Julitta . There is something romantic about a man literally having some sense knocked into him . Unlike so many romances of the time that had the love interest fight each other to the end then suddenly they are in love , Ms. Ingram gradually brings Julitta from dislike , to grudging respect , friendship and then love . All this while the Scots are over the border , there is disloyalty in the household and treason is afoot . This it a great read !
5 #### Great book with historical data . The chapters with the German viewpoint of WWII was fascinating .
5 #### Probably one of the best World War Two books ever written . I will definitely read it again as I find new insights every time I read it .
5 #### Read is when it was first printed . Enjoyed it more this time around . Highly recommend it and now reading the sequel .
5 #### Well what is there to say about this book ? It is fantastic of course .
5 #### Beneath the story so masterfully told is a revealing of the raw prejudices and disregard for the essence of humanity : the hopes , dreams , and fears that all people hold . That a nation , leader , or people can be so callous or so cowardly that those elements of another race or nation of people can be so dismissed and left to destruction is incredible to ponder . And so it seems that the danger lies for all of us when the extremes of our emotions drive our judgment and we forget to be human first , and then civilized .
5 #### Superbly researched . Writing is the best Wouk ever did .
4 #### As a history of WWII for the layperson , this book excelled . It was engrossing in most places . However , as a romance novel ( the author 's description) ... it sucked . While the main hero ( Pug ) and , to lesser extent his son ( Byron ) , was well - fleshed out , the female characters were only shallowly portrayed . They were mere caricatures . It was the main weakness of both books for me . I could n't discern if this was caused by the author 's not understanding women , or if he was simply a misogynist . In either case , it was severely disappointing as a romance novel . The only reason I kept reading and finally finished both books was because the historical aspects of the story were so superb .
5 #### One of my all time favorite books . This is not just a book about the war , but it covers the thinking of several countries and how these thoughts led to the worst of wars . All things were put on hold until I finished this book . My guess is that it will snag you as well !
5 #### A great book on early days of WWII . I highly recommend reading the sequel to this book , War and Rememberance . Very comprehensive and detailed facts .
5 #### Thank you for your service . This is a book my son wanted . He said he read it a few years ago and wanted to read it again . He said its a good book
5 #### i first read this book in high school and return to it periodically for inspiration and encouragement . This copy was for a friend as a gift . One of the great inspirational books of all time .
5 #### This is a classic ( at least in my mind ) . I 've bought a number of copies to give to friends .
5 #### Amazing , gripping and addictive -- though the sequel War and Remembrance is even better
5 #### Certainly one of the finest books ever written ... read originally in the 1980 's , saw the Mini - Series , and recently re - read ... off to War and Rememberance now .
5 #### Everything . War and Rememberance , is the sequel Anda must read by any reader .
5 #### Long , but so worth the time to read ! If you enjoy historical fiction , you will like this book . It is obvious that the author did hours of research to make sure that , while the characters might be fictional , the book was based on factual events .
5 #### Wow . This is a great book . I was n't sure what to expect when I picked this up , but was surprised from the outset by the well balanced combination of detail , character development and pure page turning action . The story of a ' washed up ' IRA Hitman , contracted to do one last hit to gain his freedom , a new name and passport , and a new life . In the end he is torn between his desire for freedom - and the desire for inner peace and to do what is right . A solid page turner , full of action , with a deserving ending . Highly recommended .
4 #### I 'm a big fan of Jack Higgins and this was a good little book . It arrived within the given time and was packaged well . Ordered new book and pricing was very fair .
5 #### Nancy , now in Tacoma , WA : What an incredible novel . I still feel a yearning to have Fallon find peace while alive . The pages are wet with that mind - numbing rain eternally falling , and I read this on my Kindle ! Read it . You wo n't regret it . This a first for me by this author . I will definately look at the other titles by the prolific Jack Higgins .
5 #### This was the first book by Jack Higgins that I read . The plot grabbed me by the second page and did n't let go until the end . The characters were all very well developed , with no loose ends in their various encounters . The particular development of Martin Fallon was very interesting ... Higgins established his " death wish " in a good manner , but kept me guessing to the end just how Fallon would resolve all of his issues . I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller .
4 #### ... This novel was a little more touching in its direction and somewhat more of a moving story than all action of his other books . I found it as good as always , but I am a fan , so make your own opinion .
5 #### I must have read this book five years ago-- probably more like seven . In any case , it was n't my copy-- we were renting a cabin , and it happened to be on the bookshelf-- I picked it up , and could NOT put it down until I read the whole thing , at the expense of my vacation . Not that I minded , mind you . ;) In any case , Higgins ' tragic tale will have you aching over every moment . In fact , this novel is nearly perfect-- except for a couple of sexually explicit scenes , which I skipped quickly over . Due to that fact , this is not for sensetive readers at all , and usually I 'm one of those-- but , frankly , after all the books I 've ever read , this one was in my life for a mere twenty - four hours , and I remember it as one of the best .
5 #### Higgens is marvelous in understanding charachters . A nice story a hitman who 's feels finaly guilty after blowing up a schoolbus by accident . The sign of taking innocent children 's life leads him for an escape full of suspense . With a priest he was paid to kill , but ca n't for a spiritual reason and and hunting past leads him to the contridiction of life . Higgens is a fair story teller who burries the reader in violence and thrill but gratefully puts a summer rose of emotions above the grave . You do n't have to be christian or an irish dude to read it . It 's a cultural suspense in a religious frame . Very good
5 #### I have bought this book repeatedly for over 40 years to give as a gift to special people . Mountain Man
5 #### Bought as a gift since I already have my copy . Timeless and perfect .
4 #### Kahll Gibran is a great writter and I love all of his books . O got this for a particular quote in it about dying . I love it and would recommend it to anyone who has questions about life .
5 #### Do you want a simple solution for every question you have ever had about topics of love , marriage , children , giving , eating and drinking , work , joy and sorrow , houses , clothes , buying and selling , crime and punishment , laws , freedom , reason and passion , pain , self - knowledge , teaching , friendship , talking , time , good and evil , prayer , pleasure , beauty , religion , and death- then this is for you ! Written in 1923 , by Kahil Gibran in the mountains of Lebanon . He kept the manuscript for 4 years because he said , " I wanted to be sure , I wanted to be very sure , that every word of it was the very best I had to offer . " This is a polished piece of timeless literature , folks , that has enhanced many lives throughout history , and can enrich yours ; TODAY ! BUY IT ! You wo n't regret it .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for a family member . It was exactly what they wanted !
5 #### Beautifully written - if historically accurate , as I believe it to be , a new , much broader perspective on the war I lived through as a child and teenager . Looking forward to finishing " War and Remembrance " , which taking me the rest of the way through the war - and high school .
1 #### Just did n't make any sense to me , just seemed like a lot of rambling with no real substance .
4 #### I did n't expect this to be a religous story it was rather lengthy but still a good read
5 #### I wish I had read this in school . So amazing .
5 #### I read this as an Airman going through basic training in 1967 . Liked it a lot then and was recently looking for the book but somehow lost it ( I think maybe when my house was flooded during a Florida hurricane ) . It was really nice to get it back at such a great price . Brings back lots of memories .
4 #### A classic good versus evil story . A tale in which forgiveness is prevalent and man is predominantly good . To know good you must know evil and the embodiment of evil is portrayed by the mortician . The bad guy . Higgins has a smooth easy flowing style and this story is a very easy read .
4 #### As always suspenseful and fun to read . His characters have got me hooked .
4 #### 4.5 stars . Read this thriller by Jack Higgins years ago and it 's stood the test of time in my eyes . Martin Fallon is an interesting character . An executioner for the IRA , he is haunted by a mistake that he will carry for the rest of his days . He 's contracted by the thoroughly evil Jack Meehan to murder a rival in England for the price of a safe passage . When the hit is witnessed by the local Catholic priest Michael da Costa their lives become intertwined . It 's a fast flowing story , violent in parts , filled with strong characters but it was the softly spoken , tortured Martin Fallon that made this a keeper for me . It 's somewhat dated now but still an excellent read .
3 #### This is a quick and easy read . The twists and turns were somewhat predictable , but it 's like eating popcorn - you just ca n't stop . I recommend this novel as a take along for a relaxing day at the beach .
4 #### I 've found him and read all his books , so after awhile I needed a little break , but do enjoy them very much .
5 #### Another great Higgin 's book ! Well written with a great story line . I could n't wait for my wife to finish it so we could discuss it !
5 #### The book was in very good condition and meets all of my expectations .
5 #### One of the best books I 've ever read . Provides a lot of history from several points of view in a captivating , easy to read format . I highly recommend !
5 #### Dispite it 's fiction it reviews America 's reluckstance to enter WWII . Good reading !
5 #### Along with the winds of war- best WWII ever written . Great characters , broad global sweep through history , study in strategy , politics , and of course the Holocaust .
5 #### Addresses , entertainingly , almost every possible issue that was extant leading up to the United States ' entry into World War II and mixes those insights with some good adventure and love stories .
5 #### Really good book . Historically accurate as far as I can tell .
5 #### This book is a spellbinder ! It has kept me up when I should have been sleeping on more than one evening .
5 #### I received a copy of this book when I was younger , but failed to appreciate its value at the time . A couple years later , it was interesting to finally read through this book and reflect on how it might have influenced my decisions for the better .
4 #### Keeps you wanting to turn the next page . Fine character development ; main character flawed but has a strange and deep felt morality .
5 #### I have read other books by Mr. Higgins and have never been disappointed . This was a fast moving story and really enjoyable if you like suspense .
5 #### If one loves dialogue , this is the one to read . You can practically see your characters when readin gthis by how the talk . An amazing study of speech and how it defins people . A must read for everyone .
4 #### Bought the book after seeing the movie . I liked the movie much better . I have always liked Jack Higgens books .
5 #### Gangsters and hoods make for good stories . This was a really great one . I liked the setting , the intrigue of the unlikely villains business topped it all off really well .
4 #### This Jack Higgins novel is confined to a small section of London , but the action moves at the pace of his other thrillers . It 's just a little quieter . Higgins really is the master of thrillers .
5 #### I first read this book years ago and was hooked on Higgins . I have since read nearly everything he has written and been saddened at the decline in quality . I invariably compare every book to this one , hoping he can once again reach this lofty height . Great story , characters and a gut wrenching protagonist 's struggle to save his conscience . This book is the apex of Higgins ' long career and should not be missed .
5 #### Very very good . Try not to read all the other summaries -- you do n't need to know all about Fallon 's past until the book fills in those details . :)
5 #### This book was short , but it was mighty . Ex - IRA soldier using the name Martin Fallon , is pushed into performing a contract hit ( on a very bad mobster by another very bad mobster ) in exchange for a new passport , new identity , and a trip on a ship out of England for a new life . His soul carries wounds from an IRA bombing gone bad . A priest witnesses his contract killing , but Fallon ca n't bring himself to kill the priest even though he has seen his face . What follows is a painful journey for Fallon and the characters affected by his actions . Higgins created characters that resonate and , though the book was written many years ago , those characters are true to life and the story has a timeless quality . The writing is nearly flawless and , though short , this book carries the weight in your heart that a longer work would carry . I finished it last night and have n't been able to get the story out of my mind - now that is the mark a truly great work .
4 #### very interesting history of an extremely important period of our history .
4 #### As someone who never much cared for historical texts , Wouk masterfully interleaves fact with fiction in The Winds of War . It 's got a bit of everything and I am now looking forward to reading the second book that I understand concludes this epic .
5 #### Great novel with a lot of history . I am about one forth completed .
5 #### I am a fan of Herman Wouk . He is an excellent writer of historical fiction . He inserts the historical facts of a given period and place while doing an excellent job on the fictional characters and story line . If you link this sort of genre of writing I would highly recommend this book which covers the events leading up to WWII .
5 #### As a new comer to this point of view i find the writings to be very nice it does seem to be just another interpretation and an enjoyable point to view from . I did enjoy it .
5 #### I discovered Kahlil Gibran many decades ago . My copies of the books have been stolen several times . The words are food for the soul . I plan to purchase additional books by this author .
5 #### " On Children " was my introduction to Gibran 's . His insight is simultaneously amazing , poignant and very common sense . I read it almost 30 years ago , at the birth of my first child . I was awestruck . I call this single poem , along with the Bible -- my mothering manifesto ! Now that my youngest is 15 , I continue to find deeper meaning and understanding as she passes through each stage . Wisdom for the ages . Very lovely and full of grace . It 's amazing to me that a single poem given as a gift to me has come to mean so much . I look forward to giving this treasured book to the next generation , when I become a grandmother .
5 #### Lovely read . Touching imagery and moving words on the soul 's search for love and meaning . An enduring classic to savor .
5 #### Kahlil Gibran 's literary masterpiece , The Prophet , is rich with heady poetic prose and spiritualism . Almustafa , the Chosen and Beloved , has spent twelve long years searching the seas after his ship capsized , waiting for the return of his people to carry him home . When the day comes that he sights his ship , he is filled with deep , soulful introspect ; while he longs to return to his island home , awareness blooms that he has made a home in the city of Orphalese . Realizing that he has caused himself to suffer by holding himself aloft from those in the small community who now occupy his heart , he asks himself : " Shall the day of parting be the day of gathering ? And shall it be said that my eve was in truth my dawn ? " While waiting for the ship to draw near and Almustafa spends his last hour on the mainland . He leaves a trail of offerings from his heart and wisdom that he has gained as his gift , and final goodbye .
5 #### This is another of his long books but very entertaining .
5 #### So glad I got the book Winds of War . Love the book and the movie . I will buy the movie soon . I am so glad I got the book . It 's a great book to read . A very good novel .
5 #### One of my favorite reads of all time . First read it approximately thirty years ago . Maybe even better the second time
5 #### If you 're looking for some good historical fiction to get lost in , this is a great buy . It 's going to take you a few weeks or months to get through , but that just makes it better . WW2 purists be warned : you 'll recognize a lot of the historical events captured in this book and see that the coverage is maybe a bit cliche . It 's OKit 's fiction . The character development and style are superb .
5 #### I enjoyed reading about events that occurred during my childhood . I also appreciate reading the German point of view . Herman Wouk took on a massive task and produced a compelling novel .
5 #### this is a must read for anyone who likes WWII . it is an epic story of a family during the war . i recommend reading both books in the series
5 #### I love this book . So beautiful , just like everything written by Kahlil Gibran , but this one is my favorite .
4 #### I rate The Prophet as five stars , but this particular edition is not quote as appealing as the old standard " traditional " version .
5 #### A very good book with many profound statements , almost biblical . The prophet gives you alternative thinking and a better view of life and death . A very good read .
5 #### I gave this to a really good friend as a Thank You , for a gift I received . I 've had a copy for 30 years , its a great read . Everyone should own a copy .
3 #### I liked this because it gave me what I wanted . A view of WWII . Almost an insiders view , and for that reason very appealing . On the other hand , it was not written in a current or elegantly appealing style , which would have been to my preference .
5 #### Gave as a gift . Was well liked by recipient .
5 #### Excellent storytelling . The more you enjoy WWII fiction , the more you will appreciate this novel .
5 #### Once I started reading , I did n't want to stop . This and the sequel , War and Rememberance , make you feel you are living through WWII yourself . The characters have great depth and personality . I loved it .
5 #### A fascinating account of events leading up to the US involvement with WW2
5 #### This of course is not a new novel but it is such a well written classic novel . Everyone should read it and it 's sequel . Has factual history of World War Ii , plus an interestingr story to make for an excell entry read . I would recommend it to any intelligent and dedicated reader . Thought provoking in today 's tense world .
4 #### I enjoyed the book.i have seen the BBC tv production which closely mirrored the book . I would recommend to any reader of 19th century literature .
1 #### Could have been a good book but bad plotting . Vernacular dialect too hard to follow
5 #### Margaret and her family must leave sunny southern England for the dark smoky north . Rough as it sound will it break her ?
5 #### Love Industry through the English and American early 1800 and 1900 periods .
1 #### This book was definitely not worth $ 50.00 ! It was only a used and yellowed copy . Really nothing special about it . I returned it .
5 #### If you like historical fiction , it does n't get any better than this . A wonderful book ..
4 #### Great book and story Just too long for the content Wouk is great but wordy .
5 #### It'a been years since I read this book . All of the WWII history was incredibly interesting .
4 #### A classic Civil War novel . A bit long winded by todays standards but good character development and some interesting plot twists . I liked it enough to read book 2
5 #### Wonderful book with conflict and romance , language is difficult at first but if you are a classics individual then you should catch on in no time .
5 #### For those who enjoy historic fiction , this is an engaging novel . This first book weaves actual events that occurred in the years leading up to the Civil War into the story of two fictional families , the Mains from the South and the Hazards from the North . Character development is very good , and if you happened to watch the miniseries based on this book and produced in the ' 80s , your mental images will be even more enhanced . Love , hate , jealousy , bigotry , patriotism ... this book covers all the hot issues of the times !
5 #### gilt edged pages . Small and chunky book , fits perfectly in the hand . A wonderful gift for a wonderful friend .
5 #### Completely engrossing . Fictional characters , that we either love or hate , in real life situations . Anxious to continue with Book 2 - Love and War .
5 #### This book was purchased to replace one I no longer had . I was pleased with timely re either of book and satisfied with condition of it . Thanks !
3 #### I know the book is supposed to be excellent . . . I have started to read it . . . but just ca n't get into it !
5 #### I keep giving copies of this book away and have to get another . I will try to hang onto this one for awhile .
5 #### I came across this at a church sale a summer or two ago . I did not know what it was and only read it for the first time a few weeks back . As I was reading it , I asked myself " What is this , and who wrote this ? " I thought at times I was reading something from the New Testament , but actually it 's quite different . As soon as I finished The Prophet , I started to re - read it . Gibran was a Maronite Christian who apparently studied many religions . He was an artist as is evidenced in the drawings in this lovely edition . I read that this book has never been out of print since it was published in 1926 . I have been greatly enamored of the Lebanese people I 've known - they are the warmest and friendliest people I 've come across in the United States , so I 'm not surprised that Gibran is considered the national poet of that country . To sum up the book ( if such a thing is possible ) , a prophet is waiting for a ship to return him to his home . The townspeople come to say goodbye and question him on topics such as marriage , children , giving , eating and drinking , work , joy and sorrow etc . You want to read something uplifting ? Read this beautiful book .
5 #### This was the third time I 've read this book and it gets better every time .
5 #### Great read . Easy to read , a true pleasure - one of the best historical novels I 've come across . Recommend it highly if you 're into World War 2 history .
5 #### I first read this book over 30 years ago and itcremains my favorite fiction book of all time . I love this book and its sequel . I wish I could read them again for the first time . Great characters and plot . If you like WW2 , you will thoroughly enjoy both books . Although I was born after the war , this book gave me a glimpse of what it must have been like . I hated for the story to end . I am now re - reading Winds on the Kindle .
5 #### Third time I have read this book and still relevant .
5 #### One of the most amazing books available on spirituality ( if even that ) . Beautiful tapestry unfolds as the ages are read . It is required reading for the people I work with .
5 #### Top class writing . Spiritual truths , cuts to the heart of things in beautiful style .
4 #### I really liked this edition as a gift . I 've had a copy of this book in my collection for over thirty six years and felt it would be a great gift for newly weds .
1 #### I did n't read the book . It 's very large and unwieldy . The print is very small .
4 #### Aside from the old tired tropes of ineffectual mother 's , sick young ladies , and misunderstandings in romance , the book had parallels to modern society . The question that particularly intrigued me was about religion : does it indeed show in a person 's mode of thinking and way of life , or is it pretty words on a Sunday ? The book is n't so moralistic as to give an answer , thank goodness , but raises questions to ponder .
4 #### I was eager to read the book but did n't expect it to be so large ! It 's about 12"by 9 " in size - not something you can pop in you purse or back pocket . Guess I 'll just be reading it at home :-) Arrived promptly and in good condition !
5 #### One of my favorites , right up there with Jane Austens Pride and Prejudice
5 #### My dad fought in Europe beneath Patton , as a scout for one ; I knew a girl at school on the model of Natalie in the book . Therefore I read Wouk 's war books with great interest , in 2000 in paperback and again last year in hardbound . Mostly , on Wouk 's centennial as a man and a writer , I appreciate the positive humanity in his work . It is possible to adopt a more realistic view of humanity including less hope , tenacity or resolve and many would choose such a book . I 've gotten a copy of The Complete New Yorker , 80 years on DVD and was interested on their reviews . Each volume of this series received a negative , brief Capsule Review . Winds Of War was faulted for the characters " would n't you know it " showing up just at the right time to observe history in the making . Surely the premise would improve were they to miss out ! War And Remembrance was guilty of weak female characters , wrote the female reviewer . Why would Natalie not make a run for the US and safety ? Why , indeed , with only her uncle , a writer , to consider .
5 #### I read it in the 1980s just reread it . Just as good 2nd time if not better , I know more now . The vonRoon memories of 1930 - 40s Hitler Germany was much more appreciated today . Pig 's relationship with FDR was better now that I know more about FDR . Great summer reread .
4 #### Good fictional account of actual WW II events . Helps one understand the personal side of this war .
5 #### I have read and reread The Prophet numerous times over the years . I fell in love with it in my undergraduate days and still have my dog - eared and underlined copy . The Prophet has guided me through much of my adult life .
5 #### An amazing , thought - provoking inspiration . I 've read it many times , usually section by section . Marriage and children have helped me stay sane through a lot of the stuff both of those entail . Beautifully written .
5 #### a classic- soo mucu better than " holy text "
5 #### The Prophet is worth its weight in Gold .. or should one say wisdom , inspiration and the deep philosophy ! I have read it many many times but did not own a Hardcover . Now I do .. Just one thing .. I wish we Americans would learn to spell the name of this greatest of philosophers right .. I do believe it is Khalil Gibran .. But I guess Kahlil Gibran is the name he is known by now .. I love his writing whatever we may call him !
5 #### I love historical fiction and John Jakes makes you feel the emotions and issues of the time ! It made me better understand the mind sets on both sides of this conflict that nearly destroyed the unity of our country . Since it was a Republican president who freed the slaves , I 'm puzzled why more blacks are not Republicans ? !
5 #### It was a gift and they liked it very much !
5 #### I would never have read this except for the BBC production . The book is even better than the film . Gaskell 's vivid characterizations are microcosms of the society at large . A naive young girl 's experiences of good and evil are a testing ground for her virtue and her courage .
5 #### This was a very interesting book about a important time in our nation 's history . It was informative and easy to read from a human point of view . I 'm looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy .
1 #### This publication is hugethe dimensions of a text book , not a regular paperbackand the formatting is awful . ( See photos : 1st is next to an average sized paperback , 2nd is an example of the formattingfont too small and too many words per page for reading comfortably . ) Not at all what I was expecting . As for the story itself , I ca nt say much about it , because the formatting is so bad , I have n't read it yet . I m planning to return it and get a better copy from another publisher .
5 #### This version stops half way through WWII = = the other half takes from Pearl Harbor forward -- I have read both books many years ago and just wanted to do it again --
5 #### For me this is an awesome classic that anyone interested in WW 2 will appreciate and enjoy .
5 #### Amazing saga of WWII as seen through the lives of one family . I 'd read the book many years ago - shortly after it was published and am now listening to the unabridged audio ( 45 + hours on 3 MPs ) . The author does a precise job of explaining the war - from the German 's slaughter of the Jews , to the U.S. 's hesitancy to join , all the politics that go along with a way , the military view , and so much more . It 's like reading a history book at one moment , a novel , the next , and biography the next . I HIGHLY recommend this book - for history lovers , mystery lovers ( since you really do n't know what is going to happen ) , to those that just like good literature .
5 #### One of the finest historical novels ever written by the master of the genre .
5 #### A worldwide story with breathtaking scope and detail . A true Classic which immerses you in the luves and emotions of the times . Fantastic historical perspective . War and Rememberance is Part 2 , and is just as good .
5 #### Excellent book ! A must read for historical fiction fans .
5 #### A brilliant and thought provoking work . A must read .
5 #### It does not matter what religion or denomination you are , read this book . Beautifully written .
5 #### What can you say about this book -- it defies words . Gibran 's view of life , death , relationships and God are breathtaking in their beautiful simplicity , and deep as a soul . I bought it for my 13 - year - old granddaughter , and since I had given my copy away many years ago , I thought I deserved a new copy of it myself . I keep it where I can read a chapter or two whenever the need or the mood strikes me .
5 #### needed new copy to replace 1970 's version . Good book .
5 #### I usually read a book before watching the movie , but in this case I watched the mini - series and fell in love with the story . I immediately downloaded the book and could n't put it down . The author has a way of describing the minutest details that set it apart from most books and the romance between the main characters was even more intense than more famous books like " Pride and Prejudice . " I really enjoy her depiction of this historical period and the strange divides in English society , a poor ex - communicated parson 's daughter is still higher social standing than a wealthy industrialist seems strange to us but was perfectly natural during that tumultuous time .
2 #### I finished the book but it was quite an effort . There is nothing particularly historically informative about the book and the character development arc is highly predictable . It 's almost based as if it were a Hollywood movie where you have the stereotypical villains and heroes and the simmering conflicts that are easy to predict where they 'll end up . Honestly I do n't know why this has such high reviews . In terms of the volume of great civil war novels out there this ranks pretty low in my esteem .
4 #### A very sweet book . Loved the characters and the way they grew and matured . I 'm Glad to have read it .
3 #### Very small print and margins ...... kind of eye boggling . I think it 's an Amazon reprint of the story . Basically , you get the text of the story with no extras . Considering the low price , you get what you pay for .
4 #### People say the book 's not as good as the BBC miniseries , but I quite liked it ! ( Y'know , despite Gaskell 's tendency to go on long descriptions of the heroine 's beauty . )
5 #### A quick read with details on the Henry family through 1941 . Knowing the historical events leading to the war encouraged we to be actively seeking the next page . It is a very realistic story of how the family copes and how reality of life exists . Well onto War and Rememberance .
5 #### The Winds of Wars is Wouk 's best . The attention to historical detail is mind - boggling and keeping a central thread going through the book must have been a chore -- but he did . Well worth the time and effort it takes to read these 2 books .
2 #### It 's Peyton Place with World War II as the stage and a major talk fest . Style is dated . I was much more impressed with the harder * Caine Mutiny . *
5 #### One of my favorite books - 7th time I have read it - first time in Kindle format - in combination to the sequel ( War and Remembrance ) provides a detailed history of World War II from various perspectives - the " historical novel " framework makes for an exciting read - while still grounded in historical fact . For me , the clever insertion of a fictional translation of a Nazi General 's memoirs , by the main character in retirement , gives the unique perspective of the war from the losing side . Do n't miss this absolute classic 2 - volume pairing by an author who should be recognized as a contemporary American master storyteller .
5 #### This two - book series is the best Wouk publication since The Caine Mutiny . For anyone with a vague notion of the events of WWII who would like to obtain a firmer grasp of the subject matter in a really enjoyable fashion , this is the way to go . The history is accurate and compelling , and the plot lines of the many fictional characters are addictive . Read it now , and read it again in a few years for even greater understanding and enjoyment .
5 #### I had read these two books many years ago , and decided to revisit them , since rereading a book one has n't read for over twenty years offers insights missed in the first readings . I absolutely love these books , and literally could not put them down ; I read day and night , and when I finished them , I missed them and wanted to reread them immediately . No doubt some day I will .
5 #### I enjoyed this book for the historical setting leading up to America 's entry into WWII . Also , the fictional characters and several plots kept me glued to the book , always wanting more . Wouk is good at putting you into historic scenes all over the world , whether its being in the same room with Churchill , Roosevelt , Hitler , Stalin , Admiral King , etc . He makes you feel like you there and a part of history and the pervading atmosphere of the time .
5 #### I like the book and would recommend it to people who need to ponder on difficulties in life . It gives you something to think about . Doris
5 #### One of m favorites since I was a child . My father had a copy and I read and reread it many times . So happy to have a copy in my own library at last .
5 #### This is one of my all time favorite books . I 've given this book to a number of people for gifts , and have owned a copy myself , ever since I can remember . I highly recommend this little treasure of wisdom to anyone who appreciates timeless advice from a real master of insight .
1 #### ' YURITA 'S ' edition is one of 74 editions of this book ! ( 74 ! ! why ? ? ) It is NOT the one you want . - Paragraphs end mid - sentence and are continued in the next paragraph . ... errors abound & meanings must be guessed - AND , I knew I 'd read this story before ... under a different title ? ? I can only guess ANYWAY , YOU'VE BEEN WARNED . Sorry , I ca n't help by suggesting a readable edition . FOR SHAME KINDLE ! ! !
4 #### This book is not natural or entirely credible , it has melodramatic aspects that comprise true flaws by this point , and yet there 's enough to it to make the read worthwhile . I prefer ' Cranford , ' a less ambitious effort that achieves more : it 's more limited and addresses the modest , constrained lives of women of a certain class in a small town - and every bit rings true . In contrast , ' North and South ' is more serious , trying harder and encompassing a bigger world , not entirely successfully . It departs from women and domesticity to try to deal with the world of men , business , capital , social conflict , and Justice . It suffers from a flawless heroine with dud parents , caregivers and advisors - and just how , if neither through nature nor nurture , did she become who she is ? But there 's enough emotional realism to make me wish somebody would smack each of those parents , enough political and cultural content to make a person think , and enough cryptic sexuality to merit attention . After a first proposal , what the main character feels is shame ; when a man first meets a beautiful young woman , he ca n't stop being aware of and troubled by the way her bracelet presses the white flesh of her arm as she pours tea . Also there 's something satisfying about the ending . So if you 're inclined toward this realm of fiction , do give this one try .
5 #### I have always liked the history of this most beautiful country of ours . I enjoy reading about our country when it was growing up , as this is history about the civil war , I also like the westerns that are written about the early settlers .
5 #### Love John Jakes writing and narration by Grover Gardner . Ca n't wait for the next AudioBook from them !
4 #### There was a lot of emphasis on grief , particularly in grieving for the several principal characters who were claimed by death after their personalities were fairly developed . It seemed as though the author reveled in killing off as many characters as feasible ! The introduction was detailed , the conflict was long and sad , and the happy denouement was quite short , and at the extreme end of the book . It was interesting to observe the changes of opinion and feeling of the hero and heroine , but I ca n't help feeling some of the events were unlikely , such as the heroine losing all her authorities and gaining wealth in the same year from a surplus of sickness - related deaths . Once the first third of the book is over , the action picks up . Business concepts are generally referred to , but lack technical detail . Much of the tension is built on a lack of communication , which could have been easily resolved very early on . An interesting read , but definitely not a pattern for lifestyle .
3 #### although it 's a good story the way is written is a bit old . I got bored with it .
5 #### Although basically a romantic historical novel , it describes the prelude and beginning of WWII through the eyes of an American Navy Captain and his family with commentary and observations on the German viewpoint .
5 #### Fine reminder this period in my early life and one that should be studied by today 's youth .
5 #### Third time around for reading this series . Excellent read - terrific historical information .
3 #### I read this book to learn more about the history of WWII and the understand the sequence of events . It did that very well by telling a very well developed story . A bit long for my taste but I learned so much .
5 #### Again , one of my favorite Gibran 's ! I also bought this for a friend .
5 #### Pros : - beautiful , so poetic and creative - speaks of universal Truth - related to the highest level teachings of all religions Cons : - sometimes hard to understand due to it 's old poetic language Conclusion : - a must read for everyone . Period .
4 #### While there were some parts that seemed a little overly fluffy , the majority of the book captured hard to describe spiritual matters with great imagery . There were truths in the book so succinctly put and beautifully written . Below are a few of my favorite . " You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth . The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite , and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far . Let your bending in the Archers hand be for gladness ; For even as He loves the arrow that flies , so He loves also the bow that is stable . " " Work is love made visible . " " Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding . " " You have been told that , even like a chain , you are as weak as your weakest link . This is but half the truth . You are also as strong as your strongest link . To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam . To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconstancy . " " And he to whom worshiping is a window , to open but also to shut , has not yet visited the house of his soul whose windows are from dawn to dawn . Your daily life is your temple and your religion . Whenever you enter into it take with you your all . " Beautiful and enlightening .
4 #### I had read this book many years ago while living among the Mormons . In fact , it was given to me by a Mormon . I lost my copy over the years , so finding a replacement was great .
5 #### This book is absolutely amazing and is a must read for a great perspective on life !
5 #### Wow this is so much better than the ridiculous Netflix series . This had more flesh to the story . Great novel
5 #### BEST BOOK EVER . However I think some of the words were messed up in this edition .
5 #### Great story . Kind of like Pride and Prejudice ( seemingly ill - fitted people fall in love ) but more believable .
5 #### I love everything John Jakes writes . This is the 1st book of 3 . Years before the Civil Was 2 classmates meet at Military Academy , 1 from Pennsylvania and 1 from South Carolina . They form a close bond , and keep the friendship alive by embracing each others families with extended vacations . Of course the culture difference between George Hazard of Pennsylvania who owns an Iron Factory , and Orry Main of South Carolina whose manages a plantation with slave labor will cause problems between the 2 families . This book leads right up to the start of the Civil War . Lots of romance , adventure , and unwise decisions will keep you glued to this book . Enjoy !
5 #### I read the last chapter twice and then I reread the first chapter . I did n't want it to end . Gaskell is a wonderful author and I look forward to reading more of her works . Some reviewers have mistaken this book for another one . This novel takes place entirely in the north and south of England . It has nothing to do with American history . It is mostly about labor strife and love in 1850s England .
5 #### This is an excellent book that reveals several different views of the the war by adversaries as well as allies . It is interesting to see how soldiers as well as the citizens affected by the war likely viewed their leaders in the war effort . Although it is a work of fiction , many of the intertwined stories of the characters in the book seem realistic in that the stories likely paralleled the attitudes and activities of actual people of the times .
5 #### One of my favorite historical novels of all time .
5 #### Herman Wouk is one of my favorite authors and Winds of War is proof of why ! So well written !
5 #### One of the better WWII books , leading up to his fantastic " War and Remembrance " . Loved his work since " The Caine Mutiny " .
5 #### I would bet 90 % of citizens of America have no idea the political events that led up to our involvement in WWII . Herman Wouk makes history interesting and so enlightening for everyone . This is my second reading , my first was 35 years ago , and I was just as moved as the first time .
5 #### I loved this book when I read it @ 40 years ago . I wanted to read it again , so got this copy . The " violence " is due to the fact that it is about WW II . It 's a great way to review the history .
5 #### a must read followed by war and remembrances , by herman wouk . i will never forget these memorable books .
5 #### Well written with fully developed characters . Gripping drama set in a time of desperation .. Wouk takes you into the highest levels of power as world leaders prepare and then launch WW2 . Warning - do not read this book unless you are willing to read its sequel , War and Remembrance .
5 #### Could n't put it down . Especially enjoyed the historical context . Characters are interesting , realistic , and quick to develop . I will read the sequel
5 #### This is the book that opened my soul at the age of 18 . Beautiful !
5 #### I love the writing and consider it my bible . Great insight and clarity into human behavior . Touches my ' sou ' every time I read it
5 #### This is a wonderful addition to anyone 's library . I truly exceptional man
1 #### Not good for me . Made it only through the first chapter .
5 #### The basic plot is simple enough , but the characters and the very real struggles and feelings are exquisite . The misunderstandings and one 's desire for them to be cleared up keep you turning pages ( or tapping screens ) to the end . I appreciated the deep exploration of industrial era conflicts from both sides , much of which could apply even to current political and social schisms . The examining is n't dry though because it comes through individual characters and their stories and interaction . Lovely book . I thoroughly enjoyed it .
5 #### Comparable with Pride and Prejudice . A great read with an exceptional development of characters . A wonderful book without sex or violence . Highly recommended .
4 #### I really liked North and South . It was recommended to me by someone because of my love of Pride and Prejudice . It is not like Pride and Prejudice in that it is a very depressing storyline with a character who tries desperately to see the silver lining in everything . Margaret Hale is put through hell , but she is a main character that you can love .
5 #### A good blend of historical facts and fiction , interesting narrative with insights from the German perspective as well
5 #### The enire saga is just wonderful , read those four books in one breath
5 #### Riveting in parts ... I was inspired to read after watching the tv series with Robert Mitchum . I really enjoy the use of World Empire Lost as a narrative of the historic events . Towards the end it seemed just a touch too long .
5 #### A well written book and an excellent review of those troubled years . It was something of a chore to wade through the massive book and then the companion book - War and " remembrance " Which was also huge . But it was worth the time and effort .
5 #### I have n't completed reading this book yet , but I read it years ago . Having been born in 1939 and realizing that life in America during my adult lifetime has been the most prosperous and peaceful time in world history and it was all because of America being bordered on each coast by 2 large oceans . We are protected by those oceans , especially while the Nazi 's were in power in Germany . This book gives insight into the some of the countries most affected by WWII at the startup to war . The story is fictional but , but many events are true . In my opinion , Herman Wouk is one of the best writers of the 20th century , and this is one of his best works .
5 #### I feel like I was there . This is an epic work ! Exceptionally well thought out and written . I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in WW2 .
5 #### Liked the TV series so I thought the book would be good . As usual the book turns out to exceed the film .
5 #### Highly recommend ... great for the novice of World War II with a wonderful family story
5 #### Had n't read it in 50 years . What a wonderful revisit .
5 #### Reviewed earlier on this page . This is an excellent book .
5 #### This book was written by a Lebanese Christian and published in 1927 . I purchased two of them for gifts .
5 #### Not for a casual audience , but if you are into spiritual books and philosophy this is a must read . Beautiful wording and leaves you with plenty to think about . Absolutely five stars .
5 #### Famous book .. Very interesting .. I now have several copies of this book . Great thought went into creating this book - this philosophy !
5 #### I was sorry when this book ended as I enjoyed every minute . It paints a good picture of the lives of the different classes in England around the time of the foundation of the cotton mills . Through it runs a strong vein of the story of the integrity of the main characters which was keenly felt , as the reader and leaves the soul restored .
3 #### Likable characters and a gentle story , but rather slow moving and long winded . Set in the same time period as Austen 's works but without her sparkle .
5 #### So you 've read Austen , Dickinson , Shelley , and the Bronte sisters . Now read Gaskell . Read about Margaret who turns down marriage proposals , tell men how to run their businesses , and makes big time business deals . Serialized by Dickens , this is a modern feminist novel from the mid 19th century .
5 #### What a wonderful book about WWII . Truly a great read .
5 #### One of my top favorite books of all time ! If you have any interest in WWII this is a must read .
5 #### If we do n't learn from our past , we are bound to have it repeated
5 #### Great book , but it is odd that the prominent photo on the cover collage is of an enlisted man getting married -- the main military characters in the book are all officers .
5 #### This is the first part of this epic novel , followed by War And Remembrance . This is my second reading . I read this book when it was published and became engrossed in the Henry family and the events surrounding them . This novel is one of the finest ever written depicting the events concerning our entry into the Second World War . The characters come alive as the novel unfolds . This is storytelling at its finest . If you have never had the pleasure of reading this , by all means do so . This is a truly great experience in reading . Also , do not forget the continuation of this in the magnificent War And Remembrance . If you have already read and experienced this masterwork , do yourself a great favor and read it again . It is an experience well worth revisiting .
5 #### Having read this years ago , I purchased it to own it and be able to re - read it at my leisure . Having it on a KindleFire makes it much easier than toting a large book when traveling .
5 #### Thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish . It 's a great combination of factual history and very interesting fictional characters . It 's a great story .
5 #### Timeless classic that has taught me so much . " Your children are not your children . They are the sons and daughters of life 's longing for itself . " I have been a spiritual seeker throughout my life and gone from one extreme to another . Somehow this book always made sense , no matter what side of the spiritual stewpot I stood on . That 's the nature of timeless truth . My high school English teacher turned me on to it . I am eternally grateful .
5 #### Interesting read from the last book Elvis was reading at the time of his death . Elvis always brought a copy of this book with him on tours underlining passages . So I decided to see what the book was about . Very interesting subject and philosophies .
3 #### It was a little slow but depicts life in that era .
5 #### If you 're looking to get informed on the Industrial Revelation from the perspective of someone who loved through it , this books does a good job of addressing the social political issues from both ends . The ending was rather unsatisfactory though , story wise .
5 #### Truely enjoyed a glimpse of history during those changing times spiritually and industrially and its effects on women and men
4 #### This is a well - ordered collection of aphorisms , nothing more . I encourage you to read it , but I do not wish to forward the claim that there is something inherently special about this work . It is a loose collection of thoughts on life presented within the context of a very simple , one - act plot . I read the book twice to fully digest it ; it 's a rich network of thoughts .
5 #### This is one of those books that you can read over and over . It is one of my favorites . I have quoted Gibran in writing letters to people who were moving on , people who were in need of comfort , etc . Sheila Bickerton
5 #### I read this a very long time ago . It was 1970 . I have gone through several copies of it . It is most certainly a keeper . I kept giving my copies away to friends . Now I need one of my own again " TO KEEP . "
5 #### we bought the movie first , loved it . So we bought the book recommend both highly .
5 #### One of the greatest history fictional books of the 20th century
5 #### If you care to see how history configures the present , with excellent nuanced scenes and glorious action segmsnts this book is for you . Individual people take center stage . The plight of the Jews and the miseries of total war are unforgettably near . On Pearl Harbor Day this longish read is definitely worth your time
4 #### I purchased this after buying number of books in a the " A Day in a life of " series , great photography and adjoining stories .
4 #### I read these books when they came out and I recalling enjoying them immensely the passage of years has enhanced my enjoyment of these novels . Taken as a trilogy the represent an American version of War and Peace .
2 #### I tried . I really did . I tried 3 different times to make it through this book and it was just boring and silly and a waste of time . It 's a shame , as I enjoyed the mini series , and my friend enjoyed the book , but nope . I gave up and returned the audio book .
5 #### I could see the comparison to Jane Austen . The strong female character , the handsome aloof man , the misunderstanding , and finally the happy resolution of the relationship . I keep realizing how satisfying the classics are .
5 #### A fair examination of both sides- workers and owners of business . And a very good look of how easily we misread a situation and develop prejudices . A lot can be gleaned from this and at the same time enjoy the story !
5 #### Probably , with WAR AND REMEMBRANCE , the most sweeping historical novel about WW II written in the 20th Century . Deep insight into characters and war strategies . Precise , historically and psychologically , one follows a military family through their trials and victories on the stage of world catastrophe . These two books will resonate in the heart and mind of this reader for many years . This is a classic work of fiction mixed with documented fact .
5 #### Awesome . So glad I bought instead of renting . Will enjoy this every time I " rerun " it .
5 #### Fantastic story of pre WWII history of war torn Europe .
5 #### Another historical fiction that is above and beyond any critique . What research , what execution . Re - read it ten times and more and will surely do a few more rounds on this entire saga . Wouk is one of my all times favorite authors !
5 #### As a little girl during WWII , I was swept up with the patriotism of the time , buying war stamps at school , planting a " victory garden " , saving cans for armaments , rationing , and watching newsreels at the movies that were horrors to see for a child . This book objectively review the positions of the UK , Russia , Germany and the US . I enjoyed the mini - series but as always ... the book is better . It was through Herman Wouks lens that I was better able to understand the various aspects of war and in so doing , perhaps to learn how to live more peacably . The characterizatios are believable and realistic . This is a book I will always remember .
4 #### Very good in its historical reference but beware , it is 800 pages long .
5 #### What 's not to like . Great characters , great writing , great stories , great historical insights . A book you never forget .
5 #### I really enjoyed this book . I am looking forward to reading the sequel , War and Remembrance ..
2 #### I purchased under the recommendation of Oprah but this was a mistake I wish I did n't do . Did n't really understand the whole book .
5 #### Beautiful and peaceful read . I carry it in my purse and read it whenever I am waiting for the Doctor , at the airport , etc .
5 #### a great book . very helpful in developing a spiritual life . I have several similar book but this one is most helpful .
5 #### This is a great book to read again and again . I always see new things each time I read it .
2 #### My friends said it ' 's a great book but I 'm just not into poetry type books . It 's got good wisdom and life lessons in it though .
5 #### This has been one of my favorite books to quote from since high school . I never tire of reading Gibran .
5 #### I found this book a little hard to read and the use of so many words was hard for me but I wanted to know the end of the story and was pleased with that .
5 #### Another strong heroine in a classoc work . These books are so well worth the read . Nothing else compares with the tried and true classics . Love it .
5 #### I believe this rating very appropriate for the author has presented so much historical fact woven with imagination and feeling for his characters , you feel they could be your family or friends . You fall in love with them and urge then on , or wish for swift justice for those who need it . I most definitely recommend this trilogy for those who enjoy reading about our country and its struggles for its very existence .
2 #### If you like soap operas , you will love this book . It 's supposedly a historical novel encompassing events which led the Civil War the United States . But what it really is , is a soap opera , with mostly unlikable characters who are overcome by jealousy and envy . Halfway through the book it became so tedious , that I put it down .
5 #### I read this book 30 years ago and loved it . I enjoyed it just as much reading it again . The story stands the test of time and the historical facts are excellent . I felt like I learned so much about this era , it was a wonderful history lesson . I highly recommend this book !
5 #### THIS BOOK IS TRULY AN EXCELLENT READ ABOUT A TIME IN OUR HISTORY THAT WAS VITAL IN KEEPING AMERICA FREE ! ! ! ! THE BOOK IS EXCELLENTLY WRITTEN , & QUITE INTERESTING ! ! ! ! ! U S ARMY VETERAN
5 #### You wo n't ever regret taking this book on ! Acute Insite to what the times were like leading up to the war and the life changing impact it had on so many people and countries ...
5 #### This is a great book by a great author . You are immediately sweep into the intrigue that predated America entrance into the Second World War . This book is a must for those who wish to understand what really lead to this incredible conflict .
5 #### Mr. Wouk 's , best novel along with the sequel " War and Remembrance " .
5 #### Being a child of the 60 's , I first read this book in college . Years later when my daughter went off to school , I gave her my well worn , tattered copy of this beloved book . Recently we have been faced with some health challenges , and I turn again to the beautiful words written so long ago by an author with a simply beautiful presence . And once again it brings me peace and understanding .
5 #### Great poetry , great insight , great message to current days . One of mine top books ever . Independent of one 's creed , everyone should read it .
5 #### Echoing the reviews of others - it is obvious that Gibran both was inspired by and inspired many of the great writers of all ages . From Buddha to Coehlo , and countless others in between , there is a depth of truth and a veil of simplicity that , once lifted , opens the mind , heart and soul to universal wisdom . It is not hard to understand why Gibran was as popular in his day , and in the 1960 's , as he was . Covering the landscape from religion to love , Gibran bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the Prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey . The metaphors are numerous and the scale of depth is exceptional . The book itself is nearly 100 pages , but the content is not readable at any level rapidly . This book is one that bears constant revival and renewal . It 's a well that provides the reader with sweet water of wisdom which merits frequent draws to slake the thirst . A must have and a must read .
5 #### The Prophet is a timeless piece , and it speaks for itself . The profound messages are written so poetically and gracefully they resonate much deeper than dry philosophy . Once you read it , you 'll never want to lose this book .
5 #### This is ideal in the few minutes while the microwave is going or you are waiting for the water to boil . Each takes only a moment to read but gives something calming and thought provoking before you eat or whatever .
3 #### Good book , but I would n't buy this edition again . Several typos and whole sentences left out . Also falls apart pretty easily . Wish I had spent more on an edition printed by a real publisher
5 #### I initially saw the movie for this ( BBC ? ) . I thought it was interesting , if a little slow , and was curious to kind the book it was based on . I 've since read it probably half a dozen times , and thoroughly enjoyed it . The last time I read it through - after having recommended it for a book discussion - I realized that it is rather slow paced at some times ( It 's interesting what you notice when you try to see something you like from other 's perspective ) , but besides the human drama and relationships , it gives a fascinating and balanced perspective of class differences and issues at the time - North versus South - gentry verses manufacturers verses working class - and all with deep sympathy for each . I enjoyed it and I learned .
5 #### Loved it ! So much better than the BBC miniseries . I liked that well enough , and that is what piqued my interest in this author and this book . I 'm so glad I read the book , though , and did n't leave Margaret and Mr. Thornton to just what the BBC showed them as .
3 #### North and South starts out like Jane Austen with a lovely young lady enjoying upper - class life in London with a proposal of marriage which she declines . Is this Pride and Prejudice with Margaret as the proud person ? Then things change drastically . Margaret"s father , an Anglican priest , decides to leave the Church and move his family from lovely , agricultural Hampshire to a northern manufacturing town where he will tutor the children of the mill owners and even the owners themselves . It is cold , smoky , and foggy there and Margaret 's mother is soon ill . The ladies are dismayed by being there , and are soon aware of the tensions between owners and workers . Margaret and her mother are dismayed by both the workers and the owners which , though wealthy , are still seen as of a lower class . So then the story becomes more a " muck raker " novel than a romance as we learn more of life in the mills for both adults and children . The weather makes many ill , and the cotton mills cause lung disease . One of the owners is interested in Margaret , but she snubs him . And then a lot of people begin to die and there is a lot of sobbing . The major problem is that the book is way too long , but was written in the 19th century when people had a lot of time to read .
5 #### From a US viewpoint , Winds of War is a terrific novelization of the Second World War up to Pearl Harbor . Pug Henry may be an unlikely character in real life but he makes a fine protagonist for Wouk 's magnum opus .
5 #### This was my second reading of this classic , and it was even better this time around . The Henry family , the central point about which pre WW2 America revolved captured the atmosphere that existed at that time and in those places where members of the family found themselves . Wouk does an amazing job of weaving the fortunes and misfortunes of the family into many of the key hot spots the the late 30 's and very early 40 's . The entire story was mae more real for me as I happened to reread the book during the world crises of mid 2014 . The names and places are different , but the story is just about the same .
5 #### This is as good a book leading to WW II as Winston Churchill 's book and it is from the American point of view . It features a very believable fiction American family in the very thick of everything . It features military analysis by the German General Roon and historical rebuttal by the author through his fictional character naval Captain Victor Henry . The writing is masterful . The analysis of the management by President Roosevelt is superb . The reader can almost feel like he was there at the time . The analysis of the psychology of the German people who could let themselves be led into this catastrophe seems to be explained .
4 #### Actually , I did n't read this . It would 've have been the 2nd time . I do remember reading it the 1st time and really enjoying it . I also saw the movie with Robert Mitchum and enjoyed that too .
5 #### I do n't normally give five - star ratings , but this book deserves it . Herman Wouk really can write , unlike , sadly , many of today 's bestsellers .
5 #### Read this many years ago and decided to read it again . It is classified as a romance but the research by Mr. Wolk is very thorough and informative . What was going on in the world and especially Brittan , the US and Germany prior to WWII . By entwining his characters into the " history lesson " , one enjoys a good story while learning , Because it is such a large book I got it on my Kindle so I could take it anywhere .
5 #### Wonderful book . I am sure I will read it again .
5 #### I first started reading Prophet in 1963 . Since then I have read it many times . Each time I read it I have found something new in it . Its message is ever - new . This is a book to be read and implemented in life . It has made a difference in my life and it will make a difference in the life of anybody who reads it .
5 #### Excellent - this is one of my favorites since i discovered it in college . This is just the ebook version for convenience . Highly recommended .
5 #### My favorite book . I used the passaged in my wedding ceremony . I read it over and over and never tire of it
4 #### I am reminded of Jane Austen 's books when reading North and South . Margaret is loved by many and grows in so many ways from pain and sadness in her young life .
5 #### A wonderful approach to focus on two families one from the North , the other from the South in the telling of the war between the states . This personalized the attitudes and habits of those pro and those against enough so we see both sides . Clearly the unavoidable injustice shows through . How could it not ? Jakes weaves a wonderful story in and around the dynamics leading up to the final days of peace and coexistence . Great history . Great story .
4 #### I love all things historically British , and this classic is one of my favorite old British romances , next to the works of Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte .
5 #### I watched the mini series North and South on Netflix more than once in recent years . The book and the series complement each other well , as a movie could not possibly portray all the richness of character and depth of story found in the book . I loved this book ! Will probably read it again and again !
5 #### I loved the characters involved , the historical background and most of all the writing . 865 pages and it kept me interested .
5 #### An epic novel . Romance history written beautifully . Could n't put it down .
5 #### Winds of War and its continuation , War and Remembrance along with The Killer Angels are undoubtedly the best historical novels ever written . The three above novels to me are literary time machines . The authors allow us to understand " behind the scene " , machinations of history makers . Wouk presents to us that history was carved out by common men doing uncommon deeds .
5 #### If you desire to learn more about World War II and the impact of the war on the United States , I urge you to read this book . Mr. Wouk used the device of an American family reflecting the major issues of the war . He also gives background of major events that help you see the war as those who really lived it . This is a compelling book .
5 #### Kahlil is so amazing . To try to express his wisdom with my own words would be more like an insult . Just read the book and just let it soak in . Carl Bozeman Author : Amazon bestselling book ; " On Being God - Beyond Your Life 's Purpose Are You Listening ? Addressing the Divine Within & On Human Being - Loving and Living Without Purpose
5 #### The Prophet is one of the best books ever written ! ! It is timeless . Provides inspiration and guidance for any situation in your life . I recommended highly . I purchased to give it as a present and my friend loves it ! ! I love it too ! !
5 #### A classic . Inspirational for all generations . Timeless . Comforting advice with brief verse that one can refer to in the moment .
5 #### This book has so much you can take out of it to use in your real life . Amazing , and one of my favorite reads of all time .
5 #### I received my first copy of this book over 40 years ago . As a young woman , I found understanding in topics that concerned me ; as I aged , my life experiences broadened and this book still gave me understanding and confirmation . I have given this gift to many and they , too , enjoy the book and keep it as a reference . This is a book that keeps on giving what you need as your life experiences or interests change .
5 #### This novel is an exceptional example of Victorian literature . I especially loved the strong female lead of Margaret Hale and the relationship that developed between Margaret and Mr. Thornton . You have to read it to get all the great details , but the mini - series uses direct quotes and gives you a glimpse of Elizabeth Gaskell 's masterpiece .
4 #### I ca n't believe I actually liked it , as the Civil War has never held any particular interest for me , but this well - written tale works to draw you in despite what I felt to be a rather slow start . The author captures the time , place , and the sentiments of both sides of said time and place very well . I highly enjoyed this , much to my surprise , and I recommend it as well if you are looking for some excellent historical fiction .
5 #### I love this book ! ! The font is good and the quality excellent . Writing style is old fashion but that is a part of the charm of the book . Who says old - fashion romance ca n't be chaste and passionate at the same time ?
1 #### WARNING . Do not buy . This is NOT a pocket - sized paperback book , it is a briefcase - sized paperback that has lines of small type so long that i got a headache looking over the first page . I had planned to give it as a gift . It 's a wonderful and well - written romantic classic . But the format is a killer .
2 #### In deciding to select this company for my source for the book The Black Moon by Winston Graham , I was led to believe that this was a complete volume . When I received the book , I found that it was Volume 1 of 2 Volumes . This was in no way noted in the description of the book and now I only have half of the written work by Winston Graham and must look to find a complete copy . I wrote to the company asking if it was possible to purchase Vol 2 or if I could possibly purchase a complete volume . I have received no response from them . I would not recommend this company to future buyers .
5 #### THE GARDEN OF THE PROPHET & Sand and Foam is a good Kahlil Gibran story not as strong as " The Profit " or " the Madman " but very enjoyable
5 #### A short and magnificent book that will forever withstand the test of time because it speaks to , and from , the heart .
5 #### There is only one thing to say about Gibran , that he is one of the most powerful writers of gentle soul - touching prose and poetry that has ever lived .
5 #### This book is hard to put down because it makes you really think and reflect on life and the world . I read through it really fast the first time , but I wanted to buy it as a daily reader / reference to just pick up and read a short section every once in a while . This is on the short list of my all time favorite books .
5 #### I have always loved this book and had misplaced my original copy so I was happy to get it again .
5 #### I have given away more than 50 of these books over the years - and will continue to do so . This is a well - made book - will last a long time .
5 #### Good series . Good history review for us old folks and just good history for the younger generations .
5 #### Fantastic book . Mr. Wouk went to great lengths to keep the book historically accurate . The book is giving me insite as to how the people around the world were reacting to Hitler and the politics of the time . I am enjoying the characters he created like old friends . A must read .
4 #### this is a good review within historical fiction of events leading to W W II . Read it years ago but found the book again so decided to read again , especially with the way our world is today . I think we as a nation should review the past as we move forward . I enjoyed the book . It is lengthy but did keep my interest .
5 #### If you are interested in WWII history , this is one of the best books .
5 #### Have read the book twice ... seen the movie several times .... all time classic ..... love it !
5 #### I have searched high and low for a novel that rivals the romance of Jane Austin and have finally found one !
4 #### I like Elizabeth Gaskell writing , and this was very enjoyable to read . It was interesting to learn about the cultural differences between northern and southern England .
4 #### This book had many interesting aspects including simply , its focus on capitalism . Its hard to believe there is a Pride and Prejudice story in here as well .
5 #### This is a great story . It has to be one of my favorite books . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Read this book long ago and just wanted the " hard cover " for my collection .
5 #### I have always loved this book and its companion War and Rembrance . The only reason I bought this recently was that my 30 year old book club copy was falling apart .
5 #### I may be one of the last people to read this book and I never saw the movie , but I am glad I read it . The book was a great mix of factual information from the time period interspersed with interesting characters . I am looking forward to reading " War and Remembrance " next .
4 #### A great read for anyone into historical fiction . Great characters .... now onto the second book !
5 #### Great book ! Liked the way it inserted the German point of view though it was harder to read through .
5 #### Years ago , a mini series was made of Wouk 's " The Winds of War " with an all - star cast . Of course , a vast number of us bought the book as we were swept into the lives of an American officer 's family pre - WWI . I was - as I remember , a busy , busy college student who had just finished a rather arduous course in World History .... and I hated Military strategy and philosophy with a passion . I skimmed through " The Winds of War " paying attention to the story line only - and I stupidly skipped through a vast number of passages that explained the underlying factors and philosophies leading to WW I. My words do not do this Masterpiece justice , but suffice it to say that it is not only entertaining , but it is powerfully thought provoking . Through his use of characters is his story , Wouk gives the reader insights into political philosophies of that time in history , and it left me with the thought that our time now - is not vastly different than what it was pre - WWI .
5 #### There are lots of twists and turns as the pages progress . The characters bringing a somewhat familiar story to life keep interest high . Some parts are somewhat technical but add to the realistic mood at the time . Great book .
1 #### You 've got to be kidding , all you 5 star reviewers ! This overly sentimental trash is sickening ! It just rambles on and on with nonsense . It is said that Gibran is a great poet . Really ? It has no poetic value whatsoever . Save your $ 2 , my friend , and if you 're looking for enlightenment try " Siddhartha " .
5 #### Have purchased many in the past like in the 1970 's after I received one as a gift . I recommend to all ages .
5 #### writing this review due to how interesting the book was . solitary life of a profit going from place to place educating the world on what he s learned and needed to tell them . Up till I read this book I had an entirely different image of what I profit even is . I like the perspective this book gave me . I also very much enjoyed the flow of the story . Well worth the read .
5 #### It has helped to replace the many dysfunctional premises my sociopathic parents modeled ! This is a book with a popularity which continues to grow at phenomenal rates ! I had to buy this version since I 'd lost my original classic one . There certainly NEED to be more Half Price Book Stores here in CA ! ! ! I got spoiled by having 3 - 4 in Dallas alone !
5 #### This is a great book ! Read it after you 've watched Season 3 of Poldark on PBS .... a fabulous story !
5 #### The Poldark series is one of the best written I have ever encountered . Winston Graham 's command of the English language is marvelous . His knowledge of the era makes these historically accurate novels fascinating along with the numerous plots lines . I can not praise it or recommend it enough .
5 #### Was birthday gift for sister & she loved it !
5 #### Very much enjoying the Poldark series , ca n't wait for the next one . Keeps me up late reading into the wee hours .
5 #### Interesting and a great way to understand some of the history of USA .
3 #### Excellent plot and even more excellent historical setting . The writing itself is only tolerable . The first two kept me reading . The last made me skip pages . Too often the women retired to their couches while the men paced anxiously . The very positive is how the author is able to convey both the mill owner 's and workers ' point of view . For this reason , the book is worth reading .
4 #### I would love to read this and why not in Kindle Format ? I would like to read this but do not want to spend the money that it would cost for paperback .
5 #### My degree is in history and when I just want to relax , historical novels fit the bill . this is a great book to accompany the cd 's
5 #### I was going through my old book , looking to clear out the shelves and donate to the library , when I found this and decided to reread it . It 's better the second time around . I found myself wanting to strangle Uncle Aaron and to scream at Natalie . I think knowing what 's in store for the various characters just built up the tension . My husband is a WWII junkie and so I have seen every episode of every documentary ever made about that war . But I learned more about the causes of the war and the thinking of the politicians from this one novel than from any of the documentaries . If you are even vaguely interested in that war , read this . Not just history , but a great story
4 #### Very interesting and enjoyable . A very skilled writer . I wish this writer would have written more non - war books , for as good as they are , he is at his best writing about male female relationships . This writer even as a Pulitzer prize winner is underrated . I have listened to so many highly rated mediocre books on Audible it is a joy to find an author like this . I preferred his book Marjorie Morningstar .
5 #### I loved the mini - series so decided to give the book a go . The TV series covered all the most important things from the book , but as usual there is much detail in the book that there was not time for in the series . This book is a good bet for anyone who loves an engrossing story about a very important time in the history of mankind . I learned a great deal that I never knew before , and I fancy myself somewhat of a history buff . Highly recommended .
5 #### Excellent epic novel . For anyone enjoying WWII history , it plays a brilliant backdrop to the story of the Henry family . A very enjoyable read .
4 #### Was great fun to visit old friends . Also very good on facts . I do recommend it . Intend to order the series on DVD .
5 #### I have read and reread this book in paper form several times . I purchased it for my Kindle to have an alternative to carrying around the heavy book ( my kindle weighs fall less than the book and I can change the font size as the day progresses ) . If you have never read this book before take an up - tight navy Captain ( who while being strictly military is also a human being ) , a son following in his footsteps and another son who is basically floating through life making as few waves as possible , and a wife who loves her husband ( most of the time ) who is more ambitious for his advancement to keep up with the Jones . Add into this middleclass protestant world a Jewish devil may care girl who is worldly wise and living in Europe in the late 1930 's who does n't believe evil exists and who has an uncle who thinks that the war if it comes will not effect him since he is a famous author . Now add WWII to the mix and you have a hell of a story told by Mr. Wouk in full color . The story takes us into Germany before the US enters the War , takes us to England where the war is raging , to Russia during the war , to the Pacific after Pearl Harbor . The sequel to Winds of War is War and Remembrance and should not be read out of sequence !
4 #### it is well written and the characters are fleshed out and believable . I read in one read and it kept my interest
5 #### I read this many years ago and thought I would like to read again , but remembered too much of the story so I did n't finish the second reading . I highly recommend this excellent story to anyone interested in the World War II era . Not only does the story explain much of the politics of the time , but also tells the story of several very interesting families caught up in the struggle . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is a timeless classic . Over the years I 've given it as a gift more times than I can count , and will continue to do so . Addresses real life issues in a beautiful way and makes us reexamine our own attitude about how we see what happens in our lives . So easy to read over and over .
5 #### Reading this made my mind feel like a still pool of water , cool and quiet in a mossy grotto . It 's direct and simple wisdom has a depth of complexity that takes a quiet day to sink in , leaving you at peace . It is best to set time aside for it , relax , absorb , and let it softly clear your mind .
5 #### I bought this book to supplement a recording I treasure in my collection .. The Prophet is truly inspirational , and poetically illustrates the many challenges and journeys the human spirit traverses from birth to death . The utterings are omni - religious and subtly explain the basic principles of the human lifespan from an authoritative and spiritual perspective . A must- have for any deep or not - so - deep thinker .
5 #### I have known and loved this book since childhood , and give it as a gift to the special people in my life .
5 #### This book provides a reflection that you can apply to your own life . And , a way for you to try and assess whether you are truly doing the right thing and making the most of your short time on this plane .
5 #### This is classic reading , which I did read when it was " young " . I was glad to find it available for Kindle .
5 #### Who can ever say anything negative about this great philosopher poet , artist ? Read , enjoy , and apply to your own life .
5 #### Poldark series is fantastic ! Keeps me wanting more and more ...
4 #### Did n't disappoint - continues to hold my interest . Ca n't wait for new season on Amazon.com .
4 #### This will take you into an entire new surroundings , and a few new characters ... Stay alert , or you 'll end up having to go back to reorient yourself .. Voice of experience .... learned much more regarding French and English political relationship ... Good book in itself without being a part of the Poldark series
5 #### I began reading this series after watching Poldark on PBS . This one picks up where season 2 ends . Elizabeth is pregnant . It ends with the senior Poldark and her last words . I do n't want to say much for spoiling it but if you are watching the series and can not wait for season 3 then read this and it will bring you up to speed and you 'd have a leg up on next season !
5 #### What a fabulous novel . I 'm sorry I did n't read it sooner . But , if I had , I would n't have had this treat of a story to read . It is a little plodding in a few places but well worth the effort to make it through . Loved the ending .
4 #### Loved fue book , but you have to be aware that it is not an ' Austenian ' love sorry as the tv series would have you believe . There is an exciting love story , but its more on the background , the novel is mainly about how Margaret 's life changes from living in southern Helston to northern industrial Milton .
4 #### I had hoped the first of this trilogy would be like Jeffrey Archer 's Clifton Chronicles or Ken Follett 's Century Triolgy or even Edward Rutherfurd 's tomes . Instead it 's a much more detailed account of a relatively short period of time . At 810 pages in the print version I felt at times if I 'd never finish . I got the Kindle version as the trilogy for $ 1.99 and will no doubt read the remaining two books but I truly need a break from the Civil War and the Main and Hazard families . Hope the ne t two books pick up the pace of the story .
5 #### Loooved this book ! That s all I got ta say :)
5 #### Wow ! I gave away my previous version of this book , which was in paperback . I am so happy with my replacement ! This was in great shape , There was no writing , except for a small inscription , which was just a name at the front . I love it !
5 #### I love the Prophet and tend to buy copies to give to people who may need it 's message . I do n't ever loan mine out because it never comes back ! This book speaks on all matters human ! I 've owned it since I was 14 and go back to it constantly . I especially love the sections on children , love and marriage . It 's a wonder insightful read and I highly recommend it . It 's also rather spiritual which is lovely . It 's not like the bible , but easy to read and take in . It can give you peace when you need it . Please consider adding it to your library .
5 #### Just reread The Prophet for the umpteenth time . Still love it and its insights into many issues . Great quotable texts . Everyone should read this and reflect - not the same as agreeing -- on what Gibran says .
5 #### I read this when it came out and decided to reread . It is a very interesting family story but is also a very informative historical narrative about the several years before the US entered WW2 . The description of the political , social and military history of the time is as engrossing as the personal story . Very well written and highly recommended .
5 #### I have read this book several times before and I also have it on dvd . Great book ca n't say enough about it----glad i have it on my kindle now - going to read a different book now to get a break and then i will get the war and rememberance another great book
5 #### Herman Wouk has a knack for incorporating research and history of his subject matter into a fictional story line that makes for compelling reading . He takes a fictional family and incorporates their story before , during , and after WWII into the history of what started WWII , what brought the United States into the war , and what occurred during the war . He tells this story thru their eyes as they lived it . I could not put the book down as I read it during my free time on a missile submarine patrol . The Winds of War takes the reader to Pearl Harbor . And I could hardly wait for the follow on novel War and Rememberance which covers the rest of WWII . And if you desire the video too , get the DVD miniseries pkgs . too because the videos bring the words to life . You will not doubt the horrors of the holocaust after reading and viewing these works of Herman Wouk .
5 #### I read The Winds of War many years ago and just re - read it . I also got War and Remembrance and will re - read that one . These two books are among my favorite books I have ever read . The books were well written and the characters are developed well along with an incredibly well - researched history of WWII . I 'm sure I will read the books again and again and would recommend them to all readers . I do n't hand out 5 stars lightly .
5 #### I consider this book one of the greatest books ever written . Sometimes I had to put it down as it was too hard to take the awful events of World War II . I loved it .
5 #### This book is a must read for all who enjoy reading about the historical events that brought the world to the brink of utter destruction during the second World War . The unbelievably destruction of human life and property is only an example of what awaits us all if it should ever happen again . There are not enought stars to do justice to the personal way this book is written and holds your attention . Just Outstanding . Sal Ingrassia
5 #### This book held my interest from the first page to the last and I could not wait to read " War and remembrance " , the sequel which was just as interesting .
5 #### If you were one of those students that was doodling during American History or , more likely , by spring when WWII was covered , was thinking of other things as the teacher sped through the entire event in two periods , this is an wonderfully enjoyable way to get the history you missed . Following two families , this historic fiction offers insights into WWII that no textbook could . It opens in early 1939 and closes with Pearl Harbor , describing events in London , Europe , Washington and the Pacific . The book includes an enormous amount of factual data on actual events and individuals who played a significant role during the period . Additionally , it very effectively employs the device of reports written by a fictitious German general , to provide the German perspective on the war effort there . All in all an excellent book that should be required reading for anyone that feels they know too little about the period . And the sequel , War and Remembrance ( which I am now reading ) is an excellent follow up , continuing to track the characters throughout the remainder of the war .
4 #### I enjoyed this book in the Poldark Series . I like to read historical novels that are well researched , as this one is . Looking forward to the next book .
4 #### s always an excellent read continuing the Poldark saga
5 #### not done reading it but it is a good book , love the series on PBS too !
5 #### I just love this series ! Now , I am caught up to the book my husband is just finishing up , and it is due on Wednesday with holds ahead of me . Have I mentioned I just love a good book ?
5 #### This is a must read for POLDARK fans . There is much character development . I had been wondering when we were going to read more about Geoffrey Charles . Scenes where he and his governess get to know Drake are fun and touching . We get to know George and his relationship with Elizabeth much better . The last scene with George and Agatha haunts me even now . If we ever had any doubt that George was a cruel person , there will be no doubt after reading THE BLACK MOON . Ross continues to be adventurous , chance taking and fascinating in his quest to help Caroline and Dwight . Demelza continues to be loving , understanding , and giving .
5 #### I like this novel better than Pride and Prejudice . The ending is so tender and well crafted . I will treasure it .
5 #### Elizabeth Gaskell does a superb job transporting us to the Industrial Revolution in Northern England at the Cotton Mill of fictional Milton . John Thornton & Margaret Hale are definitely two characters that mold and shape the book . They compliment and contrast each other , giving the sense of urgency and belonging in this Victorian era novel . Truly is a page turner from start to finish !
5 #### This is my first book from this author , and I really , really loved it . The style and subject matter is similar to Jane Austen , but there 's a different sort of richness to the storyline and character development . I 'm looking forward to reading other books by this author .
3 #### Maybe some of the folks in his homeland considered him a " prophet , " but I see him as an other person with some ideas but not too many truths . That being said , I like many of his ideas and concepts . If you like spiritual gurus like Eckhardt Tolle you 'll probably like Kahlil Gibran .
5 #### I have been a huge fan of The Prophet since I was 16 and received it as a gift ! ! ! That was 40 years ago ! It is one of my favorites to open up over and over and over ! Roxie
5 #### Since I first read The Prophet when I was a teenager I have had a copy by my side . It is a gift of such value in comprehending the depth and meaning of this wonderful Life in its beauty of every relationship that engages us . Be it work , parenting , eating , death or love , Gibran paints word images of such divine and exquisite loveliness that , once read , will change the reader 's perspective forever . It is a book to refer to again and again as life unfolds and offers new opportunities for spiritual growth and awareness . It is a book I have given as a gift to many young people as they grapple with the frustrations and distortions of an often incomprehensible outer world . It is a book of beautiful truths and a map to our own seeking souls . I particularly love this edition which includes Gibran 's original drawings .
5 #### I admire the philosophy of this author . This book is ageless and inspirational , should be one of those mandatory books for high school .
5 #### I have n't read this for years but at one time it was very meaningful to me . Simple suggestions for life .
5 #### I first read this book in 1972 . It is the story of a military family from 1939- through 1941 and the attack on Pearl Harbor that brought us into the war . Very readable and meticulously researched , the characters in the book have become like treasured ancestors . I just finished my 4th reading of the book .
4 #### This novel was an enormous best seller in the 1970s for good reason . Wouk is a skilled story teller , and the reader quickly learns to like and to care about the fate of Wouk 's characters . Also , Wouk portrays a vision of America appealing to Americans : they enter war reluctantly , but once in , they fight the good war and fight it well . Although Wouk knows too much about the military to abandon all cynicism , he portrays military men as generally competent , committed , and patriotic . The appeal of the novel is also its limitation . This is not a meditation on the human condition like Tolstoy 's " War and Peace . " Also , Wouk uses his characters to tell the whole story of the lead up to World War II . He is sufficiently skilled to pull it off , but he spreads his characters a bit thin in the process . I recommend the book as highly entertaining . Despite its length , it reads fast .
5 #### I loved this book . I also watched the DVD that is out on the Winds of War , and also loved it . The book goes into so much more detail then the movie . But the movie is also very well done . The book gets inside the characters ' & makes you feel that you know them & what they are going through during World War ll . I would recommend this book to those who love world history .
5 #### This book is nearly perfect . The cadence and content of the prose . The intricate weaving of characters . All from an historical perspective of the second world war . I am starting on the second book now .
5 #### This was a re - read for me . I remain impressed by Wouk 's grasp of history and his ability to incorporate it into a moving story with realistic characters experiencing the ups and downs of the 1930 's and the onset of WW II . It is , without a doubt , a masterpiece of historical fiction .
5 #### Well written and best book on how WWII came to be and all of the key leaders and their personalities .
5 #### The " Winds of War ' along with its sequel " War and Remembrance " have been around for a long time . Still probably no other piece of historical fiction better tells the inside thinking and decision making of WWII 's major players . Told through the eyes of an extraordinary Naval Attache , " Pug " Henry finds himself with the wars key decision makers during their most important decisions of WWII . The novel is also about the plight of the Jews in Europe leading up to and throughout WWII told through the eyes of Natalie Jastrow and her stubborn Uncle Aarron , the novel shows just how easily the Jews of Europe were systematically gathered up and brought to the " work camps " where most were eventually gassed . The novel(s ) are both beautifully and horrifically written . Some of the finest historical fiction ever written ,
5 #### This is the ultimate in great historical fiction , successfully integrating fictional and historical personages and events . The book has 2 conceits -- one that works , another that drives me nuts . First , Victor Henry is a Naval officer who surprisingly , but believably , finds himself at the center of history leading up to the war . Viewing these events and historic figures through Henry 's discerning eyes is genuine learning experience . His foil , the German General Von Roon , works equally well from the German perspective . The other conceit is necessary , but works less well -- this is the subplot of the book about Aaron Jastrow and his niece Natalie , Jewish Americans who find themselves dangerously trapped in Europe . Since the Holocaust will be Wouk 's ultimate overriding theme -- they are essential figures . The problem is that in order to place the Jastrows in their predicament , Wouk has created two of the most snobbish and stupid people in literature . One can not help buy sympathize with their situation , but it is frustrating at the number of opportunities they had to avoid it .
4 #### In this fifth book of the Poldark series , several new characters and story lines are introduced , but the old familiar ones remain . Although Demelza features less in this book than the previous ones , she 's ever present in Ross ' thoughts . He knows her so well that she has become his conscience when he 's wrestling with a tough decision . The conflict between social classes continue and George Warleggan still battles with his inner feelings of insecurity and his outer faade of superiority . The slower bits ( my opinion ) involving religious conflict between Methodists and Anglicans and battles between Royalists and Republicans in France are the only things that keep me from giving the book a 5 star rating . Fortunately , the author skillfully wraps up these events without losing the reader . The glorious reveal at the end , and the manner in which it is done , makes any " boring " battles in France worth plodding through .
5 #### Love Winston Graham - what a beautiful , descriptive writer and I feel as if I have traveled back in time to Cornwall ! I 've lived in England and so reading his stories are nostalgic . The language is lovely and he has the period expressions and dialogue down ! What a joy to read .
5 #### I love the entire series and ca n't wait for the PBS series to start up again in 2017 . I have read all the 13 books and will re - read them this summer to get ready for the new series coming up . LOVE , LOVE , LOVE ! ! ! !
4 #### I am a BIG fan of the PBS Poldark series and decided to read the books . I have bought e books up to # 9 out of the 12 . Yesterday I found them on Amazon for $ 2.99 . I have enjoyed the books very much with more details etc of the story . Get a little frustrated with the English jargon in the book but I just find myself reading slower and concentrating more . For any Poldark fans , I could highly recommend the books .
5 #### Larger sized book so there is a lot to read on a page but it makes the chapters seem shorter so I like the book size . :) pristine condition !
4 #### The audible addition was terrific . It helps with the older style of English .
5 #### This is a classic of world literature . Everyone with a poet 's heart , a lover 's heart , a philosopher 's heart , a dancer 's heart , a parent 's heart , a leader 's heart , or simply who enjoys beauty found in life 's joys and sorrows , this book is simply the best .
5 #### This was a book that my wife read and loved . We purchased this one as a birthday gift for our daughter , and had it shipped directly . The seller was very prompt , and even agreed to add a birthday note with the shipment . Great seller experience .
3 #### I bought this book for a friend . Since I am a Christian , I can not accept anything this book says . I think the book would be a Great Aid for Hollywood writers to put a movie script together .
5 #### This book has been a classic for many years . It has so much wisdom in it that it can be read numerous times and new things will come out each time . My favorite chapter is the one on children .
5 #### One of the classics that everyone should read . It is also one of the most profound books that is this short .
5 #### Herman Wouk has done a remarkable job of individualizing events in WWII by showing us through the eyes of one family what the impact of Nazism was at that time . Beautiful and moving !
5 #### I have read this book and itx successor , War and Remembrance , four times ! ! I always find something I missed while reading them previously . Herman Wouk develops characters so well , I can visualize them in my mind as I read .
5 #### I originally read " Winds of War " and " War and Remembrance " while serving on the USS Enterprise in the 80 's . I loved them both so much I decided to re - read them again . I also watch both TV Mini - Series about twice a year ! ! Both the Books and the Videos show me a good snapshot of what life was like for a typical Navy family caught up in swirling maelstrom that was WW2 ! !
5 #### Another in the Poldark series that is quite good ........ romance , history , war , challenges .... all done in a beautiful writing style that other authors of today should take guidance from . I love this whole series and ca n't wait to gobble each one up .
4 #### After watching the first two seasons of Poldark on Amazon Prime this past year .. I started with Black Moon so I could get a jump on the upcoming season 3 of Poldark new Masterpiece from PBS/ BBC . I am jumping now to book 6 which I 've read Season 3 will cover some of . I like the author , but this is n't the usual type of books I read , but So far I am enjoying it and will start this morning to book 6 .
5 #### Love all the Poldark series . I only wish there were more .
5 #### Another wonderful must read in the Poldark collection . The Story of the Poldarks and Warleggans continues in this gripping tale .
5 #### I have loved this book since I first acquired it decades ago ... a classic in every since of the word . I have always kept a book copy , had to have an e - copy too .
5 #### Deep , moving dramatic verses of the heart and soul . Truths of ancient wisdom from a true and romantic poet . Relevant for all eternity .
5 #### This is a fantastic book and I would definitely recommend it to everyone . Quick read , but also very insightful . It really makes you think .
4 #### The Prophet is a story of advice from a departing visitor to the villagers of the town where he has resided for the past 12 years . Some is moving , some is ordinary , a bit is trite . Some parts are powerful . This version of the book is truly outstanding because of the beautiful illustrations that accompany it , all reproductions of famous pieces of Middle Eastern art . A fantastic book .
5 #### I highlighted or wanted to highlight almost every word . So much beautiful metaphor , and profound wisdom here . I wish everyone read this and took it to heart .
5 #### I had this book for years & lost it when I moved . I got this used & was glad I did , felt like getting my old copy back .
5 #### This was a great way to understand more about the war , and enjoy rereading the book after seeing the movie on netflix .
5 #### I am enjoying this book as it is interesting and tells so much about the people who did nothing but were persecuted due to their religion and finally decided to fight back !
5 #### The TV serial has many dfferences from the book , both are excellent . Both are reasonably accurate . For Naval detIails see Morison 's " Operational History of the USN In WW II " , Skip vol . XVI ( a fantastic index )
5 #### Wonderful story of World War II , told by one man 's family who happen to be in all the right ( wrong ? ) places to be involved in the many aspects of the war , from Europe to the Pacific to the home front ... sort of a serious Forrest Gump story . I checked the validity of some of the history and everything seems to be accurate .
5 #### I 've read it several times over the years . I recently ordered it for my Kindle because I 've broken the spine on my paperback edition of it . I love that it covers pretty much every corner of the world during the period . The characters are very easy to relate to and three dimensional . I would recommend this and the second part to anyone who enjoys not only a good read , but something that is worth putting time into .
5 #### Had to have it for my Kindle . Saw the miniseries back in the 80s , loved the book , too , so had to have another copy . Thanks !
4 #### Wouk wrote this book just as if he had personal knowledge of the U.S. Navy in WWII . He did , and this is a very intelligent account of the way things were , from a very qualified , on several levels , observer .
5 #### I have loved this book for years , so I bought enough for my whole book club to share it with them . The writing is wonderful , and stimulates thought , charity and love , and better actions towards ourselves , others , and the world .
5 #### Slow reading but full of Significant messages . Took long to read in order to fully capture and understand his message .
5 #### I have read this book several times . I have given it to loved ones several times . There is much to learn about life and love from reading this book . It has always been a classic for a reason .
5 #### This book was great ; each chapter was a nugget of wisdom , resulting in a treasure trove by the end . It 's no wonder this book is called a classic . Gibran uses a literary style inspired by the Bible , but it is still easy to read . Has a lot of philosophical ideas that I 'm sure I will revisit in the future . Seems like one of those books that you learn something new every time you reread it . Definitely recommend , especially for anyone new to philosophy reading because it is short and easy to read .
5 #### An amazing work . Realizing extensive use of Biblical imagery and sentence structure , " The Prophet " by Khalil Gibran is a literary classic . Influencing the Free Love movement of the 1960 's , Gibran 's master work explores themes of love , longing and loss .
5 #### I have not read the book from cover to cover but read snippets and what I 've read so far is uplifting and enlightening
5 #### When I married 40 years ago , the minister quoted from this book , and I thought it was a little corny , but I 've heard it used at all kinds of events since , and I find it 's stood time 's test . Portions are quoted in my church 's ceremony for dedicating children , and I turned to it for a toast when my daughter married recently . I was sorry to find the hardcover out of print , but I bought this copy for her and her husband . It 's a keeper .
5 #### This is the fifth book in the Poldark series . I recommend reading the whole series in order to understand this one . Poldark has been made into a television series on PBS , and we are hooked . The books have a little more detail , of course , and any avid reader will enjoy both immensely . The story weaves sorrow , joy , romance , revenge , and history in one . It 's a classic , to be read many times .
5 #### Really enjoying the wonderful writing , and absolutely addictive storytelling . Wish the series was longer .
5 #### I loved this book and the series poldark.i will read more books from this author.i love his style and look forward to more from him
5 #### Well , these books are marvelous . Each one continues the saga and continues to maintain the quality and interest of the series . None so far have been a disappointment .
5 #### I am addicted to this series and will be sad when I get to the last book .
5 #### Great continuation of the Poldark saga . It is one of 12 . All good and riveting !
5 #### true to life then as it is now ... classic forever . used marriage passages in my wedding ceremony ... need i say more .
5 #### I read this book many years ago , It is a book that should be on ones book shelf to read often . It takes several readings to get to the heart of his deep writings of philosophy . Glad I replaced the one I lost .
5 #### Excellent Book Full of wisdom . Even though the book was n't preachey there were a lot of references made to the bible made .
5 #### Just read it . It 's one of those books that will renew your idea of humanity . I would recommend it to anyone .
5 #### One of the best books written in English , ever . Simple , yet extremely penetrating like " Jonathan Livingston Seagull " , deeply thought - provoking like " Stranger in a Strange Land " , semantically precise yet as moving as the Psalms of David , Gibran 's masterpiece is timeless .
5 #### Excellent book . Herman Wouk is a genius at weaving historical facts with fictional characters . He makes reading a very enjoyable experience .
5 #### This is the story about the years and events leading up to the Second World War looking through the eyes of one family and their friends . Wonderful book .
5 #### For me , THE WINDS OF WAR , combined with WAR AND REMEMBRANCE , comprise Herman Wouk 's ultimate masterpiece . A sweeping telling of the World War II story from initial rumblings to Hiroshima , all through the eyes of a US Navy commander . The two books combined make for a massive read , but it 's well worth it . We must never ever forget the horror of the war , the horrific fate of the Jews caught in it 's net and the brave men who willingly and , yes , gladly went off to fight enemies on both sides of the planet . They are dying daily and the world owes them a huge debt . Herman Wouk 's accurate and fair telling of the story will stand as a monument to all of them . These books can be read and read again then listened to in the excellent audio version - they are that good .
5 #### This romantic , anti - war novel explains how the insanity and mass killing of WWII got started . It is one of the greatest books of all time .
5 #### I believe this to be historically accurate , explaining through the actions of fictitious characters how events led up to WWII . It is written so well ! It is exciting to read even if you do not want to know much about World War II .
5 #### I think all deep thinking adults should read this book , to help insure that this can never happen again . Wouk is a super writer .
4 #### The book clarified some of my misconceptions about the events leading to the second world war . Creation of a story makes the reading of history much more interesting . I really enjoyed reading it .
4 #### At times a little wordy , but I feel it is detailed and gives views about what led to WW2 . Worth getting through the slow partsdon't short change them , because you 'll learn something you did not know . I realize that this is a war novel , but it reads like good historical fiction .
5 #### One of the most complete books I have ever read on WWII . He gives a perspective from the American , English and even the German side . Some parts are difficult to read , but I guarantee you will remember and understand more about that period of time then you knew . Well worth your time . And his character development is superb .
5 #### Went straight onto No . 6 - ca n't put them down !
5 #### I liked it because I had been watching the PBS series Poldark and wanted to know more about the stories .
5 #### Love the suspense and intrigue of this book in the Poldark series . Highly recommend reading this set of great books !
5 #### Compared it to works like " Tarantula " by Bob Dylan . Purchased this time as a gift , it was received with praise per its current cover
5 #### The Prophet is one of the best books I have ever read . I have read it many times and each time , it seems more rich . I think it makes an excellent gift .
5 #### Each time I read this poetry I see another aspect of life , at 76 I can never stop learning ... Particularly loved the piece on children .
5 #### A book of poetry i go to when I am pondering different subjects . Always very calming to read his beautiful , wise words .
5 #### This , along with " War and Remembrance , " are the finest historical novels I have ever read about WWII . You will be totally engrossed in the pride , passion , tragedy and pain of real people caught up in the maelstrom of nations at war .
5 #### Wonderful , historically correct fiction . Rich family saga that makes you feel they really existed . Transports you to WWII days and gives a close look at the impact war has on a family . Emotional and gripping .
5 #### Insightful read , although fiction , based on historical facts . Great perspective from career naval family . Refreshing to see honor , truth and family hailed as the ultimate purpose for this family . Although not hailed as a love story you ca n't help but feel the deep love this family has for each other and our great country .
5 #### Engaging and educational from the first page This is the second time I have read this book , the first many years ago
5 #### I 've always loved this book and just re - read it . Wouk got down so many details , not just of history , but of everyday Navy life and , really , life in general , how persons interact with one another . I do think a real - life Pug Henry would have dropped dead of a heart attack before doing half of what he did in the novel , but that 's a small quibble .
5 #### One of the top 10 books I 've ever read . Period . Should be on everyone 's reading list . Do n't forget the sequel : War and Remembrance . Just as good .
5 #### The first of two books that sets the stage for the Henry family during WWII . Be sure to purchase both books . The story will make more sense that way . A serious read , yet one that will not put you to sleep . Wouk is a literary master at detail , geography , politics of the day , and the drama surrounding his characters .
5 #### I have read this book more than two times . It is still a very good story . I will start the conclusion in a few minutes .
5 #### I just love this book . It 's deep , philosophical , romantic and a beautiful add to any book collection . :) It makes for a wonderful gift .
4 #### The Prophet was a surprisingly quick read that gave me quite a bit to think about during my travels this summer . Kahlil Gibran has a talent for words , and it really shows . Would recommend to anyone interested in poetry , philosophy , or human relations .
4 #### Kahlil Gibran is a wonderful poet . He is a philosopher who meshes the bible with his prose . Very spiritual to read .
5 #### I have loved this book for forty years , both the written version and the audio ( Richard Harris narrating I believe ) with orchestral accompaniment . This new format only increases its accessibility .
3 #### Decent read . I read for myself to find out what the fuss was about . Nothing major , not too impressive , just a decent read . I guess I can now say that I 've read it when I hear people talking about it . The Alchemist by Paulo Coehlo was waaaay better !
5 #### Truly a classic of world literature , Gibran has snatched a chunk of wisdom from the ether -- from and for the ages -- and fashioned it into a masterwork .
5 #### Some change of style is noticeable from the first four novels . A bit more action / adventure is a nice addition . The Black Moon omen is opened and closed nicely .
5 #### Loved the constant suspense and new characters ( good & evil ) . I highly recommend the whole series including this fifth book in the series .
5 #### I 'm so obsessed with these books and truly amazed at how gifted Winston Graham was !
5 #### I am on Book 6 of the Poldark Series . I have enjoyed reading these books . I love history and this is a time and place in history that I am unfamiliar . What was going on in England after they lost the American Revolution . Times were difficult . I enjoy getting a peek into the daily lives of the Poldark family . This is a good read .
5 #### I loved this book ! And I ca n't wait to start the next one !
5 #### Reads like a Cornish War and Peace ! Beautifully crafted . Perfectly paced . I could n't put it down . Highly recommended for anyone who loves Tolstoy
5 #### It 's a very sad story but I love how it talks about the very hard truths for people during that time . The developing relationship between the two main characters is interesting to watch because they never know what the other is actually thinking about the other . The mini tv series follows the book pretty good with the exception of a few differences .
3 #### We were surprised when the book arrived and it is the size of a magazine . Kinda clunky to read as the pages are huge .
5 #### i love this novel one of my favorites . love Elizabeth Gaskell . i have at least watched the BBC tv series of this novel more than 50 times ... Its great book . all classics lovers must read it
5 #### A well written and well constructed novel . About 15 % to long , but I blame that on the editor , some Dickens fellow . A must for anyone who wants to claim they are versed in English literature . You can feel Hardy and so many others as you read .
4 #### After a rather slow start it turned into a enjoyable book . It does a good job of character development .
3 #### I 'm still waiting to read the remaining chapters , but the diatribe on the events leading up to WWII by the Ambassador ( ? ) was not likely to hold anyone 's attention .
5 #### This book , Winds of War and the book , War and Remembrance are worth reading and re - reading . Having both read the books and watched the mini - series several times since the 1980s , I feel a part of the extended Henry family . I 've gotten to know them and love them . The history lesson is relevant to the past , the present and the future of the US , and the world . The beginning of the end of war lies in remembrance . October 25 , 2013 as A Never Ending War rages on Earth .
5 #### A must read for any history buff . The book elicits revelations and looks into the feel and culture of the American people . This book made reading about the coming of WWII a breeze .
5 #### Mr. Wouk 's fictional characters become your neighbors and friends and his knowledge of WWII is amazing . I loved this book and will look for another H. Wouk book .
5 #### Herman Wouk 's tale is a huge masterpiece : sweeping in terms of plot , character , and history . His knowledge of WWII is staggering ; years of research are evident in the story . He also has the rare gift of literary poetry , with imaginative similes rolling off the storyteller 's pen . The one very slight fault is that the occasional letters or diaries lose a bit of their authentic voice ; most people , even creative geniuses , do n't pen such cleverly Shakespearian notes to their loved ones . Otherwise , this is a moving and satisfying drama about one of the globe 's great tragic conflicts . NOTE : I read a hard copy , not the much - aligned Kindle version .
5 #### I read Winds of War as well as War and Remembrance 30 - something years ago , and ever since have felt that they were the best , most compelling books I had read in my life . That 's never changed , despite having read hundreds of books since then . So I put Winds of War on my Kindle and am rereading slowly , savoring each chapter this time through . If you have n't read them , do so . You wo n't regret it .
5 #### I watched the mini series before reading the book . Book was so much better . I really likes the way the author weaves the story between all throughout the book .
5 #### One of my all time favs . This , along with War and Remembrance are some of the finest historical fiction ever written
5 #### The Prophet is a poetic , in some aspects , means of viewing life . Kahlil Gibran was able to draw on various aspects of life and compile a take that is , in some senses , new and appreciable .
5 #### Aphorisms ... At first glance you think to yourself , " Who is so conceited that they would publish a book of aphorisms ? " Then you realize , by the end of page one that with Gibran , there is no conceit or ego at work , just a beautiful , simple wisdom that would be at home between the covers of any holy book . Loosely grouped by theme , and positioned between full page reproductions of the author 's artwork , here are simple words that will challenge you , teach you , and move you back to your center . Find a quiet place in the sun and open up this book . It is a quick read , or a long read , and a book that I think will give something back every time you reach for it .
5 #### Not to be confused with THE good Book . Typical eastern philosophy and good food for thought . I liked this book . I thought it was inspiring .
5 #### I bought this for a child going through a stressful time . I always took comfort from it when I needed a few words of wisdom , and needed to appreciate what I have .
5 #### I love this book and give it as a graduation gift every year , they like the message . I buy a minimum of 15 each year .
5 #### I ca n't wait for it to be part of the series 's
5 #### Love the series . interesting and complex characters , seemingly authentic historical background .
5 #### New characters add interest and those familiar to the reader are revealed in greater depth and complexity . Relationships are altered by events which are skilfully developed as well as unexpected .
5 #### I was referred this book to read and enjoyed it . Reading it slow is the best way to absorb it fully
5 #### I find myself quoting this book constantly . This is a nice book to give as a gift , because it covers such a range of life topics and has such wisdom to convey . I also find myself referencing it 's knowledge when providing advice to friends . It 's an absolute classic that calms your spirit .
5 #### Book offers amazing Philosphy and at the same time delivers perspective on any thing life . The Prophet is a must read .
5 #### " Your joy is your sorrow unmasked . And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears . And how else can it be ? The deeper that sorrow carves into your being , the more joy you can contain . " page 29
5 #### Great book . Great price . I read this book quite a few years ago . This reasonable purchase , from Amazon.com afforded me to revisit the reading of this book . It did not cost me an arm and a leg either .
5 #### Loved this book since first I read it , years gone by . Purchased this copy for a friend who has not ever read Gibran .
5 #### Like any " historical " fiction novel , one must be a little skeptical about how facts are re - told . Nonetheless , the book does a good job re - telling the major events leading up to WWII while delivering an interesting plot around its main characters . So , I have been entertained with the story while learning some new things about the war too .
5 #### The story takes us and the Henry Family from 1939 to 1941 . We see how the coming war changes members of the Henry family and their friends . We meet some of the important people who shaped the world and led us into War . We participate in the invasion of Poland and learn who the war changed the lives of those who were involved . Some characters face terrible challenges and rise to the occasion and others fail . Hitler was not a nice person . Read the book and watch the miniseries . It was interesting to see the attitudes of many Americans before the war and others in Europe how they thought things were going .
5 #### I read this novel like I used to when I could n't put a book down . I loved the plot and became very involved with all the characters . I hope War and Remembrance will continue the story . The book also gave me a lot of insight into the Second World War . I have already recommended the Winds of War to many friends .
5 #### This book was recommended by a friend who said I would like it . Boy , was he right . What I like was the development of the characters , the insight into the development of WWII and visual impact that the book has . This is an excellent book for anyone under 60 to understand nation thinking that lead to war .
5 #### This and War and Remembrance ( 2 Volumes ) are some of the greatest books I have ever read . The author combines history , philosophy , politics and military tactics effortlessly throughout all three volumes .
5 #### This is a deservedly acclaimed novel of the events leading up to World War II . It 's famous for a reason : it 's great literature . Wouk weaves real history and real people into a page - turning novel , it 's a must read .
5 #### I enjoy history so much especially about WWII . The way Wouk weaves the history and the fiction family , Henry 's , in the book makes the history easier to remember . Also , you learn more about battle strategy 's , which are the important aspects of war .
5 #### I fell absolutely in love with this book . Having always been an Austen fan and having loved the miniseries based on this novel , I knew I would . But somehow it has sat on my to - read list unread for years . In many ways I d say the book is better than the comparable Pride and Prejudice for Gaskill gives us a good idea of the feeling and environment of the changing times , as well as the different ideas the various class levels had of them . Margaret Hale and John Thornton are simply lovely and believable characters full of passion and pride as they figure out there place in the world .
5 #### Great history and great story . Characters are very believable .
5 #### Even though I kept remembering Pride & Prejudice , ( strong , misunderstood , handsome , unsmiling men ; sensible , assertive , beautiful women ) I enjoyed the film , especially Richard Armitage . Never had seen him in anything .
4 #### This is a classic book . A great love story . The writing is lovely and not as heavy as , for example , Jane Austen 's . I did , however , think the mini - series was better than the book . Margaret is quite more prejudiced in the book !
5 #### love all the poldark books and will order more soon .
5 #### This has been a very enjoyable book with more to like about the character of the Poldark family . I am ready for the next book . Anyone who enjoys reading period novel will like this series .
5 #### Lots of action in the continuing saga of Ross Poldark . A great read .
5 #### Another great turn in the series . Am so glad I found this series , I 've enjoyed every book in the series greatly and each book brings more surprises and interesting characters . Wonderful saga , wonderful history lesson !
5 #### Very much like real life . Only set in the 1700 's
5 #### I 'm enjoying this book , as I have all the Poldark books so far .
5 #### A classic which has only improved with time . The thoughts and ideas in this book would make the world a better place !
5 #### An old book that I had read many years ago , but had lost . Decided to buy again and get inspired . It 's worth the read .
5 #### I have loved this book my whole life . It is one of the books I turn to in all the details of life .
4 #### I have no memory of buying this book but I had it when I was a kid and loved it . Maybe I should buy it again . I have no idea where it is now
5 #### goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood what else can I say . lol very goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood read I hope you enjoy it . I bought paper back and it came fairly quickly . thanks
5 #### Beautifuly written book , and as you read it again over the years you find more and more meaning in it .
5 #### This series - Winds of War and War and Remembrance - are among the finest novels to come out of the 20th century . I am a World War II baby whose life was hugely shaped by the events of this period . Wouk 's ability to invoke and portray the sights , sounds , and feel of the era is nothing less than remarkable . I re - read each of them once every two or three years . They are long enough and dense enough to make the re - reading enjoyable and immensely entertaining . Why read it again and again ? Because when one compares contemporary events with those described in that historic period , there are always incredible parallels as well new insights on everything from presidential leadership , to understanding racism , oppression , and , as always , the horrors of war .
5 #### Great story line , following a military family through the war years . Following the war as it happened using the imaginary family brought more of the feeling of the times . H. Wouk gets gold stars .
5 #### Again , this described an era since past , that I grew up / matured during . It was a complete story of a family that lived through that era .
1 #### This Book on CD 's is terribly disappointing . The CD 's do n't play well in my car CD player - the player either skips ahead to future tracks or skips back to previous tracks or even occassionally to another CD . In addition , the CD 's are packaged so poorly that the plastic binders that hold the folders for the discs come apart readily when you try to turn to unplayed CD 's or when you try to put back CD 's and have now ripped out of the base on the container . The product seems like a counterfeit product produced in a back alley in Bejing or Hanoi with poor , cheap materials . Extremely disappointing !
5 #### This is a sweeping view of WWII , as seen through the eyes of a fictional Navy family . It encompasses every war theater and deals factually with the military and political figures of that important era .
5 #### I read the trilogy in the 80 's when it was first publish . I enjoyed it as much this second time through .
5 #### well written with a hint of realism and hypothetical facts thrown in to magnify the impact of those historical events which shaped this country .
5 #### Book 5 of the great Poldark book series written by Winston Graham . Very , very good story full of romance , adventures and drama . Highly recommend .
5 #### Loved it . Love all th Ed Winston Grantham books .
5 #### Wonderful continuing story of the Poldark family set in beautiful Cornwall
5 #### Well written . characters are all very well developed . I love this series
5 #### The PBS show got me interested in the books .... and I am loving them . If you love reading historical novels , Mr. Graham did a great job with this series .
5 #### Addicted to the Poldark series after watching the Masterpiece series . Great insight into life in Cornwall during the 18th-19th centuries .
5 #### Great read ! A book for the ages ! Each little piece of prose / poem has something simple and profound to tell us all .
5 #### I read the Winds of War and War and Rememberance as they came out and bought them just now for my daughter . If you only saw the miniseries , you missed most of the story .
5 #### I have read this and War and Remembrance every year for the last 25 years . Each time I learn something new . I really like how the books works the story around real history .
5 #### This was purchased for my wife who is in Jail in Fla. She said she really enjoyed it . My only concern is that it took almost a month to reach her . I am answering this disappointment in an other email .
1 #### I did not like this book . I did not care for Wouk 's depiction of women in general as I tried to read the book . Consequently , I did not finish this book . End of story .
5 #### I never tire of reading Herman Soul 's work . I loved the mini - series but the Noel is light years better . It is an outstanding work that takes the reader back to the dark days of the late thirties up to Pearl Harbor .
4 #### A great novel about World War II . I ca n't help comparing it to Winter of the WORLD by Ken Follett which was a fantastic novel about the same time period .
5 #### I learned more WWII history from this book than I had in school . That history was delivered via a very entertaining story of a naval officer and his family members . Some people may shy away from this book because of its length , however , I hated to see it end . Fortunately there is a sequel , War and Remembrance , which I immediately moved onto and finished . Now I am reading The Caine Mutiny by Herman Wouk . You probably correctly get the idea that I like these books .
5 #### I especially enjoy historical fiction and the history and insights into both sides of the civil was . John Jakes has continued his engaging storytelling that I first experienced with The Kent Chronicles . I kept using whatever free time I had to pick up the book waiting for the story to unfold .
5 #### John Jakes is one of my favorite authors , he brings life to his characters and teaches history without your even being aware . It is an excellent novel !
2 #### Started out very interesting , but took too long to get to the end . Too much unnecessary detail in explaining difference between the two areas and not historically enlightening .
3 #### Very detailed account of civil war where it would help if you knew the history and were familiar with all the military personnell involved . I kept reading to find out about the two families who were friends on opposite sides of the war .
5 #### A love story woven through with social justice issues of the Industrial Revolution still engages readers by not being to preachy . All sides get a fair shake . Gaskell may not write quite as well as Austen , but her insights into the problems of her era make up for that tiny shortcoming .
5 #### I LOVE this book ! If you are a fan of Jane Austen , you will like Elizabeth Gaskell . I like the fact that her novels have similar themes but the settings and events taking place are so different . It 's fascinating to see bits of what life was like at the beginning of the machine age and how it changed the way people lived .
5 #### Saw the BBC ( c. 1980 ) mini - series and immediately afterward got the E - book .
5 #### Elizabeth Gaskell 's novel on the meeting of rural south and industrial north is much more than a love story . It 's a meditation on the changes that occurred in England as a result of the rise of the industrial revolution and the good and bad aspects of it .
5 #### " Winds " is a magnificent saga of the Henry family and their friends and associates told against a backdrop of the world events leading up to the USA 's entry to WWII . Navy Captain Victor " Pug " Henry travels the world doing odd jobs for FDR while Germany invades Poland , overruns France , and fights England and Russia . In the meantime , FDR keeps the USA out of the war . After rubbing elbows with Churchill , Stalin , and Hitler , Pug finally finishes up his tasks for FDR and heads to Hawaii to command a battleship . All Pug really ever wanted was a sea command , a decent shot at flag rank , and good lives for his family . Wait a minute --- Hawaii ? Is n't that where Pearl Harbor is ? When I read " The Caine Mutiny " , I thought I had read Wouk 's best . Despite the rather narrower scope of " Caine " , I still feel that way . Do n't miss this one though , it 's great .
5 #### I had a hard time , putting the book down to do some work . Wonderfully written , great characters and the . Best plot .
4 #### " The Winds of War " and " War and Remembrance " must be read together . These lengthy novels follow the trials and travails of one American family through the years immediately preceeding the Second World War through to the end of that war . The author does a great job of depicting the terrors of the holocaust and of the ground war on Europe 's eastern front . Likewise pacific naval combat is dealt with on a personal level . The historical context of the books seemed to be quite accurate . By the close of the second book the reader will have an appreciation for the cost of global war . Personally , I could have done with somewhat less of the romantic double - dealings and intrigue . My only other caution to the prospective reader is the daunting length of these books . I listened to the unabridged Audible Audio version of both books and found the narration to be excellent .
4 #### Third time reading-- still a great book . I always find a new point . I am old enough to remember the start and end .
5 #### I try to read anything written by this author and this book did not disappoint . His character development is clear and the timelines are consistant with the historical events he refers to in the story . Overall entertaining and , as with his other books , hold your attention . My one complaint would be that it takes almost the entire book for the obvious to be stated by the main characters .
4 #### Herman Wouk has a way with words and characterizations . The historical events and issues that lead to the U.S. entry into World War II are woven into the Henry family , a military clan that the father ( Pug ) characterizes as tumbleweeds blown around by the wind . I found this very enjoyable .
5 #### I received my first copy of The Prophet a million years ago when I was a somewhat precocious 12 year old . I still have that copy . Now , I find young people who I believe will benefit from these writings and pass it along . Probably best first offered at ages 14 - 16 and certainly at any age beyond . I must admit , I do n't understand the new cover ; the original was so much more appropriate . Thankfully , the text remains intact . Gibran has been quoted so often that , to some , parts may seem oddly familiar ; like an overused catch phrase . However , in context , Gibran 's thoughts remain utterly profound . Like biblical text that one reads and re - reads , one is challenged by the understandings that Gibran 's writings promote and that can only be achieved through experience over time . Definitely a treasured companion .
5 #### This work still holds up decades later . Every reflective , thoughtful person should have The Prophet in the home library . It can be read one chapter at a time . The chapter on love is as good as anything I 've ever read .
5 #### Kahlil Gibran - touchs the heart , the soul and the mind . Beautiful words that comfort and guide . If only more people would read his work , if you can call it work , Wonderful writing but the publisher ( as many seem to do these days ) get very artistic and print too faintly - the letters are pale grey and very difficult to read . It is n't the writing it 's the publisher at fault . The printers should realize that the entire purpose of the printed word is to let people READ it .
5 #### The Prophet is one of those books that you refer to often over the years . And to have it on my Kindle , so I can take it anywhere , is a real treat !
5 #### This is a nice text of aphorisms separated by leafy diagrams inside . The text also includes black and white original paintings by Gibran on individual pages . Khalil Gibran 's work is always outstanding , and this is one of the best from what I have read . It 's also a nice size hardback , and not very long , but very deep and revealing in deceptively simple lines . I think these hardbacks are some of the nicest volumes of Gibran 's that have been printed . I would rank Sand and Foam as one of his best .
4 #### This is one of few versions of this book which was available through Amazon Prime , which included all the normal book contents . Check my other reviews to help you identify the two of 5 that I ordered which were incomplete ! The true , real book is wondweful and you need one , but make sure you do n't order or give one as a gift , which is incomplete . DanC
1 #### Please do n't order this particular publication of " The Prophet " . It is a poor reproduction , which is missing one of the most important components ; the " Table of Contents " . This is a book of prose with very close ties to each of the " Chapters " listed in the contents . It will be very disappointing to purchase a copy , without the reference to each chapter and it 's title . Look at my other warnings , as this is the second of 5 different versions which Amazon Prime has sold & shipped to me , with this missing component . The original book " The Prophet " is priceless , but it is very important to have the " Table of Contents " . Ask Amazon for specifics and make sure the book is in it 's original form ! DanC
1 #### This book is a very poor copy of the original , and is missing at the very least ; the " Table of Contents " . In this book , each verse of prose should be separated and numbered , listed clearly in a table of contents ( in the front of the book . ) This publisher and Amazon neglected to proof read these copies and are selling you an incomplete book . WARNING -- DO NOT ORDER THIS BOOK ! ! ! ! It 's value is highly reduced , without having a contents for quick reference , so as to aid in quickly turning to a relevant chapters , poor for sharing or for personal comfort . Very sad indeed ! ! ! Sincerely , DanC
5 #### I just ca n't help but love every novel in this series . They are written so well and are page turners , start to finish .
5 #### This book takes you forward into the lives of the people that you have begun to love . So entertaining . Great books to make a series .
4 #### This is the fifth novel in the series that I read . It is interesting as a continuum of the family history and inter - relationships . The background history of the period is very interesting . The only criticism that if you have read the novels in sequence , the beginning is somewhat boring / redundant . At any rate I love the series , the authors writing and after a short break I will finish the series .
5 #### The haves and have nots still exists today , but the struggle to begin change is evident here . The intense cruelty of those who have made a step up the ladder , on those they perceive to be inferior . They are also jealous of those them deem to be above , leads to great conflict of wills .
5 #### I was fascinated with the proper speech , with the slang , and with the era of this wonderful book . A clash of social levels , of the educated , of the poor , but honesty , good deeds and love wins out , finally ! Life has all the same things now , just a different set of characters . I recommend this book to those who enjoy history and values .
5 #### I enjoyed the BBC production , but the book is ten times better . The subtleties of each character 's personality , the beautiful language , the natural way in which faith is discussed , and the witty , satisfying ending are only a few of the reasons this novel is on my " favorites " list .
5 #### What can I say ? Easily one of the best victorian romance stories out there .
4 #### I enjoyed the way this book gave me a glimpse of how the war affected a family . Pug Henry is a character you find your self rooting for . I could have done without some of the other characters . Good solid read .
5 #### Winds of War is unusual as the emphasis of the book is on the characters as opposed to the battles . The momentous events of the war and many of its greater personalities blow around our main characters and take them from country to country , from embassy to embassy , and from shore to sea duty . It has everything from meaningful romance to historic input by an ordinary but highly skilled naval officer who happened to be in the right place at the right time and whose input had a major effect on major events . I 've been reading this book for many years from paperback to hardback to Kindle . It 's one of my all - time favorites and I recommend it highly .
5 #### This is really a good book and I would recommend it to anyone . Especially history and war buffs . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### Herman Wouk used all the elements of a great epic family tale to present an accurate history of the Second World War , or the latest Thirty Year War as he implies . He has his protaganist visit all of the historical leaders and capitals during the lead up to US entry so that we can look at the interests of each country . I expecially enjoyed his fictiitous German generals post war memoirs of the German reasoning and strategy towards uniting Europe . I 've read a lot of interesting books in this area and this is " as good as it gets " . I will soon move on to War and Rememberance . It is nice to be retired and have the chance to catch up on the storys that I wanted to read years ago .
5 #### This is an epic fact - fiction WWII novel , something like War & Peace . Wouk makes his characters come to life . Robert Mitchem played the main role of Pug Henry in the TV series based on this book , and he was a good choice . Wouk , at 97 , lives today in Palm Springs .
5 #### THS IS A GREAT BOOK ABOUT THE CAUSE AND EFFECTS OF THE WORLD SITUATION THAT LED TO THE 2ND WORLD WWAR . i BELEIVE THAT EVERYYOUNG PERSON TODAY SHOULD READ THIS BOOK AND FOLLOW UP WITH wAR AND REMEMBERANCE
5 #### I could n't be happier . I had this book many years ago and lost it . And this copy is in almost perfect condition .
5 #### I lost my own copy when I moved some years ago and decided I just had to have a copy of my own again . It 's so beautiful in its ' descriptions of life !
5 #### Have had this particular book for many years . I have given it to family and friends . Especially young woman . For me , it put life in proper perspective and especially helpful when both my children moved to Europe . Think there is something for everyone .
5 #### Love to become so engrossed in a book- Winston Graham has a way with words that are so beautiful .
5 #### Great series and great author . I watched the television series based on the first couple of these novels on PBS and could n't wait to find out what happened next . Graham is a master of suspense and his use of well - chosen details put you right in the scene he is describing .
5 #### I THINK THESE BOOKS ARE SO GOOD , I AM GRADUALLY WORKING MY WAY THROUGH THEM . I THINK THEY SHOULD BE OFFERED AT A BETTER PRICE FOR READING THEM ALL , THE AUTHOR HAS A GREAT EMPATHY WITH HIS SUBJECTS SO I AM JUST ON THE 6TH BOOK IN THE SERIES " FOUR SWANS " GOOD TO FIND A WRITER YOU CAN IDENTIFY WITH .
5 #### Thorughly enjoyed this book . It is the 5th in a series of 12 books . If you were lucky enough to catch the TV show when it aired last year , this book will help answer questions as to what happens to our hero Ross Poldark . I plan to finish the series and am already sad to think I will be coming to the end . Series 2 of the show is being released in Britain in Sep 16 . Expect the books to gain lots of new fans . Winston Graham is a masterful story teller .
5 #### I started on these books after watching the newest TV version of Poldark . I love to read , and these books have become my all time favorites ! The writing is outstanding . You fall in love with the characters . The story is fast moving , no dull and boring parts . I sit down to read for a bit and find myself unable to put it down . I an so very glad there are so many of them . I never want them to end !
5 #### I will read the Poldark stories until I 've completed the set ; very well written and just the right amount of suspense , intrigue and romance .
1 #### I did n't read this but needed to undo the previous post which got put here instead for a movie I had reviewed . Amazon does n't offer a way to delete a review .
5 #### I recently bought this edition along with War & Remembrance as a gift to my retiring assistant who herself worked for the Dept of the Navy more than 30 years . I read the book years ago , and would recommend it to anyone without hesitation .
5 #### splendid story telling . The history is fairly close the truth . This is my second read through although it had been something like twenty years since the first time . There is more than enough detail that it made it a please to reread .
5 #### This was my second reading of this book . Although it is fiction , it seems to be factually accurate . Great book
5 #### I 'd heard so much about this book , and all of it rang true . This is a truly epic , classic American story lined with history , intrigue and wisdom . You 'll love it - male , female , young or old .
5 #### Wouk 's writing is so approachable ; you get to know the main characters very well in a thousand pages ! The inclusion of an Axis commentary on WWII is brilliant . For those of us ' boomers ' that were born right after the War , the book is reminiscent of the stories which with we were raised .
4 #### I really enjoyed this story about the Henry family before and during the outbreak of WWII I found it to be a compelling read and kept my interest .
5 #### Really a great book presented by a great actress .
5 #### I liked how historical events were molded into the story
3 #### I think it 's a very good book , but it seemed unnecessarily long , hence the three stars . The length is not surprising and is forgivable given the fact that it was a serialization .
5 #### Residing in my mind are the words of a true poet . I was given the book THE PROPHET by my best friend when I was young . It has followed me through my life and has filled me with the emotions and practical thought I needed to guide me through the smooth and rough waters of my life . I gave this copy of Kahil Gibran 's book to a young lady with the hope she will enjoy it the rest of her life . Thank you Amazon for having this wonderful work of art available to all .
5 #### I have heard much about this book and finally decided to read it . Wow ! I could not put it down . A must for everybody seeking truth and poetry .
1 #### This book is n't the truth - This book is Not the word of God - This man was a son of a pastor , but worshipped a profit , not God - Do your homework on him . The Bible is the truth . Do n't be misled by what this book tells you .
1 #### This man was a son of a pastor , but worshipped a profit , not God - Do your homework on him . The Bible is the truth . Do n't be misled by what this book tells you . This quote is from Wikipedia - Thompson reported Gibran later saying that all the way through writing " Jesus , the Son of Man " , he thought of ` Abdu'l - Bah&aacute ; . Years later , after the death of ` Abdu'l - Bah&aacute ; , at a viewing of a movie of ` Abdu'l - Bah&aacute ; , Gibran rose to talk and proclaimed in tears an exalted station of ` Abdu'l - Bah&aacute ; and left the event weeping . A noted scholar on Gibran is Suheil Bushrui from Gibran 's native Lebanon , also a Bah&aacute;'&iacute ; , published more than one volume about him and serves as the Kahlil Gibran Chair for Values and Peace at the University of Maryland and winner of the Juliet Hollister Awards from the Temple of Understanding . Abdu'l - Bah&aacute ; ' ( Arabic : ; 23 May 1844 - 28 November 1921 ) , born ` Abb&aacute;s Effend&iacute ; , was the eldest son of Bah&aacute;'u'll&aacute;h,[1 ] the founder of the Bah&aacute;'&iacute ; Faith .
1 #### This book is n't the truth - This book is Not the word of God - This man was a son of a pastor , but worshipped a profit , not God - Do your homework on him . The Bible is the truth . Do n't be misled by what this book tells you .
4 #### For one who would prefer Truth coming from a source other than the King James Version , " The Prophet " is written with the voice of wisdom and the beauty of poetry . If there is a Black and White ' Truth , ' one could easily seek it here in almost all the verses .
5 #### I had this book before and lost it when I moved and I just love it touches my soul and gives me perspective on life .
5 #### Such a classic book ; deep wisdom in a very readable container . The Prophet has always been a favorite , and I wanted to give a copy to my brother . The book is great for just picking up and reading a page or two . I had the opportunity to read a passage at my wedding ceremony .
5 #### It 's not often that I find a series that holds my interest . Such a great story .
5 #### I 'm loving this series . I 'm on book 7 and already dreading finishing the last book . Love the new BBC series as well -- that 's how I got started on the books .
5 #### I love the Poldark series . Ca n't wait to start reading the next book . I 'm hating George more and more ! Ca n't wait to see what happens next
5 #### Herman Wouk is a master story teller with the gift of getting a reader involved from the outset . His characterizations and plot are rock solid . The back set of the Second World War and the days preceding the involvement of the United States in the war are woven in with its fictional family the Henry 's . With out being a spoiler I can say the book is masterfully written from start to finish .
3 #### Interesting premise and generally historically accurate , particularly for a novel . Some archaic wording , but of course this was written in the literary style of a half century ago . Wouk could have left out the romance parts , which is clearly not his strong suit , but I 'd recommend this book as an easy yet informative read .
5 #### I recalled this being a mini series from when I was 8 years old , and all of the hoopla surrounding it . I can still remember , from my youth , Robert Mitchum , dressed in his Navy outfit as the epic music played . As someone absolutely infatuated with United States history , I knew that this was something that I needed to read . I was actually absolutely shocked at how I fell in love with the characters in this book . I am also amazed at how much I learned regarding United States and their involvement in World War II . This book has a little bit of everything romance , action , historical intrigue , and insight that you can barely get from any other book . This book follows the family of Victor Henry , a naval commander , with three children . The children branch out and each have their own story to tell . From the United States , to the Soviet Union , Poland , to Italy and beyond . This story takes you all over the globe , and that you find yourself caring about each and every one of the characters . This book will give you incredible insight into the lives of historical figures such as Adolf Hitler , Benito Mussolini , Franklin Roosevelt , Winston Churchill , Joseph Stalin , and others . Some readers complain that the Kindle version is glitchy . That must have been fixed because I had no problems at all . I just ordered War and Remembrance and I ca n't wait to start !
5 #### I rally enjoyed this book because the fictional story line was very interesting , and the historical background was fascinating . I was a teenager during the second world war so have some recollection of events , but this book brought the time into real focus and presented some of the world political figures in a different way than I had envisioned them previiously . The author is Jewish and cerrtainly brings to light the terrible injustices of that time .
5 #### The Winds of War & War & Remembrance I watched this great movie on DVD .And look forward to reading this book .
4 #### I just finished the first volume of the trilogy and am started on the second . I enjoy Jakes ' writing style and choice of vocabulary which fits the historical period even if obsolete for today . I am reading a volume and then watching the disc with my wife . Jakes ' main characters run the gamut of human emotions , displaying both the laudable and shocking sides of human nature . He dares to display the culture of that time and today 's politically correct may find his descriptions offensive . If you do not live in a pretend world , it is an intersting depiction of the civil war era .
4 #### Good writing but just a little too long and too much detail for me . However , author seemed very knowledgeable . Will read more by this author but down the road !
5 #### Very much in the style of Jane Austen but a little more political . The leading man , Mr. Thornton is very Darcy - esq in his strong misunderstood but highly romantic nature . Love love love it !
4 #### This book has great charcterations . The story follows the historical situation in the North and the South prior to and leading up to the Civl War . It includes many aspects , conflicts in emotions that people would have had concerning the slavery problems at that period of time .
4 #### Enjoyable read though a bit dense on the political strife of unions and manufacturers .
5 #### I am happy to add Gibran 's classic work to my personal collection . Recommended reading for everyone . Book arrived in perfect condition .
5 #### A WONDERFUL BOOK FULL OF BEAUTY MEANT TO BE READ OVER AND OVER . YOU WILL NEED QUIET AROUND YOU TO LET ALL HIS WORDS ABSORB .
5 #### Jubran Kahlil Jubran had a teacher make a mistake on his name and wrote down ' Kahlil Gibran ' as when he arrived here from Lebanon which was still part of the Ottoman Empire he went by Gibran Kahlil Gibran . His poetry is as timeless as his view towards life and the world at large - everyone was his friend ! One passage " Half of what I say is meaningless , but I say it so that the other half may reach you " was used by John Lennon in the white album on a tune called " Julia " .
5 #### I discovered The Prophet fifty years ago in college and have read it dozens of times since then . Now , in addition to my beat up hard copy , I have a portable e - copy . If you were looking for an example of an intelligently designed ( pun intended ) book of spiritual guidance , this would be it . It does n't care how you picture , name or define " God " or whether you give him a gender and a personality . It just cuts to the heart of how to live and how to relate to others . If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book , it might come out like this . When I first read it , I found some passages difficult to grasp . Looking back , I now think that it was not because they were hard to understand , but because I did not want to hear gently spoken , intelligently phrased ideas that contradicted my own . Now , if I could have only one book , this would probably be it .
5 #### Read The Prophet in college and now my college kids have discovered it ! In fact my daughter and her new hubby used quotes in their marriage ceremony . Fun to rediscover and share the book .
5 #### This is a book I wanted in my library . My original copy is yellowed and worn . This is the one book ( other than the Bible ) that I continue to re - read .
5 #### One of the two best books ( fiction ) ever written on WWII . The other being War and Remembrance . Mr. Wouk is one of the great writers of our time .
5 #### PLEASE read this book and you will never never forget it . You will be so grateful it was written and that you found it ! It truly is a life - changing read ! ! ! Ah the romance-- the grandeur -- the history that we " kinda " thought we knew -- it all comes together -- and the characters are simply my all - time favorites -- and I am a READER ! !
4 #### The way that Herman Wouk winds tangential stories from the family and friends of Victor Henry , the main character , is highly compelling . His inclusion of a purported work of history , which on its own offers questions about how we interpret history , as written by a Nazi officer and translated by Victor Henry is brilliant . I will continue to ponder the picture of the Axis as a chimera , as described in the work of history .
4 #### This is such a great tome of a novel on the global events leading up to WWII and great characters that you are rooting for . But one must have a lot of patience to get through the entire thing ... and know that it is just book 1 of 2 ! I still recommend it though .
5 #### Poldark fans will enjoy the continuing saga . The excitement of the first four novels builds to a greater crescendo as beloved characters fight both historical forces and new and returning foes .
4 #### The fifth in the Poldark series by Winston Graham continues to propel me on to read through book 12 .
5 #### Wish there were 25 Poldark books , no , 50 , no , wish they never would end ! !
5 #### Just as good as the previous novels ; ca n't wait to begin the next one .
5 #### I have seen the movie , and I wanted to read the book . All I can really say , very informative , and an excellent read ! Enjoy and remember ! ! ! ! Joannie :)
4 #### Herman Wouk is a fantastic writer . I read The Winds of War and War and Remembrance when I was a young woman . I am enjoying the book just as much the second time around .
5 #### War and Remembrance and Winds of War are the best examples of historical fiction I know of ; both of these books should be required reading in high school when students learn about WWII . The only thing missing is a companion reader that would include maps of the campaigns , battles and engagements along with some other short narratives of the events .
5 #### Winds of War is the fictional account of the family Henry and their adventures from 1938 through Pearl Harbor . Captain Pug Henry , a career Naval Officer is sent to Germany to serve as Naval Attache in Berlin . There he meets all the big players , Hitler , Goering et al . He predicts the Stalin - Hitler non - agression pact and gets called to the White House . There Roosevelt gives him an informal assignment that keeps him involved in myriad interesting developments leading up to the invasion of Poland , then France , the Battle of Britain , and the invasion of Russia . Meanwhile , his son Brian , in Italy working for a Jewish author falls in love with the beautiful Jewish - American niece who was engaged to an American diplomat , who happens to be serving in Warsaw ... naturally Brian and Natalie are visiting her old friend Slote in Warsaw when the Germans attack . Meanwhile ... well you get the point . A popular miniseries was made of this book and its sequel , War and Remembrance . This book is VERY historically accurate . All the events are true , and one of the Henrys or their acquaintances are involved in one or more of them . This is a great read . Brilliantly told , we work through the great events through the experiences of the characters .
5 #### I read this in hard - copy when it was first published . During several moves , I have lost the book . I decided to get the Kindle edition and I am thrilled to read this wonderful author again . I found the sequel ' War and Remembrance ' in the last move and will read that . This is a long novel but well worth the time . Although fiction , it involved historical figures that give it a real - life experience quality . The fictional characters are fully developed and it is easy to visualize their life during the run up to World War II . It is definitely a cautionary tale in today 's world where most of us have the tendency to bury our heads in sand -- or in family and work -- and hope things will get better without doing anything ourselves . Great read . I 'm still on the second half ( because this is really two volumes ) and even knowing the end , I 'm rooting for Natalie and Aaron to get back home .
5 #### This " story " is really amazing . The way it 's told , the language the author uses , the character development , the accuracy of millions of facts and lastly , but most importantly , the way this book filled with facts reads like a really good novel ! I 'm never bored and always left wondering . I 'm learning more now than ever before ( and my undergraduate minor was in history ) ! !
5 #### Not much that I can add that has not been said many times . A classic that has stood the test of time and finding new fans every year . Family , drama , sex , murder lust and love done at it 's best .
5 #### I 've never seen the BBC adaption so I ca n't compare this classic with it but I know I 've been recommended both many times over the years . I much preferred the male characters John Thornton , Mr Bell and Higgins in this novel , they showed such sterling qualities in their own way . Marvellous contrast between the lush and gentle countryside , way of life to the robust , bustling , industrialised Milton . A " steadfast " romance but by the end of the journey for Margaret Hale and John Thornton I really wanted more .
5 #### I was introduced to North and South by the incredible BBC adaptation . The book , reminiscent of Pride and Predijice and Jane Eyre does not disappoint . It provides a vivid portrait of the times and an engrossing love story . It is long and the pace is slow , yet the ending leaves you wishing for more .
4 #### A really enjoyable and engaging book . It relys a little on coincidence to drive the plot here and there but it does n't detract from the pleasure of reading . It highlighted the difference between northern industrial areas in the mill towns and southern rural living with episodes also placed in London society . The attitudes of the time are well drawn and interesting to compare with modern thinking . Recommended !
2 #### I know it 's a classic ... it 's just . so . boring . At one point the main male - lead is admiring the main female - lead . Specifically , her nostrils . Yes ... who does n't want their fine nostrils admired ? I suppose on that front it was good for a laugh ?
4 #### I have enjoyed all the Poldark books . This was was a little darker than the others I have read , but still a great read . Good history , good characters , well drawn . No perfect people in this book which makes for a much more interesting read .
5 #### Elizabeth and George Warleggan have been married for over a year when their son Valentine(a sickly lad who suffers from rickets and other ailments ) . Elizabeth , the former lover of Ross Polkdark , is already the mother of one son Geoffrey Charles sired by her late husband Francis ( a cousin of Ross Poldark ) . The child is born during a total eclipse of the moon which in Cornish folklore was thought to cause bad luck . Meanwhile , Ross and Demelza celebrate the birth of a new daughter . Morwenna Chynewith the daughter of a dean and a Polkdark cousin is hired to be the tutor of little Georffrey Charles . she falls in love with Demelza 's miner brother named Drake Carne . However , she is being coerced into giving her hand in marriage to a feckless clergyman who is a widower with two children Ross goes to France in order to rescue his friend surgeon Dwight Enys who is being held by the Napoleonic regime following a deadly sea battle . Dwight was at the time serving as a ship surgeon . His fianc&eacute ; Carolyn does everything she can to aid in his rescue .. This soap opera plot takes place in Cornwall in 1794 - 95 . Winston Graham is very good at spinning a good yarn ; painting beautiful poetic descriptions of the change of seasons in Cornwall and drawing complex characters whom you learn to love . The entire series is well worth reading .
5 #### This is a wonderful book by Kahlil Gibran . It takes you back to a different time and place which is pleasing . It is a comfort book , relaxing your spirit . The seller was prompt with delivery .
5 #### This is an amazingly beautiful book . The writings are spiritual and absolutely beautiful . They cover almost every aspect of life and provide inspiring , poetic and though - provoking words in answer to questions raised about them . When my mother passed away , I read this book over and over again . Many use the chapter on marriage as part of their wedding vows . My daughter asked me to read that chapter to her and her husband as part of their wedding ceremony . I can not think of a better way to spend $ 10.00 . You will more than get your money 's worth even if you only read one chapter in the book .
5 #### This was my favorite book when i was 19 ! So I purchased it for my 19 yr old granddaughter . Hope she loves it as much as I do !
4 #### Long , but worth the time . The author provides an historial account of WWII that headlines or history books of that period could not provide . He personalizes that period by following a family as they deal with the everchanging landscape of war .
3 #### A good book but i did n't know there is a sequel . I do n't think I would have bought the first one .
5 #### Winds of War is a truly great work . I enjoyed it immensely and can see why Herman Wouk won a Pulitzer for it .
5 #### Wouk 's The Winds of War is a wonderful piece of historical fiction . Following the Henry family in their international travels in the lead up to World War II , the author 's extensive research enables him to use this familial narrative as a context for providing the reader with a history of the events that lead up to the break out of WW II . The characters are unpredictable and realistically three - dimensional . The book was so good , I eagerly took up its sequel War and Remembrance the moment I finished it . Highly recommended .
5 #### Have read this book several times and never seem to tire of it . The characters are so very well drawn and the time / era has ever been fascinating to me . Wouk captures the sights , sounds and smells of those days perfectly . His interaction between ' his ' characters and actual persons of the time is flawless . A terrific historical introduction to the times , how people felt , things that were done . It 's a masterpiece in my estimation .
5 #### One of the few books that I universally recommend and that I have never had someone tell me they were disapointed .
5 #### Finally read this book after all these years . It is probably the best fiction book on WWII that I have ever read . It was a slow read for me as I kept going back and looking up the facts of this war through out the book . Good characters , descriptions , flow , etc .. everything you need for an excellent novel .
4 #### Well written , acted and filmed . Great story lines and you 'll learn history along the way ! Each of the Henry 's are intriguing and Wouk makes you care about them and those they love !
5 #### I have watched the series often because it is one of my favorites . As happens often the book is so much richer and sweeter , although I still consider the TV series one of my favorites . An excellent read that takes you into the center of another world , at another time !
5 #### My favorite story about the civil war . I love anything John Jakes writes . Very historical .
5 #### Fabulous writing and beautiful use of the English language , not to mention a riveting love story set in the industrial age in northern England . Do n't miss this one .
5 #### i really enjoyed the book and the especially the character development .
4 #### The author introduced a variety of new characters in this book . I was partial to Ross and Demelza 's story and missed them in the first half of the book . However , it all came together in the end . I especially appreciated getting to know the thought processes and inner workings / struggles of Demelza and Elizabeth .
5 #### I am thoroughly enjoying reading through the Poldark series .
5 #### Basically I can not get enough of Poldark . My cousin who has read the whole series says everything you need to know about life is in Poldark . Having read only the first book at the time I did n't quite understand what she meant , but having completed number 5 I now do . Yes there is a story line with good vs bad , yes there is wonderful description of the countryside which is absolutely transporting , yes there are characters who come and go with their own little storylines . but above all that is the questioning , the pondering on some of life 's big questions - religion , politics , economics , cultural status . Do n't look for answers - this series is not that straightforward , but you will see your own deepest beliefs and values tucked away in this book from time to time and recognise your own unanswered questions . I am just grateful that Winston Graham had enough stamina and imagination to keep writing for 12 books !
4 #### Enough already with the distracting Kindle version typos ! Otherwise , a highly readable account of the eve and first years of WWII . The improbabilities are outweighed by the author`s sweeping command of history .
5 #### Really ... I'm old enough to remember when this was first published ! Maybe I should be grateful that I read it at a mature age , I probably appreciated it more . The Winds of War and War and Rememberance ( which I also read and give 5 stars to ) are the story of a fictional American family , a Navy family , and their lives during the run up to WWII and during the war itself . I have read a great deal about WWII , both fiction and non fiction , and this is a great work . The narrative is beautiful , the characters are written with great depth and insight ( male and female , civilian and military alike ) and the story spans the entire globe . There is n't a dull moment . What is amazing about the story is how well the personal trials and tribulations of the Henry clan are woven into the world history that is unfolding . Joy , love , death , betrayal , and all of it beautifully told . Wouk is a brilliant writer and a wonderful story teller .
1 #### Extremely insulting that no one ever proof reads books after conversion to kindle format . While the kindle edition appears to have undergone some clean up after so many negative reviews for a chapter to have " Bearl Barbor " as the title is beyond belief . There are many other conversion errors with improper character recognition but I did not track those . A few problems with hyphenation also remain where the printed edition used hyphenation as a means to word / line wrap but the after conversion to kindle the hyphen is no longer appropriate since the line wrap occurs at a different point in the line . There are a few graphics from the printed version also scanned into the kindle edition and therefore of poor quality . Can only imagine how bad War and Remembrance kindle edition must be since that title has been unavailable for many months while awaiting correction .
5 #### This book , and it 's companion , " War and Remembrance " are two of my favorite novels of WWII . I read / re - read them about every ten years . I find them exceptionally well written with clearly drawn characters who enter the traumic period of Western civilization 's march through the use of the industrial model for the destruction of millions of people and an end to traditional European colonial powers . I find myself caring about the characters , their losses , and how they delt with a world bent on destruction ; characters trying to balance traditional values while creating new beginnings from the ashes of a world focused on self - destruction and death . I have read most of Mr. Wouk 's books and have been a fan of his writings for many years . You will not be disappointed .
4 #### Natalie needs to be slapped back to reality . She is a dolt from the very start . Could a guy be buddies with Franklin , Winston , Stalin and Adolf ? No . I doubt he could even meet them in such a short frame of time . The love story between Pug and Pam .... Great Byron and Natalie .......... boring Worth the read , though .
2 #### This is a wonderful book and a terrific follow up to The Winds of War . The poor rating is solely because the Kindle edition has loads of typos that significantly detract from the reader 's enjoyment .
3 #### Let me start by saying I am a Herman Wouk Fan . I love the Caine Mutiny and even like this book very much as well as War and Rememberance . I like the historical research done to support as the framework for these books . I like how he has created a character like Pug Henry that interacts with the key leaders and players of WWII during critical times . Excellent military detail . Now the bad . Take the Jastrows , Rhoda and Briny and punch them all in the face until they are no longer stupid one dimensional characters . I realize that they exist to make poor decisions so that we can see the resulting evil of the Nazi 's , but come on . It is almost as if Wouk does not respect his female characters , they are so shallow and predictable . I have no use for Rhoda Henry , who is really just an elitist , Hoe . Her husband toils and works his ass off , but she just ca n't rationalize enough for her own happiness . I ca n't believe that Natalie is an intellectual and brilliant , making some of the dumbest remarks and decisions in the book , just to be petulant and have her own way . Byron , Briny , just needs his ass kicked and told to man up . What a baby . Anyway , for historical research , excellent , for shallow , selfish , petulant characters , thunbs down .
5 #### Great writing about children , being sons and daughters of life longing to be themselves . This was a great chapter for my sons .
5 #### I stumbled onto this book , and it opened my mind and began my process of becoming aware . Then I went across country to collect my deceased Grandmother 's belongings . One item was this book . I opened the the cover and saw that Grandma had lent it out to her friends and they all had signed it . One person who had signed it was my Mom , who had died years before before my Grandma . I 'm going to buy it for my little arrow now . 4th generation of passing it on .
5 #### This book transcends all religions , and explains the many questions we have about life through what seems like a channeled spiritual source . This book is not long , but says so much is so few words . Highly recommended ! !
5 #### Needed to read this and could not find my old copy , so bought a new copy and it still helps me when I need to remember what is inside this lovely collection of wisdom !
5 #### I read this book when I was 16 , and 50 years later , I still go back to this book all the time , and have memorized most of the passages . The Prophet changed my life . I was pretty amazed to find a garden that sits across from the Vice President 's house in Washington DC , honoring Kahlil Gibran and the great work he wrote . Obviously , I have not been the only one transformed by his messages .
3 #### The first one was the masterpiece while this book is just the wrapper . The bulk of Gibran 's truths are in the original Prophet .
4 #### Great book ; I shared with my co - workers and have n't gotten it back yet so everyone at work is enjoying the book as much as I did ....
5 #### I had been an avid viewer of the mini - series when it came out years ago , and recently had the opportunity to re - visit it via the book . As fantastic as the series was , the book does not disappoint . I very highly recommend it !
5 #### I loved this book , and really did n't want it to end . Just as good , if not better than the miniseries . In fact , I did n't even KNOW this was a book until doing a little research . When I found out that the miniseries was based on this book , I snapped it up immediately . As others have mentioned , the beginning is a bit slow and tedious , but it 's so worth it to push forward to the real meat and potatoes of the rest of the story .
5 #### I 'm interested in history and while some of the story is fictional , I felt that I learned much about that time in our nation 's history .
4 #### Good read , cared about the characters , learned more about the history of the beginning of the Civil War .
5 #### Excellent story . Lots of good historical information of the industrial revolution in England with a delightful romance to round it out .
5 #### This is the best book I have read in a long time . It gives a great historical account of the early years of WWII that is completely factual , save for the fictional characters Wouk inserts . This book is a page - turner , yet still allows the reader to gain excellent information about real events and circumstances in the war . Wouk shapes his characters so fully that it makes it easy for the reader to empathize with them , yet without any unnecessary detail . I feel this book is a great compromise for people who are interested in world events yet still enjoy a riveting fictional story .
5 #### This is a very readable and engrossing book , which also gives an excellent overview of the origins and beginning of World War II .
5 #### This is a 5 - star book that should read by anybody with an interest in WW II . The comments and complaints regarding sexism and poor female characters ... well the book was published in 1971 . Compare it to some of the other fiction being published at the time ... Ian Fleming , John MacDonald , Robert Heinlein . Wouk comes of pretty well in comparison to those authors , I think , especially as his subject is war . Despite this , Wouk still constructs some fascinating female characters ... and not all of them are brilliant , easy to sympathize with , or even very smart . But then again , neither are the men . It 's a long story , a bit melodramatic at times , will infuriate you , and bring tears to your eyes . Which was what Wouk set out to accomplish .
4 #### The next in the series featuring the characters we came to love in previous books . The story does not repeat the old stories but allows the characters to grow in age and emotion as it progresses . If I have a criticism it would be that some of the war and seafaring adventures go on a bit long .
5 #### The entire series is excellent . Graham writes as if he lived in that era . His understanding of men 's and women 's emotions is unbelievable . I am reading all of the books for the second time . George Warleggan is the perfect villain , and Ross Poldark the hero who is himself not too perfect to be believable . Demelza is such a wonderful character , so rich and earthy , full of love and empathy . Elizabeth is tragic . I have n't read anything so satisfying in years .
4 #### I got hooked on this series but disappointed in Valentine 's character . He did n't ask to be their love child but has to bear their sins . You can see that coming . He instinctlvely knows he 's Ross ' son and I think he should 've been more of a hero , but it kept my interest and I liked it until I realized if a character does something bad , he is punished usually by death . That lesson got a little old .
5 #### Another great story by Elizabeth Haskell ! Similar in plot to Pride and Prejudice but set in a more industrial setting . Very well written and interesting .
2 #### I saw a list of Best Novels of the 19th Century and found I had read the first 31 listed and this was no . 32 so I decided to read it . I had read Cranford on 8 Apr 1956 and Mary Barton on 21 Aug 2002 and liked both . But North and South is very ploddingly written and all things proceed at a snail 's pace as the ' heroine ' , Margaret Hale , moves from a lovely southern rural community to a northern England manufacturing town , where she meets Mr. Thornton . For pages they interact adversely but finally there comes a time when there is some excitement and tenseness . But it quickly dies away and the story plods on and on and not till the very end do we learn that the expected conclusion indeed occurs . I found the book a failure and its insight into profound sociological facts is very limited .
4 #### It 's always hard reviewing a long , chunkster book , because so much happens . I try to just share my general thoughts about it as compared to a more formal review . 1 . The book is well written , and the style is engaging , though the plot does get a little slow at times ( especially when reading characters you do n't really like , which often happens with a large multi - volume series like this one . You ca n't possibly be interested in following every single character 's whole life in great detail ) . Especially towards the end , I did tend myself skimming through long passages with characters whining about the same thing for the tenth time in so many minutes . 2 . The characters are very , very two dimensional , but I think Jakes does it on purpose . The " good " characters are very very good , and the " bad " characters are very , very bad . No one in real life is that one sided , but I think Jakes does it to make a point . It does get frustrating after a while . 3 . I 'm not big into romance & there 's a tiny smidge of it here , as characters meet and fall in love . There are some sex scenes but most are rather brief .
4 #### Gives good insight into the issues of the day and the horrendous impact that resulted . Well written ; entertaining .
5 #### Elizabeth Gaskell is my favorite author . I loved North and South but would have to say that " Ruth " is the best of her books .
5 #### " The Winds of War " is a bona fide 5 STAR book if there ever was one ! It is the Gold Standard of historical fiction of World War II . Some folks decided to trash the book based on an apparently highly flawed Kindle version or some badly mangled used books . These were not literary criticisms and the people probably should have sought an alternative method to register their valid complaints . Diluting the considered comments and thoughtful ratings of ( people judging ) the substance of the book is not fair to the author or to prospective readers . This book takes the reader on a sweeping historical journey from events leading up America 's involvement in the war . Our protagonist , US Naval Captain Victor " Pug " Henry , has a large adult extended family which is spread out across the globe and this allows Wouk to deal with pre - war Nazi Germany , the blitzkrieg of Poland , the Battle of Britain , Italy , Stalin in Russia and finally Pearl Harbor . The characters and storyline are so good it leaves you aching for more . And he delivers " more " with the sequel , " War and Remembrance " . For wonderful thought - provoking entertainment and a history lesson all rolled into one , these 2 books are the best you can get ! John E. Nevola Author of The Last Jump - A Novel of World War II
5 #### You 're in for a long haul but it 's well worth it . I take on at least one epic every winter and picked " Winds of War " and it 's sequel " War and Remembrance " this year . I love historical fiction and these two books are some of the best . You 'll learn about WWII and still be able to wrap yourself around the characters whose family soon becomes a part of your life . There 's intrigue & suspense , there 's action & very personal relationships as well and then there are the facts of WWII that will have you looking online for more information . These are powerful novels that really draw you in ; so much so that after I read " Winds of War " I was going to take a break and read something else between it and " War and Remembrance " but as I read the " other " book I kept wondering about what happens to these characters Wouk created . So I quit the " break " book and got right back on " War and Remembrance . " I 'm very glad I did . Both novels are such page turners that it 's darn near impossible not to want more . The two combined are close to two thousand pages but they read like a novel of several hundred . Good stuff !
4 #### Let me start with saying that the book itself deserves 5 stars , easily . It 's awesome , amazing , wonderful . Thank God I read it in print format first . Now , on to the Kindle edition ... I do think that if you decide to offer a book in a Kindle edition , someone really has to -- I do n't know -- READ IT ! Not just scan in the original and trust that your software is up to the task of rendering the original perfectly in the new medium . YOU HAVE TO CHECK YOUR WORK . Why am I sure this did n't happen ? The section heading in big bold print reading " Bearl Barbour " sort of gives it away . Seriously , the Kindle edition is riddled with errors like this , and no , I 'm not particularly looking for them . Someone needs to go back and fix this . Seriously . It 's just jarringly bad . I love my Kindle , and I 've never encountered anything like this shoddy editing job in any of my other Kindle books , not even the free ones . This one I paid for , and I 'm very , very offended that it was transcribed into the new format without someone proofreading it to make sure that everything came out all right . It 's discourteous to a great book , a great author , and to readers .
5 #### I love Herman Wouk and really love this book . It should be required reading in history classes across the country .
4 #### Okay the dialogue is often clunky , and the story very contrived , but this one novel really does a very good job of telling you about the war , and the story really does have a great deal of clout !
5 #### " Winds of War " is simply the best novel ever written about WWII . I was a history minor with a keen interest in the war and through the decades , have read countless books about it , both fiction and non - fiction . I have written four books myself and have developed some appreciation for the craft of good writing . With " Winds " , Herman Wouk , a truly great writer , is at his greatest . I have read this masterpiece at least once a year for the last 30 years and have never tired of it . I hope to have that many more years to read it .
5 #### " And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears . And how else can it be ? The deeper that sorrow carves into your being , the more joy you can contain . Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter 's oven ? " I first came across this in a high school class on the spiritual journey , and it 's remained by my side ever since . Gibran 's poetic , graceful writing touches upon issues central to human life . A deeply moving work that I can not recommend enough .
5 #### Wisdom for life-- a true manual to help you on your spiritual journey . I think Gibran has peered into the human heart , mind , and soul . His advice is profound ...
5 #### I gifted it to my son who enjoyed it as much as I did when I was in college many years ago !
5 #### I found this book years ago and have loved the way of life that is described within its pages . It 's the perfect way to live for all humanity , no matter one 's personal beliefs as to the non / existence of God . It covers all facets of life and its wisdom is indisputable . Be aware -- the drawings , done by the author , are all nudes in this edition . They are tastefully done and very artistic . Not a problem for me , but I bought the book for an acquaintance and am not sure how they will be received .
5 #### Here is a book that will get your spiritual side working again . This book subscribes to no particular religion(s ) , but gives much to reflect upon . This is a short book . It will only take you around an hour or so to read it . But if you want to take a break from the hectic day - to - day lives we lead and think about the deeper meanings of life , this book is for you . It 's the story of a prophet that comes to a town and gives the townspeople his wisdom . They ask him questions about life , and he gives them deep spiritual answers . Simple concept , great read .
5 #### It moved into the story well and I enjoyed it !
5 #### The series renewed after 20 years with this book . I was afraid that it might be " different " somehow from the 1st 4 books ( which I loved ) . It is a bit different , the quality of writing is even better , I feel . There is some time spent catching the reader up with the previous 4 books . And there is significantly more emphasis on the turbulent historical events in Europe , which are complex ! I personally glazed over these parts , except to glean whatever might affect the main characters . I am now starting The Stranger From the Sea . Totally hooked on the series !
5 #### PBS started with the 2015 Poldark series . I was not about to wait months for what happens next . Just got into book 8 . Says it all , does n't it ?
5 #### Immensely enjoyable ! The Black Moon is just meatier than the previous book ... the reader is introduced to several characters that promise the series will become even more tantalizing ! The loss at the end though of a character whose sharp repartee and observations will surely be missed ... I definitely will read The Four Swans ( Poldark # 6 )
5 #### This great novel is the best description of World War II that the average person will ever find . You could read Churchill 's Memoirs , as I have , or Max Hastings non - fiction " Overlord . " You would have to read at least a dozen non - fiction books to get the story . I have probably read 50 books on World War II . I have also read Winds of War a dozen times . Pug Henry is the observer and minor participant that has been used by many other historical novelists . WEB Griffin is an enormously popular writer of novels on World War II . I have read them all . He is excellent at characterization . Wouk is better . There are many excellent novels about World War II that have been forgotten . Leon Uris wrote several of them and they are excellent . Wouk is better . If you want the story of World War II in one story , read this novel and the sequel War and Remembrance . I have read each of them many times . There is no better way to get the whole story . I have amused myself with looking up the stories of the real characters he includes . They are all real and he does them justice . There is no better way to start the study of World War II .
5 #### I first read " Winds of War " back in the 70 's , and jumped all over the sequel , " War and Remembrance " a few years later . I believe I have read them both at least 5 times over the years , and could read them again right now . I 've read thousands of books , and still view these two epics as my all time favorites . Wouk is a national treasure .
5 #### I feel like I stepped into the 1940 's and I was right ther with Pug and Rhoda . This is the most detailed and accurate novel on WWII that I have read . The charachers are so alive . This Navy family are scattered all over Europe and the US in WWII . You go from desk jobs to the trenches in Russia . Briney the youngest son marries a Jewish woman who is living in Siena , Italy so you can guess where that leads . You read the horrors of Hitlers Final Solution . All the military planning and battles and the tender moments between husbands and wives . The Kindle edition did have many typo 's in it . I did report it and was assured that it is being corrected . This is a great read and it is so much easier to read on the Kindle as it is a BIG heavy book . I highly recommend it to anyone who loves WWII drama .
1 #### The book is excellent . See the other reviews for details . However , the conversion to Kindle format has riddled the manuscript with typographical errors , misspellings , missing words , and omitted spaces . I would never have bought it had I any idea of how poor the editing job was . If you want this book , buy the paper edition instead .
4 #### This was the book I suggested for my monthly book club meeting this month and yikes . It 's a long , slow book that I feel that my other readers friends do not like me for suggesting ! I liked the story . Over all , it was worth reading . However , it is so long and slow that the abrupt ending actually made me go ' NO ! WHY ? ! ' and angrily throw my phone onto my bed , because it 's so unsatisfying . The book is a good one and worth the read , but that ending ... I thought my kindle had failed to download the full text ! After I finished the book , I watched the BBC mini - series and I have to be honest ... if you want a much more romantic version of the story with some way better and more memorable quotes , just watch that . If you enjoy the Victorian writing style , the book may be the better option , but it definitely lacks the passion and hitting emotions that the BBC mini - series did . I 'm glad I did n't watch the series first or I would 've probably been disappointed in this book . It 's rare that the television adaptation of a book is better , but really , that cuts out all the long , slow sections and adds way more passion to the romance than the book involves . All in all , I 'd say my review was really 3.5/5 , but since it 's worth it , I just marked it 4/5 .
1 #### I picked up this book through my online library because I thought I had read it before and liked it . Either my tastes have changed or this is a different Civil War saga . It 's kinda like having fond childhood memories of Thanksgiving weekend at your grandmother 's house only returning as an adult and realizing everyone is crazy . You keep looking at your watch , as I did the page numbers , hoping the experience would end soon . The stilted dialogue was as weak as cold mashed potatoes . The head hopping was like trying to listen to five conversations at once . The two dimensional characters-- especially the caricatures of the antagonists were exasperating -- and like my family these families had skeletons in their closets too . The men we all noble or evil . The women were all Madonnas or whores . Sure there was a lot of history , but the educational value did n't get in the way of brutal action scenes and titillating romance . Why did I finish it ? I 'm not sure . Partly out of curiosity , partly because I wanted to see how the author would seque into the sequel , partly because like the dessert table at Thanksgiving , I do n't know when to stop indulging on sweets that are n't so good for me . I celebrate Thanksgiving with my family once a year . Reading another book in this series should be less frequent than that .
5 #### The language of this era is simply beautiful , and is able to tell the story so much better because of it . The book starts out a little slowly , as most of the books from this time do , but it 's worth sticking with it . The pace picks up and the stories of so many people from different experiences and classes are intertwined into an exciting and meaningful story . It shows the struggle between knowing what is right and wrong , between those on top of society and those below . It shows how all people are interdependent , but they fight against each other , not seeing others point of view or respecting their position , which is especially shown in the tension between the classes . Pride is also a big theme . It stands in the way of them understanding each other and seeing that we all face hardship and oppression , and between the two main characters from admitting or even seeing their love for each other .
3 #### I 'm a third of the way through it . The other members of the book club day it picks up further into the book . You 'll have to take their word for it .
5 #### The prophet 's words are full of wisdom , passion , learning and moreover peaceful for a loving or depressed soul . You wo n't be tired of listening to his calmed recorded voice . Thanks .
5 #### This book is so good , it brings tears to my eyes in the beauty of the wording . It is definitely a must - read for everyone who enjoys reading :)
5 #### His words are so poetic and philosophical , gave me reason to pause and think . Loved it . I frequently quote Gibran , many great quotes in this book . If you enjoy his work , this wo n't dissapoint .
5 #### ... might not agree with every idea , but the writing is hauntingly beautiful and nostalgic . Read it outdoors under a tree in the fall or spring . Read it aloud . Enjoy .
5 #### This is a series . Start with the first book and you will have months of reading pleasure . For more enjoyment , try getting the Masterpiece series that started this summer . Then you will have visual context for all the beautiful people and scenery .
5 #### If you are reading the Poldark Series ( currently on Masterpiece Theater ) you 'll enjoy Black Moon . Read these in sequence .
5 #### These books are hard to put down . Follow the Poldarks as they age marry & live life . You feel like you lived in Cornwall . Love stories , the rich vs the poor . Ships war , what else could you ask for .
5 #### I just ca n't get enough of these books , they are so very good .
4 #### Wouk does a magnificent job of providing the background of the US prior to our comittment in World War Two .
5 #### This book was so good that it caused me to slack off on my studies . I do n't normally read too much fiction , but a friend who is a fellow WWII buff recommended it , and I 'm glad I took him up on it . The story follows US Naval Captain Victor " Pug " Henry and his family in the years leading up to WWII . The characters are all intriguing and lifelike , and Wouk 's storytelling ability is second to none . Not only is there plenty of romance , intrigue and suspense , but I found the book to be very nuanced as well . This is no one - dimensional patriotic hack job . The historical background of the book is incredibly sharp , and you can actually learn quite a bit of real history even while being highly entertained . Whether it 's through Pug or his son Byron , or any one of the other characters , the book takes the reader through pre - war Nazi Germany , Poland under Blitzkrieg , London in the Battle of Britain , Italy , Portugal , Russia and ending at Pearl Harbor . Pug manages to find himself in some high places , rubbing elbows with quite significant individuals . I particularly liked the way that Wouk just kind of snuck in historical details into the conversations of the characters so seamlessly . ' The Winds of War ' is truly an American epic , and a highly addictive one at that .
5 #### There 's a scene where Henry is taken to Tolstoy 's grave and one wonders if this is a conceit by Wouk ; but the comparison is not far fetched and maybe this novel is superior to War and Peace- it 's certainly more readable .
5 #### " The Winds of War " by Herman Wouk was one of the best books I have read in a very long time . I have just ordered " War and Remembrance " because I finished the latter today and need to continue with the story . The first half of the story ( the first book ) was a bit slow at first and I was reluctant to continue on , however it soon picked up pace and I could n't put it down . The story was heart - rending and I became sympathetic to all of the main characters and felt disdain towards the antagonists , just as the protagonists felt . I recommend this book to anyone who loves America and the struggle to gain freedom in a time when hope seemed far in the distance . This book will enliven the American spirit . I am sure that " War and Remembrance " will be just as well - written as " The Winds of War " and I look forward to reading how the character 's lives end up . Read This !
5 #### I first read the novel 35 years ago . I was entranced by Wouk 's human characterizations and his grasp of history . He allows you to BELIEVE in the story . I probably have it all memorized by now but I still grab a read now and then . Definitely 5 stars .
5 #### So the BBC version had to read the book was great
5 #### This is one of the greatest classic novels ever . This was the first book I have read by Elizabeth Gaskell , but I like it so much that I downloaded two other books by her . Such a sweet story of a trying time for the Hale family , especially Margaret . The contrast in life in the country and life in the industrial town is neat , and Gaskell shows this so well . Also , one of the best love stories written . It ties with Pride and Prejudice in my eyes :)
4 #### Excellent story about overcoming prejudices . Also reflects a bit about strikes and the development of unions in England . It took me a while to get into the book , but I could n't put it down once I did .
4 #### I wanted the book the Prophet as an anniversary gift to my spouse . We read this book while dating . He had copies before but lost track by giving them away . I went to Amazon and put in the title and there it was ... nothing like what it would have cost retail . So for me it was just what I was looking for , at the price I could pay , in the condition I could use for the perfect gift for my husband . Thank You !
5 #### I have the 1972 version , bought in 1974 . The 1972 version originally had a dust jacket but that is long gone . This particular rendition has had many re - printings , for a reason : it 's very popular . The textured paper , old - style typography , and leather cover are better than a plain - old paperback . The size is diminutive , which is perfect for this book .

5 #### I first read it as a senior in high school . When I moved away from home I reread it often , chronologically and not - so . I have offered my copy to others and recommended it to many . It is nuanced and timeless .
5 #### Ca n't say enough about Kahlil Gibran 's work among this piece . Everybody in the whole world should read this ! There is almost too much to take in , really appreciate and put towards our daily lives . In my opinion , it is just one of the most beautiful literature pieces ever written . Would recommend to as a gift for anyone spiritual / poetic / philosophy / educational piece or just something to enjoy here and there . 5 stars for sure !
5 #### As other previous books , this one was as good . I love how the writer is able to introduce new characters from not taking anything away from Demelza and Ross . Those characters are engaging and interesting adding to the storyline . Drake and Sam appear in their lives and make it more colorful . I like both brothers , Drake is more like Demelza , smart , intelligent and with a good heart , he has dreams and hopes and he falls in love with someone who is employed by George , so ... And there is Dr. Enys and Ross who goes to France to save him which makes the book more adventurous . I love every single character . I admire the writer 's take on the lives of people in times that were difficult and harsh . I love Ross , he is a rebel , a decent guy who does not belong to any class , but his own , a class which cares for all and does good . I have to say that I was very disappointed in him in Warleggan book . My heart almost broke for what he did and I did not like that " affair ' of his , especially because Demelza is really great . Love the book .
5 #### I love this book , ca n't wait to read all 12 , only way to buy this is in set off 3 , page turner for sure .Winston G.is for sure best there is .
5 #### I have not read this book yet but I bought the entire Poldark Collection . Ross Poldark is an awesome read and I am expecting that the rest of the collection will be more of the same !
5 #### This book is part of the Poldark saga which includes 12 books covering the period of 1787 to 1820 in Cornwall , England . It is about the Poldark family , centering on a rebellious and individualistic cousin / nephew of the main family branch , Ross Poldark . Upon returning from his involvement in the American Revolution , he arrives home to a small estate in ruins and a larger family which looks down upon him and his father and mother , now deceased . It is a mining family and Ross marries Delmeza , who is the daughter of a miner , a marriage which is considered dclass but which is very happy . The novels take place against the historical background of this period -- the chaos caused throughout Europe by the French Revolution , its complex political aftermath , and the rise of the Emperor Napoleon . I am now reading the 8th novel of this series and I can vouch for the fact that all 8 are page - turners . I am so grateful that all are available on my Kindle so that I can move from one novel to another rapidly . These books are magnificent ! Always gripping , always beautifully written -- an amazing literary accomplishment ! .
5 #### Love this series ! I finish one and then have to start the next . Love the characters and the setting .
5 #### A powerful epic of the events preceding World War 2 . Many books have been written about the late 30 's and the events leading to WWII , but H. Wouk 's " Winds of War " is a most dramatic narrative . Together with its sequence " War and Remembrance " , it gives the reader the chills of the events that change the world and still haunt us . The death of an apparent civil European society with ripple effects throughout the world . The TV drama based on these two books is one of the best renditions of the era .
5 #### the absolute best WWII story I 've ever read . It is imposible to read this book without picturing Pug as Robert Mitchum . He is the perfect epitome of this character . If you 've never seen the TV mini - series or if you 've had then read the book . Unforgettable characters in a moment of history that changes the world .
5 #### Winds of war is a masterpiece , the definitive novel of world war two . It has everything , characters , plot and , most of all , great history . If you like this book , watch for NIGHT OF FLAMES by Douglas W. Jacobson , coming soon.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Night - of - Flames - A - Novel - of - World - War - II / dp/1590131363 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Night of Flames : A Novel of World War II</a >
5 #### What an unbelievable work of art . This book not only grabs you and pulls you in , with wonderful characters and writing , but you find yourself lost in the time and place . I am currently about a fourth of the way through War and Remembrance .... it is equally splendid . I first read Marjorie Morningstar and fell in love with Herman Wouk 's style and mastery of the storyline and character development . At times when reading these books I am incredibly sad , other times uplifted , and yet other times amazed . Absolutely one of the best authors I 've ever read ... and I have read alot of books .
5 #### As a novice reader , beginning Herman Wouk 's massive epic " Winds of War " was a big challenge for me . It sat on my bookshelf for a while before I cracked the first page and was pleasantly surprised by its ability to keep me utterly engrossed in the story . As a historical fiction piece , Wouk tells the story of a Navy family and their individual lives leading up to the United States ' entry into World War II . As the family of five spreads out around the world , their paths continue to cross , keeping their relationships alive and continually gravitating towards one another . Truly an epic tale , Wouk does a magnificent job depicting ( in an interesting manner ) the historical events , political persuasion , national influence , and social pressures surrounding WWII . You will learn about Hitler , Stalin , Mussolini , Churchill and Roosevelt ... Wouk 's work is better than any history class I 've ever taken . This is an impactful " must read " for everyone and at the risk of sounding trite , I would call this book a masterpiece . Have fun , David Tobias Redondo Beach , CA
3 #### He 's a most utterly unappealing protagonist . Wouk wants us to think of Pug as a career - driven , very rigidly moral sort of person . Instead , he came across to me as cold , humorless , stodgy , somewhat hypocritical , and very , VERY boring . The few things Wouk has him do to make him less of a plaster saint ( drinks a bit , smokes , lusts in his heart after a young English woman ) did n't humanize Pug for me . By the end of the novel , I found him about as likeable as Wouk 's other famous character , Captain Queeg . That said , the plot of the novel was engrossing and most of the other characters ( Including Hitler and Stalin!)were more interesting and entertaining than Pug . The definite highlight of the book is Wouk writing as the German General van Roon . It 's very convincingly done and it is in these sections of the book where what little ( sly ) humor Wouk offers is to be found .
4 #### While the characters . are not as endearing as those in Mrs. Gaskell 's Cranford , the story told in North and South gives deep insight into human condition during the Industrial . Revolution . I did not find the denouement entirely believable though there is ample foreshadowing . Still North and South is an excellent read and holds a vitalplace among Mrs. Gaskell 's " industrial " novels .
5 #### British literature , no doubt . The descriptions of life in London , in the lovely country village of Helstone , and in the manufacturing town of Milton , are colorful and moving , each in their own way . The narratives of intercourse between people in widely varying situations of life are refreshing and sometimes funny . I relished every single word , even the few whose spelling made me laugh ( sate not sat ) and those I had to inquire after before they could be clearly understood ( How many folks know what the verb " clem " means ? ) . The author presents people of all economic and social classes and each in his or her own way , using the appropriate vernacular . Unlike many novels of the period , the focus is not solely on the upper classes . I hated for it to end , although I so deeply desired some resolution . My only complaint is the ending seemed to sneak up on me so abruptly . Once again , I am left to wonder why I have never read this previously . What error in my prior education skipped over this novel , hmm ?
5 #### I had read this before about year ago and now I 'm reading it again
5 #### This is a great story . There is much about the culture and time of the industrial revolution in northern England . It gives a clearer view of what it must have been like to live and work for the Masters of the cotton weaving mills . The descriptions of the efforts that the cotton had on the workers were disturbing . The pollution of the water caused by the dyes at the mills was graphic when a disgruntled worker drowned in the polluted waters . But more than that it is a slow moving love story about a young woman from the South and a Master from the North who struggle with their cultures to fine that love can conquer most things .
5 #### My brother was looking for this book and I ordered it for him . I was pleased with the price and the fact I could have it shipped directly to him . Thanks Amazon !
5 #### Love this book . Every time I buy one , I give it away . This one is for me . The book arrived on time and in good condition .
5 #### This book is a classic . I always end up giving it to someone as a gift and then have to buy another . Spiritual words of wisdom with simplicity and depth . I love this book .
3 #### This book was great in the 60 's and it 's great still . It makes you feel peaceful inside . It lets you stop and contimplate what you read . Good source of tranquility .
5 #### I would have given this book four and a half stars , if it had been an option . It has a tinge of soap in places , but that does n't detract from its impact , in my opinion . I 'm rereading it , particularly for the description of Byron in Poland during the German invasion . Mr Wouk meant to write a large scale , sweeping novel , I 'm sure . His characterizations do n't seem to me to suffer .
5 #### This was on my list of summer reads and is truly enlightening , I now have a deeper understanding of World War II . Herman Wouk is a master storyteller and keeps you coming back for more ! His insights on human nature and the human condition are right on target . It is truly frightening to think how close we were to losing both the Pacific and European battles , due to complacency and isolationism . War and Remembrance is also a must read .
5 #### This is a must - read for every American . I thought it would be dry . I opened it to do some dutiful reading . Instead , I was captivated , and now ca n't wait to read War and Remembrance . Sure it 's a thick book , but you are so sorry when you come to the end -- you want more ! It gives every country 's perspective on World War II , and insight into the leaders of countries on both sides of the war . Amazing ! Somebody make sure Herman Wouk stays healthy and keeps working ! Pure genius !
5 #### As I sit here about to read " The Winds of War " for the umpteenth time , it and " War and Remembrance " are my number one and two of 42 years of reading and collecting books . No other fictional novel can give you a more accurate account of the actual beginning of those years preceding the entrance of the United States into WWII than " Winds of War . " I know I am an amateur history buff of WWII , the Vietnam Conflict , and the American Civil War . Not only does Herman Wouk give us a history lesson but he also gives us a monumental story of love , fear , joy , anger , hope , despair , and tragedy . Two books not easily put down and a story surely never forgotten .
5 #### I love this entire series . I am always glad there is another one to read after I finish with each one .
5 #### I do n't know how I missed this series in my youth , it would have been right up my alley .... good history , Napoleonic times from the English working man side . At any rate the new Poldark series on PBS got my curiosity up , and here I am .... halfway through the series ... Good Read !
5 #### A great continuation of the Poldark series I love them all and am now almost halfway through the 12 - volume set .
5 #### This is a great novel which continues the Poldark story . Very excitingly written , may be the best so far ...
5 #### I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this series of books ! !
5 #### love the poldark series , great characters and plot line
5 #### Although this was a long read , I enjoyed it immensely . I plan to read the other volumes as well .
5 #### This particular book is beautiful . The illustrations really make it that much more special . I really enjoyed this book ! The development of the love story between Margaret and Thornton around the struggles of Victorian social and economical classes was amazing . I highly recommend this book !
4 #### I really enjoyed the novel after being introduced via BBC drama of the same name featuring RIchard Armitage and Daniela DenbyAshe . I never heard of this author before , only Jane Austen and Bronte sisters when it came to British romance novels . And surprised to find there was equal drama , romance , and social commentary behind the story . I highly recommend this to those who like to delve into British romance novels more . It was n't boring at all ! Although I recommend watching the BBC drama before or after reading the novel . It really adds to the experience and the TV drama was well done .
3 #### Bought it because I loved the miniseries so much ..... Really prefer the miniseries ....
5 #### A reader does not need to have a special interest in war stories to enjoy this novel ( along with its continuation in War and Remembrance ) . This is a very well - written story that puts a personal face on World War Two . Even though The Winds of War adn War and Remembrance is one coherent stroy covering over 2000 pages , the story never bogs down . Spans events from the lead - up to the end of the war and follows the main characters all over the world . Wouk does a great job of writing from various perspectives . The history seems to be fairly accurate , with some necessary literary license taken to covey the sheer volume of information required as the backdrop for the main characters . You would n't read this to replace history works , but it really humanizes the events of the war .
5 #### In a recent WWII class in college I was assigned to read both Wouk novels , and let me just say that this was not busy work . I found time for this classic and the story just enraptured me . An amazing work of genius , and I am definitely going to purchase more of his novels . I recommend to anyone who wants to learn about WWII in a fun and easy to read way , in addition to reading just for fun .
5 #### For someone interested in long novels and history , this is a heaven - sent book , rich in imagination and historical facts . I wonder what prompted Mr Wouk to write this book . There is no match for it in the literary world ! !
5 #### I first read The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran over 30 years ago and have read it many times since . Gibran 's messages are timeless and have always influenced my life and relationships . Over the years I have used it as a gift for persons I cared about . This paperback version has a lovely cover and makes a nice yet inexpensive gift containing valuable lessons for anyone . I purchased three for future giving at the special price offered .
5 #### I 'm not religious , but I take moral philosophy very seriously . If there were a list of books that all people should read in order to call themselves a student of life , this is probably the most important one . I would also include The Alchemist . Check it out .
5 #### I have been reading The Prophet every year for over a decade . Or intending to . It 's an incredible read . If I 'm having issues in my life , I read the section that relates to my problem and it helps clarify things somewhat . It is a divinely inspired piece of work , and can be read in one setting . There is pretty much nothing that he does n't cover in the book that ca n't be related to your own life . I bought the ebook version so I could have easier access . It 's a book for everyone .
5 #### Cool book , I really like the quality of the production . Black clothbound with gold embossing and nice paper , looks to be cotton rag . I am proud to include it in my collection . Intrigueing story full of the sort of passion that does not cloud the mind or divert truth but instead is revealing and living . Very readable , the stories are short and highly economic so that one is likely to read for only a minute or two until something insightful is revealed . It is full of timeless truths which are of lasting value to the reader and inform life . The language and delivery is familiar yet of a quality that is penetrating in a similar way as it might be listening to a surmon by Jesus . I give it 5 stars . I considered giving only 4 stars because the format is fairly predictable but I have decided that this quality is actually a strength as one can pick up the book at any point and continue until the end ... and then start over for that matter . Excellent for busy people or commuters !
5 #### A decade past , I knew very little about the writer / artist / poet / prophet , Kahlil Gibran . I am happy to say , that today , I am well acquainted with his work . The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran , and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words . To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre . I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran 's books , that you consider the Prophet as a good start . You will not be disappointed . A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran : The Voice Of The Master ; The Beloved ; Sand And Foam ; The Broken Wings ; Between Night And Morn ; The Earth Gods ; and one of my personal favorites , though not so much a " story , " but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends : Kahlil Gibran : A Self - Portrait .
5 #### I just love Gibran . I have most of his writings . It took him 9 years to finish this little book , and it is so spiritual , not religious . It is a book of love . I highly recommend this work to everyone .
4 #### Best continuation of a novel I have ever read -- no rehashing of what you read before -- just carries on from Warleggan .
5 #### He did it again ! I am completely besotted with this series ! Ca n't get enough of the Poldark saga & am already regretting its coming to an end at some point .
5 #### This book was a lively , vibrant account of WWII from the perspectives of diverse , well - developed characters . _ Winds of War _ recounted the great historical events occuring from 1938 - 39 until the end of 1941 , but presented them in a way that reflected believable sentiments real people felt at the time . The characters of the Jastrow family were particularly interesting for me , who as a Jew , try to understand the element in which they found themselves trying to escape Europe , and how they responded to it . The protagonist , an ambitious and succesful naval officer is the patriarch of the model naval WASP family . He maneuvers through the thickest power circles in his time with tact and ease , and is really a lot of fun to imagine . Wouk basically conjures a bunch of extremely gifted characters , some beautiful , some brilliant , and weaves them into a fascinating narrative of the most influential years of the 20th century . Historical fiction at its best , if you want a fun yet accurate portrayal of WWII , this is a good pick .
5 #### This book along with it 's companion , War and Remembrance , are so full of vivid history . I learned from these books more about WWII including what led up to it than any history class , documentary , or history book could ever provide . On top of all this history is a touching tale about a military family that suffers the highs and lows of personal events ( romance , divorce , death , etc . ) while rubbing elbows with all the great names of that time . The authors descriptions of some of the battle scenes ( The German defeat of the French ) are so real that I felt I had experienced them first hand . This should be required reading for any WWII history class .
5 #### Of any book I 've ever read , The Winds of War remains the most thrilling , beautifully educational , and wonderful . Even though many years have passed since I finished it , I frequently think of the characters , and the horror and heroism of World War II . This book puts you there like no non - fiction book can.(I was so moved when I finished , I wrote Mr. Wouk , to tell him what an impact the book had on me . He wrote me back , with thanks , and told me how few readers ever write him with feedback . So be sure to send him a note when you 're finished . ) READ THIS BOOK .
5 #### In the foreward of my copy , I am still touched by Herman Wouk 's talents , " Peace , if it ever exists , will not be based on the fear of war , but on the love of peace . It will not be the abstaining from an act , but the coming of a state of mind . In this sense the most insignificant writer can serve peace , where the most powerful tribunals can do nothing . " All family members , and military figures in this great novel had to find their own form of peace . Their faith was challenged . As was their fundamental ways of life . I especially enjoy how the arthor combined true history with the fictional family . It was easy to relate to each family member , and to root for their desire for peace . The message that the quote above carries in my heart is also something that I believe we must apply in our daily lives . It 's extremely valuable to face problems from a desire for peace , knowing that looking directly at the problems , and what role we play creates love that is passed onto others , naturally .
5 #### This is so huge that it takes time to digest all information in the book . This is massive . This is good . This is a new classic .
5 #### I 'm a bit too young for World War II , but my dad -- enlisting in the Navy at age 17 - -survived Pearl Harbor , a later kamikaze attack on his ship ( the USS San Francisco ) at the battle of Guadalcanal , and personal participation in the invasion of Guam ( 3rd wave , to set up a communications station ) . As a Navy brat , I played on abandoned pillboxes in the jungle outside of Subic Bay ( Philippines ) in the late 50s and picked up empty shell casings on a group family outing to Corregador . That said , I consider _ The Winds of War _ and _ War and Remembrance _ to be the greatest novels written about World War II . The historical detail is dead on , the military , political , and social commentary is brilliant , and the story itself keeps you page - turning for a few thousand pages . It is a heart - wrenching book that helps one grasp -- six decades later -- what it was like to have the entire world plunged into war , with a close look at the horrors of the Holocaust . Wouk actually served in the US Navy in the Pacific during WW II . He lived through the war and brings that whole era to life in a way that I doubt any current author could . And yet they are utterly relevant today . I frankly think they should be required reading in college or even high school . Read them . .. bruce ..
5 #### I really enjoyed this book . It kept my attention from start to finish .
4 #### I purchased the original version not the edited version . It is a little hard to read , but I think well worth it . A great story .
3 #### Read this after watching the BBC adaptation , which turned out to be better than the book ( a rare occurrence ) . Some rather dodgy economic theory espoused by the author - e.g. that employers have no control over wage rates ( ! ) . Dialogue had too much long - winded speeches on various items of pedantry rather than actual stuff we 'd want to read about . Quite a lot of self - righteous stewing that got tiresome . Traces of classism - even though the author tries to show how un - classist she is , you ca n't miss the fact that the union dudes are apparently too dumb to understand things that the bosses understand . But it still had a whole lot of good stuff - she 's trying to be a more serious thinking person 's Jane Austen and she gets most of the way there but still not quite .
4 #### I really enjoyed reading this story . Poor Margaret endured so much pain , but always seemed to endure . It seemed that John Thornton spent too much time thinking about Margaret and not enough about pursuing her . The class difference had a lot to do with their challenges . I 'm glad Margaret realized what she finally needed .
5 #### Got this book for my son who was n't familiar with Kahlil Gabran . Everyone should read him at least once do n't you think ? The book was more attractive than pictured and small - fits in his pocket . He likes it .
4 #### This is an excellent short book of inspirational fiction by one of the best poets of all - time . I especially love the artistic cover of this well made paperback edition .
4 #### I 've read this book a few times and it always takes me away from the petty worries of everyday life to a place where universal truth seems to exist . This is surprising as I do n't believe in universal truth but in a world of competing truths , depending on your perspective . How does Gibran do this ? It 's the simple , poetic language and use of metaphor which makes this book seem timeless . Some people have said he 's helped to inspire the Arab Spring and that he 's a revolutionary , others say he 's irrelevant and full of pop psychology - but he remains the third most popular poet in the world so go figure . Another book I read recently had a similar prophet , a woman called Bal Ashtu - calling for equality between men and women in Islam . It was called ' Mosaic Deceptions ' I think . Worth a read too if you 're interested in spiritual themes and a good plot in the same book .
2 #### Great service great condition . I loved the Prophet and did n't care for this book at all . It did n't resonate with me and I did n't understand it most of the time . Quick read not moving .
5 #### Had this book in the 70 's and not sure what happened to it , but always recalled many quotes from it so was happy to find it again . First time with this company and will use them in the future .
5 #### This book remains " simply the best ! " I have read it many times and quoted it frequently over the last 60 years . I gave a copy to my daughter as part of her wedding gift - and years later it is at her bedside . The information given is simple , yet profound . It is something that exhaults when you are need to be lifted up , comforts you when you are disheartened , and provides something for nearly every situation ! ! As a nurse I carried one with me always and shared frequently with patients who found comfort in the simple poetry . You will want to keep it handy ! It 's appropriate for most situations and makes a wonderful , simple gift !
5 #### I go from historical romance novels to historical fiction to non - fiction but easy - to - read history . Each of them has its own slant on perspective about that era , ranging from history - as- wallpaper to up - close rendering , as if you were there . This is one of the very few novels that manages to combine the elements of all 3 kinds of those books into a very gripping reading saga of WWII . So you are given well researched history in a very palatable form . It follows an interrelated cast of characters all over the map with WWII , taking us deeply into the critical locales . There is even a fascinating account given by a German general , interspersed throughout , of the war as seen through the opposite side 's eyes . Wouk does an incredible job and his sequel , " War and Remembrance " is almost as good . Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL ( livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com ) . Friday 's entry will always be weekend entertainment recs from my 5 star Amazon reviews in film , tv , books and music . These are very heavy on buried treasures and hidden gems . My blogspot is published on Monday , Wednesday & Friday .
5 #### I just recently read Winds of War and its sequel , War and Remembrance . They were both excellent novels . Wouk strikes me as a talented writer , who employs all the technical tools of his trade - such as using letters , excerpts from a military analysis ( fictional ) to help lend depth to his characters and a framework for the events of the novel . Winds of War , in particular , grabbed me and by the end I was frantic to get to the sequel to find out what happens to the Henry clan . I agree with another reviewer who writes about the steady developement and changes to Byron and how believeable it is . A great read ( both of them ) I would also recommend for similar novels ( albeit different periods ) " A Soldier of the Great War " and " Killer Angels " One final note , you may want to pause b / w reading the two novels as I found towards the latter third of War and Remembrance that I was getting tired of the book , but I read the two back to back over the course of three weeks .
5 #### Despite the fictional characters , I believe this book to be among the best sources available to get a sense of the world of the 1940 's . As a baby boomer , I grew up among many adults who were directly or indirectly involved in World War II . Herman Wouk has captured the values and views of that generation in a way that no future novelist ( one who was not an eyewitness to those times ) will ever be able to do . The Henry family whose lives are traced through this book typify the straightforward Americans of that day . This book ought to have won a Pulitzer . Oh and finally , in case none of the other 37 reviewers mentioned it , for inquiring minds : " Wouk " rhymes with " oak " .
5 #### I read Winds of War ( and then its sequel , War and Remembrance ) a few years ago and enjoyed it thoroughly . Herman Wouk weaves in the story of the Henry family through the ordeal of Second World War . The reader gets a very personal look at World War II ( on all fronts , including the Holocaust ) through the eyes of this tight knit American family . Although it 's a pretty big book , the pages fly by ... !
5 #### Just when I think the last book was epic then I read the next book . Here there is a daring rescue , a death in the Poldark family , a birth , love abounds just as betrayal and dark secrets ooze through the muck . I am on to the next novel !
4 #### This novel further develops the story of Ross Poldark and his family . It has action , love and heartbreak within its covers . Good book !
4 #### All the Poldark stories are great . They are so well written and in the gracious form of semi old English . I find them a joy to read and once I have read one , must read the next . This is not necessary though as each novel recaps on what has gone before in a very thoughtful way . If you like Cornish history then these books are a must .
5 #### Loved the author 's style and appreciated the drama and insight into English history in that part of England and at the time period .
5 #### I have finished this series of books and thoroughly enjoyed them . If you are too , also try the Outlander series . They are just as good , if not better . Happy reading !
5 #### Very political now , Wish I knew more about politics in the 18th century . First class writing as ever , trouble is I am now on my 5th book and they all blue into one wonderful saga which makes it difficult to distinguish one novel from the other .
5 #### This was my first reading of work by Elizabeth Gaskell , and I am impressed . The story was rich with detail and , if anything , ended too soon . Highly recommended .
3 #### Did n't want chapters to end . At times it was very slow Moving . 3 Three stars . Would recommend for vacation reading .
5 #### Well written story of Britain 's industrial north in the middle of the nineteenth century . A realistic story of the lives of the Hale 's a dissenting clergyman and his family who move from a romantic country village in the south to Milton a dirty busy cotton town of the north . Miss Margaret Hale finds it hard to learn new ways and adjust to the trials and tribulations of those around her . Living between 2 worlds of the workers and the mill owners she has little concern for her reputation and does n't hesitate to share her views . This is also a compelling love story . Thought provoking and entertaining this is one book I could n't put down .
5 #### What a great book . Hustorical drama . History and fiction mixedn story of two families that care for each other but hate each others lifestyle s. Great readn
5 #### I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60 's . The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60 's . It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me . After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country ( Liberia ) at times of illness and the night before I left , this book gave me great comfort . I read it before I married , just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses . I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you , grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future . Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word . I think that we as a nation should read AND learn the lessons here . It is definitely a time for thought and reflection this book could guide us through .
5 #### I first read this book as a teenager . It has remained on my bookshelf , being read many , many times . I have given it as a gift to several people , over the years . It is one of my favourite books . The Prophet is a classic , and is considered to be Kahlil Gibran 's masterpiece . Gibran himself considered it his " greatest achievement " . Originally published in 1923 , it has been translated into 28 languages , and is still a popular piece of literature today . The book is a beautiful blend of poetry and philosophy . Each chapter takes on a particular topic , or aspect of life . " The Prophet " speaks on love , work , law , freedom , pain , time , and many other important issues we all deal with as we journey through life . Each beautifully written chapter is also illustrated by Gibran . The importance and beauty of this book is immeasurable and timeless . This book should be on every bookshelf of those who truly enjoy the beauty of poetry and classic literature , to be enjoyed and appreciated by every generation . The life lessons offered by Kahlil Gibran are timeless in essence and belief .
5 #### My friend recommended this book , she said she had read it as a young girl and it made an impression . So I bought it for my son . I read it and loved it . The way the book is written is so sweet and beautiful . The explanation to lives basic spiritual rules are poetry . I loved it ! !
2 #### I 've always loved The Prophet and I 've read it many times . I gave away my last copy and was looking for a replacement . I purchased this copy only to find that it was a tiny novelty version of the book . If you 're looking for something tiny to keep in your purse then this is for you . If you 're looking for a " real book " then this is a joke .
4 #### The book came in great condition , as well as , on time . Feel sad , though , because it was lost in a move .
5 #### A book to be treasured . A tremendous poet dealing mostly with Christianity and spiritual love . His insights on topics of life are to be cherished . I have read his treasured poems many times and brightened the lives of others by sharing . This book was highly inspiring during my emotional spiritual journey to discover my biological roots . I listed The Prophet as a key reference source in my book Adoption Detective : Memoir of an Adopted Child . Judith Land , Author Adoption Detective : Memoir of an Adopted Child
5 #### A curse on George Warleggan ! One can only hope he will get his one of these days ! I am enjoying the introduction of the Carne brothers and we shall see what befalls Caroline and Dwight . The characters are brought to life so wonderfully by Graham ... it is easy to imagine what they look like , visualize the scenes , and become emotionally involved in all of their lives . Looking forward to the next book , but will be sorry when I close the cover on the last book . I going to stretch out the rest of the books so I wo n't reach the end too soon .
5 #### If you are a fan of historical fiction , this series will keep you enchanted for days and days ! I had to order some of these books from overseas and did it gladly to follow the fortunes of the Poldark family .
5 #### Winston Graham does it again ! Anyone who enjoys well - written historical novel will be delighted with this addition , the fifth in the Poldark series . It is especially appealing to those of us who love the speech , manners , and charm of the eighteenth century . Added to this is Graham 's special talent for developing well - delineated and very realistic characters -- many you will grow fond of and a number you will despise . All in all this novel and the four preceding it will whisk you back in time to a simpler , beautiful , but altogether harsh and cruel period . It is the closest you will ever get to living in the eighteen century .
5 #### I am again thankful that the author was so prolific and that I have more pleasureful reading ahead with the rest of the series . My only problem has been in finding all of his books still available .
5 #### Jane Austen for the socially - conscious set ! The small - town drama and will - they - or - won't - they romance is interspersed with conversation regarding the societal effects of the industrial revolution . The characters were wonderfully written and there was a wonderful build to the final resolution . Highly recommend !
5 #### For all who love the works of Jane Austen , this is one to add to your collection . Full of the same passion , tension and romance , this novel will not disappoint .
5 #### Wish I 'd read this before seeing the BBC version but I totally loved it all the same . Such a lovely story .
5 #### This is an excellent book . it arrived in good shape . i have loaned it out to other people . they are astounded that it is a used book
5 #### I read The Prophet years ago as a freshman college student & wished I 'd read it in high school . The lessons in this book can really positively impact the life of a teen or young person . I 've found another book that is geared towards young people that also gets this same message across , in an epic adventure way that teens like . The Prophetic Tales of No Child Left Behind [ ] I stumbled across this book & decided to buy it for a niece that 's a senior in high school . Its very rough , with some errors but the impact it had on her life , was similar to the impact The Prophet had on mine . If you like Kahlil Gibran , I think you could appreciate this also .

5 #### I have this entire series in the original , but nothing is quite so good as this one . A wise master is leaving the city . As he departs , the crowd shouts out for him to impart his knowledge . " Teach us about love , education , power , knowledge , etc " they cry . A simple plot for the organization of timeless wisdom .
5 #### I enjoyed the beautiful prose and the way the heroine develops her strength of character . The tender love story is interwoven with the poignant struggles of an early working class in an increasingly busy and indifferent industrial world .
5 #### I thoroughly enjoyed this book . It is long and there are a multitude of characters to keep track of which made it a little more difficult if one has to pick it up and put it down . I enjoy reading about the Civil War era and therefore find these books very interesting . I guess I should read a book which gives the true picture of that era so I know what is actual and what is made up .
4 #### Enjoyed the first book , even though some of the characters seemed a bit contrived . Always a fascinating period to revisit .
5 #### received on time and thank you for rel good on time service . HIS CHAPTER ON PAIN IS THE BEST .
5 #### Kahlil Gibran is my favorite poet , and his book : The Prophet has changed my outlook on many aspects of life . I am grateful that Amazon sent this book so rapidly because I could n't wait to begin searching its pages for its in - depth truths . It is not only inspiring , but it also adds philosophical insight to such subjects as reincarnation and brings to light the meaning of life . Each page of this book brings a greater spiritual awakening and opens the door to a deeper understanding of what is important ! This book is life - altering !
5 #### " The Prophet " is a powerful book of topical wisdom by Lebanese author and poet Khalil Ghibran . The book begins when a fictional prophet arrives mysteriously by ship and is taken in by a group of people who he remains among for several years . Before he leaves , he wants to thank them for their kindness but has nothing to give , so he gathers the people together and answers their questions with his wisdom on various aspects of life . The premise is similar to that of the Tao Te Ching and Lao Tzu imparting his wisdom to a guard . Every chapter is beautifully written in simple yet profound prose . Balance and the oneness of life are big themes . Ghibran is so artful in his use of metaphors and does n't waste a single word . If ever there were a great gift book , this is one . I think it 's a classic that everyone should read once but most will find themselves returning to many times over the years .
4 #### Easy read . Interesting book . I bought this book on a chance of luck & really enjoyed it . I recommend it to everyone .
5 #### I turn to The Prophet for perspective whenever life gets distorted and seems to be on its own track . This book offers poetic and visionary commentary on some of the most vital points of living , and does so in a creative , thought - provoking way . I first learned of Kahlil Gibran and The Prophet during a sermon at a Unitarian Universalist church , and I ran to get the book . It 's occupied an important place on my bookshelf ever since . It helps me realize that life is a process , and letting go is a big part of moving forward . It also reminds me to be mindful of how I think about and interact with the world . It keeps things in perspective . The Prophet is an inspirational read .
5 #### Khalil Gibran 's book , The Prophet , has the power to transform the darkest feeling of pain in your heart into great release . What a blessing that it exists . Each passage touches on a deep and universal topic ( marriage , friendship , etc ) . The words , spoken profoundly and clearly from the mouth of the mystic and insightful prophet , who has nothing but words of wisdom to impart to those who gather around him , is a truly life affirming and transformative experience . Please read this today . It will give you insight on the sacred aspects of all life choices and experiences that exist in the world .
5 #### I 've been a fan of this wonderful book since my college days ( back in the dark ages ) . It contains many wonderful thoughts that will always inspire .
5 #### This may be a short book , but it is full of insight . It is perfect to dip into at odd moment for that renewed spiritual focus or uplift , or just as good to read in one sitting . It is a classic with good reason and cuts to the core with it 's deceptively simple style . There is much depth to this book to be explored and comes highly recommended . Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page .
4 #### My review is prejudiced . Last year I read the 3rd book of the trilogy out of sequence . That does n't detract from the my estimate of the entire work -- a superb literary endeavor .
5 #### Jakes at his best . This is his greatest work . Love the story and characters .
5 #### The TV series got me interested in North and South . And as usual , does not do the book or characters justice . The book is sweet , realistic of the misunderstandings of life , heartbreaking and pure . I loved it .
4 #### I 'd forgotten what an enjoyable read this is . ,,not to mention a great history lesson . It 's an interesting story told from two points of view and relevant again in 2015 !
4 #### Made me wish I could read faster . I 'm enjoying the read .
4 #### Hi , I have not read the book yet but it arrived on time in the condition I expected .
5 #### Beautiful , wholly accessible , brought tears to my eyes . As graceful as Jesus ' parables must have been when freshly spoken , without the distortion of time and culture and multiple translations . The Prophet had been on my list of " oh yeah , I 've heard about it and probably should read it one day " books . A friend 's recommendation bumped it from there into my Kindle . This is the book that motivated me to learn how to underline and save notes , the Kindle equivilent of dog - earing my favorite parts . ( Somehow less satisfying than a dog - ear , but really easy to retrieve later . ) Other books that have made it from the list to my shopping cart sit largely unread because they are just too much work . I probably wo n't read Don Quixote , for example , until I 'm sitting on the Spanish Med and polishing my classic Spanish . Easy AND good for you . How perfect is that ?
5 #### This book takes different themes such as work , love , etc . and poses them as questions that a community asks a wise man , who seems to be spirit talking . He is a man who is not so much of a religious base but more filled with a love of nature finding peace and depth through sensory and embracement of all dark and light . He is a person who has freedom in all areas of his life and learns from all things and all moments because of his openess and aliveness . He wants all people to gain awareness from their path thru eternity . This can be read in a variety of ways coming from each person 's belief system . I read this when I was in a state of loss , loss of so much . This book can bring understanding and a shift in consciousness at least for a spell of time . It can expand who you are while you process and integrate his writings . I most definately recommend this book , for all people on their journey in whatever space they are in on their path of life .
5 #### Everyone carries an omnificent quality within themselves . Some individuals have not grasped this concept . Some individuals do not realize that a simple change can create a huge transformation . Would you ask an important figure for advice before she or he left town ? Their advice would be elements about life that you already knew , but seemingly forgot . There are simple fundamentals to follow that can make you a better person within your own eyes . Gibran uses The Prophet Almustafa to enlighten readers with simple tactics they can use to live a more pure and genuine life . How many of us love , go to work , have clothes , feel pain , and own friendships ? You do not have to be religious to appreciate this book . Gibran 's classic takes common stress factors that everyone can relate to , and shares guidance on how to simplify it in your life : " When you work with love , you bind yourself to yourself , and to one another " ( p. 26 ) . Read this book and share it . Think about the most valuable portion to you in this book . Share that portion with another person .
5 #### this is a book that I purchased for myself many years ago . It is as current today as it was when I purchased it . Kahlil Gibrahn is able to capture the thoughts concerning all aspects of life and relationships that make good sense of what life should and could be .
5 #### Now this is a MUST READ kind of book . simple yet very deep . makes you look within yourself and realized what you are doing with life and what you can do better . Highly recommend it to anyone looking for insight of self and spirituality .
5 #### Great chronicle of the issues leading to the civil war woven through the lives of two families .
1 #### I have almost never said this , but the series adaptation was much better than the book .
4 #### Very difficult to read at times but it gives a very good insight into the era and the industrial revolution . However , the ending was not well done , very abrupt and unfinished .
5 #### I love this story . The more I read it the more I love it .
4 #### Formulaic bad actors got on my nerves but the insights into the breakdown in communications and trust that caused the southern states to secede was very insightful . I 'm left wondering how much of it ( civil war ) was really due to people 's true feelings about slavery .
5 #### I had read this many years ago , and had forgotten how truly inspirational " The Prophet " was . Poetic , yes;deeply moving ditto . Thought provoking ? definitely . This is a classic that I 'm now very happy to own .
5 #### This should be on the booklist for every child before graduating HS . The textbook of LIFE . My 9 year old thinks so too ..
5 #### The prevailing popularity of Gibran 's PROPHET lies in only one secret : he writes his poems with readers in his mind . The compassionate poet I come to know through his lines , Gibran did not write to impress , shock or confuse but to communicate truth with highest poetic beauty . THE PROPHET addresses 27 essential subjects of life that concerns everyone - love , freedom , children , work , self - knowledge , friendship , time , beauty , death to name a few . I have this book for many years but this is a kind of poetry that ripens with time and each time you take a sip , it still surprises you with refreshing revelations . Also recommended are his less known books , A TEAR AND A SMILE , SAND AND FOAM and THE GARDEN OF THE PROPHET .
5 #### This is a wonderful expression of some of the fundamental truths of human nature and existence . This little book is always on my desk and every now and I revisit it again and ruminate over the wisdom that Al Mustafa gives to the people of the city of Orphalese . As Al Mustafa prepares to leave Orphalese after 12 years , the seeress Almitra implores , " Yet this we ask ere you leave us , that you speak to us and give us of your truth . And we shall give it unto our children , and they unto their children , and it shall not perish . In your aloneness you have watched with our days , and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and laughter of our sleep . Now therefore disclose us to ourselves , and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death . " ... and thus begins the beautiful explanation of love , marriage , children , houses , clothes , teaching , talking , religion and many more . Actually you can read this entire book online , so you do n't necessarily need to purchase one to enjoy it . Some of my favorite ones include , On Houses , On Teaching , On Talking and On religion . and he parts by saying , " Less hasty am I than the Wind , yet I must go . We wanderers , ever seeking the lonelier way , begin no day where we have ended another day ; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us "
4 #### If you like classic Jane Austen , then you should definitely read this book . I loved the story , though it could be a little depressing at times ( typical for this time period ) and the ending left me a tad empty . I definitely recommend to the classic lovers though !
5 #### Great book but this copy is pocket sized ( so much smaller than I had expected ) .
5 #### Great story , great message with all the history you 'd like to know .
4 #### This story was not about the North and South of America but about the rural and aristocratic South of England and the cotton mills of the industrialized North , and how a young lady , who came from the South was able to cope with the changes the North presented in her life . It was a good read
4 #### ( I mean Socialists , not , as some think are the same thing , Communists . ) Pride and Prejudice for people who like to think , and are socially interested . A great view of the difference in the rich and the poor social levels in the 1800 's , it truly makes the reader glad someone took the labour fights and fight for women 's rights , so we can enjoy the freedom we have today . I liked the characters , they seem to me like real persons with whom one can identify in a lesser or greater degree . They adapt in a natural way , through philosophy and events . The draw - back was , for me , the huge amount of Christian indoctrination , but one can easily overlook those .
5 #### A must in everyone 's library for graceful poetry , inpirational reading and lessons to live by and to even to let go . A new printing would be a welcome as the " used " ones in good condition are quite expensive .
5 #### The Prophet was given to me by a good friend when my Dad passed away twenty years ago . I loved it the first time I read it and I have given several copies away to friends / family who have lost someone they loved or had a problem I thought the book could help them with . I have 2 copies at home now and I often refer to it . A book you wo n't want to part with .
5 #### The Prophet delivers a philosophy for living which covers a wide spectrum of subject areas . It is easily in my top - ten favorites of all the books I have read . I 've purchased many copies for gifts for others , and never travel without my own worn but wonderful copy .
4 #### The writing style was very much the style of the time , but the story was very enjoyable .
3 #### Well this is one story where the movie is better than the book ! It is well written but there are parts I did n't understand ... French and just lots of details ! Anyway , the Netflix 4 part series is great ! Very romantic and compelling . The book gets bogged down on details . They do n't see each other for the last half of the book until the end and then it kind of leaves you hanging . Still good but series is more satisfying !
5 #### Wonderful piece of period literature . Very enjoyable journey to the inevitable .
5 #### I really enjoyed the story told around two families . It made the story more interesting . Looking froward to the next book .
5 #### Sorry for late response . Delivery and state of product was perfect - thank you ! Kind regards , Melissa
4 #### It was my mistake to assume the book would come with a book jacket , which it did n't despite the picture of it . However , pages are intact and came in decent condition .
5 #### As the author of a spiritually - themed book entitled " The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude , " I appreciate any book that opens the doors to spiritual understanding . There are few contemporary books that will do this for you in such a poetic way . This is a book containing eternal truths . It was given to me as a high school graduation present many years ago . At the time , I found it beautiful , but I could n't understand it . That is because I had n't experienced life . Selections from this book were read at my wedding . The sections on love speak of what it is truly about . Most of us never have an inkling of what true love is since we are caught up in a world of attachment to illusions and delusions . This book will help you to break through them . This is a classic that will stand the mark of time such as the Bible has done . Kahlil Gibran is an old soul who speaks in a language that can be embraced by people of any faith . The book is filled with metaphors and parables . It is almost as if Jesus himself is speaking through the author . Whether or not you will be able to comprehend what the author is speaking about , The Prophet will plant seeds that can bear good fruit . Davis Aujourd'hui , author of " The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude "
2 #### I evidently misread the writeup , I thought it was a hardback . It was a cheap paperback . I got it as a present so I could n't send it back but I 'm very dissapointed for the cost !
5 #### Gibran may be a poet , rather than a true prophet - but the simple truths in this book seem applicable to all religions . The short passages on love , children , pain , beauty , death and other timeless topics are full of insight and inspiration , but completely lacking in the politics and self - righteousness that pervade so many religions . This book is goodness , plain and simple , and it changed my life more than any other book I can recall reading .
5 #### Wonderful book ! Very well written and one of my favorites of all time . If you enjoy 1800s historical fiction , you have to read it ! And this particular edition is quite nice , with font that is easy on th eyes .
5 #### Those who enjoyed Jane Austen 's " Pride and Prejudice " will like this book . Not that I believe Elizabeth Gaskell is a copy of Jane Austen . The storylines are very similar but different enough to make a very enjoyable experience . It focuses on many social problems of its Victorian setting . It has also been made into a mini - series which I also recommend !
5 #### One of the best books I 've read . Makes me want to read the second two books and it looks like I may have to pay for them LOL Excellent from a historical point and the characters dealing with the threat of war , family discord and slavery and a bit of romance . Definitely recommend it .
5 #### I love the goodness and growth of the characters in this story . Beautifully written , and still applicable in our day . We all have opportunities to sink to a lower level or rise above our difficulties to make a difference for good in other 's lives .
5 #### It has been a honor to read this book . I can tell that the author put so much research into it , but not just that , he put his heart into this book . He shows us the good / bad / ugly on both sides . History is written by winners of the war , Jakes gives us an account from the losing side as well . A must read for every citizen of the United States , no matter what color you are ... take it from me ( I 'm yellow ... Japanese ) !
5 #### A little dark as are several of Gaskell 's novels , but a lovely story that deals with class conflict , personal crisis , and , of course , love .
5 #### My intention here is to comment on the quality of this reading , rather than the timeless content , the quality of which is well known . I very much enjoyed Paul Sparer 's reading . I found his rich bass voice and eloquent style ideal for Gibran and very pleasing to listen to . Unlike another reviewer , I was not at all distracted by the music ; in fact , I barely noticed it . Taste in such things is a personal issue , and for what it 's worth , this reading very much suits my tastes .
5 #### the excellent condition and speedy receipt of this product will always encourage me to purchase items from Amazon and their providers . WONDERFUL ! ! ! ! ! ! !
2 #### The book is fine . Yet , I would not have purchased this version if I had known that it lacks a table of contents . Particularly for The Prophet , most readers want to be able to jump quickly to a particular section . I want to " return " this version and buy a more expensive copy that includes a table of contents . Being brand new to the Kindle , I will now see if Amazon allows a Kindle item to be retruned for credit .
5 #### The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a book that 's been around for a while . There are many passages in the book and many basic topics on marriage , children , friendship , work and pleasure , which will touch you in one form or another .
5 #### the subjects are timeless . i especially love the reflections about children , marriage and love . in order to be understood the book should be digested slowly and thoughtfully .
5 #### Like watching an Olympic athlete or listening to an accomplished singer reading Khalil Gibran is in many ways indescribeable . In that way , it 's good that many of the other reviewers have tried to describe this book by giving anectodes of how it personally touched them . But ultimately those anectodes are like the stories of people who 've gone to some great vacation spot . Sure , they can tell you how they felt enjoying its weather or appreciating its beauty but such descriptions will never compare to you taking your own personal journey there . Because of the way this book is written , some of its passages will no doubt touch you more than others but it is beyond doubt that you will emerge touched and having that rare feeling of connecting with someone only through the medium of the printed word . I wish we could award more than five stars . I wish it could be an infinity ... for every heart touched by this wonderful , wonderful book .
4 #### I would buy from this seller again . Kahlil Gibran was a genius . " The Prophet " uses a lot of old English , but is still an easy / quick read . I can see why this book has been translated into dozens of different languages . - Definitely words to live by . A poet .
3 #### As he ( the " prophet " ) awaits the ship that will return him to his home country after fourteen years of being absent , he begins providing answers in colorful parables to questions raised by the occupants of the city he has temporarily made his home . We follow this spiritual man as the loving townspeople seek him out for wisdom . There is ultimately great sadness when he departs . I would describe these writings as poetic , philosophic prose for daily spiritual living . There are many sound words , with a relaxed style , and a somewhat universalistic belief . It is okay . Lord 's blessings Scott
5 #### This is my new favorite book ! Elizabeth Gaskell goes where Austen did n't by describing in detail complex emotions and tender observations , as well as sharing the thoughts of many of her characters , rather that just those of the heroine . Austen will always be one of my favorite classical authors but Gaskell is now at the top of my list
3 #### It was hard to read the book in a dialect , but I guess it made it more authentic . The characters were hard to relate to since they came from a different time and place . But having said that there are books of other times that I have thoroughly enjoyed .
5 #### This book is , at least in part , about a couple and their road to each other but I do n't know if I would call it a love story . The thing that makes it so incredible is that it 's about mostly the lives and politics and circumstances that intertwine to create a terribly sad , startlingly beautiful life where happiness is absolutely possible amidst so much pain . I love Margaret most of all for her complete and total honesty with others , with God , but mostly with herself . This novel is beyond expression in it 's simpler moments of humble truth .
5 #### It was very nice to read after watching the TV series . There are differences of course but the show kept to the feel of the book very well
5 #### First read this when I was 14 years old . Now several decades later , I just reread this while sitting and waiting during Karate lessons and other children 's sports / activities . It brought me back again to the mountains of Idlewild , above Palm Springs where I first read his words while at Church Camp . It brought me back to that place of center , balance and peace . Profoundly wise and insightful ..... I loved the way his words washed over me , filling all of the corners of my heart . Would recommend this to all lovers of words and soul seekers ..... of any age . This is ageless and priceless . Thanks Kahlil for another lovely visit .
5 #### I LOVE this book ... his writing seems to just flow from page to page . I get something different from this book each time I read it ..
4 #### Gibran was a great author and in this book he truly shines . I recommend this book to anyone , even if he / she is not into reading . The book is short but full of wisdom . I only gave it 4 stars because the idea of the book ( and even the title ) are taken from " Thus Spoke Zarathustra " which I gave 5 stars . So I did n't think it would be fair to give this one an equal grading . I actually recommend both books , but The Prophet is much easier to read , while Thus Spoke Zarathustra is deeper and more intelligent .
5 #### I keep a copy of this book nearby at all times for quick reference , my personal copy home to numerous marks and marginal notes . Every line reads as the most delicate of poetry , honed and refined to the purest and most undeniable words of truth and wisdom . This may be the height of human understanding , bringing a peace and solidarity which encompasses the many to make us all one .
3 #### This book is tagged as THE PROPHET by KAHLIL GIBRAN . Alas I know I 'm easily annoyed but I did n't even open the sample of this book once I saw that the title and author were in all caps . I 'm sure the text is fine but I did n't bother to look . I bought a different edition instead .
1 #### I appreciate getting the book at the great price . I 'm really not complaining but the book was quite yellow and the jacket was torn in various places . It looked like it was on the shelf for quite a while ........ Maureen
5 #### I have never read Mr Jakes books until this one . I have to rate it a five star as he is as fine an author as I have encountered . I almost set it aside in the beginning as it seemed slow going but thankfully I persisted . The characterizations are so wonderfully done I want to hate the bad and love the good ones . It is a long story but I enjoyed the journey and I 'm ready for the next book . I see many other books by Mr Jakes so my appetite for his stories can be enjoyed for a long time . North and South is a big winner
4 #### A little long and convoluted in places , and some of the dialect can be a little difficult to decipher because it is so regional . The main character can get frustrating at times ; I just wanted to shake her a little now and then . Some characters are not really explored much despite the book 's length .
5 #### This is a thrilling story of two families , one from the South and one from the North , who become friends as the two primary characters meet while students at West Point . Their experiences at school and their attitudes about slavery interact to paint a picture of how the Civil War came about . The story flows through successive generations as the families try to maintain their friendship despite the differences in beliefs . The author is a fantastic storyteller . The story flows as clearly as a movie script . I was introduced to this Author 's work many years ago by reading one of his early books " The Bastard " which I also thoroughly enjoyed . I am now reading the second book in the trilogy and find it as captivating as the first .
5 #### A subtle evaluation of gender and class attitudes prevailing in mid century 1800s England and the beginnings of management - labor cooperation .
5 #### This copy is by far the best I 've seen regarding font / type face and " readability " ( I have seen three other versions ) . This story is in my top five all time favorites and I searched for the best edition to purchase . The story is a grown up version of " Town Mouse Country Mouse " with real characters and life experiences . Mr. Thornton is by far my favorite male character . I imagine everyone could connect to this story . I 've watched the movie multiple times ( with Richard Armitage ) and the movie is amazing too .
4 #### This is an abridged version ! If your looking for unabridged , look carefully . I typed in unabridged for my search and this came up . However this story is a great one , similar to pride and prejudice but set in a different type of world and era .
3 #### I loved the movie . The written story does not flow as well . And I can imagine that many modern readers might find her prose tedious .
5 #### A very profound , deeply insightful and moving experience ! One of my two favorite books of all times . No matter how often you read it , you find something new , some new insight , some amazing revelation , some word of consolation , another stunning example of wordcraft . A masterpiece ! Inspired ! This book should not be on a book shelf in the library , office or study , but on the bedside table , and the audiobook -- on your Ipod .
5 #### Should we , could we all walk through life in such an enlightened state ? What a wonderful peaceful world it would be . How can we deny that Kahlil Gibran was directed by the Gods to deliver a message : " be as one , live in the light , love is the only answer ! " and so I paraphrase , but in truth , it is a way of life that is essential to the well - being of mankind .
5 #### I only wish I could read the original text . The simplicity and frankness , the blend of respect for the individual and appreciation of spirituality -- this is the most astonishing work I have ever read .
5 #### I was introduced to Gibran by my husband on my birthday years ago . Since that time , Gibran has helped me in many of lifes trying times . My favorite passage is by and far his writings on Children . How many times during the ' teenage ' years of raising my son , did I turn to his reminders on how to be a good ' bow ' I do n't know , but it was invaluable help . I give this book to graduates , friends who have everything , friends who have nothing after a trauma in their lives , there really is n't any opporunity that I pass up to give this book as a gift with a message included that I hope that they can find as much in this book as I have . Do n't try to read it as a ' book',it 's able to be read from any point and any topic that strikes your fancy . And by all means go back and re - read . You will find new and fuller meanings with every reading .
5 #### i read this book when i was 16 and was amazed and enlightened by its ' simple wisdom . 12 years later , and with a bit more life experience , i still am in awe of the truth contained in the pages of this book .
4 #### I read this book after seeing the BBC mini - series starring the incredible Richard Armitage and the talented Daniela Denby - Ashe . I found myself just as lost in the story of these two headstrong people as I was watching the series . The book gave more insight into the characters thoughts , doubts and fears which almost always improves on a theatrical production . The descriptions of life in Helstone , London and Milton were windows into another world of poverty , vanity and hardship that can be sadly seen today in some parts of the world . My only problem with the book was some of the language used was hard to figure out archaic almost , for example I had to Google clemming to find out it meant starving . Overall it was a wonderful story of an incredible and hard - won love that will last the test of time .
5 #### I really enjoyed this book . I had heard that John Jakes had good books . I do plan to read the other two books in the Civil War series because I do want to know how the main characters will survive the war and where the war will actually take them . I will say one thing ... I was surprised on how much people wanted to get their revenge on the Main and/or Hazard family in some way . Especially since a lot of the revenge took place with the siblings . I wo n't give anything away but I will have to say it surprised me . Even with all the " drama " I liked it .
5 #### One of the most profound books I have ever read . You can learn alot about love , life and relationships after reading this book . Very insightful .
5 #### As you read , Gibran 's poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you . Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature .
2 #### I read this about a year ago and ca n't recall a great deal of the book . From what I do recall it was like a poem all the way through . While the writing was beautiful , I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with . When Gibran speaks of God , I can not identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies . It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book . I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book . Indeed , I pulled wisdom from parts , but rather than go back and read it again , for now , perhaps I will move on to another of the many books out there that are enlightening and worth reading . Someday , I would like to read this again and dig deeper .
5 #### Anyone who has read Gibran 's book " The Prophet " should read " The Eye of the Prophet " . While the first book is the masterpiece of philosophic poetry , this one is it 's great companion in prose . Both books prescribe philosophical view on love , marriage , death , beauty -- things and topics that encircle all of our lives and experiences . The best thing one can do it to have both of these books as a tools to use and reflect in times of need , doubt and inspiration . I have read the hardcover copy of the book . I wish that hardcopy edition of the book had as many illustrations by it 's author as " The Prophet " . But alas , we only get to enjoy the one on the cover . For readers new to Gibran it is helpful to know that he was a wonderful painter in addition to his excellence in writing .
5 #### I recently read an article in The New Yorker Magazine about Kahlil Gibran , writer born in the middle east to Christian parents . Kahlil Gibran managed to immigrate to NYC with his mother and siblings . Gibran 's personal life and his early death , his exotic looks and ability to both write and paint is what attracted me to read his masterpiece " The Prophet " . It is a mystic story , written in verse , less than 100 ages long with a dozen fantastic paintings that remind of magical realism in painting . The book is a manifest on how to live , love , work , dress , embrace joy and sorrow , accept righteousness and mankind far from perfection . It is a book of duality that in the most beautiful language a young philosopher teaches the ways to live life . No matter what world , culture , continent or country one comes from , this verse is universal . If anything , this piece of work has compelled me to seek out other of Gibran 's work . I need to get into a mind of this wonderful thinker who himself led a very complicated and solitary life . It has been a long time since I read anything as beautiful and touching as this piece of literature .
5 #### This book could easily be a text for religious and non religious people to live by . Great remarks on death , love , life , or anything . Check it out .
4 #### I loved the story . However , in the kindle edition , I found a lot of typos . I also did not like the ending , as it did not flow well . All of a sudden , you knew it was going to happen ( she was going to fall in love ; I wo n't spoil it and tell you which one she picked ) , she falls in love . The story did n't seem to fully build up to the falling in love scene . I did n't follow how she came from being not in love to in love . It was a quantum leap . I almost wondered if the kindle edition left out a chapter , as it seemed like it was missing a piece .
3 #### I 'm still not sure how many stars to give this book . It is n't any great classic , but it was a very interesting story to read . I had already seen the British TV series made from it , and wanted to know the whole ' John and Margaret ' story . The movie version is the better of the two . It is difficult for a person in the 21st century to fully understand the mores , social norms and acceptable behaviors from the 19th century . I 'm still wondering why a female , especially a daughter , was not allowed or expected to attend her mother 's funeral . As for the ' John and Margaret ' story - it was enjoyable , but nothing to compare to the DVD version . I am glad I read the book . I was so curious about the story , and having that satisfied , it is now time to move on to other stories .
5 #### " A brilliant man 's philosophy on love , marriage , joy , sorrow , time , friendship and just life . Originally published in 1923 - translated into more than 20 languages . Also has drawings by Gibran ... A poetic , inspiring little book that you can read over and over again ... "
5 #### This is , by far , the most inspiring work I have ever read . The prose is so strikingly beautiful that the reader finds she must look away to regain her composure . Gibran 's take on joy and sorrow is profound and very moving : Your joy is your sorrow unmasked . And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears . And how else can it be ? The deeper that sorrow carves into your being , the more joy you can contain . Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter 's oven ? A masterpiece . If you do n't own it - you should !
5 #### I recieved this book the first time I met my father when I was a teenager . It is a gift I hold dear to this day over 30 years later . It is thought provoking . The truths are as relevant today as they were in the early 1970s .
5 #### The Prophet , for me , is a very vivid yet dense book . It speaks some sort of wisdom , and I delight in that wisdom when I can understand it . The illustrations are done by the author himself , which is nice .
5 #### This book still holds all the philosophical magic 70 years after Gibran wrote it . He managed to distill some basic truths about life and they are as applicable now as they were then .
5 #### I bought this book for my son who had his stolen from him and was in despair . He likes the beautiful poetic resonance and in looking through the book , I agree . This is a book for sensitive souls , beautifully written and illustrated by the author .
5 #### Great Civil War book . I read it many years ago and decided to get the Kindle version too . Some truth - some fiction .
4 #### John Jakes develops a complex set of characters that sets the stage for the upcoming war between the states . All in all , an enjoyable read .
5 #### Awesome journey into pre Civil War America . Jakes has a wonderful way of developing his characters and presenting them as if they are real people . Having trouble putting it down and going to sleep . I also bought the other two books in the trilogy so I have my reading plans all ready made for the the next month or so . I read this book many years ago but it 's like a new read to me .
5 #### So much death in such a short span . I felt so bad for Margaret and was frustrated the amount of time it took for her to recognize what was in front of her face the whole time . But a satisfactory ending made it worth the read .
5 #### The prophet by Kahlil Gibran is a very beautiful , inspiring writing which really resonated within me , it felt as truth . I feel that with good patience and deep contemplation , this book can lead you to a profound understanding of your own life and all others around you . I first read about Kahlil Gibran in a book called&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Lost - Teachings - of - Atlantis / dp/0966001532 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Lost Teachings of Atlantis</a > . That book answered all my spiritual questions about the meaning of Life , who and what we are and more in a very easily understandable manner and all of it corresponds with the writing of Kahlil Gibran . I HIGHLY recommend reading that book also .
3 #### Maybe I just was n't in the right mood for a heavily poetic book on one man 's life philosophies , but this book lost me after the chapter on children . Some sections are insightful and very well written . On death , children , and love were my favorites . I 'm not sure how novel these ideas were back in 1928 ( ? ) when the book was first published , but they are nothing new today . Still , the flowery language is pretty , it 's not overly long , and also it 's probably one of those books that make you look cool when your reading it at a coffee shop .... so it 's not all bad . This book was given to me by my dad who grew up in the 60 's and 70 's . It occurs to me that The Prophet seems to speak best to those from this generation ( peace , love , and all that crap ... you know ) . Maybe it 's just not relevant to me ? Maybe I need to approach it at a different time ? Maybe I need to smoke something herbal ?
5 #### This book is poetic myth , a work of beauty , whose every word drips a truth , and a thought of knowledge . Reading it is like swimming in reality but a reality I have not known , till now . Kahlil Kahlil Gibran knew something we did not , he shared a bit of the wonder of simplicity . Though this is merely the preaching of a Prophet , Gibran is able to turn it into story , and I feel from the gut for all the characters . The Prophet is unsurpassed in form , in content best when speaking of beauty , in ways I had never known , and weakest when speaking of prayer . Certainly Gibran relies on the story of Jesus , and throughout there are allusions to his words and actions . But this is a new prophet , who speaks the words of old , though it be in new wineskin .
5 #### Kahlil Gibran ( 1883 - 1931 ) , the Lebanese - American poet and mystic never wrote anything finer than this 1923 volume , his masterwork . Had he written nothing before or beyond THE PROPHET , he would still be remembered into perpetuity . Each brief chapter of THE PROPHET addresses an aspect of the human condition , including Love , Marriage , Work , Pleasure , Buying and Selling , Children , Eating and Drinking , to name but a few . Gibran espouses no particular religious , ethical or moral system , and yet includes them all in this slim tome , written it seems , with a quill of light , not ink . A Higher Power ( by whatever name you may call it ) spoke through Gibran in the writing , a perfect letter to the ages , and an ultimate expression of Humanity .
4 #### Kahlil Gibran 's THE PROPHET is a singular book . Clearly inspired by a Higher Power ( by any name we wish to call it ) the author 's quill was dipped in light , not ink as he wrote . Such is the substance of what is written on the page . The simple elegance of the language of THE PROPHET very much lends itself to public readings , and there have been many audio recordings of THE PROPHET released over the years . This is one of the more unremarkable ones . Reader Paul Sparer has an impressive stentorian voice , but his habit of interjecting unnecessary rococo flourishes in his speech detracts from this recording . THE PROPHET needs no such flourishes . He also reads too quickly , giving the listener little time to absorb the words . Nor does this recording need the inconsistent moments of flute music between chapters , especially as the playing is both shrill and tuneless . More consistency and less stridency ( and perhaps some lute notes ) might have added to this recording rather than diminished it . This recording comes on 2 CDs , split very unevenly . A better quality product could have this book entirely on one disc . The reading and packaging is merely average . The material , however , is not . THREE AND A HALF STARS for the CD , FIVE BY FIVE for Gibran 's genius .
4 #### The Prophet is an elegant and beautifully crafted piece of art that eloquently states Universal Truths concerning all pertinent aspects of ourlive . These include love , death , justice , art , etc . It 's divine poetr that could have only been inspired by the creator of this magnificent world . Highly recommended .
5 #### Seldom has there been a book that I have read time and time again as much as this one . I have given this book numerous times to people as a small gift . I have used this book in my son 's christening when he was a baby and on numerous holidays . These words are every bit as relevant when they were written . For all time , this book still ranks in my top 5 .
5 #### Both me and my girls love this book , and it has had an amazing effect on their understanding of what is what in life . My girls at time of writing this are 2 and nearly 4 - and they have got to grips with the concept of what is he and she but also what it means . It has helped explain to ( well at least to the 4 year old ) that only men are he and women are she - but that pretty much everything is open to them from there on in . I really like that in a book . It is a fun poem with brightly coloured illustrations - and the wonderfully rounded Berenstain Bears which they evolved in their later illustrations . Nice book for 2 and Up I would say . ( I do love most of the Berenstain books by the way and so do my kids )
5 #### I absolutely loved the narration of this book . Juliet Stevenson does an excellent job and it 's one of my favorite books as well .
5 #### North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell 4.5 stars and favorite I saw the BBC film with Richard Armitage and loved it . I got the ebook for free on my kindle when I first got it 3 years ago . So it 's been on my tbr list forever . It 's a good story and similar to Pride and Prejudice . This case being prejudices of social environments vs the North and South of England in the 19th century . Farm - life vs Mill Factories . And I think it 's more realistic than Jane Austen , for while Jane uses society as a parody , Elizabeth uses it in a realistic way . And it 's interesting to have both the heroine and heroes points - of - view ( while still in 3rd person ) . Really loved John Thornton ! !
4 #### This book is hard to put down . The characters are well - developed . This is a good read before you watch " Gone With the Wind " again .
5 #### This is the second book by this author I 've read . It gives insights into our every day lives . I found a lot of quotations I 'd like to post on the walls in the classroom where I teach . All the writings of K. Gibran carry a deeply spiritual information . His teachings are very tightly intertwined with Christian values . I highly recommend this book to understand and open our knowledge of Christian Religion all over the world .
5 #### This was purchased as a gift to a friend who had just lost a dear friend and I was pleased that she found as much comfort in his words as I , and my family , have for many years . A must have for any home library .
5 #### This is an amazing book of poetry ... even if it is written more like prose . It is definitely one of my favorite books and I think that Gibran defines what the word poetry means in his writing of this book . Definitely written with the divine hand . I like it better than Rumi or Hafiz .
5 #### This book is for anyone of any religion . I was first introduced to this book at the age of 18 and have every word memorized . I refer to his words daily . Kahlil Gibrans serene nature gives light to the words of ' The Prophet ' and will touch you .
5 #### I consider this book one of my favorite reads .
5 #### well written and full of suspense this book carries you on a journey you wo n't soon forget . buy it- devour it , you wo n't be sorry
3 #### I saw the PBS movie made from this book and enjoyed that more than the actually book . The author is a bit wordy for my taste , but I wanted to read the actual book and I did . I have also bought a couple more books by Elizabeth Gaskell , but have not read them yet .
5 #### If you love History this is your book . I loved all the play on your emotions . Makes you think about your friends and how the war changed the lives of some people .
5 #### Great book with classic children writing . When there is a girl and boy in the family , this is a really good addition to their library .
5 #### For my toddler grandson to be read , and then later to read .
5 #### A feminist 's dream . He bear AND she bear can do anything ! !
5 #### Great book for pronouns at preschool level . My three year olds really like it .
2 #### I got this book because I try to provide gender neutral toy options and want my daughter to know she can chose anything to be or to play with . This book shows the male and female bear are able to do and be all the same things , HOWEVER .... every activity in the book is a stereotypically " male activity " . that 's great to show her she can be a truck driver , construction worker , painter , etc . But if I had a son I would be pretty annoyed at this book . Boys can sew and cook and be nurses and teachers too ! I expected to see both typical male and female activities to show kids that occupations and activities are not gender restrictive . This book only shows that women can do " manly " type jobs ... not the other way around . there 's literally not a single example of a typical " female " role or job in this book . I was incredibly disappointed . I would absolutely NOT recommend this book if you 're looking for something about gender equality . especially not for a male child !
5 #### I 've always been wary of stories claiming ownership of principles of truth and wisdom , and attempting to package them in tidy , marketable portions for mass consumption . However , I found this novella unique and unpretentious in it 's delivery of many truths that at first glance may appear intuitive , but in reality escape me in the daily practice of my life . It was a well - written , thought - provoking tale that helped me focus on the most important things of my daily life .
5 #### Inspirational and true teachings about various aspects of life are what you will find when you read this beautiful book . The book is short , 96 pages , and includes artwork by the author . The short chapters begin with various people ( a ploughman , a judge , a woman , a rich man , an old priest , a mason , a hermit , etc.)asking the mystic to speak about different subjects of life , such as : On Beauty , On Good and Evil , On Marriage , On Joy and sorrow , on friendship , and many more ) I have to say that if I had come across this book much earlier in my life , I know I would not have understood or appreciated the beauty of it . I mentioned a quote from this book to a friend once who told me that her mother in law gave her the book years ago , and she had never read it . I told her what a treasure it was and after ( finally ) reading it , she loved it too . There is so much wisdom here to learn from . This is an incredible book !
5 #### I 'm already into the second of the trilogy and expect to read the third .
5 #### Daughter loved the book she read it in two days .
5 #### It 's one of my son 's favorite books . Just a book about how it does n't matter if you are a boy or a girl , you can do anything !
2 #### My son loves this books , especially the page with the fish on it . Unfortunately , that is just one of the many pages left out of this book becuase it is a board book . I did not realize publishers cut so many pages from these types of books .
5 #### They pretty much love any Berenstain Bear books . This one has bright artwork that keeps your eyes busy . They board pages are perfect for my 1 year old and small enough for her hands .
5 #### The 2 and 1/2 year old loves this book and is able to grasp its theme . The overall message = you can hold almost any profession you want regardless of gender . The book puts emphasis on determination and an attitude of " the sky is the limit " which is important in shaping the young minds of boys and girls everywhere . Great pictures throughout the book , very pleased with this selection .
5 #### I am a speech therapist and work in the schools . Kids love these stories and it helps to not only learn pronouns ( especially for my English learning kiddos who have difficulty differentiating he / she ) but there are great vocabulary concepts in here . Great buy .
4 #### This is a book that has been extremely difficult to find as it has been out of print for several years . I used to read to my nephews when they were just little guys . It has humor and rhythm and great pictures . It appeals to both boys and girls . I needed a few copies to pass on to the next generation . Some day I hope to find it in the hardbound edition as the board edition leaves out a few stanzas , to simplify it for the toddlers . The used copies are a bit scuffed - obviously loved - and I am glad I was able to give them to new homes .
5 #### My mother read this book a long time ago and recommended it to me but I never read it . I just recentlyu read in ( June 2006 ) and glad I finally did . This book short essays on the different aspects of life . These are teachings and they are meant to inspire and advise . They are written in such a way so that the words are not rammed down your throat .
5 #### It is a true masterpiece in which almost every , if not every word counts . I have read it over and over again , since a girlfriend gave me a copy just before I left for Berkeley to attend law school . I have given copies to many friends , and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully . There is enormous wisdom in each chapter , especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live - which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings . Gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of Life , and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century . This book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what Life is really all about . Indeed , it can be picked up at any age , and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written . I urge anyone , who is thinking about buying it , to do so . Just peruse a copy at a local bookstore or library , and you are apt to become enthralled . It may take several readings to soak up its essence ; and even after many years , I still find nuances and learn more each time I reread it .
5 #### If your ship has run aground and you are looking for inspiration to continue your journey , this book is for you . Sensuous , seductive , and profound , this poetic beauty is nectar for the gods .
5 #### Gibran Khalil Gibran was born in 1883 in what is now Northern Lebanon . In 1909 he went to Paris to study , but he did not like the strict education , and so he traveled , eventually moving to New York . Gibran became both an artist and a writer , and in 1923 he published " The Prophet " , which is generally considered to be his greatest work . He died of cancer in a New York hospital at the very young age of 48 . The Prophet is a story about Almustafa ( The Prophet ) who after living 12 years in Orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home . Before he goes , a group of people stop him , and to them he teaches the secrets of life . Gibran writes in a very poetic manner , and it is wonderful to read .
5 #### I read this book when first published . I enjoyed reading it this time every bit as much . These characters are so full of life and you feel as if you know them .
5 #### This is the start of a great trilogy . If you have only seen the tv mini - series , then please do yourself a favor and read this . Then read the rest of the trilogy . I think the second novel , Love and War , is the better of the three , but maybe that 's because I love the Cousin Charles character so much . John Jake 's writes huge splendid masterpieces , and I think this is his best .
4 #### This is the first book I have read by Gaskell . She is more Bronte than Austen . Very sincere . Her attempt at capturing local dialect is a bit hard to read but kudoos for trying . Margaret Hale is often wrong and a terrible snob but she grows and changes and adapts .
5 #### Fascinating book . I could n't put it down . I would highly recommend it ..
5 #### Typical John Jakes . If you liked the Kent family chronicles , you will like this . Personalized accounts of historical events with plenty of blood and Gore and romance .
4 #### First of the trilogy . Found the storytelling to be first class . Will read the next one soon . Highly recommend this book .
4 #### My first experience with North and South was through the BBC series . I loved it . So when I started the Avid Reader Challenge 2015 I jumped at the chance to finally read the book . I was not dissapointed . It 's such a strong story with harsh circumstances yet it warms the heart and freshens the soul . It 's not an easy read , as most classics are n't , but its worth wading through . If you 've watched the series you still need to read the book because there are so many details and scenes that got left out in the show . If you 've read the book but have n't watched the series do n't delay . It was beautiful done ! Matter of fact , I only gave the book a 4 star rating because I prefer the ending the series had vs the book .
5 #### Great addition to the little ones collection of Berenstain Bears Books . She loves watching the cartoons and reading the books .
3 #### I love this story and have it in the hardcover version . I recently purchased it for a friend that was having twins ( thought it would be appropriate ! ) , while I was reading it with my 3 year old granddaughter she noticed that some of the pages were missing from the original version . I just think that it should be noted in the description that this book is a condensed version . It makes a person feel cheated .
4 #### I loved Berenstain Bears books as a kid , so I wanted to find some BB board books for my 18 - month - old twin boys . This was the only board book I found . It 's cute and simple and my boys like it ; I just wish more of the Berenstain Bears books were made in board book form !
5 #### A female and male bear explore a variety of things they can be besides being parents . Delightfully rhyming the book affirms abilities of girls and boys . This was a favorite of my children . ( This review was previously published in " Daughters of Sarah " Nov / Dec 1986 . )
5 #### I have always been a fan of the Berenstain Bear Books through my own children . My 18 - month old granddaughter does n't sit long enough to listen to most books . However , this shortened , board book is just the right length for her . It does not have as many pages as the regular book of the same name . The words on each page are minimal . She even " reads " along with me . It is of a size that she can easily hold in her own hands . I also do n't need to worry about her tearing the pages .
5 #### A great rhyming Berenstain Bears book for young readers , it teaches the difference between he and she and it also teaches about equality of sexes , how both girls and boys can do practically anything regardless of their sex except for being a dad or a mom : " Dad 's a he / mom 's a she / those are things / that we could be / just because we 're he and she./But there are other things to be .... " It also teaches kids that they can do anything they want : " be a doctor / make folks well / teach kids how to add and spell ... " and can be a first approach to professions . All in all , a great buy . My 3 y.o . son enjoys this book very much , and it 's not very long so it 's a good option for when you do n't feel like reading a longer story ...
5 #### My kid has totally fallen in love with this book . The illustrations are great and he looks at every little detail . He is only 17 months old , so I doubt if he understands the concept , but he likes to read this book . He points to the He Bear and says papa and the She Bear and says Mama ! There is enough to keep him engaged for 15 mins . I would love it if it were a board book .
5 #### Our son and daughter , ages five and three , have been pulling this book off the shelves at least a couple times each month over the past two years . It still appeals to them because the characters imagine themselves participating in many exciting activities such as flying a jet , making a mess or ' taming twelve tigers . ' Gender issues are just one aspect of this fast paced , wide ranging book .
5 #### Anything I 've read by Gibran is , in my mind , flawless . This , the most famous of his works , is no exception . It is simple , yet deep ; honest and profound ; moving and inspirational . Gibran 's work is one of a kind , and can be far more encouraging and moving than any self - help program or therapy or anything like that . The poetic style , the aphorisms , the parables , the almost biblical feel , are all just what over - worked , over - stressed , modern and spiritually starved worldly people need .
5 #### This is a very beautiful book . It contains a lovely section on marriage , emphazing the importance of seperate identities between lovers .
5 #### This is a very usefull book that can be used as a secondary source for your primary religious texts . Not only does it give you excellent prophetic sayings , but when reading anyone could have a diffrent interpretation . Here is some things you could look to find : -Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding . -Say not , " I have found the truth , " but rather , " I have found a truth . " -Say not , " I have found the path of the soul , " but rather , " I have met the soul walking upon my path . " For the soul walks upon all paths . -You talk when you cease to be at peace with your thoughts . -For what is evil , but good tortured by it 's own hunger and thurst . -And beauty is not a need , but an ecstasy . -Who can seperate his faith from his actions , or his belief from his occupation . -To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconsistency . -No man can reveal to you aught but that wich is already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge . -If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of his wisdom , but rather leads you to the threshhold of your own mind . -And even as each of you stands alone in god 's knowledge , so must each of you be alone in his knowledge of God and his understanding of the earth .
4 #### A very good read . While a novel you will come away with much historical knowledge about the Civil war . The author holds your interest from start to finish .
5 #### North and South is about the Mains and the Hazzards . While the prologue gives how each family ended up in America , the book really gets started on the day that George Hazzard and Orrie Main meet each other on their journey to West Point . A few years before the tensions between the North and South really start to explode they become fast friends . But they also make a mutual enemy at school who appears to single them out in particular . Throughout the course of the book they and even later their family members have memorable runs in with the man . The two men remain friends despite occassional tensions in their own friendships because of their differing beliefs . Also why George finds love pretty easily once he experiences it , Orrie has a much harder time of it as the woman he loves belongs to another . But with her realizing her husband 's true nature could there be hope for them some other day . With such a broad sweep of history that takes place from 1842 - 1861 there is much American history to experience . One caution though to someone in reading this book as it is quite long to make sure that you either have lots of time to read or do n't mind spending a couple weeks with the characters . But John Jakes writes really sweeping and well written historical novels .
4 #### An engaging novel of England in the industrial revolution , giving a good understanding of the class differences between the gentry in the south of England , and the peopIe engaged in trade and industry in the north . I enjoyed the characters a great deal , especially the inhabitants of Milton . I was frustrated by Margaret 's inability to speak her own feelings , but I suppose that was typical of the Victorian era . I was also unhappy with the ending ... it happened much to fast to satisfy the suspense that had built up throughout the book . Beautiful writing , though , and well worth reading .
5 #### Liked this even more than Wives and Daughters . Part of this is that the characters are all a bit stronger and more direct ( the female protagonist Margaret Hale is spunky like Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice ) . But part is , too , that there are underlying economic themes like labor and capital and economic prosperity as opposed to quality of life that are still topical today . Well worth the time .
5 #### One of my favorites . A beautiful story . LOVE IT .
5 #### Mr. Thornton is to Elizabeth Gaskell as Mr. Darcy is to Jane Austen ... It was so lovely , I read it twice .
4 #### Saw the mini series on TV years ago and now reading the trilogy . I enjoyed this first one and looking forward to the other two ..
5 #### Very captivating . Both sides well presented , making one feel a certain sympathy for both sides , while regretting that our country had to undergo such tragedy .
5 #### Myself , and my whole Family started with " The Kent Family Chronicles " in the mid-70 's , and then shared every Not Jake 's novel we could find . We also enjoyed all the excellent mini - series that stemmed from those books . Rereading North and South has brought back the memories of both those years of Family life , as well as regaining my appreciation of Mr Jake 's fine writings .
5 #### Have you ever read a line , first you feel the language is beautiful and next a thought , even a reality hits you ? And even after you have finished , the message keeps playing on and on in your mind ? Well , this book is one of them ( if you have luckily found other books by other author ) . It is the exploration of self , soul , community , nature , and universe . No matter what religion you hold , from where you came or who / what you are . This is a book for every human being to know and keep in perspective what they are doing everyday .
5 #### " The Prophet " is a supreme literary achievement that has impacted millions of people around the globe . The Prophet has been translated into many languages and has sold millions of copies . Gibran 's chef - d'oeuvre will provide the reader with an ecstatic , refined , and transcending literary experience ! ! !
2 #### I picked up this book after being inspired by some quotes from Kahlil Gibran . This is a brief text written in a flowery language that masks some simple points . I did not find this book inspiring or insightful , but it was a short read .
5 #### At least 6 out of 5 stars ! " The deeper that sorrow carves into your being , the more joy you can contain " , is my favourite quote from this classic book of magical mystical poetry and philosophy . There is insight and wisdom on every page . 25 years after someone first leant me a copy , it seems to have more relevance to life 's fundamental challenges than ever . Kahlil Gibran tells the story of Almastafa 's departure from the city of Orphalese . As he leaves , the prophet ( Almastafa ) shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience . " Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding " , " Work is love made visible " , " And think not that you can direct the course of love , for love , if it finds you worthy , directs your course " . However " The Prophet " is much more than a few inspiring self - help quotes . More a case of some of the deepest Eastern wisdom , universally applicable to the human condition . Long may it continue to inspire countless numbers of people around the world .
5 #### This book was recommended to me by a friend . What he told me of it is that , just as The Art of War , this is the book from which you take out whatever you want . What you find in it depends as much on the book as it does on you . It speaks of love , life and people in the most touching way ever . I have it in my handbag at all times . When I first read it , I cried . There is literally something mystical about it . I like to think I took a lot out of it . One of those books you should read again and again and again ..
5 #### This is one of the best , most inspiring philosophy / poetry books ever written ! I have read it over and over , though never tire of it . It is a great reminder for what 's most important in life and puts everything in perspective . My favorite ' chapters ' are Love , Marriage , Children and The first look . I am a romantic though , so the other chapters may appeal to you more .... ;- ) Absolutely classic and timeless . Perfectly stands the test of time . My personal copy is from 1948 and is one of my favorite treasures .
5 #### Loved the movie . Got book for my son . Scared him away with all those pages ! Lol
5 #### One of the best books I 've ever read . I recommend the entire set and anything else John Jakes has written .
4 #### I have been on the fence about reading North and South for awhile since I was n't sure if all books in the trilogy would appeal to me . After I caught a great audible sale I ended up with book one in the trilogy . It took me awhile to decide on a rating for this book , but I have settled on a solid 3.5 for a few reasons . While I loved the building up of the friendship between George and Orry , I could not STAND that every villian was either obese , sex crazed , or had homosexual tendencies . As if weight issues and sexuality that is n't " the norm " mean you are evil . Also the cartoonish vindictiveness of these " bad guys " was ridiculous . That said I did enjoy this book because it was well written and engaging . I 'm eager to purchase book 2 in the series and I will add that I think the book did a great job exploring what led to the beginning of the civil war .
4 #### This book was the first and only I 've read by Kahlil Gibran . Every chapter offers insight and philosophy on almost every subject that a person can think about . From death to love to marriage to friendship Kahlil Gibran offers a very sensitive view of all aspects of life . I 've reread it many times .
5 #### It 's a thin book which has deep thoughts about topics like love , generosity , death , prayer , etc . It can be read again and again because it is thin while at the sametime it contains so many words of wisdon .
5 #### My father has this huge book collection and I remember I was around 12 when I found this book amidst a sea of books and I thought it was pretty small , so I read it in one sit ... It changed my life . It talks about life , love , friendship , death , etc . All of these answers that you spend your entire life searching for ... are in this book . It tells you all of these things that you already know about life , but somehow we keep in the back of our heads so we do n't have to do the right thing , as if ignoring them will make us more human by default . There is no place that I go that this book does n't follow me . I remember in college having this teacher that I despised so much and the class was talking about their favorite book and when it came my turn I said " The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran " and she got all excited too and said " That 's my favorite book too , it 's like my Bible" ... I remember thinking " How can I have something that is so important to me in common with someone that I despise?" ... I guess that 's the thing about life ... I will never forget that or her ...
3 #### I originally read this early in college and did n't think it was anything special then . I saw it recently in a used bookstore for two bucks , so I bought it . It took about an hour to read . There were about a dozen short passages I underlined . Most of them were n't really revelations , but rather really good analogies I liked or uniquely descriptive ways of presenting commonly known truths .
5 #### Reminiscient of the Bible , but universal in it 's appeal . Advice on how to act and live and believe . This book was written in 1923 , but is timeless in the wisdom of which it speaks . I would recommend this book as a gift for someone you know who is going through times of difficulty , or adversity , no matter their religious beliefs .
5 #### If I have ever read a book that is timeless , other than the Word of God , it would have to be this one . Although I may not have agreed with every word written , so many of the words of wisdom within these pages brought peace and comfort to me . I read this book many , many years ago . I quoted from it at times and thought of it often . The words seemed to wrap themselves around your heart and spring out in times of need . There are not many books that can stake that claim , and I have read many . A classic in my opinion and a book that will never be outdated . Recommended .
5 #### I was given this book by a writer friend who called it " the most beautiful book I 've ever read . " So , since she and I have similar literary tastes , I was inclined to read it . This little book , written in a rich , colorful , deep , and wise poetic style , is full of some of the most moving and impressive spiritual phrases and messages I 've ever read . It was written in 1923 but its poetry and wisdom are timeless . David Rehak author of " Poems From My Bleeding Heart "
5 #### This is a book you can read and re - read many many times . Great and timeless thoughts about relationships , love and friendship . I will share this with my family . :) Jeffrey C. McAndrew author of " Our Brown Eyed Boy "
5 #### Those of us sad that Austen only left us six novels can rejoice in the discovery of Elizabeth Gaskell , who , though writing at a later period , satisfies our desire for a strong heroine and a complicated love story with North and South . She also gives us a greater social consciousness as she delves into the conflicts between the working and merchant classes that so characterized the first half of the British 19th century . An excellent novel that will reward the reader fully .
3 #### There were many good things about this novel such as the struggle within each character to define his position . However i never got to like the main character , Margaret was supposedly intelligent ; yet she never was independent in her actions . She doted on her parents who demanded certain errands . She never understood the Industrial revolution .
5 #### Book is very good , somewhat different than mini - series , but a wonderful love story .
5 #### I am so happy that I got this book because I plan on reading it over and over again for years to come , I was completely caught up in the lives of Margaret Hale and Mr. John Thornton along with the people they meet along the way , there were certain moments in the story that made me teary - eyed and the ending did not disappoint I truly enjoyed this story and I already ca n't wait to read it again .
5 #### I saw the movie first then i read the book . Even if the book it is good , I still like the changes made on the adaptation by BBC . But it is a good book to read .
5 #### Gibran wrote the ultimate way of seeing life and living in it . the importance of each relationship . The book was written to be relatable to every reader , all the subjects are mondain . The availability of this book is a great advantage that I do n't think people are aware of . It 's an hour long to read , but a lifetime to understand , if you read it you 'll remember it in every new life matter or relationship . Buy it and keep it on the shelve for reference , it 's an answer to everything . and read it carefully .
5 #### This is one my must have books . It is a masterpiece of spirituality . I 'll be the first to admit , its literary quality is n't much . It is rather simplistically written , but the message behind it is so powerful that you have to read it . It will take you to enlightenment .
5 #### This book is everything that is simple , delicate , true , and beautiful . I have read few books so touching and enlightening ; " The Prophet " is a true masterpiece that has that feeling of ancient wisdom in it . The wisdom of the text is gentle , yet insistent , it lets you understand things you 've always known . My feelings defy description .
5 #### Reading a classic such as " The Prophet " is much more fruitful when it is revisited often , the lessons are applied and the reader reads as if Gibran is writing only to him or her . Sitting with this book in your hands can be like sitting across from Gibran , listening to him speak . The accompanying art work also by Gibran gives it yet another rich element and peek into the soul of this incredible writer . Listen , embrace and breathe in these words . Open your mind and heart to The Prophet .
5 #### Great little book full of ( seemingly ) common sense . Should be read by any judgemental person or religomanic . Should be cheaper !
5 #### Khalil Gibran 's The Prophet is a truly awe inspiring work of prosaic poetry . Despite being a native - born Arabic speaker , Gibran wrote The Prophet in English , ensuring that his powerful words lost nothing in translation . The work 's 28 short chapters recount the words of a prophet as he leaves his home to depart on a new journey . The words that flow from the prophet 's mouth and onto the pages are philosophical and spiritual treatises on all aspects of life . Chapters discuss the range of human experiences and include discussions such as " On Friendship " , " On Pain " and " On Death . " What unites the 28 chapters is Gibran 's thought provoking and probing literary style as Gibran 's prophet invokes his listeners to live life to the fullest . The book is not overtly religious but every word and sentence is filled with a spiritual clarity . The book is eminently quotable with every chapter providing a nugget of truth worthy of repeating . Amazingly , Gibran packs his masterpiece into less than 100 pages , making it a very quick and easy read . Readers will find themselves returning to The Prophet again and again to recapture the beauty of Gibran 's words . The Prophet , which Gibran himself recognized as his greatest masterpiece , is a timeless literary classic . Its truth has touched generations of readers and will undoubtedly continue to do so .
5 #### I was given this book as a high school graduation gift and I have found it to be the book I look to in hard times as well as good times , for advise , inspiration , hope and words of wisdom . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Mr. Gibran has begets a master piece . His splendor writing style is amazing and the eloquent use of the words are moving force which forever will be a guiding light for our souls .
5 #### I read it in an hour . Kahlil Gibran is definitely the people 's philosopher . The book itself seems to be written on impulse , and the author knows what the modern world is looking for . The context is powerful and sensitive , and more than anything it 's the truth .
5 #### This is Elizabeth Gaskell at her best . North and South is the story of Margaret Hale , the daughter of a middle - class parson who is moved from a privileged upbringing in a rural town near London in the south of England to live in the town of Milton , an industrial mill - town in the north in the throes of the Industrial Revolution . This is a story of contrast : the perception that people in the north are rough , ignorant , and rude - nothing like the cultured and educated people in the more genteel south of England . The mill owners , epitomized by John Thornton , appear at their most appalling , as hard hearted and money - hungry tyrants . The perception is that mill owners view workers only as cogs on the mill wheel ; workers view the owners as unsympathetic and tyrannical . There is great distinction between rich and poor . Conflict is everywhere and Margaret is drawn into the midst of it . Gradually as she gets to know the people , mill owners and workers , she becomes a catalyst for change - a change that leads to reconciliation and eventually , and unexpectedly , love . The great thing about Gaskell 's novel is that she writes of her characters as real people . She was writing at the same time as Charles Dickens and Charlotte Bronte but handles her plot and characterization very differently . Masters are all bad and the working poor are not all good .
5 #### Great yarn . Interesting characters and exciting events . A great way to relearn American History now that I 've moved to Virginia where it all began !
2 #### I started reading the book but could not get " into " it , so have not tried to read it again .
5 #### Wow , I really liked this book . After reading all of Jane Austen I did not know that another author existed that could make their time period come alive . I even liked the mini - series of the same title .
5 #### Pure mastery in words revealing the essence of life . Very simply , this book speaks to everyone . It does n't matter who you are or what you believe . It brings tears to me each time I read it , because if your mind is open , you will achieve a feeling of higher existence upon completion of your reading . I hope you will take that understanding and infuse it within all you do . I also recommend listening to Richard Harris ' reading of this book , though it may be out of print these days .
5 #### A timeless classic . It is a very demanding and assuming title , but Gibran backs it up with some excellent style and content . If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier , he could have inspired a new religion . From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination , we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it . It is a messege . A guide book . A Sufi sermon . Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma . There is much that hints at his birth place , Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely . Probably becuase it was written in English originally , the writing flows , it is pleasant to read , and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus . I loved the cover .
3 #### An unusual departure of an imaginary prophet ... Saying goodbye , his people gather around him asking about human nature and life ! ! The dialogue takes the form of questions and answers ... which makes it a little monotonous ... but the poetic language and the symbolic style of explanation takes your mind away and makes you wonder impatiently what the next question will be ! ! An inspiring revelation of truths ... " Love one another , but make not a bond of love ... Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music "
5 #### Eloquent and full of divine wisdom , this little treatise packs more truth into 96 pages than you 're going to find anywhere else . I 'll continue to read passages each morning just to remind myself of the beauty and magic of life .
5 #### I recently reread this after many years and found the words to resonate with wisdom and spiritual centeredness . The book can be enjoyed and read with profit by people from all faiths and traditions . Each will find some treasure that speaks to their heart . There is nothing in THE PROPHET that would contradict or conflict with any of the sacred texts of the world 's major religions . It somehow encompasses the teachings of all of them in a secular and beautiful work of literature .
5 #### Gibran 's words strike as deep and sudden as lightning , and lay bare to you , with unbelievable simplicity , the truths of human life . And they do so beautifully . To read this book is to enrich yourself , enlighten yourself , and to enjoy some of the most beautiful words ever written . Gibran 's accompanying drawings are as mystical and moving as his words , and accentuate the utterances of the Prophet . The sheer wisdom and beauty of this little book is undeniable . All hail the Prophet .
5 #### The Prophet dispenses ultimate wisdom to his loved ones as he bids fare well . Khalil Gibran defines all that I never had words to define , or more appropriately , did not have the good sense to define . I discovered this book a while back and took a long time to read it since I refused to rush through it . I read it a lesson at a time , understanding it to the best of my ability . I found a way of life in these words . I could read it everyday and each time these words would dispense a new lesson ... like a never ending treasure .
5 #### Certainly the words are of Kahlil Gibran , but the eternally PRESENT divine wisdom told through his words is from the source of all sources . Only those who are ready to receive the divine wisdom are destined to read and know the meaning behind the meanings of his words . This is one of the five most valued books that I keep on refering again and again for solace and peace of MYSELF . While writing - or rather while being an instrument to write this book - Kahlil Gibran must have reached the original source of all the knowledge and wisdom available to humankind . Gibran 's book is music , poetry , wisdom and truth - all at the same time ! I salute Kahlil Gibran for giving us the " THE PROPHET " .
5 #### I read this book several times and find new things everytime I read it again
4 #### This book is very well written and it takes the reader on quite the literary journey ! I must admit the dialect spoken in Milton by characters including Nicholas Higgins was a bit hard to follow at times ( ie ' hoo ' ) , but i generally still got the gist of what was being communicated by Northern characters . Many many deaths experienced by the main character , and a big surprise ending just when i had almost lost hope ! !
4 #### I think it 's well written . The characters are really well fleshed out and I really like the two main characters , Margaret Hale and John Thornton . Since I watched the TV series before I read the book , it makes the book more enjoyable because I have a visual already in my head .
5 #### John Jakes is a master at historical fiction . I am a transplanted Yankee living in South Carolina , and found the viewpoints of SC citizens so interesting . I have visited so many of these cities , which made the story even more poignant I learned much about the Civil War , and recommend this book highly .
5 #### I wish I would have read this before I watched the BBC version of it on Netflix ( I always prefer reading a story prior to seeing the movie ! ) but this is a great book - a classic and a decent version to read -- especially for free ! ! !
4 #### I enjoyed this book . I would like to read the other two in the series .
1 #### I 've been rereading my Alistair Maclean collection ( meaning all of them . ) Elsie Wilson 's earlier review is dead on except it left out an important fact : Nothing happens in this book . There is no climax ; the denouement is less than a paragraph . The book has more talking than exposition ( it has no action , so I went with the next best comparison . ) On top of that , it makes no sense . Characters change locations for no discernible reasons . The villain has no real plan . At the end , the hero tells everyone that he already knew everything . Then why did you risk so many innocent lives , including that of your sister ? In the end , it 's a silly book , but not Maclean 's worse . Read it only if you must read all of Maclean .
2 #### Amsterdam Airport - the best in Europe - is flooded . Some planes are still floating aimlessly around . Some have sunk out of sight their tail - planes sticking up above the water , scattered at random over a large area of the airfield . The wall of water was the work of the terrorist movement FFF - an Irish organisation who want to force Britain 's hand . Detective Lieutenant van Effen is called in , a feared interrogator and undercover intimate of the criminal Krakers gang to sabotage the FFF plan . If van Effen fails and the FFF get control over the vital dyke , either Holland will sink beneath the sea or Britain will be awash with blood .
4 #### My brother and I first discovered this book lying around the house years ago , and to this day we still pick it up every now and then , read it from cover to cover , and enjoy it immensely . The plot is interesting , the writing is witty , and the characters are engaging , especially Lieutenant Peter van Effen , with his many talents and his decrepit car , and his rather fuzzy - minded boss , the Chief of Police de Graaf . As another reviewer mentioned , the book ends on a calmer note than one would expect , but it does n't disappoint . And my brother and I still put it down thoroughly satisfied every time .
4 #### Another great detective novel by the master ! Probably one of his best works . The suspense in the book picks up from the first page and does not leave until the very end . The action is mostly fast - paced , but slows down in some places . The book 's end is unexpected in a manner that the reader of a suspense novel expects a shart teist of plot at the end , but it never comes and the book ends on a rather calm note . The main hero is , as usual , a very heroic character , occupied by a beautiful woman who is full of love for him , a love that becomes mutual at the end ... Over all the book is a typical MacLean story .
2 #### Formulaic MacLean story . Starts with Amsterdam airoport flooded , as a way of getting the readers ' attention , moves to further floods ( dikes blasted ) in the Netherlands and threats of even more , as a way of drawing attention to the terrorists ' demands . The hero is a typical MacLean hero , just a little too good , fluent in languages , explosives , criminal behaiviour , organisation , self - confidence , yet still not the top man in his organisation ( the Amsterdam police force ) ; a natural gentleman , concerned for and afraid of his sister . The ladies in the novel are simply the most beautiful available or imaginable ; and perfect ladies . The government figures are , except for one , dolts and incapable of understanding a simple statement . The terrorists are , in this case , fighting for a worthy ulitmate cause , though their methods are to be despised and themselves destroyed . Just happens , though , that the leader is a son of an English earl and , in his own way , to be pitied also . It is as though MacLean got tired of writing , towards the end of his career , the original , inventive , and clever plots such as " H.M.S. Ulysses " and " The Guns of Navarone " and instead took the most successful portions of some of his other tales and fit them into a basic plot outline . Sad to say about MacLean , whom i loved at one stage in my life , reading everything i could find of his , but this is nowhere near his peak ability .
5 #### This belongs in EVERY spiritual persons home library . Easy reading on easy spiritual truths ! ! !
5 #### Intrinsically , this book utilizes a flowing a cleaver way to express the ideological interpretations of the author . While , personally , I found nothing profound in the ideologies expressed in the book , I did find it , simply a pleasure to read . Even with the lack of philosophical epiphany , the style of the book in its fluid manner , the parallel structure of the chapters , and the brevity combined with the larger font in the piece , leave the reader , whether they agree with the philosophies therein or not , in a state of solemn peace and the feeling that they have not wasted their time . As , really , they probably have not , it really did not waste my time anyway ; it only took a little over an hour to read ( with breaks ) .
5 #### I would have to say that this is the best book I 've ever read .. I could feel every word deep in my heart everytime , of the many times I 've read it ! I would never get enough of it ! its a treasure ..
4 #### I have long been a fan of Historical Fiction because I hated history in formal classes because of the memorization required to pass tests . Historical fiction enables learning history in an enjoyable way , without a test looming . John Jake 's North & South has taught me so.much about the circumstances that led to the Civil War , the thoughts and feelings of the PEOPLE on both sides through the eyes of the two families he portrays as examples of both the North and the South , the Hazard and Main families . But like in real - time life , both sides have detractors , schemers , folks determined to have THEIR OWN way rather than what is best for the whole country ( sound familiar , almost like today 's congress and other governmental forces ) . The character I most disliked and never understood his role in the novel was the one who held a grudge for years and was BENT on destroying both families . Now that I finally understand why and how Fort Sumter was the start of the War Between the States , I must read Jakes ' next two books in the series .
5 #### Excellent book , really gets the reader into the period . Nicely written with good characterization and dialogue . I ca n't wait to read the rest of the trilogy
5 #### This is one of Elizabeth Gaskell 's best works , in addition to Wives and Daughters . Although I am not from England and most assuredly am not from the 19th century , I very much enjoy her writing despite that fact that there will be references to which I am unfamiliar and would probably make this book more complex and enjoyable . Yes , it is a romance but it is so much more than that . Ms. Gaskell here has written a primer of sorts on how to write a social commentary novel . I highly recommend her works to any uninitiated - especially those who have previously begun on Jane Austen 's works .
4 #### I really liked reading this book . I had seen the BBC movie and loved it . The book gives more insight as to Mr. Thornton and his feelings . Reminds me a lot of the Pride and Prejudice story .
4 #### An amazing classic . I could n't put it down . Strong characters and great love story .
5 #### This book was a great read ! A very engaging story with strong characters that hold your interest . You also get a historical view of 19th century England during the industrial revolution and the politics and conflicts that existed between workers and bosses . The same issues that still trouble us today .
5 #### I really hated to put this book down , it was rather long , but it held me very interested it what was coming next .
5 #### Elizabeth Gaskell does an amazing job of making a " History " lesson interesting by capturing the essence of the mid 1800 's and presenting it in a beautiful love story . If every time period in History were presented in such a wonderful way instead of the " dry facts " found in other books people would know more about it . I would love to read more books like North and South .
4 #### In the days before my kindle my favourite reads were period romances and while now my kindle has opened up a whole new world of books , in fact I 'm spoilt for choice with MC 's , shifters , vampires ... the list goes on and on but you really ca n't beat a good classic . I originally read North and South years ago and while I enjoyed the relationship between Margaret and John it was the poverty and suffering of the mill workers which really caught my attention . After the BBC drama I read the book again and this time it was the romance I felt drawn to , the difference age makes , I suppose . This is an interesting read which covers the struggle and social injustice of the workers , it has great interesting characters and the relationship between John and Margaret builds and simmers throughout the book . I 'm glad that I now have this on my kindle since even though I was adamant that I would n't give up ' actual ' books in reality I find I read them less and less these days . I always thought of ' North and South ' as the industrial northern version of ' Pride and Prejudice ' less ribbons and balls and more poverty and suffering and while I like both books ' Pride and Prejudice ' is I think my favourite book of all time maybe because it 's the book that made me fall in love with reading .
4 #### Elizabeth Gaskell always weaves a lovely story with characters you can relate to and care about . I wanted a little more at the end . Her stories are always full of rich details but for me this story ended too abruptly ... still wonderfully satisfying .
5 #### When Gibran was first introduced to me , I had definite doubts that his work would be the ordinary , grab a dictionary sort of read . But when you first open to those sections that apply to you , and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears , well , shock is the only word for it . Yes , the ideals and beliefs that he expresses in ' The Prophet ' may not be anything new as far as philosophy is concerned , but the perfect blend of brilliant poetry and this simple philosophy come together to make something that is indeed , unique . I 've purchased countless copies to the ones that I know will love and understand his words . And if for nothing else , Kahlil 's work can be labeled as truly , a literary work of art .
5 #### Gibran gets right down to the bedrock of what it is all about . He was obviously a very enlightened man , and The Prophet is so completely , psychologically and spiritually healthy . Anyone who would not consider this work a standard for healthy living , is simply simple - minded . This book should be offered to all high school students as a guide in gaining perspective on what is really important in life . I first read The Prophet about 10 years ago , and I typically read it about once a year , just to remind myself . However , I gave my copy to my son who showed signs of being " at risk " at age 17 . I believe the book had a significant , positive impact on him , and he is now 20 and living a very responsible and balanced life . After my son had read this book , I found him on the telephone one evening reading passages to a friend . It made him think , and any time you can get a teenager to think , it 's a very good thing .
5 #### When i ordered this book i knew it was worth it . The Prophet teaches us about life with its pains , sorrows , joy and love and much more . This book deserves more than five stars , i highly recommend it .
5 #### I first stumbled across Gibran in a quote a firend shared with me while I was going through a divorce . The quotes on Pain , Joy and Sorrow , and Love became touchstones . This is a very touching perceptive work .
5 #### This book was given to me as a gift before I journeyed overseas on a spiritual quest to " find myself . " I never got a chance to read it until one month after I was there and I had lost my job , my relationship was very unsteady , and being so far form home , I felt completely isolated . After skipping around the book and reading sections that immediately pertained to me at that point , I cried , not out of sadness , but out of enlightenment ... Gibran wrote his experiences , and his thoughts on life , but they are such detailed poetic accounts , it applies to everyone at some time , his writings have layers , and therefore this book can be read many times over , and each time a new understanding will come . " Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding ... "
5 #### I love listening to Juliet Stevenson - she is an excellent narrator . I also find that she and I share a similar taste in books , many of them dealing with the position of women in society . I chose my first 3 Juliet Stevenson narrated books - The Golden Notebook ( Doris Lessing ) , To the Lighthouse ( Virginia Woolf ) , and The Signature of All Things ( Elizabeth Gilbert ) simply because they were books I wanted to listen to . ( I loved all 3 . ) Then I noticed that , by coincidence for me , Juliet Stevenson had narrated them all . I chose my next three books ( The Paying Guests by Sarah Waters , North and South , and now Mary Barton - both by Elizabeth Gaskell ) simply because Juliet Stevenson had narrated them . I had never heard of North and South or Elizabeth Gaskell . All that said , I really enjoyed North and South ! The characters were interesting and real , and I enjoyed learning about English mill towns in the late nineteenth century , from both the perspective of labor and capitalist .
5 #### Ordered the Elizabeth Gaskell 3 DVD set and fell in love with North and South . A great love story . Decided to read the book , knowing that the books are always better . Was n't disappointed ! And .... I think it beats Pride and Prejudice !
5 #### For some reason I thought this was about the Civil War , but it 's actually about North and South England and their manufacturing process . It 's like the British version of the American book The Jungle .
5 #### Well written a great glimpse of past history through the lives of two family 's and the strains of living in the divide created by slavery
5 #### You basically ca n't go wrong with Elizabeth Gaskell . I have yet to read a writer that has such a way of making characters and stories that are both endearingly quirky and tragically serious at the same time . She is genius !
3 #### The BBC production was more enjoyable for me . The book did add some dimensions and understanding which the movie had to omit .
1 #### Very boring . Did not enjoy at all , too many stories intertwined together with no explanation thouroughly of each one . The audio version made it bearable to read for a book club reading .
3 #### Its a thin book , very readable and has interesting 1 - 2 page thoughts on various entities like anger , children , religion , speech , silence and its COOL ......... reading . Ofcourse if one needs to imbibe the thoughts of the author , it has to be consumed slowly and perhaps revisited but leaves you pretty heady and clear about certain things .
5 #### This book is almost as if Kahlil Gibran took the pains and joys of millions of people and somehow managed to encapsulate all these wonders in this one book . In his own unique manner , Gibran has explored every facet of human existence . Although the book has a sacred charm to it , there is a universal appeal that should allow anyone of any religious persuassion enjoy this gem of a book . I would n't be surprised if a few hundred years from now some theologians unearth this book and conclude that it was a bible of our times .
5 #### If there were more than five stars , this book would surely deserve it . This book is the paradigm of wisdom , humility , and grace . This is my favorite book on my shelf , and I would recommend this book to anyone . Truly , if Gibran was a religion , The Prophet would be my Bible . Never has inspiration hit me with such velocity as reading this book .
4 #### I first became aware of Kahlil Gibran when I read a poem of his that was on the menu at my favorite Lebanese restaurant . Ever since then , I have sought out his books . The Prophet is my favorite . Several of the " poems " or passages are fully relevant to parts of my life . The book makes one feel good and inspired to do good for others . There is barely an aspect on life that the poems do not touch on - love , marriage , death and all of our own insecurities and doubts about people and life . This would be a good book to give to a friend who is going through a rough time , or just has unanswered questions at a certain point in their lives . The writing is lucid , insightful , and will be relevant for as long as time goes on . The drawings add to an already great work . At my favorite Lebanese restaurant , I not only found good food - I thankfully found Kahlil Gibran .
5 #### This is Gibran 's most celebrated work and it is so with goodreason . It is a profound insight and expose into the human characterand the emotions that work within the heart and soul . Humble words , seared with the heights and depths of love and of pain , this is a life - changing arrangement of words . If I had to sum the book up in one word , it would be " SUBLIME . " If you 're picking up this title , be sure to order Gibran 's ' The Beloved ' to go along with it . These are books that deserve a worthy and permanent place on your bookshelf .
5 #### This is Kahlil Gibran at his best . The prophet is uplifting , thought - provoking , lyrical , simplistic , and completely unforgettable . Gibran 's unique prose poetry rythym flows like wine while reading it . This book is a classic .
5 #### For me Kahil 's words and insights are next to the New Testament , the best expression of our oneness in the Spirit ! If you love the book , I would ENCOURAGE you to acquire the Audio Narration that was done by Richard Harris . It will bring you to another level !
5 #### This is a classic and it 's free in the Kindle version . How can anyone complain ? It is a deliciously slow romance and a story that makes you think critically of social reform and the Industrial Revolution . My only regret is that Gaskell was forced to wrap the story up before she had exhausted her ideas - it ends rather abruptly .
5 #### Perfection . Dickensian in scope and Austenian in feel , this is one of the best books of its time . Enjoy !
3 #### I might have liked North OR South better . The two together were tedious .
5 #### This was a wonderful history with such strong characters you came to feel like you know them by the end of the book . So happy it was followed up by 2 more in this trilogy . Great reading .
5 #### I do n't know why this book and movie are n't more well known . They are at least as good as Pride and Prejudice . Gaskell 's writing is fabulous and the film adaptation , though varying somewhat from the book , is also well done . The book follows a young lady through her difficult move from a home she loves in the south of England to the colder , harsher climate of a Northern England mill town . There is some great symbolism there and for the younger reader a commentary such as Cliffnotes or Sparknotes may be helpful if you want more depth . The plot is enjoyable enough to be worth even an easy read , though , so do n't pass this up . Its more than a great romance , its a window both into this era in history and to the prejudices we each hold about those different from us .
4 #### A bit different from the mini - series . A good read !
5 #### Loved it . Need to order the next one . The second time I have read it . But so many years ago I am enjoying it
5 #### very good - if you like Jane Austin style , time period , customs , you will like this too !
5 #### Easy read , great love story , watch the mini series on Amazon Instant Video afterwards !
5 #### This is an old book but it 's the first time I have read it . It 's great . Wonderful story and a good history lesson for all . The author blended in factual history with a fiction story so well , it was a real pleasure reading . It 's a long story but now I ca n't wait to read books 2 and 3 of the trilogy . Really amazing how much factual history detail I never knew . A must read for all .
5 #### was n't sure what to expect from this book , I am a huge Jane Austen fan and this did n't fail to impress . This is like a mixture of Tolstoy and Austen , set during England 's Industrial Revolution it tells a poignant story of ideals , expectations and reality of two people from very different backgrounds and coping with their philosophical differences . The author did a good job of showing both sides to the labor issues so prevalent during that time and to some extent today . Highly recommend it .
4 #### It 's a very interesting , well written book . The language is challenging to read because the author is very descriptive and poetic , but I like that . The characters are well - defined and the plot is fun .
4 #### There have already been two mistakes in Chapter 1 , " staid " for " stayed " , and I forget what the other one is , but I am going to buy this and edit this review , as the characters and dialogue are fairly well written .
5 #### originally read these when I was 16 back in 1989 . I fell in love with the Mains and the Hazards when I watched the made - for - television mini - series based on books 1 & 2 a few years before that . I 've always been a bit of a history buff and the American Civil War has been a favorite era of mine to read and research . John Jakes has a definite specialty when it comes to writing historical fiction and with the North and South trilogy he combines both good and bad aspects of that part of our nation 's past with intriguing characters and subplots that keep the reader captivated . If you love history , fiction , drama , romance , and intrigue than this is definitely a series you want to look into .
5 #### John Jakes at his best . The saga of pre - civil war US is realistic and heart touching . Loved it !
5 #### At first it took me a little to get into it , could not understand why all the crying because they are moving and scaling down a little , but got more and more into it , by the end I could not put it down . So romantic ! I did not think at my age I would still get so absorbed in a work of fiction , but it 's a lovely novel , and I was sorry to come to the end of it !
5 #### Having read five Jakes history of the U.S. series long ago , I did not notice till now his second series on North & South . Using the same wonderful fictitious family technique , while staying faithful to historic fact , Jakes again helps readers understand more fully the human and emotional circumstances that were generated and released so as to impact the outcomes of historic fact in ways that help us understand the many ways that individuals have more than normal impact on major points of historic importance- some with ruthless and mindless mob rule actions and others with far more subtle yet profoundly determinative impact . Inventions , accidental discoveries , acts of nature and perhaps God , come alive in the way Jakes presents happenstance into the equations that deal with what really made things happen .
3 #### It was very good but too long and too wordy .
5 #### Comparable to " Pride and Prejudice " a very good read . The characters are well rounded and true to the time period . Although , I did want to shake some sense into Margaret once or twice .
4 #### This book offers the reader an introduction to the experience and feelings of the people who lived through the decades leading up to the Civil War . Fictitious characters are created with imagination and color .
5 #### Tracey Whitney is my hero ! The way she fights back in this book makes me love her even more . This was the first Sidney Sheldon book I read and I have never looked back . I think I keep reading this over and over again . If you want to read some great romance / suspense then this is it .
4 #### The beginning was depressing . A lot of bad things happen to Tracy in jail . I was disappointed with the stupid things she did that landed her in jail . But after she got out of jail , the book really took off and was enjoyable . My favorite part was the way Tracy got revenge against mafia guys . After that I enjoyed watching her plan and pull off con jobs and thefts . The audiobook narrator Nancy LaScala was good in parts , but not good in some ways . Sometimes her general narration voice was too wooden , not engaging and interesting . And sometimes she spoke too fast like she was in a hurry . DATA : Narrative mode : 3rd person . Swearing language : mild . Sexual content : 3 sex scenes briefly referred to , no details shown . Setting : around 1985 various locations in U.S. and Europe . Book copyright : 1985 . Setting : fiction .
5 #### This book was referred to me . I was n't disappointed .
1 #### This is the first Sheldon book I have not enjoyed , everything was so much fantasy , it was really pathetic and sad
4 #### One of Sidney Sheldon 's Best Novels . I thought it was in Paperback Form . Hardcover without Slipcover . Did n't see that In Description . Great Read . Since it 's in Hardcover , the Missing Sleeve is a Non - Issue . Arrived packed with other Items . No wrap to prevent Soil or Moisturizer for Book or Invoice from Seller .
5 #### Friend is a fan of the author ! ! I created her a small care package with the collection of the books
3 #### The drug out longer than it needed too .... not as good as Rage of Angles
5 #### The recipient of this book said this is one of his favorite Sheldon books . Along with Master of the Game . It was highly recommended . I may buy again so I can read it .
5 #### This booK was so exciting , I could not put it down . I have read a couple of Sidney Shelton books in the past . Iwill read more . Always exciting
5 #### Wonderful writer ! Engaging historical novel - will definitely read the other books in this trilogy .
5 #### An exquisite , beautifully told story of mid-19th - century England of the clash of the gentle southern agrarian sensibility of the heroine with the turbulent industrial north she makes her home and also of the class conflict within the north as the industrial revolution took hold . All is told against the backdrop of the tempestuous courtship of the heroine and the self - made , headstrong , but equally sensitive and intelligent manufacturer she meets in the north . One of the many delicious aspects of the book is the interior monologue Gaskell provides for the two central characters as they puzzle their way through their understanding of both each other and their times and place . Although this is a serious and substantial book , the interior talk leavens it with humor , making it the ideal read for both entertainment and edification . I expect to read it many times .
5 #### This is an outstanding historical novel , full of excitement and great period detail . Although I am not an expert , I felt it was very authentic and well researched . The characters are realistic and I did care about them a great deal . Good enough to be designated a classic in my view .
5 #### Sidney Sheldon is always a fantastic read ! You can not predict his story lines as he loves to surprise you when least expected .
4 #### It 's a page turner ! I liked it very much ! It has everything from drama to adventures and romance ! Nice reading .
5 #### Sidney Sheldon once again shows the skills of a master storyteller . About the only thing cliche in this story is that the heroine finds her soul mate . If does n't happen til the end of the story , though , with enough plot twists for two or three books before that . Even if you do n't relate to the main character , you 'll keep reading to see how she survives this setting ( whatever it is ) and what happens next .
5 #### Love this book ! My second read . I read it several years ago and again recently . It is still as good as I remembered !
5 #### Sidney Sheldon 's books are always way above average - just love his books
5 #### Just about anything Sidney Sheldon writes is good to me ! He 's my favorite because most of the time he does n't ( or did n't ) bore me with ALL the details of how a room looks . or how the hemline on a dress was made . He got to the point with just enough details to entice you to read further ! Yeaaa Sidney ! Plus it 's enough for me to know that they had sex , I really do n't need every little detail ! I got it ! They did it ! Sidney tells it and moves on !
1 #### I do n't think Mr. Sheldon can be considered an author of"fine " literature , but he has written some interestingly varied , and fun , books over the course of a long and successful career , books that I 've read and enjoyed ( but , then , I used to enjoy Harold Robbins too , when I was a young adult ) . But I wonder if Mr. Sheldon is pulling our collective legs with this one . It 's awful . Truly awful . Unbelievably awful . Too awful to even keep skimming and speed - reading to see how the " heroine " triumphed over all those who 'd done her wrong and to see how she managed to screw over all the awful , and awfully written , " villains " in this adolescent attempt at producing a thriller . Too awful to be so awful it 's funny . But I think Mr. Sheldon and his banker and his accountant get the last laugh .
5 #### I really enjoyed this novel and will be reading the sequiel next . If you are a Civil War type you will enjoy this one . I highly recommend it to all American History buffs . Very well done .
5 #### I enjoyed this book very much . A friend mentioned this author who I had missed in my timid treks through the classics . I enjoy them in the same way I enjoy black and white movies : restful , peaceful slow ambles through life . The protagonist is easy to like and a welcome guide on the journey through England in a particular place and time . The story is specific and universal at the same time , following characters you come to care about as they grapple with timeless human dilemmas .
4 #### What made the experience of listening to North and South the most enjoyable ? Juliet Stevenson 's narration was perfect for this story of class differences , labor vs. the masters , etc . Who was your favorite character and why ? Margaret Hale was a strong character who grows as the book evolves . She has almost every bad thing happen to her and she continues to do the right thing . She is a great heroine . Have you listened to any of Juliet Stevensons other performances before ? How does this one compare ? Any book she does is suberb . Was there a moment in the book that particularly moved you ? The end when Mr. Thornley and Margaret meet for what could be the last time ... It has it all , humor and pathos . Any additional comments ? Wonderful story , but I did find Margaret 's father as the weakest character in the novel . If he leaves the church because he believes more in the reformers than the regular church , why does the family no longer seem to attend church at all ? For a former minister to become a tutor but not attend church seems false to me . My only complaint on the book though .
5 #### Great , just great ! I 'm not what you would call a history buff , rather , the opposite ... but this book ( or series of books ) put a spin on these long ago times and helps the reader become involved with the struggle and the love of two families . I ca n't wait to read the rest of the series .
2 #### Just OK . Not a page turner . Very predictable , not exiting .
5 #### A wonderful book and great writer . A thrilling story and kept you in suspense .
5 #### Loved the Book . Sidney Shelton is great . You are swept up in all the action and ca nt put it down .
4 #### All blended well . Characters and story line , very enjoyable . I 'll read the next adventure .
5 #### I think the book North and South ranks five stars because it mixes fact with fiction so well . If I were to read a book strictly about the Civil War I think it would lose my attention . However John Jakes incorporates the Civil War history with a story about families involed with each other before and during the war .
5 #### Loved the book BUT loved the movie more . I just loved Richard Armitage playing this main character and as I read the book I visualized him in that movie . Of course , there was more to the book and I did appreciate that . I usually enjoy reading a book more than watching the story but I did see the series first so it holds a special place in my heart , but so does this book . A very worthwhile read if you like period pieces .
5 #### A really EXCELLENT , well written depiction of the Northern and Southern cultures , and West Point leading up to the Civil War , something you will not find in the history books . Tom Leo , CPP , USMA'59
4 #### I read anything this author writes . He is my favorite . All of his books are page turners . Romance , action , suspense . You get it all with his books .
5 #### a book that 's hard to put down once you read the first few chapters . loved this book and would highly recommend it for a book club read
5 #### Very revealing and some times shocking story that makes you support whatever the evolving subject must do to resolve her life conflicts .
5 #### Great signed , first addition . The seller was quick to respond to my messages / inquiries before I purchased to make sure this was excellent enough condition to gift to someone . Thank you ! !
4 #### Wonderful book , giving me excellent reading experience . I have read two times . It 's also a good start to read English novel books
5 #### I have n't read the book yet but I have the movie and I really loved it . I know the book will be great .
5 #### Amazing story telling ability about one of the most interesting and tragic times in our country 's history . Ca n't wait to continue the trilogy .
5 #### This is a really great story with memorable and well - developed characters . The audio version is excellent , as well . I 've already purchased the next two in the series . I 'd seen the mini - series in the 80s , but had never read the book . It 's better than expected .
4 #### If you like historical fiction you will likely like this book .
4 #### I really enjoyed this historical novel . Although not an easy read , there are deep , challenging concepts that lead you to research this period in time and to consider the personal challenges in a new light .
5 #### Sheldon tells great stories . This one I about Tracy Whitney whose life is turned upside down in the first few pages . In the rest of the book , we walk with her as she tries to piece her life back together as best as she can . A fantastic story .
5 #### The novel begins with with Tracy wrongly accused of a crime that sends her to a women 's penitentiary . She is abused until she finds another inmate that keeps hope alive . She is released and wants to get even with those that betrayed her . She is very bright and comes up with a plan that gets her a great deal of money . Great opportunities await her in her life of crime If you enjoy reading Sheldons novels , you will like this one .
5 #### This is a good introduction to the issues that led up to the Civil Was . As someone from the Midwest we were more isolated from this and have little history of our own to highlight those issues . It was n't just about slavery but about the federal union of states . The personal stories kept it from being a history book with just dates and places . I would recommend this to anyone that is interested in the pre Civil War era .
5 #### This series is without question the best fictional account of the Civil War that brings both sides of the conflict into play . The good , the bad and the ugly are all portrayed here . Seeing both sides at the same time truly shows how brother vs. brother came into play .
4 #### A historical classic -- it 's long , often graphic , but the historical detail is excellent . Well worth the read .
5 #### Great historical novel only the way Jakes can tell a story .
4 #### This is an engrossing read , a fictional and comprehensive look at the events leading up to the Civil War , with some romance thrown in . Suspenseful , at times , but also a bit dragging .
4 #### Kept on the edge of my seat the entire book . Could n't put it down once I finally started it . Great .
1 #### This is a perfectly awful book which I will not even finish . I can not imagine how it got so many good reviews . The plot does not even approach intrigue but is totally ridiculous . Roger Moore reads it like a freight train barreling through the night . One can only imagine that he was given a firm fixed number of minutes in which to complete his read .
3 #### I always have liked this author . The author does not spent too much time describing mundane tunings . It moved right along
1 #### The story was unbelievable . I thought it would never end . Awful ! I thought Sidney Sheldon was supposed to be a great writer . This , not so much .
5 #### I was sure the heroine would never make it . Lots of intrigue . You ca n't help but root for the main character .
5 #### Nice book , with a lot of twists and turns
4 #### Although I have seen TV & movie adaptations of his books , had n't read a Sidney Sheldon novel since " The Other Side of Midnight " . While I enjoyed this easy read , I 've outgrown his style .
5 #### Sidney Sheldon 's writing never disappoints ! I remember reading this book in college it was great to read again . If you were looking for some action and adventure , this is the book for you .
5 #### Years ago I read many of Sidney Sheldon 's novels and enjoyed them immensely . to tell the truth , I 'm still not sure that I may have read this too ! I did enjoy it , dated as it was .
4 #### Hard to watch but beautifully done . A nasty disease that robs people of their personhood .
5 #### This is Sidney Sheldon 's best book I have read in a long time . Full of surprises .
5 #### Very good , really have always liked reading your books . The characters were so real , the storyline fabulous . Thanks again for a great read
5 #### Couldn't't put the book down . Really a great read .
5 #### Besides being a wonderful love story with a little of the pride and prejudice magic , it is also a fascinating bit of history showing the forces at work on the right and the left during England 's industrial revolution .
2 #### The plot is good , writing is done well but I just could not finish reading the book because some of the descriptions describing the brutal treatment of some of the characters . Maybe I am too sensitive but I just could not continue reading it .
4 #### I especially enjoy an intimate look into the families off North and South . Politics ruled the day , just as they do now . Times have changed , but unfortunately humanity is just as opinionated and divided today . A good book for Civil War era buffs .
5 #### Elizabeth Gaskell deserves to be better known . This novel is set in an Northern England industrial town and has as its backdrop the issues of industrialization and tension between labor and management . However , it is also about a young woman and her choices - or lack thereof - in 19th century England . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Great historical novel weaving a family from the north and one from the south into the context of the civil war . Seems to give pretty fair view of the conflict . I 'm interested enough to be in the middle of the second book of this trilogy .
4 #### An interesting story that seems to have the history going back to even West Point . A little draggy at times , but worth the read .
4 #### I am still reading this and am enjoying it very much . I plan to buy more books in the series .
5 #### If you are all for pride and prejudice then , this is a story for you . Wonderful love story mixed with a historical period in England , at a later date . A description of workers and factory owners , men and women , and the kind of life they led . The language is easy and beautiful , not difficult for a foreigner , if English is n't your first language .
5 #### North and South is one of my favorite classic novels and its not hard to read at all , as can be the case with the language of some classic novels that can bog a reader down . Do n't tell Ms. Austen but I like North and South much more than Pride and Prejudice . The only reason I compare the two is because of the " hate at first sight , which grows into love " romance that blossoms between Mr. Thornton and Miss Hale , because North and South is so much more than a love story . It 's also a story of the formation of workers ' unions and the turmoil between factory bosses and their laborers . And of course , it 's a story about how a place can change and shape who we are and who we become . If you are even thinking about reading this book , pick it up and do so .
5 #### thought i do n't like potboilers very much , i adore Sidney Sheldon . his books read like a committee wrote them , but I do n't care . this story about a woman forced into becoming a con artist is very fun . the segment set in a women 's prison is downright educational ! the late Sidney Sheldon has an heir , Tilly Bagshawe , who is writing the new ' Sidney Sheldon 's . she is very very good , but there was only one Sidney . he takes himself very seriously as an entertainer , and so do i.
5 #### It has been years since I read Sidney Sheldon book and after reading If Tomorrow Comes , I wonder why . Characters in this book and all his books are intriguing . Very well written mystery .
4 #### This was a good read ! I enjoyed the book even more than the miniseries .
3 #### This book moves so slow , I have had immense difficulty keeping interested . I know Jakes is an acclaimed author and this trilogy was very popular upon its release , I have just found it boring . I definitely will not attempt parts two and three !
4 #### I give this story 5 stars but the actual paperback quality less then 5 . Read some reviews about the novel and see that it is a great story but I will focus on the actual book quality . This book is a very appealing price and to some extent you get what you pay for . The paper back cover is of a pretty low weight cardstock . I bought this book cheap just to see how I liked it . Now I need to replace it as almost immediately it started to show wear . I would buy this book in a nice hardback with a cover design that I really like now . It is a great piece of classic literature . If you are interested in just reading it in a very in - expensive book form I would say this is the book structure for you . What is contained beneath the cover makes it worth the expense at any price range .
5 #### A very good and useful edition for students and teachers
3 #### Pretty good book but it was too long and I eventually got bored . It felt like three books smashed into one .
5 #### I am amazed at how well thought out and detailed this book was . The characters are vividly described and the plot is fun and entertaining . I had a hard time putting this down . The ending was a totally surprising event . All in all superbly done .
5 #### I thoroughly enjoyed the development of the main character Tracy and her ingenious ways of thinking outside the box . I felt surprised by every turn the book took me ! Well done ! !
5 #### great book - if you want a feel for day to day life prior to civil war . now it leads me to the next one as a must read
5 #### Once you start this series you ca n't stop reading them ... I strongly recommend it .
3 #### A novel easy to read with interesting characters whom represented the social crisis of the pre civil war .
5 #### a terrific story . He has done it again with this novel . Very good .
5 #### It 's been a bit since I read it , but I love all the books written by Sidney Sheldon . The first one I eve read was The Other Side of Midnight , then I saw the movie of it . It kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through . It made me laugh , cry , and become angry .
5 #### A travel log loaded with mystery , great characters . What a keen mind to whip up all of these wonderful adventures . A page turner , indeed .
5 #### Sheldon is a classic from my youth . Quick , exciting reads .
4 #### Some parts are a little corny and you can tell that Sidney Sheldon is from a bygone era . ( Probably why some parts are really corny ) . Also you have to have a bit of imagination because this book is pre - modern day tech . But over all I enjoyed this very unique book .
5 #### This is the 2nd time I read it . I read it YEARS ago and new I would still enjoy it like all of Sidney Sheldon 's books !
5 #### This was a terrific book . The way the plot grew using the Main and Hazzard families like the rungs of a ladder was an excellent way to set the hook .
5 #### I really enjoyed this historic novel . The Civil War period is fascinating and this book is the perfect lead - up to the war . By following characters and their families from both North and South , the reader is immersed in ideology , setting and intrigue . I immediately purchased part II of Jakes trilogy and find the same fast reading pleasure .
5 #### If you are a Pride and Prejudice fan , you will love this epic and truly satisfying love story about a gentlewoman rising above the entrenched class distinctions in 19th century England to discover the nobility and worth of a " tradesman " in textiles . The " Mr. Darcy " in this story may have blue collar roots , but he is every bit a man . Rich and complex with a panoply of characters , unexpected twists of fate , heartbreak , suspense , passionate love , and redemption , this is love story and social commentary combined . Loved it .
4 #### Examination of the political beliefs and social classes during the English industrial revolution - set against the background of a romance . If you want more romance watch the BBC movie
5 #### John Jakes epic story of the time and famous figures in American history leading up to the beginnings of the Civil War is a must for history buffs . The struggles of the nation are reflected in the life stories of the Hazards and the Mains : two wealthy families whose sons met at West Point , became best friends , fought in the war with Spain , and then were tested by the strife that tore apart this country . One family loyal to the preservation of the Union and other to their way of life in their home state in the Old South .
3 #### This is a very interesting book but it to wordy . After a while it got a little boring after awhile .
5 #### Great story with a lot of excitement . Loved the planning process and execution of the heists . My favorite was the chess match .
5 #### Great Sidney Sheldon read . Worst part is it ended ! ! !
1 #### It 's very rare that I quit on a book , especially if I 've purchased it , but this is one I did quit on . I remember enjoying the TV miniseries many years ago , but this book bears little resemblance to that miniseries . It 's traces the roots way to far back , and I just lost my patience . This one just was n't for me .
3 #### I wanted to read because of the movie and I was dissatisfied
5 #### I enjoy history novels and this is very good .
3 #### Easy read and apparentlywell researched . Author portrays the events before and during our Civil War as seen by people of different backgrounds . Too much sex , just for the sake of " sex " ( sales ) . but otherwise an OK book .
5 #### I was so happy to find another 19th century novel that I had n't read yet . I agree with another reviewer that this book is like Middlemarch . Not quite as good , but still a fun read .
5 #### Margaret and John are proud . Each is prejudiced against the other , she because he is " in trade " and he because she is a " fine lady " . And they misunderstand each other in every possible way as the plot twists and turns through its fast paced events . This could be the stuff of comedy , but Mrs. Gaskell makes it operatic instead , and takes on many important issues along the way , like capitalism , labor unions , ship mutiny , religious convictions , and human rights vs. moral rights . This book should leave you emotionally and intellectually exercised , and fairly satisfied despite its abrupt conclusion .
4 #### Fast - moving , romantic peek into a past era . Great last words ! Easy to skip some sententious passages that must have been inspirational in their day . Now I 'm going to watch the video to see what the BBC made of the story .
5 #### Great book . Superb storyteller . Keeps you on the edge of your seat
5 #### If Tomorrow Comes by Sidney Sheldon is a fast paced novel of vengeance that never lets up . Tracy is the unforgettable lead character of this tale . Fans of fast going books will love this . Not for the kids .
5 #### I found this to be such an amazing easy and gripping read . Sydney sheldon You are ... As the song goes " your simply the best " .
5 #### Great book , after reading lee child , david baldacci 's bland books , i am glad I chose this book , am gon na read more ...
5 #### I watched the mini - series on Netflix and loved it . Then I read the book . As in most cases , the book is so much better than the movie . This edition is well done , with none of the grammatical errors that sometimes occur in kindle books .
5 #### Although this book can be a bit difficult to read due to the change in language and use of words in writing , the story is timeless . A bit slow in places , and not an easy - breeze through read , but worth every minute put into it . Absolutely timeless story with a ton of depth and emotion . Highly recommend !
5 #### This is one of the rare books that took me back to the early 1800s and kept me there . The prequel to the Civil War is usually glossed over and we are taken into the meat of the battles . Sadly , I 'm on the last of the trilogy and I fear it will be a long , long time until I find another book that wraps me in a blanket of history and holds me there .
5 #### Great story of a very dark time in American History . A must read . I ca n't wait to read the rest of the series .
4 #### This was a book we had to read in High School . Now that it has been a few years ( quite a few ) , this was something I chose to go through again and you really ca n't beat the price . This is a good ebook version , though I prefer physical books .
5 #### Written in a style that gives you history , but based on believable characters who capture the sense of the feelings that ran strong enough to lead to a civil war .
5 #### Loved this story line . Kept me on my toes all the way to the end !
5 #### Amazingly addictive . Very quick reading and fun . The first quart is very tough , but interesting nonetheless . Endless imagination for plots , thanks Sheldon , i 've read it three times ( one per decade )
5 #### Really good book . I had forgotten how much I enjoy Sidney Sheldon novels . Glad I rediscovered them !
1 #### not the original book as read many years ago
5 #### In true Sidney Sheldon fashion , the twists and turns are present and the story is fast paced , could not put it down until I finished ! While I knew what would happen , I could n't wait to see how Tracy Whitney would get out of certain situations !
5 #### Great stroy and you can never go wrong with Sidney Sheldon
1 #### first Sheldon book I have ever read that I did not like . More like science fiction
5 #### Love Sydney Sheldon books ! This one is one of my favorites ! At first life could n't be worse for the main character but by the end it ca n't be better .
5 #### I ca n't read French as well as I thought I could and this is certainly not the place to start !
5 #### Such a fun book to read - one of the rare books that I enjoyed twice , many years apart
5 #### Read the book years ago . Reread it now . So many years have past it was like reading a new book and was just as good . Loved it then . Loved it now . An easy , clever book in the Sidney Sheldon Style . I recommend it to the younger generation who did n't get to experience Sidney Sheldon .
5 #### Sidney never fails . So suspenseful I loved this book . I truly enjoyed it and the characters were exciting and fun .
3 #### Entertaining , but not nearly as good as some of his other books .
5 #### Text is closely spaced , but I like the pages in the back that translate some of Gaskell 's colloquial terms into modern English .
5 #### Great book . Once I started reading it I could n't put it down . I want to read the othetr books in this series . He is an amazing story teller .
4 #### While this book is very long I loved the tv series and read the books to see how much they were alike . I loved this book .
5 #### Excellent and excellently written ! First of his books I 've read and looking forward to more . Historical writing keeps reader glued to this novel ..
5 #### It was a very long book but kept my interest all the way through ... Very informative about how things were in those times .... I do enjoy these kind of books .... very well written .
5 #### an education in human nature , and in american history . beautiful .
5 #### Loved the manner in which the families were brought to the States and how their lives entwined with each other . A new presentation of a version of Gone With The Wind for me !
5 #### I have been a fan of Sidney Sheldon for over 30 years . His story lines keep you enthralled , and his characters are memorable .
5 #### A silly book . Full of adventure , sex , violence , beautiful locations , gorgeous women , attractive men ... in other words another Sidney Sheldon blockbuster :) WARNING ! ! ! SPOILERS AHEAD ! ! ! ! It deals with Tracy Whitney . She 's a young , beautiful woman prepared to marry a rich man and is happy . However , through a series of truly ridiculous circumstances she 's railroaded into prison . While there she 's assaulted and becomes a strong powerful woman . She is released and takes revenge on all the men who put her there . However that 's only half the book . It switches gears completely in the middle and she becomes an international thief butting heads with Jeff Stevens who 's just like her . On the surface this is a ridiculous book full of unlikely situations and characters with huge gaps in logic . Still it reads like a dream . VERY fast - moving with plenty of plot twists to keep you entertained and interested . Just do n't think about it TOO much and you 'll like it . I 'm really torn about this book . On one hand I read through all of it and enjoyed it even though it 's long--408 pages in my paperback edition . On the other hand this is not a deep , meaningful book . It strains credibility more than once and has some REALLY questionable gaps in logic . Still it 's a fast read and certainly never boring .
5 #### This was truly a mystery of what 's to come of Tracy and Jeff ... love it !
5 #### I loved this book . So many different personalities , some in harmony , some in discord , with just enough drama to keep one going on to the next page and then the next page-- It has also brought a deeper understanding of the day to day happenings in that day . A riveting read . Now I must get the other two books of the trilogy !
5 #### ELizabeth Gaskell ' s classic story of Margaret Hale and John Thornton finding love among the cotton mills of Milton during the 1850 's in northern England . Not just a love story , it tells of conditions among the mill workers and the beginnings of trade unions . This is the second version of this novel which I have purchased ( inspired by viewing BBC ' s 2004 mini series ) . The first was advertised as being annotated . , but was not . This one has footnotes for many local idioms and reproductions of some paintings appropriate for the story . Adding the audio book increases the enjoyment and understanding of the novel .
4 #### Soap opera story with the Civil War as background . History was interesting , story was predictable . Will read the next saga at some point but not in a rush to do it .
5 #### Wonderful start to a telling of events in a young nation , good survey of the tensions and hopes for the nation .
3 #### I enjoyed learning about events that lead up to the civil war as well as what it was like to train at West Point . I thought the development of the main characters was done well . However , I found myself too often skipping paragraphs because it felt too wordy .
3 #### I wish I could give it 3.5 stars . I loved the insight into the industrialization of England & the many struggles associated with it . For being a 400 + page book , the ending was vague & rushed .
5 #### Sidney Sheldon is among my all - time favorite authors . Finding one of his books in a Kindle edition is almost like finding gold . This book was riveting from start to finish !
5 #### racy page turner . can not keep the book down till you finish reading the end
5 #### I loved the book foundi most exciting could hardly put it down . I would recommend it to any won who likes exciing mysterieies
5 #### Nothing beats a Sidney Sheldon novel to hold your interest . so sorry he is deceased and can not write for us any longer .
5 #### How many ways can you brag about Sidney Sheldon 's books , I have read just about all that he has written & have never been disappointed . Sidney 's books always keep you on the edge of your seat & rushing to turn the page & see what next he has in store for you . You can become hooked on all of his writings , I love Sidney .
4 #### Throughtout the entire book I kept rooting for the thieves , given the circumstances . This book kept me reading and had lots of surprise twists . I enjoy this author .
4 #### I had not read Sidney Sheldon in years . Enjoyed the book and remembered why he was always a favorite author of mine .
3 #### This was probably my least favorite Sidney Sheldon book . I wo n't recap the ot as other reviewers have already done that . I was able to finish it , but I kept waiting for Sidney Sheldon magic and for all of the parts to tie together .
5 #### Dream of a beautiful heroin who can think FAST and deliver a dramatic performance to go with it . Quite an interesting book . I was on the edge of my seat and biting my nails as I read this book . I kept thinking " o no , they 're going to catch her " . Anyone who loves a little intrigue will love this book . Thanks
5 #### Well documented history with believable characters and excellent plot line .
5 #### Love it . I could t put it down once I started . One of the best books I 've ever read . Although I wish the ending part was longer
5 #### A beautiful story that captures so much reality written into beautiful words ! Gaskell does a fantastic job of creating characters that the reader can empathize with , love , and learn from in her novel . The honesty and clarity that she sheds on the history of the times and the people 's thoughts is outstanding . There is nothing silly or shallow about the romance within the book either . A very good choice for anyone to read !
5 #### Mr. Thornton is better than Mr. Darcy . Gaskell undoubtedly draws upon Austen 's work but provided a realistic depth to her characters .
5 #### Chose it because I had read John Jakes before .. Enjoyed it and hated for it to end but am looking forward to his next one .. I like to follow characters through the next book .. Good writer ..
5 #### An amazing story of our country 's history . I could n't put it down . I had read this book years ago and had forgotten how much I enjoyed it . Exciting love story and love of our country .
3 #### The story kept my interest and the ending was a shock ! A good read !
5 #### This book keeps the reader on the edge of your seat from the very start . It was very hard to put it down The ending was a bit of a surprise . Really enjoyed the book .
5 #### This is my favorite book ! I read it every other year or so ... I always seem to forget how each caper is done . I can not wait for the second book to come out in Oct.
4 #### First of all , I love Sidney Sheldon . This book has to be one of his best . It was filled with suspense . After reading this book I was filled with admiration for the heroine , Tracy . The book moves at a steady pace and is never boring . The book is filled with characters and none of them are one note . You will alternately hate and love many of them . What impressed me the most about this story is the journey that Tracy experiences and how she is an entirely different person in the beginning of the book as compared to the woman she evolves into at the end .
5 #### It was easy reading and a page turner . Thoroughly enjoyed it ! ! !
4 #### Light on character development but full speed ahead on moving the plot along . A fun read -- a little dark , a little light , a little reality , and a whole lot of fantasy .
5 #### If you like American History from a personal point of view , you 'll love this book . It ends just as the Civil War starts , and its mazing the things that happened on both North and South sides of the issues . I have a much better understanding now , it was n't all about slavery !
5 #### John Jake is noted for giving you a history lesson and you did n't even notice because the story was so good . I loved it and have been recommending it to friends and daughters . Only one problem and it isn ' t really a problem . It is SO LONG and yet I hated to see it end
4 #### I enjoyed the book . At times , I could not put it down and read far too late into the night .
5 #### This is a book you ca n't put down . Anyone who loves Civil War history will want to read this .
5 #### I decided to read this after watching , and loving , the 2004 BBC Version of North and South . The book does not disappoint ! It 's characters are written in such a way that you can distinctly tell their very different upbringings and points of view ; however , you can sympathize with each one that I could n't really pick who I " sided " with more . I found their virtues and foibles to be so relatable that I could n't help but seeing them as great ( literature ) friends and I was constantly wanting to get back to them to know how everything turned out . . . even though I already knew the basic result due to seeing the BBC version & I will have to say , the artistic license taken in the end of the drama . . . FANTASTICALLY done ! If you are a fan of Jane Austen or of brooding British romances that exemplifies a passionate yet pure , humble love , that has its hiccups due to life , timing , and circumstances ; then I 'm sure you will greatly enjoy this !
4 #### I was a fan of the BBC North and South mini series and welcomed the opportunity to enjoy it in print . The book was as or more compelling than the video . I could not put it down . Most affecting was the characterization of factory owner John Thornton who is first depicted as an arrogant individualist who is changed by love and experience to a kindlier world view . As far as this edition ( a free Kindle ) is concerned , it needs annotation re the extreme dialect of Nicolas Higgins and other workers . Close readers might appreciate a more expensive edition to reveal more information as well as an introduction and biographical information on Gaskell .
5 #### This is another of Sidney Sheldon 's excellent books , and one I could not put down ! An excellent read for all !
5 #### It held my interest from beginning to end . Always kept me wondering how the next challenge would be accomplished and did n't disappoint me .
5 #### As always Sidney Sheldon fools you each and every time -- love his books .
5 #### After finishing I immediately started reading war and love . You will love this if you are a historical fiction junkie .
5 #### Good educational reading , young people should read this in school , more interesting that textbooks . My grandchildren who hates " history " , say that its dry reading . This is entertaining too .
5 #### I have watched the movie adaptation on Netflix about eight times . The characters make such a great couple . I read a review which recommended this book after the movie since it gives a greater insight to the character 's thoughts and I got it because I thought maybe I could see a better ending since the movie left me wanting more of North and South . In that sense I was a little disappointed since the book left me wanting even more . All in all , Ms. Gaskell is a wonderful storyteller and being a Jane Austen fan , I believe I have found a new favorite author !
4 #### I did n't know what to expect when I started reading North and South and that might be why I enjoyed the book so much . I wo n't get into the story other then to say it follows two families from different regions of America prior to the civil wat . I became invested in the families and the various characters that make them up . There are some good guys and bad guys and a little action to help carry the book along . I will read the next book in the trilogy .
5 #### Set in England during the time of the industrial revolution the story follows the heroine , Margaret as she comes to know the fallacies of class discrimination . Being forced by situation to leave the home she loves , Margaret has the opportunity to find her own strength and to know her own heart .
5 #### I read that was the aim of John Jakes when he wrote this . He accomplished this and much more . A sweeping history of the Civil war with the emphasis instead on transportation . He focused mainly on the railroad and the importance to the war . It is far more than that though . Love and tragedy , history , joy and sadness . A family and families caught in the middle .
5 #### Tracey Whitney was fascinating as she out foxed the others . Quite the Sidney Shelton heroine ! I enjoyed it , though not the risk taker Tracey came to be . Fun read
3 #### I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning of this book . However as the more and more unbelievable twists and solving 's of the mysteries continued it got a bit much . At the end of the book I was tired of looking ahead and trying to figure out what unbelievable method was going to be used to solve the murders . Not my favorite Sheldon book .
1 #### Descriptive but largely unneeded detail . I gave up after the first quarter of the book ... will not finish it .
4 #### typical Sidney Sheldon . Read it years ago but forgot it until I came upon the point where she went to work for the warden . Did n't remember much else
4 #### Gaskell offers a glimpse into the lives of the Hales as they live life and struggle with the hard lesson that people of different stations in life are still people , worthy of respect .
5 #### I saw the mini series on the BBC before I read this . The book is better . This is not just a romance , it also covers some interesting history of the Industrial Revolution .
5 #### John Jakes writes with the rhythm of a true history buff - his characters are so believable and the research he has done is done to the " T " ! He always draws you right into the story . I enjoyed reading this years ago , then watching the mini - series , and look forward to reading it again now on the Kindle ! I highly recommend anything that he writes !
5 #### North and South is one of the best books that I 've ever read . It is a classic story about the cultural differences between the north and south of England , and also of romance over the social divides of the day . It also has an interesting historical aspect to it concerning the mills , the manufactures , and the strikes . This book is written from a Christian or at least a highly moral worldview , which makes it even better . The book is very well written ; it certainly kept me reading . I had to find out what was going to happen next ! Personally I like the book better than the 2004 BBC version of the story ( although I do love it as well ! ) . The characters are interesting and intriguing , and the book 's ending is absolutely perfect !
5 #### This was an excellent read from start to finish
5 #### I have loved all Sidney Sheldon books . Easy reading . Keeps you hooked . Fast paced . But I wished Tracy got even with Charles . At first I thought it was a get even with all the bad people but then the story turned into a " can she get away this time to see If Tomorrow Comes " . The only bad / sad part is now I have to find another book to start . I highly recommend this book , you wo n't regret it , I sure did n't .
5 #### I gave this book five stars because it captivated me from the start to the end of the book . Mr Sheldon 's descriptions of the characters was flawless and in every scenario I felt like I was there in the book watching it unfold . If it is n't already , the book would make a fantastic movie or made for tv movie . This book was free with prime . Now I will definitely pay for Mr. Sheldon 's books !
5 #### I have not read a Sidney Sheldon book for a long time . Glad I read this one . It has everything a great book can have . Love , laughter , mystery . Sorry , it came to an end .
3 #### I have n't thought about Mr. Sheldon in decades , although I used to wait with eager anticipation in the ' 70 's and ' 80 's for every new book of his to come out . Wiki lists him 7th on the all - time best - selling authors list . " The Other Side of Midnight " was his second book and his masterpiece , and nothing he wrote after ever equalled it for thrills , intensity and probably the most shocking surprise ending of any book ever . So I must have read this before but then -- lo and behold -- there it appears as an Amazon special ! Well , it was a good story , especially the early part , the frame - up and the prison days , but then it became more of a travelogue than a novel . More hotels and restaurants were mentioned than people . And paintings and museums and colors -- colors of everything were pointed out endlessly . But still , Mr. Sheldon , thank you for so many hours of pleasure so many years ago .
4 #### Exciting and fun . I love all of Sydney Sheldon 's books .
5 #### I like reading about the civil war . Sort of a heavy book to read , but worth it , if you like historical novels .
2 #### I was prompted to read this after watching the video series . As with most novels made into videos , the original written work contains more detail , additional characters , and greater development of the main characters and situations . However , Mrs. Gaskell is no Jane Austen . I found that I continued reading to see how the story progressed , not out of joy for how the words were put together .
5 #### I could n't stop reading this book ! If you love Mr. Darcy , you 'll fall in love with Mr. Thornton . Gaskell goes beyond the pretty country life and explores the industrial revolution of England , weaving a beautiful love story for the ages . A must read .
5 #### The large print edition is of very good quality . It 's heavy , of course , but well printed . As for the book , it 's harder to enjoy it the way it was intended after watching the BBC miniseries with it 's different ending , which was delightful . Just my opinion .
5 #### Loved the story and the characters ... Just wish the ending had been a little more drawn out . Fans of Pride and Prejudice would enjoy this .
5 #### Ok , so I lived my life a little on the outskirts of this time period ... before and after . I thought that this was about the Civil War ! But , after I read it , I fell in love with Gaskell . She 's a Romantic in the Romantic period , or in the Jacksonian period if you are more familiar with American history . After the Regency , and before the Victorian , I think . British story of a preacher 's daughter having to move to an industrial town , which was completely different than her idyllic country life . She learns to like those not like herself , and even fall in love .
5 #### Very good read with good twists & turns in the plot . Enjoyed and was suprised at the end .
4 #### First Sidney Sheldon book I 've read . The plot and characters kept me interested and overall it was a decent read .
4 #### Really enjoyed the book it was a great read with a great ending , hard to put it down really enjoy Sidney Sheldon
1 #### It is all about being a con artist and getting away with it . People with no morals about murder , trickery , stealing and sex . A friend recommended and I will avoid his suggestions in the future . Bad read ! I even withdraw the one star I gave it .
5 #### I had read this book approximately 20 years ago and had n't realized it until I got into it . Regardless , I love Sidney Sheldon 's books , and I enjoyed it as much this time as I did the first time .
5 #### I love Sidney Sheldon and this book did not disappointment me . It is do nice reading on the kindle at work .
5 #### This story takes place during the industrial revolution of England . The characters compare the differences between the laid - back lifestyle of southern England to the more driven lifestyle of northern England . This is as perfect a love story as you can get . John Thornton is at the top of my list of heroes ( yes , even over Mr. Darcy ! ) . And Margaret Hale is the perfect match for him . I highly recommend this book . I also highly recommend the BBC mini - series of the same name . My favorite period drama by far ! And , oh ... That kiss !
4 #### it is a classic although not quite in the genre of Jane Austen 's novels . However it does for the first time ( beside Dickens ) address the social issues facing the poor in northern England at that time .
4 #### This is a very special story . This particular copy has many typos that made it a little frustrating to read at times .
2 #### I order this book for my mother 's birthday . she loved Gaskell books . and she loved the BBC movie of north and south . so I know she 'll love the book . but the way the book came was bad ! it s got pieces of cover missing , and what I thought could have been a showing of the cotton all of the cover , was pieces cover ripped away . I order this book NEW not used . so it 's pretty sad state .
5 #### Wow ! Being in Mr. Thompson 's head was intense and also , sometimes , very heart breaking . Though this book is quite sad , it was very well written and enjoyable .
5 #### This is a wonderfull book , With characters I just love all through the book . The setting is the industrial revolution , with romance during these happenings . I recommend this book to those who love reading Jane Austen , Charlotte Bronte , as an example .
5 #### Read this book years ago when it was first published and loved it . Decided to experience it again and it is still just as riveting . Great writers can always stand the test of time .
5 #### In the typical Sidney Sheldon tradition , he weaves a story that continues to evolve and surprise . And manages to take us to some really intriguing destinations in the process !
5 #### I gave this book five stars .... it was one of Sidney Sheldon Best books . I wish he was still with us to write more of his super good books .
5 #### I really enjoyed this book . It moved from one senario to the next - always being suspenseful and keeping you wondering .
4 #### Always enjoy Sidney Sheldon books . Like to alternate between serious reading and good mystery novels and his books hit the spot .
5 #### Gaskell was one of the most important 19th century 's women writers . As she lived in the north she understood the class struggles , between the manufacturer and workers important theme in the novel , and the parallel love story . John Thornton is every woman 's dream man and unfortunately the BBC serial left out the most important aspects of John 's kindness and strength by making him beat a poor worker for smoking ! Never understood why the script writer changed the most important actions in the book . Including the proposal scene . The book is far better How ever Richard Armitage brings a great smoldering handsome man that all women fell in love with . Excellent book about people and love
4 #### Set during the Industrial Revolution in England , the book follows the initially unacknowledged love between the beautiful , but poor and highly judgmental , daughter of a Victorian preacher and a young self - made man who had risen to become a wealthy manufacturer . While telling a good story , it provides a view into the huge social changes that wracked England in the nineteenth century .
5 #### I read it because I also love the BBC series with Richard Armitage ( also because I knew Gaskell was a friend of Charlotte Bronte's)but they are not the same story . Do n't let that worry you ! Broader concerns are the same , characters as endearing in another way . I actually listened to the very amateur Librivox version and still loved it .
5 #### Very nice development of relationship between Mr. Thornton and Margaret . In background the everlasting fight between two classes - labour vs. masters .
5 #### I know many think this book is depressing and , I guess , I can understand why . However , I love reading books that show different aspects of the human condition , how people deal with and show compassion for one another ( even in fiction ) and it does n't hurt to throw a love story in the mix .
5 #### So beautifully written . England in the nineteenth century . I felt like I was there . It 's such a shame that Gaskell had to wait two hundred years to really be appreciated . If you like this do n't miss Wives and Daughters . And be sure to check our the , what I imagine is , the cockney dialect definitions in the back of the book .
4 #### A quick read . I 've seen two of the stories on television . This is one of the few Sheldon books I had not read .
5 #### I absolutely enjoyed this book . Every woman should have a bit of the heroine in her . Spunky , passionate , fun loving and sensitive . Based on this experience I 'll read more books by Sheldon .
4 #### I am in the middle of this book right now , and I have to say that it is a very good book , very suspenseful and keeps you on your toes . A really genuine Sidney Sheldon book . I am enjoying it and recommend it .
5 #### I have read just about every book Sheldon has written . I love his style of writing . Sheldon always makes the female character excel . He has such exciting plots and adventures . This particular story really made my day . You ca n't put it down . He makes the impossible seem possible . If you love this one than try to read his other books you will be equally entertained .
5 #### Excellent delivery and I love the product I have no other issues with this product . I is exactly what I expected and need .
1 #### I did n't read Sydney Sheldon in my teens in the nineties when all around me were devouring them . I just stuck my nose up at that popular culture . It was only last year 2013 that I decided to see what all the fuss had been about . Master of the Game was alright in the way you 'd expect a popular paperback to be . But this one If Tomorrow Comes was utter nonsense and ridiculous - in fact down right irritating . I do not recommend this book to anyone with an IQ rating of above 1.5
4 #### If you enjoy Jane Austin and all those endearing old novels this is another one for you . She , just as Jane Austin , paints the landscape of the 18th century life and invites you into that world for a charming visit . I knew where the story was going , but I so enjoyed the ride ... love taking these walks into that era .... four stars because it was a lovely story ... not life changing stuff ... you know ...
5 #### This book . What else can I say except that it is a classic ? Buy it . Read it . You will not be disappointed !
4 #### I enjoyed this book very much . At first I thought it was a novel about the Civil War in the U.S. ; but it actually is about a family that moved from the south to the north of England . It was a good read , in that it seemed so realistic .
4 #### Gaskell 's love story of county parish meets urban manufacturers set against the backdrop of industrialization and how it changed the north and south of England in the mid 19th century is a classic for good reason . The relationship dynamics and development between the two lead characters rivals that of Austen 's Pride and Prejudice . I have to praise the author for her characters and the storylines as well as the substance behind the story , and I have to say that the BBC mini - series ( 2005 ) takes it up a notch further by steering away from some of the novels flaws ( like the ending , where Dickens , her editor , made her remove the last chapter before publication , giving it an unsatisfying non - ending ) and the whole thing becomes enchanting , mesmerizing and deeply touching .
5 #### How did I miss knowing the powerful writing of Elizabeth Gaskell ? This novel is incredible , though sometimes the detail needs to be glossed over , it makes such a strong picture of the industrial revolution , labor , classes , etc in england during an age long ago . The characters are well drawn , and Margaret is unforgettable in her trials and ultimate resolution . Terrifici .
5 #### The first book I 've read that gives a detailed accounting of the climate in the North and the South leading up to the Civil War . Excellent read .
4 #### Gaskell was a contemporary of Jane Austen . She was not as talented , but is an okay writer . The story is Interesting , showing a very different Britain than Austen 's . An early , mild version of fiction designed to bring awareness of the difficulties of the poorer classes in newly industrialized Britain .
5 #### Another FANTASTIC read by Sidney Sheldon ! ! ! He never disappoints ~ Aways a page turner that I can not put down !
5 #### Her world falls apart and she loses everything . But this is one smart woman , and she plans a perfect revenge .
5 #### Love this book . Have for many years . I could n't find it used anywhere and I prefer to buy mine used for budget and Eco friendly reasons .
5 #### this story is amazing and the book is unavailable at my local library , when I finish reading it I 'm going to donate it to them so others can enjoy it !
5 #### True Sheldon style ! ! I have read all of Sydney Sheldon books and this one does n't disappoint . The endings are always a surprise !
5 #### Wonderful book , but I was absolutely stunned at the ending . Where is the ending ? There surely is a sequel , I hope ......
5 #### I enjoyed this book with its twists and turns . I plan on continuing to read more of Sidney Sheldon 's books .
4 #### Sweet period book . Margaret is learning so much as we all are through our trials and struggles . I enjoy reading it over again .
5 #### This classic novel is a favorite of mine . The characters are so very real . The story touches on various struggles in life , that the reader will surely be able to relate . Gaskell writes in such a way as to invoke deep feelings from the reader . Truly , this is a masterpiece .
4 #### I loved this book ! Mr. Thornton is only second to Mr. Darcy in my opinion ! A wonderfully written book . Even the harshness of the north has a charm to it in the end . The political unrest of the time still feels fresh . Recommended to everyone .
5 #### An engaging , enjoyable and enlightening read . Written in the early 1850s , I personally find the language clearer and seemingly more modern than that employed by Charles Dickens writing at the same time . As Margaret Hale and her mother accompany her vicar father to seek new employment , leaving the gentle southern English village of Helstone , for the harsh industrial town of Milton , where she encounters the violent conflict between the employers and the working poor , She meets the ambitious and somewhat ruthless John Thornton and his harsh mother and the central theme is the relationship that develops between Margaret and John Thornton But I always am more interested on that focusing on the British poor of the period , and found my favourite character was Bessy , daughter of Union representative Nicholas Higgins who Margaret befriends while Bessie is consumptive from inhalation of cotton dust which she eventually dies from Bessie 's gentle spirit and fine mind which shines the conditions of life as one of the downtrodden and brutalized working classes of Victorian England , is a wonder to behold . Nicholas Higgins also has a rough wisdom and cynicism and eventually even forms a friendship of sorts with Mr. Thornton when he is re - employed by him after the strike The novel covers a variety of themes and certainly gives us a feel for the tortured life of England during the Industrial Revolution
5 #### I am an avid Austen fan and a fan of Classic British writing in general and somehow , I did n't know of this fantastic book until I watched the BBC miniseries of it on Netflix . INSTANTLY HOOKED ! Then I set out to read the book and found this version for my Kindle and read it all in a few days . It consumed me ! To me , it 's a perfect blend of Austen and Dickens . Not so bright , shiny and fluffy as Austen , with a bit if dirt and darkness of Dickens . The characters are well rounded and you get enough but not too much of their depth . Enough to leave to the imagination . I am a fan of both book and miniseries , though the miniseries deviated several times , the main plot was kept intact . Preferred the book , of course , which can always give much more insight and knowledge into the characters minds . So go watch the Miniseries and then come and read the book so that you can enjoy each in thier own and not pick apart the miniseries for the deviations . And then you 'll have Richard Armitage in your head to enjoy filling in the character of John . And trust me , you 'll want him in your head ! Swoon !
3 #### Honestly , the only reason that I gave this book three stars is because this is something that I would not read on my own time . I ordered this with my Kindle for my class and I loved it . This was cheaper option than buying it from a college bookstore . Also , I 'm trying to go all electronic for my books . Th book is a drag , however it is easy to understand . Also , I was a little upset though because I found this book completely free online in an electronic version at [ ... ] . It 's a safe website and the entire book was there . I understand not wanting to read from a computer screen to not strain your eyes , but if you want to save a couple bucks there you go !
2 #### I valued the picture of an early industrial town in England , with conflicts between workers and owners , and a very class - divided society . But the romantic plot was painfully stilted . And in general the book was very slow - moving . Character depth was slight , character development barely noticeable . This book will take care of any desire you might have had to have been born at an earlier period in history .
5 #### I am really grateful to have been pointed recently to Mrs. Gaskell 's North and South . ALL the Victorian Classics but this were in my parents ' house as I was growing up , plus many volumes of Good Words in which they were often originally serialised . This delightful story was n't there , because as I now realise it has been out of print for well over a century since publication . Really very good in spite of the author 's Unitarianism ; that does n't seem to stop her from portraying people as praying to Christ , and I suspect makes her nearer to a conservative Christian position than many of her contemporaries . The PoV is more feminine than that of Dickens or Thackeray . There is the usual Victorian plethora of sobs , swoons and early death , but much delicacy of feeling amidst the drama . I was particularly interested in the handling of the class - war and of early trades - unionism .
4 #### A good insight into the time period particularly concerning the strife between the rural and urban ( industrial and agrarian ) factors as they relate to the social history .
5 #### This book had you from the start . Just when you thought you had figured it out there was a new twist .
4 #### It 's defintitely entertaining , and also a page turner . Which means a very good book . It 's a little cheesy , but in its genre , that 's to be expected . Overall , you will not be wasting your money purchasing this book . -AN
4 #### The product arrived through the promised shipping method and as promised . It was very useful for the purpose I got it for .
5 #### I 've read almost everything Sidney Sheldon in both Chinese and English . Love the stories he told . Recently I rewatched mini TV series of " If Tomorrow Comes " which brought me back to the book again . Still love it !
4 #### Another winner for Sidney Sheldon . His books always keep you engaged and wanting for more . This storyline is what movies are made of .
3 #### The beginning book was what I expected after reading the description ... but then the middle and the end went on a whole new angle ( granted I liked it ... but it was sort of odd ) . Was an ' ok ' read . I reread books all the time , but I would n't reread this .
5 #### Very comprehensive and well written . It was very easy to follow the histories of each family and how each interacts with the others . It also has a lot of historical facts in a timeline that helps understand the mindset of people living in the North and South . I wish my history classes had been this interesting .
5 #### I wanted to read North and South when I read that Elizabeth Gaskell wrote about England during the Industrial Revolution and was , like Dickens a social reformer . In that sense , with its focus on the conflict between the manufacturing and working classes , the novel delivers compelling historical fiction . In addition , it has as its central character ( Margaret Hale ) a strong woman who has the sort of courage and problem solving skills normally reserved for Victorian era males . Written in the serial form so popular in the mid- nineteenth century , it is both melodramatic and wordy at times . However , if you like Dickens , you should like North and South . It lacks his over - the - top comic characters , but is at the same time a step closer to more modern , realism . So , if the novel 's length does n't put you off , you 'll like it .
5 #### Suggested by a friend and found it most informative about the history of America . A subject that was not on our syllabus when I went to school many years ago !
5 #### I watched the movie first and then I decided to read the book and absolutely loved it ! Some things were changed from movie to book but it was still amazing !
5 #### This is my first Kindle book , and I enjoyed it immensely . I have had a preference for English authors and do n't know why I 'm just discovering her work . I saw the movie first and now think it did justice to the novel . I will definitely read more of her work .
4 #### I add books to the tablet so she can read them and she loves it She is a big Civil War fan
5 #### One of Sidney Sheldon 's fantasies but very exciting and once started hard to put down . Not for bedtime reading as it is hard to put down .
4 #### Wow this book took me 4 days . At the end if each day I would dream of the next chapter . Well done
4 #### A thrill ride of bad luck , stupidity , good luck and more serendipity . Great fun ( especially the part with the painter , it 's near the end ) , but a little on the un side of believable .
5 #### I loved this book ! ! On the edge of my seat from page one , very descriptive I could feel every place she went and I could n't put it down . I did n't think the Title was all that fitting for the entire book , it made sense for the first 1/3 of the book then from there it needed another title , lol . Anyway it was so good that I went all the way back to re read the Other side of midnight . And all I can say is that Sidney Sheldon is one hellofa writer , keeps you guessing and takes you to some nice places as you journey through his story .
5 #### This book keeps you on the edge ! You ca n't wait to see what she will do next ! ! ! You get to travel all over the world and never leave your chair ! ! It was good !
5 #### I read this book twenty years ago and still remember how great it was . I remember because it was one of only two books I had to sneak a peek ahead . I do n't want to give any spoilers so I 'll just say ... what this means is that the characters were so real to me ... I just had to know . I could n't wait until the end . And although I ca n't say that my books are similar to any novels , Sidney Sheldon was my first love and the writer who made me want to write . I truly believe that he was the father of romantic - suspense novels , especially those portraying a female heroine . Carmen DeSousa author of romantic - suspense bestseller&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/She - Belongs - To - Me / dp / B006PS21NU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">She Belongs To Me</a >
5 #### If you 've not read Sidney Sheldon , this is a great place to start ~ This is my favorite of all his work ! I love the heroine , she starts off one way , living a lovely , wonderful life ~ about to marry the man of her dreams when her whole world is quite literally shattered . Every horrific thing that happens to her , changes her , tempers her but never breaks her . Sidney Sheldon was the first writer I ever read where the heroine did n't wait for the hero to come and rescue her and this is my type of girl . I do n't want one who lays on the railroad track screaming for help , give me the girl who 's rolling her way to the sharp rocks , saws her ropes free and outsmarts the villain . I ca n't recommend this book high enough ! ! ! Just an FYI ~ This book was written in 1985 and is dated ~ there is no way , with today 's technologies , that the situations would be plausible . So , keep that in mind when you decide to purchase and/or read ~ It 's still a fabulous , fun read .
5 #### As usual , spell binding page turner . He never fails to deliver . Hard to put this book down as with all of his books .
5 #### Very good suspence and well written . Could n't put it down and almost hated to get to the end - very good .
5 #### But I have to say I like this author a lot as well . I have never read a bad Sidney Sheldon book .
4 #### The ending was a bit confusing however like all of Sidney Sheldon 's books ' IF tomorrow comes ' is filled with the perfect balance of suspense , revenge and thrill . The ONLY major downfall is the ending , apart from that , this book makes for a good read .
4 #### I knew nothing about this fact of European history before reading this enchanting book , so I feel both more informed and satisfied with the story woven among the cultural facts of the era represented . You can watch this drama on your ipad and enjoy it , but it 's even better to read along and fill in the gaps . Very worthwhile classic .
5 #### I think Mrs. Gaskell did not get her just due at the time this book came out . If I have read correctly , she was a parson 's wife , but she certainly was ahead of her time in many issues . I 'm going to try to find all her works and get through them all . Bright woman who should be studied by anyone who is interested in social issues . Also , it was a nice love story . Read it after I watched the BBC four part series based on the book . Both are great , if a little different .
2 #### I had a very hard time relating to the characters in this book . The author seemed to ramble on , in my opinion .
4 #### Had seen a PBS series based on the book so wanted to read it . It was a good story which takes place in late 1800 's England , about a 19 yr . girl . If you like books like " Little Women " you will enjoy this .
5 #### This is written in the style of its time . The women cry every 5 minutes . Nobody says what they think , to protect other people 's feelings . I wanted to throw it away at first , but once our heroine moves to the industrial north it gets interesting . There 's a certain amount of the author using people as mouthpieces for political speeches . Nevertheless , I loved it . By the end I felt I knew the people .
5 #### Besides being a great story with many memorable characters , you may learn more from this book about the civil war than any non fiction work on the subject . I kind of wish I had not just watched the miniseries now . I loved it but the book is that much better .
5 #### What a fantastic book ! One of Sydney Sheldon 's best without a doubt . This was a real page turner and is one of those terrific books that really lets you escape from the real world . His characters come alive and you are completely drawn into their world . You wo n't be disappointed ! !
5 #### As an avid reader of more than 3,000 books I can say without reservation this is the best book I 've read bar none ! ! ! ! The story line is simply brilliant ! ! ! A woman , beset by misfortune and poor choices lands herself in not only serious trouble but in jail and manages to claw , climb and scrape her way out of it all and rise to the top of her game . And how she stays at the top kept me spell bound . This is a must read .
5 #### Sidney Sheldon is an excellent author . I have read all of his books . A fantastic author was lost went he died . If you like romance and suspense you will love his books
3 #### I have always been a fan of Mr Sheldon and have read and re - read nearly all his books . This book started off extremely well and held me spellbound - and thrilled - a real page - turner . And then it sort of went .... well , just past being entirely credible . But , that being said , he does spin a good yarn and for sheer escapism it is well worth the read .
5 #### Another bombshell by the master ... Tracy Whitney is the woman we all wanna be , getting away with all the daring things we try to do .
4 #### If Tomorrow Comes was my first encounter with Sidney Sheldon and I would have to say it was good . I did n't know what to expect from the book , after only reading it on a recommendation but was glad that I took the advice . The book moves quickly and at fast pace . I found myself expecting the story to go one way and then surprised along the way . I also thoroughly enjoyed the various ' cons ' and ' schemes ' that were told in the story . Makes me wish I was as creative . I give it 4 stars .
5 #### I purchased this book originally because I saw the BBC mini series on Netflix and loved the story . I was pleasantly surprised at how easy to read this book is . The language is older then modern day , and runs the risk of being hard to follow .... but this one is written quite well . I am following and engrossed in the story so much . I do n't have to reread some phrase to understand it 's meaning and get pulled out of the story . It 's an excellent read .
5 #### Captivating . If you like history and personal interest this is for you . This is the first book on the morbid Civil War that I have been able to read without getting overwhelmed by depression . I am a Yankee living is Dixie and now have a whole new understanding and appreciation for what our country went through .
5 #### I confess to finding this author by following Richard Armitage of " The Hobbit " fame . He starred in the BBC drama edition of this . Highly recommend ! So I got the book to read . She is a very good writer ahead of her time in social issues and language . Not as much stodgy Victorian overblown verbiage as some . Apparently , she had to write this for a serial and ended it more abruptly than she wanted , but it is still a nice romance . Watch the drama , then read the book and you wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### Okay , just kidding , I love Jane Austen ... but seriously , why is this book never talked about by anyone ? I thought it was brilliant and I loved the combination of the classic style and the angstiness ( is that a word ? ) that is more associated with contemporary literature . Gaskell really gives you an insight into what her characters are thinking as well as painting a clear picture of the era and setting , and I enjoyed this book enormously . If you have n't seen the BBC series based on the book , be sure to check it out - of course the book is better , but I found the series to be very good as well .
5 #### After watching the Tv - series I wanted to read the book . And I most say I was not dissapointed . The series keep themselves really close to the books except a few turns here and there but to me it gave me even more to explore of this story with more Hale and Thornton and Higgins . If you want a historical romance with not only focus on the romance but a natural part of their dailylife then this one is definetly one you should read
4 #### Once again , I remind all that I am not a lover of classics ... by the four star rating I can honestly say I came close to loving North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell . Yes , it is true that it is written in typical " classic " style , which for me means long , run on sentences that you have to break down to catch what it is saying . Gaskell seemed to become poetic and inviting with this writing style . Classics are usually full of characters , but Gaskell 's Margaret and Thornton and Edith are people ! I loved them all . I had an over - powering sense of waiting for something spectacular to happen , and in the very last perfect paragraph , it did ! ( unlike so many classics ) This book will not be soon forgotten .
5 #### This novel has a slightly Dickensian flavor- without so much heavy description or satire . I enjoyed it because it felt so modern , about regular people with regular problems .
4 #### I decided to read this after seeing the 2004 BBC miniseries starring Daniela Denby - Ashe and Richard Armitage , and I am glad I did . It is an enjoyable novel , and I found little things along the way that deepened the characters and gave me insight into the story . Now I enjoy the miniseries even more !
3 #### I enjoyed this book but felt it a little long winded . Plot and story line could have been told with more flair and less drag .
4 #### Book is divided into two parts . In the first part , Tracy Whitney , protagonist , is a bank employee . Her mother is tricked by few gangsters and ripped of property . Tracy tries to avenge her mother , but she is also framed and send to jail by gangster . She faces several hardships in the jail and forms accomplices . On releasing from the jail , Tracy and her accomplices avenge the gangsters . In the second part , Tracy could not find a job because of her past , and with time , she turns into a art thief . She steals expensive paintings and diamonds under strong security . Thefts are challenging and detailed in the book . Tracy outsmarts her rivals and police around the globe . I like the second part of the book , because it is interesting and I was kept curious of what was coming ahead . Overall , this book is a good read and I recommend this book .
5 #### If you want to read a book with non stop adventure and excitement with a uplifting story this is the book for you .
5 #### I know I must have read this book years past , but had forgotten the story . I downloaded a sample when I was reviewing Sidney Sheldon 's books . It is absoultely one of the best mysteries in the history of time . Sidney Sheldon completely keeps you guessing as to where he is going with his plots and who the characters of the stories really are . I recommend that you read this book , but also let me recommend that you read every book he has written as they just continuously get better and better . This man was a genuius in his own rights when it came to writing . I read mysteries all the time , but his are by far at the top and exceed any and all expectations for a wonderful , and entertaining book ! Just read it ! ! ! !
4 #### I really enjoyed this work when I read it for class . Great heroine , great love story , great social commentary . On an unrelated note , there was a delightful mini - series done of this book , which I also recommend
5 #### Some find the writers Austen and Gaskell too tame for their taste . I feel it gives us a view into the past . I have seen others try to remake this beautiful story into a smutty version for " todays readers " , and I feel they are taking away from what the story and the characters really are . Yes the BBC screen adaption with Richard Armitage as John Thorton did the book justice , but many of the new books out there trying to rewrite the classic fall very very short .
3 #### Due to a cleric 's questioning Church of England doctrine , he and his family move from the aristocratic south of England to the dynamic manufacturing north . His young daughter has a very hard time adjusting to her new life , which leads to a rocky relationship with the owner of a cloth manufacturing plant . He finds her a spirited , attractive woman ; she is torn between her admiration of some of this qualities , but has a very hard time time with his ambition . I liked the part about the entrepreneurial lives of the manufacturers , where financial survival was just an error in judgment from failure . This is the first of a series of novels about these two , who eventually marry in a sequel .
5 #### I can honestly say I did not care and did not pay attention to anything History related while in school . Now that I am older I have more of an interest in American History . This author and his books were recommended to me by a good friend . This is the first book I chose to read by John Jakes . I have to say I really enjoyed reading this book . It reminded me slightly of Gone With the Wind . It is hard to write a review on this book without giving away the whole plot of the book as I do n't want to ruin it for other readers . The story is about the war between the Northern and Southern states and during the 1800 's . During this time slavery was a widely debated topic for each side . The book focuses on two families , one from the North and one from the South . It spans many decades and covers multiple characters from each family . There are ups , downs , secrets , tragedies , arguments that make you feel as if you are right there living it yourself . Highly recommended ! I already downloaded the Part Two !
4 #### I read this book for an 19th century English literature class and I honestly was n't looking forward to reading it that much . Books at this time were either highly romantic or highly political and this book seemed to merge the two together . Actually , I did like it and the main character , Margaret Hale , is fairly progressive for a female protagonist at the time . Some of the plot points are a bit over the top and unrealistic but it was definitely more interesting than a standard Victorian novel . By that I mean that things ACTUALLY happen in this book , people die , fight for their rights , and Margaret must choose her own path in live . Only reason this book is 4 stars instead of 5 is because the religious lean was a little too heavy for me but its understandable for the time . Also , we learned in class that Elizabeth Gaskell originally wrote this book as a serial so the ending is a little abrupt and feels a little unfinished because she ran out of assigned chapters . Still , a good book .
5 #### It 's been more than 20 years since I read this book by Sidney Sheldon and it is still the best book I 've ever read . In fact Sidney Sheldon in my humble opinion is the best author that I 've come across . He truly was a master storyteller . I 've read this book several times over the years and it still leaves me breathless . I must say part of the appeal to the story is the main character Tracy Whitney . She is a heroine that defies the odds and comes out on top in the end . It is a book that you simply ca n't put down .
5 #### I read this book years ago and really loved it ! I wanted a copy for myself so I could read it again and found it on Amazon . Sidney Sheldon always writes such big , powerful characters and sometimes his stories get too political for me but this one does not . In my opinion , it 's definitely the best book that Sheldon has ever written !
5 #### This is one of my favorite books of all time . I love the plot , the protagonist , the way it captures me from the beginning and takes me on the ride of my life . It is worth a full 5 star rating ! I like to go back and read it because the writing is that fantastic . Sidney Sheldon is a master storyteller .
4 #### I had as much fun reading this novel as any I have ever read . All I have to say is I think a lot more Sidney Sheldon is in my immediate future .
5 #### I had not read a Sidney Sheldon book in years . I now remember why I loved his books so much . Could n't put the darn thing down ! Loved it .
5 #### I have read this book several years ago . The brilliance is the flow of the plot . It is a page turner .
5 #### I truly enjoyed this classic novel . Like Austen , it was a bit predictable , but in the end still worth reading .
5 #### One of my favorite novels is Pride & Prejudice and this one is right up there . You know its great when the mini series is amazing . Books always far out weigh TV and this is no exception .
5 #### Anyone who loves pride and prejudice by Jane Austen will love this story ! It has become a favorite of mine . I stayed up almost all night to finish it and was not disappointed !
5 #### I loved the BBC classic movie . The book - I was unable to put down ! This one kept me up nights ! Good read !
5 #### A brilliant look at industry , society , and love . I 'd go back to the beginning , read it all again , and enjoy it just the same .
5 #### The industrial revolution is something we all need to know more about . What better way could there be to learn and at the same time have intrigue and romance . It covers the waterfront and is very well written .
5 #### I had earlier seen N&S on television , and absolutely loved it ... it is a wonderful story of Industrial England . This book goes into even more detail , and is well worth reading , even if one has already seen the show .
5 #### I just love the evolving romance ! With all the hardships going on it was hard at times to bear heartbreak , but my heart swoons at the sweet love . Such a great love story ! ! !
5 #### IF TOMORROW COMES is one of the best books I have read in a long time ... and I read a lot . Bravo to Sidney Sheldon . Sorry that he has passed on , but his tales are still with us .
2 #### Sheldon tried to create a plot consisting of a string of unrelated scams pulled by his heroine Tracy White , succeeding in all of them , certainly , this is very difficult to believe by a serious reader . The main character and heroine , Tracy White working for a man named Gunther , becomes a modern Robin Hood ripping off cardboard characters of unsavory reputations with no logical reason at all , just for the sake of doing . The so called story goes superbly fast and the scores of situations popping up get solved in a couple of pages one after another with an abuse of twist and turns but there is no plot after all . I have rated it two stars one goes for the poor quality and another goes for the fun the story sometimes carries on , particularly in the beginning . If this is your first time with Sidney Sheldon , try other Sheldon novels , i.e " Master of the Game " .
5 #### this story begins as Sheldon 's usual suspense books but later turns into wuiet a unique book in comparision to his others ........... the heroin in the book is loveable ........ and every page is filled with fun and unpredictabelity ......... u will probably be APPLAUDING by the end of this book ..... YEAH its THAT GOOD ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! JOYYYYYY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Great book . Was listed as used but appeared brand new . Would consider buying from this seller again .
5 #### I think this is the 4th ' If Tomorrow Comes ' that I 've purchased in the past 15 years . This is a timeless masterpiece and I can not stop reading it . I reread this book every 5 years or so . Tracey Whitney is a heroine that you 'll applaud long after the book is over . Sidney Sheldon is a Master Storyteller and if I lose this one ... I'll buy another in a few years .
5 #### Reads like a combination of Dickens and Austen . You have the working versus the wealthy class of Dickens and you have the wit , pride , prejudice , and passion of an Austen novel .
4 #### Enjoyable story and characters . Good insights into understanding the historical development of England at that time . Appreciated the balanced view of labor / management issues , and the broader context of different cultural perspectives and how they developed and manifested in that time period in England .
5 #### Gave this to my mom to read . She simply could not put it down . She loved it so much . If you like Jane Austen , you will like Elizabeth Gaskell .
5 #### The contrasts between life in the south and the north of England are beautifully drawn . The story is compelling . The issues of Industrial Age England come alive .
5 #### Loved it ! Reminds me a lot of the works by Jane Austin . Fell in love with the characters and places . Beautifully written story and an excellent kindle version !
5 #### I own the book in hardback and on Kindle . Also have the other two of the trilogy . One of the best books I have ever read two or three times each .
5 #### In " If Tomorrow Comes " Sidney Sheldon keeps you turning the pages from the first to the last . When the book ended , I wanted to read more . A great journey of a read with awesome characters and many wonderful story lines . This is the 2nd Sidney Sheldon book I have read ( along with Rage Of Angels ) , and it certainly wo n't be my last . I plan to read all of his books . You will not be disappointed . Happy Reading !
3 #### I 'm somewhat dubious about the steady stream of gushing about this book from a few years ago . Suspicions of shilling aside , I think this is vintage Sheldon -- enjoyable , middle - brow escapist trashy fun . Made - for - TV , of course . While it 's certainly not deserving of " best book ever ! " or whatnot , I think anyone looking for a realistic plot is also missing the point . It 's sheer fantasy , with just enough humanization of the characters to make one suspend disbelief . Sheldon 's protagonist seldom varies from book to book -- beautiful hot woman who outsmarts / triumphs over / excels in the man 's world around her -- but Tracey is one of the more likeable versions . Smart , with heart . Shrewd but not ruthless , only robs the guilty , etc . Actually had a mother she loved - a refreshing change from Sheldon 's usual Electra - complex - ridden - where's - my - daddy heroine . Okay , in one instance the illogic of the plot did get to me . When the fake FBI agents leave her on the train and disappear , it 's a bit preposterous that she could just head for the airport and find them . Even 20 years ago , I doubt that you could just randomly find two people at a busy airport . How could she have known what terminal or what flight gate they were at ? For the most part , it 's got clever fantasy capers and provides a mini - tour book description of various hotels and restaurants in Europe .
3 #### " AMUSING ... FAST - PACED ... AN ENERGETIC ESCAPIST ROMP."--New York Times Book Review 3.5 stars . After finishing this book I glanced at the cover and re - read the mini - review posted there ( see above ) and I could n't agree more . In many ways this is typical Sidney Sheldon : the main character is a beautiful heroine caught up in amazing situations filled with adventure and exotic locales ; love and lust , power and privilege , fame and riches waiting to be experienced . But as this book stands , it was a little too typical . The writing is standard mass - market mediocrity loaded with tons of dialogue to keep the pace flowing like quicksilver , and the scenarios are often so predictable as to be anti - climactic . The structure of the story is a bit odd , however , as the very beginning feels like a novella that ends abruptly midway through the book . What follows are a series of capers that could have been sectioned off as short - stories if not for the recurring main characters . If you are new to Sidney Sheldon I most heartily recommend " Master of the Game " over any of his other works . " The Sands of Time " is also worth checking out . " If Tomorrow Comes " is enjoyable for what it is : a quick , entertaining read .
5 #### Another of Sidney Sheldon 's fast paced books with a beautiful heroine that exacts revenge on her enemies , travels the world , becomes a jewel thiefs , gets in / out of tight spots and falls in love ! He 's a master at this the type of writing and undoubtedly the best the 80 's had to offer in the genre of the ever tough Romance / Heroine / Racy / Revenge Formula Novel . A great read !
5 #### Tracy Whitney , the heroine of this novel , is like all of Sidney Sheldon 's leading ladies : She 's young , beautiful , bright , and driven . Oh , she 's also a professional criminal . The story opens as Tracy is wrongly convicted of attempted murder ( well , OK ; she DID shoot him ! ) and begins serving a harrowing prison term . After her surprising release , she plots revenge on all the people who have hurt her . This was my favorite part of the book . Tracy then becomes involved with a con - man and ends up as a world - famous thief , stealing treasures in the capitals of Europe . She also finds love with another thief , but can she trust him ? If you can overlook Tracy 's criminal life and the joy she takes in it , you 'll love this book . It describes in minute detail how she manages to steal from the most securely - guarded museums , stores , and homes in Europe . There is humor , too , as Tracy and her pal Jeff merrily bounce from caper to caper , outsmarting the authorities and narrowly escaping capture . Another great Sidney Sheldon page - turner ! Kona
5 #### I have been a fan of the movie for a long time . It is like they used this book as the script for the movie as I could almost hear Burton and Eastwood reading the book to me
3 #### Disappointing . The movie is one of my long time favorites and I always wanted to read the book . Maclean is a 1950s -60s popular star of this sort of thing so I expected a fun read . It 's not . Poor prose poorly expressed and totally unbelievable details such as the leaping about on the cable cars as well as unreal dialog make the experience unpleasant . I had the same reaction to Guns of Navarone , another movie favorite .
5 #### Very nice adventure story . I liked his others Fear is the key , Satan Bug , Ice Station Zebra as well . Fun read .
5 #### This novel is among MacLean 's best efforts the pacing is rapid and the descriptions of places and people keeps you guessing where the story is going highly recommended .
5 #### i read all of Alistair MacLean 's books back in the early 60 's . I still remember them to this day and I am 68 . Mystery , intrigue , governments , and in some cases love . My favorite as Force Ten from Navarro and Ice Station Zebra . The books exceptional the movies okay . Ice Station Zebra the movie did not follow the script in full ; it deteriorated from the book towards the end . So long ago , but still some of the best reading ever . I read all of Alistair 's books and still have fond memories of them .
5 #### A classic masterpiece . A spy thriller extraordinaire ! WWII . An American General is being held prisoner in an impenetrable castle in Bavaria . A suicidal mission is hastily put in play , it 's members are British and America . It 's all a ruse , a trap to catch and extremely dangerous traitor . This novel is filled with action , intrigue , betrayal and bravery . This is an epic read !
2 #### The book was written a long time ago and you could tell , oh ; and it was an English writer . Maybe that was the problem . It was very dull but I did finish it weeks after I started it .
5 #### I very much enjoyed this book . Similar to Jane Austen in style and content . Loved the historical background and research put into this work .
3 #### I downloaded this book after watching the BBC series for the third time . On the series , the acting is very good , the music exceptional , but after reading the book , I discovered the true gem is the series is the screenwriting . Although the core of the BBC story line is there , and many of the nuances explained through the book 's narration , the story does not hold up well for modern reading . I recommend reading this book only when you are ready to dig deeper into the period , the characters , and the plot line , presented in the BBC series , and are prepared to overlook a lot of annoying monologues .
5 #### One of the great classics . So much to learn from this book historically . The formation of a union in Northern England . The politics of the Church of England . And the English caste system . The romance is well developed . But the ending is actually better portrayed in the BBC North and South .
3 #### I enjoyed the book , particularly the background descriptions as England was changing from an agrarian to an industrial society . Could have used more depth to the characters . I would have especially liked to understand her father better ... too bad he did n't get to live longer . Ending is rather abrupt .
3 #### I enjoyed this 19th Century book very much and it was a required read for a book club I belong . But it was good !
4 #### A very good story but the accent is a little daunting at first . The leading man is very handsome and charismatic .
5 #### This book is fascinating in the story it tells about the lead up to the War between the States . The book is filled with interesting and compelling characters and how they are affected by the existence of slavery and the desire to either preserve that institution or to end it and the raw emotion that is engendered by the existence of slavery .
5 #### Delightfully different from the movie . Surprising that not everyone in the Shloss Adler is shot . Made sense . Ca n't wait to read the Navarone series .
5 #### Totally captivating WWII drama ! Could not put this book down . Loved every word ! Descriptive writing beyond anything I have ever read . I had a full - length movie playing in my head the entire book !
5 #### Started off like a routine rescue mission , but the multiple layers of the mission slowly became apparent and more intriguing . Many unexpected turns in this spy thriller . A great read .
5 #### Very well written I liked how it and the movie were very close to each other as so often does not happen
5 #### A woman is framed for a crime she did n't commit and left to rot in prison with no hope for release . She is abused and forced to act " tough " and learn the ways of the criminal to survive . She is able to engineer her escape and get back at those who wronged her . Having been " soiled " of character , revenge on those who wronged her is not enough . She then proceeds to become a super high - class con artist . The book goes on to tell one sting after another . An interesting one involves conning to chess masters into thinking she if playing each , where in fact they are playing against each other . The woman decides to do one last score and then retire . This will turn out to be a real tough thing to accomplish . I have read about 10 Sheldon books and this is by far my favorite . It raises the question , does a person 's environment determine whether they will become a criminal or does the genes ? Sheldon goes for the former in this book .
5 #### Sidney Sheldon is my favorite novelist of all time , and " If Tomorrow Comes " is perhaps his crowning achievement ! The novel 's beautiful heroine , Tracy Whitney , is most certainly his toughest , wittiest and most cunning creation ! Nobody crafts a more exciting story than Sheldon , and " If Tomorrow Comes " has more twists and turns than a downhill skiing competition ! If you want a book that makes the time simply fly by , you wo n't find any title more entertaining than this one !
5 #### ALL OF THE SIDNEY 'S BEST WORKS WERE READ BY US FRIENDS WHEN WE WERE IN COLLEGE , THAT IS ABOUT 10/12 YEARS AGO ... HIS LATER BOOKS LACKED THE AURA WHICH HIS EARLIER BOOKS HELD . AGAIN THIS IS A MAGNIFICIENRT BOOK .... WHAT IS THE BEST PART ABOUT SIDNEY 'S BOOKS IS THAT HE LITERALLY TRANSPORTS YOU IN THE BOOK , YOU FEEL AS IF YOU ARE THE MAIN CHARACTER AND THINGS ARE MOVING AROUND YOU .... A FEAT NOT MANY CAN ACCOMPLISH ......
5 #### You just want to find out what happens next . The description leaps off the page and suddenly you find yourself propelled into the world of Tracey Whitney , a world of near escapes , perfect timing , intrigue , passion , and last but not least , the hope for tomorrow . A brilliant creation and work of fiction . A plot that really stands out amongst the rest .
5 #### This is the first book that I read by Sidney Sheldon and I was completely in awe of the scope of this story . Every twist in the plot had me turning pages late into the night simply because I was unable to put the book down . I was quite simply , riveted to the spot . The main character , Tracy , is someone that you come to care about and respect as she leads you a series of wild and unexpected adventures . Sheldon has created an intelligent , witty and captivating tale that will keep your jaw on the floor for days to come .
4 #### This is an excellent story , the first part of the book when tracy goes to jail and when she get out and takes revenge for her mother , the second part is a little bit repetitive with her robs because one and another , and another were almost the same , except the last one , that was an amazing one .
5 #### North and South is a powerful , passionate , beautiful love story that revolves around the antagonistic relationship between these two characters and it is hard not to make comparisons with Austin 's Pride and Prejudice . Though John is a hardworking industrialist rather than an idol and landed gentleman , it is certainly very similar to Darcy as much as for his surly , stern , proud , strong willed nature as for his integrity and strength of character . Also like Darcy he falls desperately in love despite itself and is rejected . Margaret is similar to Elizabeth in that after rejecting John she realizes just what sort of man she had just rejected . All of the characters from Margaret , John , M&M Hale , Fred , Betsy , Nicolas , Mr Bell , the Shaw family and Thornton family are all so eloquently done you feel like your in touch with each one . N&S is also dealing with the working and living conditions of the mill workers and the beginnings of the labor unions of that time . We see the unions from the perspective of both masters and workers and the strength of both sides . In addition to also showing the stark contrast of industrial city living to the easy London lifestyle and country living . This story is a spellbinding , mesmerizing book that is so hard to put down , I highly highly recommend it for anybody that loves a truly wonderful classic love story that has all the elements of real life during a very trying time in England .
5 #### A very imaginative book keep one thinking and turning the pages in anticipation . Gives one an idea of what life was in the south and the battle between north and south which in some way is still in force today in a different way .
5 #### This is one of the greatest love stories I have ever read . It is full of passion and feeling . Mrs. Gaskell portrays the feelings and personalities of each character splendidly . This story , set in England , is full of surprises and is very interesting . In its own way , it has some suspense . It is one of my favorite old English stories . Mr. John Thornton , a very important manufacturer in Milton , is a proud , strict , almost rough man . But when the Hales come to town , his feelings for the regal , proud , queen - like Margaret Hale can not be denied . The two are of very different opinions and stations in life . When Miss Hale 's brother visits his ailing mother in Milton , Mr. Thornton 's suspicions arise , and their relationship has a down fall . Can Margaret face Mr. Thornton with her lie , and tell him the truth ? Can Mr. Thornton face his true , deep feelings for Miss Hale ?
3 #### Got this for my wife , as we both have the movie . She read the whole thing but says in THIS case the movie is a lot better !
5 #### Fast moving , suspenseful , and lots of action . Great leading character .
5 #### This was an entertaining book full of twists and turns . Right up until the last few pages , I never saw what was coming . Penned in 1967 , it still reads perfectly and is a nice change of pace from the formulaic books of today .
5 #### This was one of the most exciting books I have ever read . It is the story of a woman named Tracy Whitney . She gets framed for a crime , and is harshly punished . Afterword , she gets released from prison for doing a good deed for a warden , and after getting even with those who turned against her , she begins to become highly wealthy from pulling off one con after another . While the cons may seem to get tedious , they put you on the edge of your seat . Just when you think Tracy is going to get her due , she amazingly escapes again . This novel is nearly flawless . The only think I did n't like was that she was going to get revenge on her ex - fiance , but she seems to just forget about it . But , it 's okay . Do n't miss this novel .
5 #### Another book of Mr. Sheldon 's that I read years ago and again it is good . This one moves fast and you root for the main character throughout the whole book . Her revenge is sweet . Pick it up . You wo n't regret it ! Have fun ...
5 #### Sidney 's most intriguing Heroine and an imaginative plot - If Tomorrow Comes is all about Tracy Whitney ' My Love ' who bubbles around merrily while you devour the book happily ! Yeah , Sheldon is my top fav and I read all his books which are just great but this one is a page turner that never makes you stop reading again n again ! Smashing , lovely Whitney faces hardship and revenge . Sid has efficiently portrayed the character of Tracy Whitney , the beautiful romantic woman , an idealistic who passed through trials in life . When her mom Dorris Whitney commited suicide , Sid express the emotions of Tracy deeply live all through the pages when Leiutenant Miller informs her and she reaches to find a note left by her mom ! If Tomorrow comes is Sidney Sheldon 's Best ever pick you can choose and enjoy the scoop of romance , money game , adventure , thrill and emotion .
4 #### This the first book by Sidney Sheldon that I have read and I will certainly be reading more . If Tomorrow Comes tells the tale of a woman scorned . Wrongfully sent to jail and left by her fiance .. Tracy decides to get even on her release . One by one she goes after the people who have wronged her . No longer the victim she comes to enjoy the thrill of the scam and goes off on an amazing life of crime . This story is an adventure so go along for the ride .
5 #### I have been reading Sidney Sheldon 's books since high school and they are all very captivating . However , " If Tomorrow Comes " is a definite standout . Tracy Whitney is a very clever and smart character . I really wish that I had all of that cleverness that she had ! I loved the way that she outsmarted everyone ( even Daniel Cooper ) .
5 #### From the beginning to end , you will be find yourself wrapped up in the world of the main character , Tracey Whitney . It is full of surprises , adventures , and definitely some mind - blowing experiences . You will be fascinated by her , jealous of her , sympathetic to her , and you will love her ! You can learn alot from this book . It is a must - read !
4 #### Enjoyed this thriller both times I read it . It is one the falls into the category of " enjoyable re - reads " on my book shelf . This and his Puppet On a Chain are my favorites .
2 #### Boring . These books were very popular years ago but are showing their age in writing style and content .
5 #### Mr. McLean was a great writer , enjoyed the book
5 #### An amazing book about a rescue operation that is absolutely high risk . Well done , gripping , challenging , but well written , it is hard to put this one down .
5 #### I very much enjoyed this Series . It felt well researched , was quite informative in the telling of the storyline . From Book 1 to Book 3 , it kept me entertained , involved and turning pages . John Jakes provides enough detail to make it interesting , make it feel like you are right in the middle of the times . Yet you do n't feel bogged down and bored . Read the series for enjoyment !
3 #### This novel was published in 1855 , and suffers from the melodrama of novels of the era . However , the plot and characters are well done . Included is contrast of rural life versus life in an industrial town , and management / labor strife in factories , as well as the suppression of rights for women , and also the effect of poverty on children . So it is a " meaty " novel to some extent . That said , it is a long - winded book replete with sobbing , overcome , prostrate women , and over - written , over - wrought ( by today 's taste ) interiority . And it has an abrupt ending that lacked sufficient closing . It is 500 pages , but felt like 800 . I 'm glad I read it , but I 'm also glad I 'm not reading it .
5 #### I am currently in the the middle of reading this series of stories ; this one was particularly good and hard to put down . Very good book !
5 #### Great book , couple of scams I did n't know about . Must reed .
5 #### This was my 1st Sheldon read .. i was impressed .. many good twists to the story in a book that was not easy to put down .. id refer it to anyone who likes a thriller
2 #### The first part of the book acts as the set - up for the second . The first is slow and the description of how the protagonist takes revenge from her enemies is frankly naive . The second part is better but still if it 's supposed to be a thriller it would have to be addressed for early - teeners not for adults .
5 #### Every bit as good as I remember it . Re - reading it after seeing the movie so many times did take a little away from the suspense but still a very good read .
3 #### In general I am a fan of Alistair Maclean 's writing . Bear Island seemed too contrived & the main character had several seeious lapses in judgment that I found disappointing .
5 #### A very intriguing World War 2 novel . A fantastic read , with a very gripping story line . It grabs you from the first sentence and wo n't let go .
2 #### A super hero , a blend of Captain America and 007 , defies impossible odds , storming the Gestapo southern headquarter in Germany , a castle on a high mountain , accessible only by cable car , in the middle of winter . Not even entertaining .
5 #### A great novel made into a great movie . The differences between the two is interesting .
4 #### I had read it many years ago . It was a good book then and was still enjoyable to read again .
5 #### A very good read . Lots of twists and turns . Well scripted like the old best sellers used to be .
5 #### This book will have you feeling like you are propelled through time to 1800 's America . Excellent character development of Orry and George . North and South has it all : friendship , love , hate , deceit , happiness , sadness , life , death .... I love how JJ makes his characters seem like real people you might meet on the street . Everyone is n't beautiful and dashingly handsome . They are flawed and human . Some you like and some you do n't . Great read :)
4 #### I remember when the TV series came out ( do n't remember the series , though ) , and always thought the concept of brothers and friends and neighbors all fighting on opposite sides of the war . This book sets the stage for how those divides happened .
3 #### The story was interesting and what kept me reading . The writing is just this side of bad . I was shocked when I realized that this author is widely read and has been for years . I thought it was a first time novel . A cardinal rule of writing is to show do n't tell what is happening . This author writes as though the reader is a child and could n't possibly understand any feeling , thought , emotion unless he spells it out for them . Very irritating . Anyway I will never read another book by him , at least intentionally . ( I never look at the author I just read a few chapters and see if I like ) If you do n't want to have to think at all then this is a book for you .
5 #### John Jakes rocks every time . He has a way of putting the reader on the scene ; everything that is fiction is believeable .
5 #### I am a big civil war buff . These books are very real and life like . I loved them all . Recommend .
4 #### the story was great and I read this books years ago . It is so nice to be able to reread it again .
4 #### This book is a very accurate accounting of the historical facts during this period of US history . The characters are very real as are their struggles , joys and day to day situations . I found it difficult to put down and looked forward to each episode of the story as it unfolded . Compelling reading w strng historical background .
5 #### I became acquainted with John Jake 's writing when I discovered his Kent Family Chronicles in the early 70s -- I was hooked on the series . I 've read every book . The characters in this trilogy are believable and interesting ( some villainous characters are women ) . Mr. Jake 's books are the reason I came to enjoy historical novels . His research gives accurate period details while his characters are engaging . I write children 's stories and am near completion of my first historical novel for children . Thank you Mr. Jakes .
5 #### The man never failed to capture the reader 's attention . Great drama .
5 #### I have read this book in paper back and now on Kindle . No matter where or how you read this book it is a page turner . Suspense , action and no sex a very good book . Does not need obsenity to get the story line across . All thumbs up on this one ...
4 #### Maclean 's military thrillers are all pulse - pounding adventures and this one is no exception . This was a re - read for me and it was just as exciting as the first time . Military buffs will continue to delight in it .
5 #### I believe the book is better than the adapted movie . It was a fast moving story with interesting characters .
5 #### This book was absolutely great . I read it in one night and I 'm in the middle of reading again before I have to return it . I was so in awe of all the ways Tracey outsmarted people . It was awesome .
3 #### North and South : 1(the North and South Trilogy ) started off strong but I got tired about half way .. I did finish but its a little too long with too many generations
5 #### If you enjoy the Masterpiece Theater dramas , you will love reading this book . I actually saw the four hour drama first and just had to read the complete story . This is an intriguing love story as well as a history lesson about the early days of manufacturing in Milton , England .
4 #### Saw the BBC mini - series on Netflix and was so intrigued by the production value and character portrayals that I just had to read the book behind the screenplay . The Brits are big on Gaskell but this was the first novel that I read by the author . Thoroughly enjoyed the deep dive , but I have to admit that the screenplay was even more brilliant in retrospect . I usually find film adaptation to be a poor second to the original novel , but this time the alterations improved the story line and made for a tighter drama .
5 #### Loved this book . Want to read the sequel to it . It just draws you in until you feel you really know all about both families and their struggles before and during the Civil War . John Jakes really does his homework .
4 #### I have the Kindle version of this novel . There are some issues with spelling errors and formatting in some places , but otherwise it is great . This novel is a pretty easy read and is in the same as Austen , in that it looks at social behaviors and class differences .
5 #### I wish I had read it sooner . It was so good . Makes me want to study more of the civil war history . Can hardly wait to read the next book in the trilogy .
4 #### Barely qualifies as an historical novel , and the accomplishments of the hero stretch the boundaries of believabilty . Nevertheless , it is interesting and a compelling page turner . It 's unlikely I 'd read a second time .
4 #### Previously I had only seen the movie , which I liked a lot . The book and movie held pretty close to each other . The big difference was the ' witty repartee ' between the 2 title characters in the book . I enjoyed it , it was exciting .
5 #### I knew this book had been around for awhile , and think I had even seen the movie , but the book is even more gripping ; a can't - stop , page - turning must - read ! Alistair Maclean is a master of suspense and action fiction , and this book certainly did not disappoint .
3 #### It is a very slow book to reasd . I am still reading it , It is way to detailed for me ,
5 #### A well - written page - turner by a recognized master of suspense . The movie with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood follows the book closely with good reason . It 's an easy read , moving the reader along with a fast - paced , well thought through narrative . Great book if you are interested in cloak and dagger WWII stories .
4 #### I meant to give it two stars . Not a very good read -- stage not well set and too frivolous for the subject matter .
3 #### This good was good - yet it lacked ... the " who done it " part - I love all of Sidney Sheldon 's books so far - I 've read 10 so far - and this one was just ... I just did n't get excited about it . And I read what other people think about this book and I just think to myself WHY - HOW can someone say something that good about this book ? My favourite Sheldon book is " The Doomsday Conspiracy " which was my first and it made me want to read them all - If I read this one first I would n't read any of his others . Giving this 3 stars is pushing it - I only gave it that much because it 's Sidney Sheldon ... Maybe it 's because I 'm 15 that made it not appeal to me a great deal . I do n't particularly care for reading books with lesbian activity in them ... But the beginning was interesting - the end was ... alright - the middle had nothing ....
2 #### Appear to be a written for movie action series that could make an exciting movie but is very unrealistic in the written form . The German army being as incompetent as betrayed in the book is contrary to all records related to WW 2 and the continued extreme performance of the apparent hero despite near fatal injuries is totally ridiculous . One could not maintain interest or connection to the events in the book that were to completely unbelievable .
4 #### good reading but hard to follow sometimes but i am 83 so who knows .
5 #### Just as riveting as the movie ... who needs Clint Eastwood . Could not put it down .
4 #### Where eagles dare is a non - stop thrill ride where no one is who they seem to be and everyone has a hidden agenda . It is set in the days just prior to operation Overlord ( invasion of Normandy ) and follows Major Smith , a British intelligence officer as he infiltrates a Nazi stronghold deep behind enemy lines . The story will keep you guessing who the good guys are between hair raising action sequences . Give it a try !
5 #### This book was very exciting from the very beginning to the final goodby ! I love this type of book where you never know which way it will go next . I loved the book and have always enjoyed the author .
3 #### There was something about this 400 page book that compelled me to keep reading and I did so sure that it would pick up and have a glorious ending . In my opinion the book just got to the point of the story on the second to last page . It appears there may be sequels but I while I 'd like to read what I would have presumed would be the main crux of the story it would have to move substantially faster .
5 #### Wow can you believe this classic is free ! I think it is perhaps more powerful than Pride and Prejudice and certainly watching the BBC program makes it so . It is a heartbreaking story with so much sadness I thought I could not possibly like it . The hero Mr Thornton is equal to Mr Rochester of Jane Eyre and even more opinionated and prejudiced than Mr Darcy . It is a must read for any lover of classic literature and for those of us who are frustrated that it does n't continue ( as I believe the author was ) then there are numerous great sequels which you can quickly buy to fill the craving . Ca n't recommend it more . A wonderful wonderful book .
3 #### But have to agree with a prior reviewer - the typos are killing me . I 'm slogging thru though , I 've certainly read worse but I do wish this was properly proofed prior to release . I 'd gladly pay for a Kindle version of the book released by a proper publisher .
4 #### The four part series that BBC did on this book was so good I watched it over and over again . Then I heard that there were two endings so I bought the book to see what I had missed . The type is very small and being that is was written a 150 years ago is very wordy so , even though I was enjoying it - I found it very hard to get through . Went on to A Heart for Milton and recommend that to everyone .
5 #### I read this book in 1985 , I bought it Hardcover To this day I still remenber the title and the plot . Started readind at app . 7:30 pm and read all night .I keep saying to my self I will finish this chapter and then go to bed.well the first thing I new it was 6:30 am and i had read the whole book COULD!T put it down . To this day 12 years later I still recommend this book to friends .
5 #### This was the first Sidney Sheldon book that I ever read . Years later , after reading them all , it remains my favorite . I loved this book so much that I 've read it about 10 times . The characters are terrific , and it 's fun , suspenseful and powerful all at once . This is a great read and I recommend it highly . Everyone I 've recommended it to so far has loved it !
5 #### Dear Allistair , what a great story and wonderful story line . This story was very entertaining and exciting from start to finish . It 's been a long time since reading one of your stories but you never disappoint . I highly recommend reading this book to anyone interested in reading a great story . Thanks for the entertainment .
5 #### Great read .. Did n't really know who was good guy or crook until last chapter , almost last few pages . Great read for a small cost .
2 #### The story has way too many situations where the main character just manages to get out of an impossible predicament . You can liken this to the cowboy armed with only his six shooter surrounded by 1000 Indians . His pistol never run out of bullets , he kills all the Indians , marries the chiefs beautiful captured white women and rides off into the sunset .
5 #### MacLean wrote this book in six weeks and turned it into an action movie with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood . The kill count in the book is a lot less than the movie .
4 #### I enjoyed the read and read through to the end but skipped some parts as slow and overly descriptive taking away from the action of the scene . Overall though recommend .
4 #### I never saw the movie so I had no idea what this book was about . It is very exciting . An unbelievably complex mission to uncover double agents . The writing was great and I loved the suspense . I gave it 4 stars because at a number of points in the story the action became so confusing that I was unable to picture what the characters were doing .
5 #### Great book ! I could not put it down . So much action , so exciting , could n't wait to see what would happen next . So full of twists and turns , I did n't know what was going to happen next . This is a must read ! ! ! !
4 #### This was one of Maclean 's books that I never read and it was enjoyable as all the others were . Nice to take a trip back in time to the timeframe that this story takes place . I always love Maclean 's heroes talking in the first person . They seem to be such simple guys , but there is a deep , smart side to all of them like the hero in this story . If you 've never read Maclean , pick out a couple of his more popular books and have a good read .
5 #### North vs south , industrial revolution , unrequited love , jealousy , death , and one of the most original heroines in literature make it tautologous that it is a must read .
5 #### Three books in the North and South trilogy . I am excited about having them but the idea of reading them is daunting . They are a lot longer than I thought they would be
1 #### The print was way to small for me to read and enjoy . I was very disappointed . Will look for a copy in bigger print .
3 #### Bear Island was a cheap purchase for me around New Year 's ( big Kindle sale ) . It took me a while to get into ... lots of characters , big gaps of time in between readings , a couple of really long chapters ... so maybe a little my fault for it seeming to be a bit disjointed , and hard to follow because of the slow start . But it picked up and improved toward the end . Still , not my fav MacLean read , and I 've read prob . a dozen or more over the years .
3 #### Maclean is a brilliant writer , but this story reads like a screenplay and I do n't feel it 's his best work . There is a struggle with POV in the opening scene in the airplane that is confusing . The Golden Rendezvous is wonderfully written by contrast .
5 #### Great story and it is a great movie too ! You will enjoy all of the twists and turns in an incredible tale .
5 #### Complicated story - but enjoyable - watch the movie - they track closely to each other .
5 #### the author was really great for his time and the story really get you thinking and hope you are right at the end of the book
5 #### Another part of this great epic ! Very large book in great detail ! Like new condition ! A perfect read if you want a good , long story and get to be involved with all the characters in it ! Thanks good seller whom I will purchase from again !
3 #### I absolutely love things like Lewis Carroll 's Alice books , but I dislike Victorian novel - style writing in general . It 's not something you see anymore , and if you want to be an English major , wonderful stuff to learn about , but it 's not easy to read because the writing style involves a lot of telling and not enough showing .
5 #### This will be the 3rd time I will have read this book . As always it is an awesome book and John Jakes is an awesome writer . I am so glad I could get it on my Kindle because my paperback is well not in really good shape . Now I can keep it forever and re - read it when ever I want . I love my Kindle ! ! ! !
5 #### Not only do you get completely involved with the characters , the situation leading up to the Civil War from an everyman 's point of view is extremely well presented .
5 #### Probably the best Period Drama ever made from a book of unsurpassed quality . The book was far ahead of its time .
5 #### I fell in love with the mini - series and then read the book . Not a disappointment ! It is a thicker book than some , but I found it easy to get through and loved the writing . You wo n't be disappointed if you love this sort of English historical fiction !
4 #### I have seen the movie of the same name many times . So , when I saw the book pop up I said , " What the heck " . It is a little different from the movie - in that it is more " book " action than " movie " action . Also , I found it interesting that in the book , they avoided killing any more than necessary ( in the movie , people are killed like crazy ) . I also found the relationship of the characters was different than in the movie - that made it a little more interesting than just reading a screenplay of the movie . If you have never seen the movie , this book makes a good story on its own . However , I will say that action is somewhat muted compared with the movie .
4 #### Imagine Patrick McGoohan as the narrator of this mystery and you 're off on a wry adventure of words in ice - cold seas .
4 #### Maclean has experienced incredible success for his wartime adventure novels . You can not fault him for plot , premise and pace . All of these components are wonderful . If there is one flaw it is in the development of his characters . The characters in Where Eagles Dare are paper thin . He tends to reuse stock characters that most readers would be familiar with ... the cold , unflappable , stiff - upperlipped British hero ; the tough , wisecracking with slight drawl American sidekick ; and the weak but beautiful woman which is surprising for a top MI6 agent . Any other characters , including the Germans , are treated as cardboard extras . This aside the writing is punchy and the dialogue solid even it comes from stereotypes . Certainly Maclean knows how to play out a tense action scene that is why so many of his books have become movies . That is what makes this book readable . Who would n't want to know what happens on a cold winter night when seven men and a woman " drop in " on the mountain headquarters of the Gestapo ? After all , not everything is as it seems .
4 #### I enjoyed this very much . Read it in two sittings . Stock characters but they seem special . Ca n't wait to read more MacLean !
5 #### This first book of the trilogy is great . The second book is a pretty good follow up but the third one is boring as he is milking the subject .
5 #### I watched the movie on TV and then decided to read the book . The book goes into so much more detail and is better than the movie . There were no slow parts for me . I loved every page and it went fast . I am now reading The Bastard by John Jakes and it is also very good . I would recommend this book to anyone who wants an entertaining novel with lots of factual American Civil War history .
5 #### A wonderful love story , I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it .... it kind of reminds me of pride and prejudice since both the characters clearly love each other but are too proud to admit it .... the story actually turned out to be quite sad as there was a lot of death , but everything turns out all right in the end .... I love John thornton , an easy character to fall in love with ..
5 #### I read this series when I was in high school . I will purchase the entire trilogy for my kindle . The characters are wonderful . Reading is an escape for me . I can go anywhere depending on what book I 'm reading .
4 #### For those of you who are expecting something more like the BBC mini - series with Richard Armitage , this is not it . But if you actually enjoy classics like Bronte , Dickens and Austen , then you will surely enjoy Elizabeth Gaskell 's North and South .
5 #### If you 've watched the adaptation , but never read the book , you really should . While I love the adaptation , it is not surprising to learn that it differs from the book . If you enjoy good literature , you should give this a try .
4 #### I just reread this after many years after seeing the mini series on Tv again . I ' d forgotten just how entertaining & at the same time insightful it was . A great read & fast moving enough to keep my attention & pages turning . Definitely recommend for every one . It should be recommended reading in high school with discussion about the attitudes displayed by characters on both sides of one of the darkest periods in our history .
5 #### I really enjoy Alistair MacLean books . I actually saw the movie first , but I enjoyed reading the book more . You truly get the sense of danger in his stories .
5 #### MacLean writes page turners and this storyline is no different as he takes a commando team into Nazi Germany . Numerous surprises , twists and turns , fast paced action , murder , betrayal , intrigue , a bit of romance are all part of this thriller . All the characters are well defined and fit their respective roles .
5 #### Outstanding book . You get more insight into the characters
5 #### IT opens ones eyes to what is real in that it is frightening based on the fact that we are all one in Jesus yet we are so divided . I guess the rich is privileged and the poor will always be poor . It also shows the vast difference between black and white . Good book to read . I would definitely recommend it to others especially the youths so they can be aware of what is real .
5 #### Great novel . The ending was rushed but I was expecting it to be since I had previously learned that Elizabeth Gaskell was pressured to meet a deadline . I do n't feel like it took away from the spirit of the story .
4 #### Way better than Pride and Prejudice although , P+P has a smoother ending , in my opinion . Still , the romance is real and wonderful . Completely worth reading !
5 #### If you love the civil war period as I do this book will not disappoint . It is a complex and entertaining story of the war and how these families loved and lived through it . I recommend all the books in the series .
5 #### Loved this book and ca n't wait to start the second installment ..... although its fiction it 's interesting to read and imagine what life would 've been like then
5 #### I 've been a fan of the movie ever since I saw it on TV back in the eighties ( I guess I must have been nine or so ) . It 's one of my favorite WWII movies and I always have a blast watching it . I 've re - watched the movie a couple of times ever since . I guess it was a big inspiration for the Wolfenstein games . So , I recently decided to read the book as well since I was in the mood for some good old fun and uncomplicated adventure novel . It 's a page turner and definitely still delivers . The writing is obviously a bit dated but still fun to read . Compared to the movie the big difference is that the main characters go out of the way to not kill anyone in the book whereas in the movie you have Clint Eastwood casually flinging sticks of dynamite all over the place while firing bursts of machine gun fire at anything that moves . Other than that , the movie follows the book quite faithfully .
4 #### I do n't know that i 'm capable of writing a really unbiased review of many of MacLean 's books : I first got hooked on him in about 6th grade and have been periodically rereading his books for the last 4 + decades . I think part of my chronic comma - itis is due to so much early exposure to his writing . But I 've always liked " Bear Island , " and rank it with " HMS Ulysses , " " Ice Station Zebra , " the Navarones , & " When Eight Bells Toll " among my favorites , though it 's probably near the bottom of that group . I rather like the isolated feel of the settings , first on the ' Morning Rose ' and then the island ; as other reviewers mention , there is a bit of the " And then there were none " type of mystery feel about it , though the climate is considerably more savage than most drawing room mysteries . I never thought anything about the amount of alcohol consumed in the book until I got onto Amazon & looked at some of the reviews . Despite the fact that my parents were basically teetotalers , from what I saw of my friends ' parents , even at age 12 the amount of drinking that happens in this book did n't seem unusual . And heaven knows I 've known enough people in my adult life that drink as much as the bunch at Olympus Productions .
4 #### I 've read this book 3 or 4 times now . Great for relaxed , quick , uncomplicated read . The movie was good as well . I liked it when movies followed the books more closely . Anyway , this is vintage MacLean with action , a few twists , tension and humor . Not much character developement but that 's to be expected with a fairly short work .
5 #### This book was fantastic . Suspense ful and thrilling . I did n't want to put it down . Great job and ca n't wait to read another .
4 #### Typical Alistair MacLean read , very easy to read . He has a very descriptive way of writing that gives a clear picture of the people and events that takes place during his story telling . If your are expecting the story line in the book vs the movie , lets just say that the screen writers took a lot of liberties with the story line . If your a fan of A.M. , you will enjoy it .
5 #### It was so fun to read a good book . This book drew me in with all it 's charm and drama .
2 #### The book is almost always better than the movie -- but this is an exception . The BBC miniseries was wonderful and better than reading the original . Unlike Jane Austen , Gaskell tells you instead of showing you the personality of the characters . I found the writing not compelling .
3 #### Good book , but a little out there as far as reality . Also a little unclear a few times .
5 #### Great war time fiction from a master . I have always l poo bed his stories from the first time I saw a movie adaptation and the books have never disappointed .
5 #### Fast paced , compelling , complex , somewhat believable . In other words , typical MacLean novel . I like the way he turns apparent nonsensical plots into plots that do make sense in the end .
5 #### An enjoyable read , regardless of whether you have seen the movie .
4 #### one of MacLean 's more suspenseful books , spins a good yarn
5 #### Another book that my mom wanted so I ordered it for her and had it shipped to her directly . She was pleased so that makes me very happy ! Good price , and good condition !
5 #### I have read this book twice and enjoy it more each time . I like the portrayal of the period and historical facts , along with the most interesting and believable characters of the North and South . The descriptions depict in realistic terms the landscape , picturesque ladies or the era , devastation and cruelty that took place . Yes , everyone , read it several times and also the sequels that are available also .
5 #### I watched the BBC version first , and I am so happy to understand Margaret and Mr. Thorton more . I would recommend this to others like me .
4 #### gift for my mom who is vision impaired she listens to books on her kindle she said she enjoyed the book
5 #### This book is surprisingly relevant to the political and economic problems of today and yet it is a pleasant story with a predictable ending .
5 #### This has all the elements of romantic literature but is so much more . The love story is beautiful , the personality of the characters is endearing and complex , and the reflexion about the historical moment , the economy and the situation of the working classes is amazing .
5 #### If you have n't seen the movie , it may be a tough read . However , since I am a huge fan of the movie , it fleshed out some plot areas that did n't add up in the movie .
5 #### The book surpassed my expectations after seeing the movie first . Awesome read .
3 #### I probably will not read any more of this authors books !
4 #### The author made his living and reputation writing thrillers . This book , although it has plenty of suspense and violence , is more of a classic mystery than thriller . An ancient trawler converted to passenger ship is ferrying a film crew through heavy seas to the desolate Norwegian possession , Bear Island . Then the poisonings start . The situation can only get worse on the island . The tale is told through the eyes of the film crew 's doctor whose dry wit and love of misdirection add to the the entertainment . On the negative side , the book gets off to a slow start and there is too much turgid dialogue .
4 #### not done with the book yet but so far I really like it ' I am going to get a copy for my son , he will love it .
5 #### Alistair MacLean was one of the best storytellers ever . All his books are fast paced , easy to read , very suspenseful and they leave you with a strong desire to read more of his books and adventures . He n makes you feel part of his stories . I have reread all his books many times and they never fail to thrill me and make me want to read them yet again .
4 #### With a few minor transcription problems ; this was as beautiful a story as I remembered . If you love Jane Austen , you owe it to yourself to read Gaskell .
4 #### I admit that I surprisingly enjoyed the 4 episode BBC production of this book more than the book . However it was still quite an enjoyable , romantic read .
5 #### My husband was a Civil War buff so the whole family got involved . We have the movie on DVD but I had never read the book . Enjoyed it .
3 #### It is not an easy format but I love the book and at least I have it in my computer .
5 #### Have not had time to start this series on my Kindle but know I will enoy it as much as his Kent Series . Using Amazon to order e - books is very convient . I like the convience .
5 #### A great storyteller . Very fast paced books . I enjoyed them as a kid and loved him as an adult .
5 #### Excellent , first rater story . The plot is complex while at the same time being straightforward . There were new surprises on almost every page . I recommend this book highly as a fun read .
5 #### I first read this book in the early 70 's while stationed overseas . The librarian suggested it and during my time there I ended reading every Alistair Maclean book in the library . A very fast read with a nice twist at the very end .
5 #### This is an older book but Alistair MacLean was an excellent novelist back when . Most of his writings are a little dated by now but oldsters like me can still enjoy them .
4 #### Excellent story line from a master . The ins and outs of this story are spectacular leaving you guessing a lot of the way . Great storytelling .
5 #### I have loved this author since discovering him when I was in high school -- ever so long ago . I have read and reread his works multiple times . He is a spy / suspense genre , but he makes clear why the characters act the way they do . Some might find his writings dated ( He writes about WW2/ cold war period in his earlier works ) However , unlike some novels of this genre , the motivations of the characters are more clearly stated , rather than inferred . In other words , I can understand them . This book is fast - paced and keeps you guessing along with the main protagonist to the end . If you want sex , you wo n't get it here . There is a bit of romance integral to the plot , but this is not a Romance . This protagonist , like all this author 's heroes , fails but keeps on and ultimately accomplishes his goals .
5 #### It 's Alistair MacLean , Need I say more ? Another fast paced , excellent read by the master of the genre .
4 #### Very good story and made into a good movie . I read this because I saw the movie and it is one of my favorites because of Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood . So I bought this kindle version of the book just to read and compare to the flick . It is a good story and I can see how it was made into a movie . Maclean is a great story teller but falls short in some of the dialogue between the two main characters . It sounds like high school gibberish between them at times and takes away from the story . Character development is short and probably why it was bought by the movie people . The idea of the story is great and worth the read when you get past the short comings of the character development and conversation dribble .
4 #### " Broadsword calling Danny Boy . Broadsword calling Danny Boy ! " When I read these words I could n't help but hear them in Sir Richard Burton 's voice . A great story , just as good as the film I remember from childhood .
5 #### I know this is a old book but I am finding a lot of enjoyment in revisiting it . It is very well written and brings out more of the details then the movie series .
2 #### The font and spacing are strange / hard to read and there 's typos littered everywhere , literally every other page . It drives me nuts . Just pay a few bucks extra and get one of the dozen other paperback versions available on Amazon .
5 #### If you 're a Jane Austen fan , then you 'll love this book ! I admit to watching the TV series first , but I really liked the book 's version .
5 #### Even better than the movie -- which I LOVE ! There were a few lulls , but it 's worth every one of them :)
3 #### I watched the movie first , I love the movie ! After reading the book I can see why they changed a lot . It gets a little dry and boring at times . If I had not watched the movie first I never would have picked up this book and I certainly never would have finished it . The movie ending is soooooo much better !
5 #### Great comparison of the rural south of England and the industrial north just as the industrial revolutions was getting underway . I found it captivating . Human nature remains the same .
5 #### This story takes place during the WWII era . It 's espionage , double agents and human interaction to its fullest . Initially six men set out on a rescue mission under orders from Vice Admiral Rolland of the Britain Naval Operations and M16 . The story unfolds on the way to and in Schloss Adler Castle high on the mountains north of Austria , headquarters of the German Secret Service . MacLean is an excellent story teller with convincing dialogue , little obscenity and lots of energy and mystery . Readers who are interested in suspense and mystery may enjoy this book . Not recommended for younger children . .
4 #### The story was everything that I expected it to be . I always love reading these type of books , I recommend this to anybody who likes to read World War II books .
4 #### Great pulp fiction . MacLean was a master . My only complaint is that the publisher was not careful with the formatting - quite a few small errors .
3 #### The film is better , i 'm afraid to say and that does n't happen very often
5 #### Having seen the movie ( which is great ) several times , I was excited to find a Kindle version of the book was now available . I thoroughly enjoyed the book , and honestly had trouble putting it down as I read through it in just a few days .
5 #### This book was fantastic . It is also my favorite war movie . The book was somewhat different but pretty spot on to the movie .
4 #### I like this book ... I liked it when I read it umpteen years ago and I liked it when I reread it today . As usual with MacLean , the " hero " is not all that he appears to be , and most of the other characters have secrets of their own . I love the way MacLean writes ... I chuckled several times over the drollness of the hero 's thinking and ' side ' remarks . Is this the best book MacLean ever wrote ? No . It 's not . Did I figure out the villain before the hero ? Yes . I did . But it was a very enjoyable read .
5 #### ANYTHING by Alistair MacLean is worth the time and money involved for you to get it . It 's when movie producers buy the rights to it that problems start . regards - the Satan Bug , good book , rotten movie . I have to admit that Where Eagles Dare and Ice Station Zebra run neck and neck as to my absolute favorite books by MacLean . I 'm hoping that somebody will eventually do an UNABRIDGED audio book of them . Zebra , what can I say ? , submarine , under the polar ice cap with a fire on board and a spy / saboteur running around the place . Eagles , Richard Burton & Clint Eastwood - those three things together made a great movie and an even better book . Just be warned that you 're never exactly sure of what 's what until you get to the end . enjoy MacLean does not write ZIP - BAM - POW type of book but an intriguing pot boiler
4 #### Mate , it is just a bloody good yarn , What else can I say . I always thought MacLean was a good spinner of yarns .
3 #### A mission for a team of Allied spies marred by mutual mistrust and back stabbing . There is drama and suspense as sparks fly between spies , double spies and treble spies which is interesting . A bit tiring in between though .
5 #### What a great read ! I was surprised at how closely this classic resembles Jane Austen 's Pride and Prejudice . Am I the only one who has thought this ? =] In my opinion , Mr. Thornton 's character reminds me of Mr. Darcy and Margaret reminds me of Elizabeth Bennett , though there is a definite distinction between each individual . And though I do get rather annoyed when the characters misunderstand one another ( almost throughout the entire book ! ) , I greatly enjoyed reading this classic . And will definitely re - read it in the near future !
4 #### I recently saw the BBC miniseries North and South and fell in love . So I had to read the book . Unfortunately the book takes a long time to really dive into the story , but I still enjoyed it . Gaskell is a nice addition to my Austen / Bronte collection .
4 #### Great story ! I love the clash of the classes and finding love where you never thought possible . If you liked Jane Eyre you will like this one !
4 #### Elizabeth Gaskell 's " North and South " provides readers with an interesting combination of history and romance . Originally serialized in Charles Dickens ' " Household Words , " " North and South " was published as a novel in 1855 and serves as a groundbreaking and informative work of fiction with relevance to modern readers and society . In many ways a story of contrasts , " North and South " is a social novel , a romance , and overall a bildungsroman . It chronicles the coming - of - age of Margaret Hale , a young woman who moves with her family from Helstone in the south of England to Milton in the north . This transition from an agricultural economy to an industrial one forms the backbone of the novel and emphasizes contemporary class distinctions . Margaret becomes one of classic literature 's most notable and independent heroines as she approaches the conflict between masters and workers in the mills , and the tension between unions and manufacturers continues to be a germane social issue . Set against this industrial backdrop , which is comparable to Dickens ' " Hard Times , " Margaret experiences situations of love and loss which still resonate with readers . Despite a rather abrupt end , " North and South " is a noteworthy nineteenth - century work which deserves study and enjoyment , particularly for readers who take pleasure in more serious novels .
4 #### Every time I start a MacLean I wonder why . It 's so much hard work . His sentences are so long and complicated and his chapters and some paragraphs go on forever . But once I get into it I find it worth the required concentration . He has a knack of bringing his characters to life so you feel you know them , and his plots always have a good twist or two . Bear Island is no exception .
5 #### C.S. Forester has always been one of my favorite authors . This book was ordered 23 August and delivered within 5 days . It is like new . Due to the decline of libraries it is harder to find older books to read .
4 #### Alistair Maclean does a very good job with this book and would recommend it to anyone who would like to purchase it .
5 #### This is such a good book . It 's exciting and funny in places . The fight atop the cable car and the car chase with a bus through the mountains can be read over and over again without ever getting old .
1 #### I 'm not prone to hyperbole , and I remember only one thing about this book : At the time I read it , I thought that it was the worst book I have ever read . The story was poor , but the writing was abysmal .
5 #### ... and I have not been disappointed since . I am so happy I was introduced to John Jakes by the TV shows that were made from this series . John Jakes has a fan for life . The books are SO much better than the TV series and so well- researched . He really knows his craft .
5 #### I could scarcely put this book down ! I saw the movie but the book gave more insight . Loved it ! Elizabeth Gaskell is one of my favorite authors . I have read Cranford and Wives and Daughters , but North and South has become a favorite . I am new to reading with a Kindle device , having just received it , and this book was my first book to read using the Kindle . I thought it might be awkward but it was n't , it was so easy and comfortable . I love my new Kindle !
5 #### This is one long book but it 's definitely worth it ! It starts years before the civil and ends at the start of it . It follows the Hazard 's and the Mains . I like the touch the author did of showing us the ancestry of both families in the prelude . It may be a long book but it is very good . We get historyand entertainment . Good and bad sides to both sides . Soon I will be jumping in to the sequel .
3 #### Classic book , interesting to read the differences between the book and film . Great story , characters and just plain entertaining . But could not get the music score out of my head .
5 #### this is one of the best thrillers i have ever read . i started it after dinner and did n't stop til i finished it at 5 AM . my brother did the same thing . as good as the best of the ludlums ( The bourne identity , the gemini contenders ) . the movie was very well done too with richard burton and clint eastwood .
5 #### Bear Island is an entertaining mystery / adventure . Right from the start , the suspense bubbles beneath the action . Characters great . Setting vivid . Island remote . The pace a is bit slow at times , but the mystery kept me reading and guessing . Roger Weston , author of&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Golden - Catch / dp / B004YTI1UY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Golden Catch</a >
5 #### Another excellent thriller written by Alistair MacLean in his prime . The film with Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood closely follows the novel . MacLean 's tale of Allied commandos breaking into a heavily guarded German fortress is often dazzling and always suspensful . It 's only after the reader has finished the last page and closed the novel that he may wonder about the plot . There are , to be diplomatic , a few holes in it . Not as awful as the plot in The Dirty Dozen but ... It 's doubtful this operation would have ever been approved by the Allied high command . But the author makes you believe in it while turning the pages . The writing is superb . While a little suspension of belief is needed , " Eagles " is an excellent World War II tale .
4 #### Alistair MacLean has written an entertaining , behind - the - lines World War II adventure . Like&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Casablanca / dp / B002VWNIAY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Casablanca</a > , it only works with some willing suspension of disbelief by the reader . It 's a small effort with the large return of an enjoyable read . Lieutenant Schaffer is the only American assigned to a British commando team led by suspiciously - named Major Smith . The eight - man team parachutes into the Bavarian Alps to rescue a captured American general . The general apparently knows far too much about the plans for D - Day and they have to get to him before the Gestapo can begin interrogation . It soon becomes clear that somebody on the team is a German agent . The story is enjoyable , with a number of plot twists and surprises . Of course , real German soldiers were n't as blankly unimaginative as many of the ones in the book . Some of the helpful coincidences are a little hard to swallow , too . But the holes are n't so big we ca n't drive around them . The story works well enough . The&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/movie / dp / B003AWRMCO / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">movie</a>&nbsp;made from it is pretty good , too .
5 #### I first struggled over the BBC - Series , than longed to read the book and it did n't disappoint my expectations . The scenery and the caracters are discribed to get them know , love and understand . I marked my favourite parts to read them again and again and again ....
5 #### What a way to fall in love ! Yes , I too , read this book after watching the BBC movie adaptation , and I was like OMG . This book is as great or even better than the movie . Oh yes ! ( But , I still love and recommend the movie ) . Mrs. Gaskell did a wonderful job with the writing . The drama , the romance , the wonderful and funny moment at the end of the book , and especially the characters were perfect ! After , Pride and Prejudice and Persuasion , this is my favorite classic romance book ever ! :)
4 #### The loss of all things dear leads to finding the dearest of them all ! Margaret Hale carries the burdens of a young woman whose paths are chosen for her . First determined by family , then fate , her way leads through sorrow and loss to its destination in the arms of love .
4 #### Very enjoyable and worth the effort to read . I say effort because much of the book includes a different type of English language spoken by the Darkshire people . Otherwise really great characters and a lovely story .
5 #### I enjoyed this book very much . Having already seen the film made it even better . Highly recommend this book .
4 #### " Bear Island " is a mystery novel set on a boat heding for the remote Bear Island ( Bjrnya ) in the Barents Sea . The ship is carrying a film crew and actors who plan to make a movie on the island . The novel is narrated in first person by the ship 's doctor . A number of people die from apparent food poisoning , but Dr. Marlow suspects murder . The story tends to drag a bit before they get to the island , but not too much . Once they get to the island , MacLean throws in a nice plot twist and the pace picks up . This , and the humorous narrative helps it earn 4 stars . I also like MacLean 's description of Bear Island . Even though I hate when it 's cold , it almost made me want to go there .
2 #### It 's inexcusable for this book to be as bad as it is , when the author is clearly a very able writer , and capable of coming up with some lovely twists . It showed promise ; but some of the things MacLean asks the reader to accept just stretch credulity too far . The plot has holes , the good guys are crammed full of contrived and tedious bravado , and , most infuriating of all to me , the hero continually endangers his soldiers and his mission through an utterly inexplicable refusal to kill nazis . I really hope the movie is better ( I 've yet to see it ) . It 's not without its charms . You may be able to enjoy the way the hero cleverly improvises his way out of one predicament after another , if you can make yourself forget that many of the predicaments are directly caused by his own astonishingly stupid decisions . You may find it possible to get your money 's worth out of this book by just numbing yourself to the silliness , picturing Clint Eastwood , and accepting it as a quick - read thriller that will make - I promise - absolutely no demands on your intelligence . But I could n't do it . Not recommended .
4 #### This is a classic MacLean novel . Lots of action , lots of plot twists , set in WW2 , with a girl named Mary . If you have seen the Clint Eastwood movie , prepare to be surprised . The movie was a terrible translation of the book , even though MacLean was the scriptwriter . ( Or maybe the book was an improved version of the movie -- I 'm not sure which was written first . ) In particular , the Eastwood character is a cold - blooded killer , while in the book he 's a happy - go - lucky guy with a big heart and a crush on a helpful barmaid . As with all MacLean books , the point of view character lies to the reader about his real motivation and hides crucial information until the very end of the novel . This makes the novel something like a cross between an action book and a mystery . The classic image from the novel is the fight that takes place on the top of a cable car in the icy Alpine winter . But the big surprise is that , by the end , this British commando team has been inserted deep into Germany and yet they do n't kill a single German soldier in the entire book . Very different than some other action novels ( including some by MacLean ) where the body count piles up quickly and the protagonist has a very itchy trigger finger .
4 #### An important Allied general with knowledge of upcoming large - scale war theatre plans is captured . A seat of the pants mission is put together to try and get him back . Failing that , to kill him . This is a joint American - British spook operation , so those doing the dirty work find out that all is not as it seems .
5 #### I am a fan of reading about the civil war ; before , during and after that devastating event . I 'm also fascinated with that " peculiar institution " as slavery was sometimes called . Try as I might , I have a hard time understanding how one human being can own and enslave another human being , then try to justify it . At any rate , the first book of this triology , while fiction , was essentially accurate historically and it fulfilled on all accounts . I believe the author captured a good sense of what life was like , both in the south and in the north , preceding the civil war . I was satisfied enough to order the next 2 books in the series and I 've gained an interest in this author , who I was not previously familiar with . He does a good job on all fronts .
5 #### Elizabeth Gaskell - genius ! I loved this book . It took me a while to get through it . It is pretty intense at times . Definitely worth reading it if you 're a fan of the BBC series , or Austen or the Brontes .
5 #### I will not summarize the plot as it is done so well by the other reviewers . Suffice it to say I will be purchasing Love and War - also a good book by Jakes is Homeland . No matter your taste , you will enjoy this .
5 #### I had seen the mini series before I read the book , I love the book as much as the series ! I will read this again !
4 #### Ms Gaskell is a contemporary of Charles Dickens and like Dickens is concerned with the social issues of that period . In this case , the working conditions of the cotton mill workers of Manchester of northern England . She reveals these conditions through the vehicle of story and the various characters . These characters are endearing and very real . They capture our interest and concern but also our admiration . Ms Gaskell presents a balanced approach to the wage issue through the main romantic character , Mr Thornton a mill owner and the Higgins family , mill workers . Mr Higgens is also the leader of the labor movement and strike that occurs . In addition to these social issues , she also examines moral issues of the church and a crisis of her own conscience . This is one of the reasons I love literature of this era . Authors closely examine personal moral and psychological struggles of the characters with care and intimacy not just as a theoretical conjecture . And of course there 's romance . These were exciting times in the history of the world , with huge strides in technology and science which are also revealed .
5 #### Amazing book and so much going on that you hang on the edge of your seat . The ending shocked me
5 #### I love the style of writing and the inclusion of some of the cultural problems of Elizabeth Gaskell 's era . This one emphasizes the battle between the classes and unions vs. shop owners . Fantastic story .
5 #### Alistair MacLean is one of my favorite novelists , and this is my favorite novel by him . The setting is World War II , and a team of seven ( or is it eight ) double - agents are sent to rescue a kidnapped actor ( who is assumed to know something ) from a castle in a mountain , accessible by cable cars . This novel keeps you guessing , at the edge of your seats . The ending is the best one I 've read by MacLean ( I find his endings to be a weakness as a whole ) .
3 #### " Bear Island " is a solid thriller by master story - teller Alistair Maclean . A converted fishing trawler carries a movie - making crew across the Barents Sea to isolated Bear Island , well above the Arctic Circle , for some on - location filming . En route , members of the movie crew and ship 's company begin to die under mysterious circumstances . The ship 's medical officer , one Doctor Marlowe , finds himself enmeshed in a violent , multi - layered plot in which very few of the persons aboard are precisely whom they claim to be . Dr. Marlowe 's efforts to unravel the plot become even more complicated once the movie crew is deposited ashore on Bear Island , seemingly beyond the reach of the law or any other help . This novel is a closed house murder mystery with the added twist that the scene of the crimes is the high Arctic . The murders continue ashore , and Dr. Marlowe discovers they may be related to blackmail and to some forgotten events of the Second World War . " Bear Island " was not Maclean 's best effort ; the plot seems overly contrived and many of the characters are no more developed than cardboard cutouts . Nevertheless , Maclean was a polished writer and a past master of the twisting storyline ; even his lesser efforts are fascinating reading . Readers will be kept guessing as Maclean slowly unspools the clues and frames the story for an exciting ending . This book is highly recommended to fans of Alistair Maclean and to readers looking for an entertaining story .
2 #### I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it . A re - read twenty years later gave me a different perspective . MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best . There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on , two of note : Shaffer ( supposedly from Montana ) is credited with a Mid - West accent ? ? Montana is far west not ' mid ' west . Secondly , Nazi helicopters ? This is just plain sloppy . MacLean should have known much better . This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy . For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend ; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island . The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far . A poor effort by Mr MacLean .

5 #### Unlike the vast majority of " war " and " thrilller " writers , MacLean presents the " villains " as smart people who think ahead . Unlike the vast majority again ( see modern American " thrillers " as nauseatingly predictable examples ) the " hero " wins , generally pyrrhic victories , by being one step smarter , not through blind luck . And his writing is terrific - it was a disappointment when I discovered that he was an English teacher and hence had an unfair advantage there . The other thing is that MacLean 's heroes think with their brains , not with the anatomical parts that most American " heroes " ( and James Bond to some extent ) use . The suspense and thrills are created through clean , carefully crafted buildups , not through gory horror images . But if you thought all " thrilllers " were alike , you 've clearly missed reading MacLean . I wish he had written a hundred more - but I do n't see how anyone could have thought up so many of such quality . The movies based on his books do little justice to the quality of the books , but Where Eagles Dare is one of the more faithful attempts to do so .
4 #### This is of course a classic . There is however a problem with the Kindle - version I bought . The chapters are not in order !
4 #### I was given the DVD Collection as a gift and wanted to see how far off the story went . I was amazed at how much was different . Love the book --- the DVD is lacking .
3 #### This book over all was very long . But it provides insight into many things . I saw the four part series on BBC and loved it watch it first ! ! ! ! !
4 #### Feels like Pride & Prejudice from the Industrial era . The only bad thing is that my kindle version has a lot of errors : dots and commas missing , along with others .
5 #### What I enjoyed most was the book gave me a perspective of the civil war from the common man 's point of view . Most of the civil war books I have read talk about the glorious battles and what the generals did to succeed . The trilogy brought what lead up the war , during the war , and what happened after the war to life from what the common folks experienced . What 's really sad is the parallels that can be drawn between what was going on in Washington D.C. during the war and what exists in Washington today . Not much has changed .
5 #### I only read this book because I saw the BBC mini series on it and I really liked it . The book is amazing , some parts were slow going but most older books make me feel that way . Well worth the read , one of my new favorite classics .
1 #### If you 've read one Maclean book , you 've read them all ( outside of the very earliest ) . Same plot used over and over , no suspense , carboard characterizations -- and way , way , way overwritten ( the books are padded beyond belief -- if he wrote cleanly they would be reduced by two - thirds ) . Maclean himself said that he hated writing , churned out a book in about a month with one draft , and it shows . The later you read in his bibliography , the worse the books get . Do n't bother .
4 #### Hm , I 'm a little disappointed in the reviews , here . I suppose everyone expects a classic thriller par MacLean . Bear Island is less a thriller than it is a mystery , which explains the somewhat slower - than - usual pacing . MacLean brings back Captain Imrie ( from When Eight Bells Toll ) who is a good guy this time . Rather , he 's a sub - character , piloting the Morning Rose to Bear Island . Aboard is a film crew and the producers / directors of the most anticipated film of the year . And then people start dropping like flies . I love it ! It 's very reminiscent of Agatha Christie 's And Then There Were None or William Dietrich 's more recent Dark Winter . The classic premise : a bunch of people somehow completely isolated , and it 's just not the best week for any of them . Bear Island is written in first - person ( an immediate MacLean favorite ) , written with that ubiquitous dry wit found in his other novels . Despite the obvious -- more whiskey and scotch downed than there is water in the ocean , and that Bear Island only appears halfway into the book -- I found myself enjoying every page . And it turns out Bear Island is actually a very beautiful island . I recommend Googling for images ( see " customer images " for book cover ) . Do n't expect MacLean to describe it too well , since it 's dark , cloudy , windy and rainy during the tale .
4 #### I read all of MacLean 's books when I was a kid , and although Where Eagles Dare is not his best , it is easily his most exciting . I remember being up at 4 a.m. , unable to stop reading . Unusually , this is MacLean 's only book in which he wrote a screenplay first , then based the novel on his script ( that 's why the film seems such a faithful adaptation ) . As a result , the book is shorter and leaner then many of his novels , and it definitely works for the story . The suspense never stops building , the action sequences - especially atop the cable car - are some of the best he 's ever written , and the characters have a very entertaining repartee between them , particularly Smith and Shaffer . Where Eagles Dare also features some of MacLean 's sexiest female heroes , not always present in his books . The Guns of Navarone had a greater scope and deeper character development , H.M.S. Ulysses was harrowing , gritty and deeply humanistic , Ice Station Zebra had a plot with more twists and double - crosses , but Where Eagles Dare was MacLean 's all - time action / suspense fest .
4 #### This author makes his living on plot twists . Just when you think you have it figured out there is a new course . The story is a good one and very well told . The author has his historical facts correct which is important in this type of book . I would like more to a story , the editors in the 70 's must have been paid per word they cut as it seams most books of that era are a little on the short side . That aside this is a good yarn with a good story .
4 #### This 19th century novel is an engaging and touching romantic tale set in the dreary but enlightening context of intense labor conflicts during the mid-1800 's industrial expansion in England . The author was a contemporary of Dickens and Trollope . She writes clearly and in a way that holds the reader 's interest . If you love Jane Austen , you 'll enjoy this book . Highly recommended .
5 #### I so enjoyed reading this book and renewing my experience with the Hazards and the Mains . I have seen the Mini series a couple of times . GREAT READING .
5 #### I remembered reading this before , and was pleased to find it for my kindle . It is still great reading and woth the time to read .
5 #### Gaskell does it again ( as she did in Cranford and Wives and Daughters ) ! She draws you in by developing rich , real characters and making you fall in love with those who are most important . Take some time to read this classic . Choose it over a simple novel any day !
5 #### One of my favorites . I 've read several times I 'm reading it now on my paperwhite . It 's a great new classic for any library
5 #### saw the movie and it was great and then read the book which was great too . wish she wrote a sequel .
5 #### A friendship is bonded of George Hazzard and Orry Main , one that even time and trials , can not break . If you love history of the Civil war era and would love to have true characters that you can see in your mind this is a MUST read . I loved the mini series on TV and I love this book series , in time I will re read it ..
4 #### Surprisingly hard to come by nowadays , this novel was written in parallel with the fantastic film ( in a similar way to ' 2001 : A Space Odyssey ' , but with much more action ) . It makes an interesting companion - piece - there are some subtle differences in detail and tone , and whilst the book has plenty of action the destruction is n't quite so over - the - top . Best of all , you can pour over the famously - tortuous plot at your leisure , without having to pause and write down a little flowchart showing who is pretending to be who . On the downside , you do n't get the fantastic soundtrack , or Clint Eastwood 's mildly - peeved grimaces as bullets zing around his head . Although he will forever be associated with ' Eagles ' , MacLean was more of a cold war thriller writer than a war - thriller writer , and the book is an odd cross between straightforward WW2 action and a John Le Carre - esque spy thriller , meaning that the book is doubly dated , but still great fun .
5 #### Alistair Maclean 's novel , ' Where Eagles Dare , ' is a great adventure story that takes the reader back to the desperate days of World War Two . The story centers around a crack British commando team infiltrating a Bavarian stronghold to rescue a high - ranking American officer . From start to finish this is riviting fiction . Maclean 's protagonists are the kind of characters that make you want to cheer and the plot contains enough twists to keep you guessing right up to the end . The movie version of this novel , which stars Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood , is one of the the most faithful film interpretations of a book ever made . Read the book and then see the film !
4 #### This is simply one of those ca n't put down , thrill - a - minute , will he wo n't he ? classic books that have us reliving WWII . Bullets wizz , double agents crawl out of every hole and you are never quite sure of the outcome . Brilliant , I am so glad Maclean wrote thirty odd thrillers , I wo n't be running out for a while !
5 #### One of Maclean 's finest novels . Full action , thrills and wry humour .
5 #### I love , love , LOVE Elisabeth Gaskell . I love her even more than Jane Austen . This is one of my favorite classical romances . Ever . It is a romance novel that deals with political , religious , and feminist issues of the mid 19th century . Margret Hale is a moral character dealing with worldly issues , one of the aspects of Gaskell 's novels that I relate with the most . After reading the book , please watch the BBC film !
4 #### Great book , would have liked a better ending chapter it seemed to go by to quickly . Margaret is a very strong woman .
5 #### This was the second elizabeth gaskell book I read . She has easily become one of my favorite authors . She is n't afraid to be honest about how harsh life was for middle class people . She tells the truth a lot like Charles Dickens , proving that women can relate . The characters are great and I also recommend seeing the BBC version with Richard Armitage . He is amazing as Mr. Thorton .
4 #### If you have ever seen an old classic movie titled HOW THE WEST WAS WON < this trilogy entertains whilst educating you as to how the USA was really won and became one ... pun intended .
4 #### The book gives some kind of a genuine feeling about the time and characters . Romantic story and Happy end are in order ....
5 #### Very enjoyable reading . This novel follows a family who moves from rural Southern England to an industrial center in the north . There they meet with differences in social customs as well as economic philosophies . The author does an excellent job of pointing out the misunderstandings and conflicts that arise from this situation , without making either side out to be the " bad guys . " I 'm still reading this one and am enjoying it as much as " The Scarlet Pimpernel " and the Jane Austin novels .
5 #### OK so it 's not the War Between the States . But even in a small industrial English city there is a clash of cultures that is nearly insurmountable . Lots of info . about some of the values that Americans share with the British and some that we do n't .
4 #### I really enjoyed this book . The author has a similar style to Charles Dickens . I would never put it on a must read list , but definitely worth the time , and the language is beautiful .
5 #### This series had me rivited ! I love this series ! If you love books about the civil war era , this series will keep you awake all night wanting to read more ! I HIGHLY suggest it !
5 #### I loved this series years ago . I know I 'll love it again when I re read it this spring . I love John Jakes , the detail he puts into his writing .
5 #### Margaret Hale and her parents move from the idyllic south of England to Milton , a northern mill town , when her father gives up his position as a pastor after losing his faith . In Milton they become entangled in the lives of the two clashing populations ; the mill workers and the mill owners . Margaret especially buts heads with her father 's pupil , mill owner John Thornton . This is Pride and Prejudice with feminism and social justice issues . It is about being true to your self and true to your heart , and damn what anyone else might think . It is about listening to other people , and finding ways to come together for mutual support and survival . It is a great read . I also HIGHLY recommend the BBC mini - series .
3 #### Saw the movie first and then read the book . The book explained a lot of scenes from the movie . In the book were lots of great exchanges between Bessy and Margaret and Higgins involving faith which the movie was void of . The Hale 's religion / God was completely scrubbed from the movie as compared to the book . So , for this reason I enjoyed the book . The movie , I loved but they could 've put more of Margaret 's Christian remarks in- especially and at least with scenes involving Bessie . The ending pretty much stinks . The last chapter felt like an add - on from a completely different author . No dialogue between M and Mr T as per him having found out about the reason she lied to the inspector in order to protect her brother . Just felt like Margaret and Mr T went from hate to love at warp speed with no lead in .
5 #### Great book ! Better than the movie and the movie was wonderful .
5 #### If you love Jane Austen , you will love North and South . Gaskell 's novel offers more than just a between - classes love story . It also produces misunderstandings , complex family relationships , and a hint of mystery .
5 #### I loved this novel . I found Gaskell 's depiction of class separation , family , life and death all rolled up in a romance to be a very moving and completely enjoyable and satisfying read . A classic that gives you a peak into what went into the evolution of the Industrial Age . The author uses this social conflict as a backdrop to a romance between two vibrate characters , Mr. Thornton and Margaret , who are just two of the wonderful characters in a novel I highly recommend to those who have a love for classic reading .
5 #### Love this book . She writes great and the story is so enjoyable . One of my favorites novels . Her narrative is very engaging and her development of carachters is also very well done . I read the book after watching the TV series made by the BBC . Even though the show is awesome ( Richard Armitage is georgeous ) the book once again is much better .
5 #### Having seen the BBC 's 2004 TV mini - series adaptation of this book , which I love , I was keen to finally read the book . Against the backdrop of industrialisation in Northern England , with all of its social problems , is a classic love story where the hero and heroine initially clash but as they gradually get to know each other over time , they eventually fall in love . If you like Pride and Prejudice , you will surely enjoy this story . There are a number of Kindle versions . I found this one to be quite good with very few editing errors .
5 #### I had never heard of this story until my sister wanted me to watch the movie on netflix with her . After seeing it I was hooked , but did n't realize there was a book too . I really like this story . How Mr. Thornton and Margaret still esteem each other to other people even though he is disappointed and she is her stubborn self is really refreshing . There 's a maturity written in book like this that today just is n't written anymore . Now it seems in books that as soon as a guy is rejected he becomes not only bitter , but down right mean . Mr. Thornton is a true gentleman ( sigh ) . There is a lot of background story going on that could almost be ignored ( I admit some of the more lengthy descriptions , explanations I skipped over some ) . I felt heart broken for Margaret during a lot of the book ( even knowing from the movie what was going to happen ) Great characters , great emotion , great book .
5 #### I downloaded North and South onto my Kindle after watching it as a televised series on DVD . I was captivated by the story , the contrasts depicted between the Northern industrial regions and the bucolic Southern ( New Forest ) region . Throughout there was a romantic interest which I also liked . I enjoyed reading North and South and could n't put it down even though I already knew the storyline .
5 #### HALF WAY THROUGH THE BOOK . GREAT STORY , GREAT AUTHOR . ANXIOUS TO FINSH THE BOOK . READ ALL THE KENT CRONICALS AND ENJOYED ALL OF THEM .
5 #### Love this book so much :) it 's just as good as Jane Austen . North and South is a love story that takes you back to industrial England in the north and beautiful country living in the south , and two people with very different world views !
1 #### Seller claimed this was in very good condition with minimal writing / highlighting and this is n't true . The book is literally crumbling apart . There are tears in the cover , the pages are coming loose from the binding , and EVERY page is heavily written on to such extent that it is unreadable . I do n't know why the seller would claim this is anything but poor condition-- I am shocked they would claim this is very good condition . I can not believe this is the book I ordered . The packaging it came in is in perfect condition , so this could not be due to shipping . Now I have to pay to return this and will end up spending more than a new edition would cost .
5 #### A beautiful love story that took place in the background of the class conflicts of North and South and the industrialization of the North . Margaret Hale and John Thornton were wonderful characters and both of them had strong family values . Margaret was a strong and courageous woman who was able to stand up to the trials and tribulations thrown her way . John was absolutely swoon - worthy and his unyielding love for Margaret made your heart swell .
5 #### Love , love , love this novel . Ms. Gaskell 's work here is not to be outdone . The story of Margaret hale and John Thornton will live on within you after you read this . Of course it deals with the industrial revolution , class distinctions , faith , etc . it 's multifaceted . You 'll love it . Sometimes it takes a bit of brain power to read the lines with northern accents but it makes you think ....
5 #### As a fan of " the classics , " I especially love Dickens and Austen and the Bronte sisters . I do n't know how I never heard of this author until I downloaded this free book for my Kindle ! What a find !
5 #### This book really takes one back in time to a more difficult era in England that in some ways is very similar to what the US economy is experiencing in this day and age . The author really entices the reader to want to know what happens next and to read the book to completion to find out how it all will end . What makes Gaskell 's work so fascinating is her portatyal of the human spirit under very grievous and strenuous situations of starvation , lack of money , and scarcity of jobs at a life supportive rate of pay for individual and their family members . Although tragic , it conveys the desperation humans go through to make ends meet . The only drawback that I wish I could have known before purchasing the book is the very fine print that my aging eyesight has to strain to be able to read . If the print were larger , it would help immensely . I 'm enjoying the book nevertheless and would highly recommend it to my friends and family members . As usual , the book arrived in excellent condition and is a delight to keep as intact as possible so that I can pass it on when done .
5 #### As a person who loves historical fiction up through the Reconstruction after the Civil War , this story brought back fond memories I spent as a teenager reading this story . Though fictional it is historically accurate about how people were divided on the issue of slavery . The imagery John Jakes creates in all of his stories can almost make a person believe they in were actually participating in the events . A wonderfully enjoyable way to spend a rainy afternoon with nothing else to do but curl up with your Kindle and imerse yourself in an era that is gone but not forgotten .
4 #### Just re - read this one for book club , after we dumped the original Gaskell pick , CRANFORD ( snore ) . NORTH AND SOUTH , not to be confused with the John Jakes , Civil War bodice - ripper , tells the story of Margaret Hale and her parents , after they relocate from pastoral Helstone in Hampshire to the northern , industrial town of Milton . While Margaret initially disdains both the people and her surroundings , she puts down deep roots without even realizing it after she becomes involved in the lives of certain millworkers . If you loved Gaskell 's WIVES AND DAUGHTERS , you 'll love this novel . Same broad social scope , touches of humor and pathos , and a moving love story . My only gripe would be the ending , where too much is implied and unspoken . The BBC agreed with me , and if you check out the television adaptation , you 'll see they quite fixed the problem ! ( I read the free Kindle edition and found it more messy than usual , formatting - wise , but apart from one completely addled paragraph it was n't * too * distracting . )
5 #### He 's one of my favorite authors and the story Picnic had me doubled over with laughter , tears dripping off my cheeks ... a must in anyone 's library ..
5 #### An Indian - born Brit , Durrell ranks right up there with Woodehouse in terms of humor . This book was a wonderful collection of truly hilarious short stories . I thoroughly enjoyed the one where Durrell and his family get on to the streamer with a Greek crew , and was laughing out aloud pretty much with every line . His prose is so lyrical , and his narration so straight - forward that one can not help but wonder at his genius . He has written a handful of books apparently , and I am now adding those to my cart on Amazon !
5 #### This is probably my favorite Gaskell novel . It is sort of a Pride and Prejudice of the Industrial revolution . But the novel encompasses more than the central relationship and eventual romance between John Thornton and Margaret . We get a look at how the industrial revolution changed the world , and peoples lives , for better or for worse . It gives a good glimpse into the conditions of the working class person , overall business ethics , and organized labor . This is one that is worth reading and re - reading . The BBC mini - series version of this is amazing !
5 #### I would have never purchased " North and South " by Ms. Gaskell if I had not first purchased the DVD . I am a reader of non - fiction and fiction has never really appealed to me . After watching the DVD , and watching the Special Section interview with its star , Richard Armitage , where he stated that they always went back to the book for confirmation on certain aspects of the mini - series ' storyline , I knew I had to read her book . The book is much more complicated and is so well written that Elizabeth Gaskell certainly deserves the praise she was given for her writings . It 's a wonderful love story , but also includes so much knowledge about the first union organizing and the life of workers being so dreadful . And her main characters , Margaret and John Thornton , are beautifully written . It 's simply a book that deserves to be read . And then watch the DVD for the icing on the cake !
5 #### A great love story involving poor first impressions and haughty pride ( P&P in a sense but reverse ) between Margaret Hale , a young woman from the country who moves to an industrious mill town , and John Thornton , the local mill owner who started with nothing and pulled himself and his family up by the boot straps . The two have differing viewpoints on the way he should handle his business and Margaret forms friendships with the factory workers . How could these two ever see eye to eye ? Great dark gothic tale with a silver lining ! A must read especially by fans of Austen 's P&P , this book ranks up there in my opinion ( see the Richard Armitage North and South miniseries after you read ! He has Firth on the run ! lol )
5 #### I really enjoyed this novel . It shares many elements with Austen 's " Pride and Prejudice " , but way hotter lol ! The sexual tension between Margaret and Thornton makes that of Elizabeth and Darcy 's look like a cheesy 80s after - school special ! Thornton is a real take - charge kind of man who knows what he wants ! Mrs. Thornton is hilarious ! The body count made me sad though , but that is a part of life . Frederick was an interesting character as well . I highly recommend this novel to literature lovers everywhere !
5 #### From the moment this movie began it had me riveted . The story of the love affair between Margaret Hale and John Thornton is so full of social , economical , emotional and cultural issues that it could be used in a college English lit course . Their initial meeting is anything but precipitous for the love they will eventually share : he beats an employee for smoking in his cotton mill while she looks on with horror . As with any good love story , they have plenty of barriers that prevent them from developing a relationship - his mother does n't like her , thinking Margaret is snooty ; Margaret does not care for John , thinking no one will want to wear the cotton he produces and that Milltown is a dirty town in which to live . But through John 's kindness towards her family , Margaret begins to see him as a kind , generous , and forgiving man who has handled much grief and despair in his own life . The ending is a great one with an unexpected role - reversal . I wo n't give it away as a plot spoiler . I have to admit the last scene at the train station is one of the most romantic scenes I 've ever seen in any movie . Richard Armitage looks fabulous . Every woman , young or old , I 've encouraged to watch this film has loved it . It is worth setting an evening aside for . Enjoy .
4 #### I first watched the BBC mini - series , ' North and South ' , and was hooked , and the book is even better than the mini - series - far more detail , depth of character , and better flow from scene to scene . The book is colorful and skillfully woven . The author takes the reader through a country village , the upper class society of London , and the working classes of an industrial manufacturing city to present issues of class and status , the growing pains of progress , and the character of the men and women within these areas with great depth . While some mid-19th century novels can be overwritten and have superfluous details or characters , ' North and South ' does n't fall into this category . The characters are well placed and necessary , the events are well connected . I found myself greatly attached to the Miss Hale and Mr. Thornton , and hugely satisfied with the ending . This Kindle edition is cleaner than previous editions , and did not have the major mistakes that other reviewers have commented on .
3 #### If you do n't like Jane Austin then you wo n't like this book . The book is a social commentary on the British class system of the 19th century . The characters are well drawn but the book 's outcome is a well drawn conclusion after the first chapter . I like Jane Austin so I liked this book .
5 #### I was looking for a great book to read at my local bookstore and told the staff member I liked Jane Austen , and she asked if I 'd read Elizabeth Gaskell . I was delighted to sample Gaskell 's books and found them well - written with original plots . This book is my favorite as it has depth and includes the social issues of mill workers and their plight in the industrial north of England . There 's a lovely romance plus insight into factory workers and mill owners challenges in the mid-19th century . It has a Dickensian - cast to it , but not all is black and white . You LIKE Thornton , the mill owner . If your book group is looking for authentic fiction written by an author from the same time period , this book is excellent . Our library fiction group read it and everyone enjoyed it . Jane Austen fans , George Eliot fans , and Bronte devotees should enjoy Elizabeth Gaskell . Gaskell was friends with Charlotte Bronte and wrote a biography on her . In one part of the bio by Gaskell Bronte compares herself to Jane Austen in a letter , which was fun to read . I preferred this book to&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Wives - and - Daughters - Oxford - World - s - Classics / dp/0199538263 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Wives and Daughters ( Oxford World 's Classics)</a>&nbsp;which was frothier as it did n't have the depth with the social issues of early industrialization , but it was worth reading as well .
4 #### Generally I am not a fan of victorian novels . However , North and South had much more depth to it . The coming of age of the mechanization of the English fabric industry gave interest and insight in more than the particular characters . This novel showed some of the first unionization of the workers in the mills , showing both sides of the issue through the characters in the novel . I thoroughly enjoyed this book .
3 #### Not my favorite Durrell memoir , but there were still some laugh out loud bits . This is a collection of rather disjointed stories . Definitely more adult in content , although not inappropriate . I was looking for more books like My Family and Other Animaks for my 12 yr old son , but had to keep this one to myself . He would n't have enjoyed it . It ended with a ghost story which was unexpected and strange .
4 #### " Good Durrell but slightly disturbing at times because a person dies from overeating"--says 10 - yr - old
5 #### Gerald Durrell writes comedy like no other . I thoroughly enjoyed all the stories of his family in this book , just like the others . The only odd thing was the macabre story at the end , which was very well written . This is written well after they left the island , so the family is all grown up and living on their own , but some of the stories are about their family and a trip they have taken together . So much comedy in the Greek ship trip alone ! Larry 's humor is usually what has me laughing loudly . Who does n't love his sarcastic wit ? I love reading about his entire family as they are all such different characters , and funny in their own way .
3 #### A good laugh at the end of the day . My Family and Other Animals is still my favorite .
5 #### I ' ve loved the books by Gerald Durrell since I 've read his My Family and Other Animals as a 12 year old . His sense of humor , beauty of his style , and knowledge of animals and people alike make his books ( all of them ) a rare treat of joyful reading .
4 #### Have been a Gerald Durrell fan from a teenager . I am now 68 . I have all his books and they make me laugh .
4 #### Although this series has been available for quite some time , I have finally undertaken the reading of this epic story . When I saw that the first book had 883 pages I almost swooned . So much for a quick read ! thought I. But I chipped away page by page and was soon finished . I must credit John Jakes with creating an historically accurate story so interesting , and characters so complex , that I simply had to keep reading . I was compelled to do so . The Hazards and the Mains have been part of my life since I saw the screen adaptation many years ago . Even reading this first book , I kept hearing Patrick Swayze 's voice as Orry Main . If you love history , have a passing interest in the Civil War or the institution of slavery , this is a must - read ! flag
5 #### Okay , I could n't put this book down . Of course we all love Mr. Darcy and Jane Austen , and I did too until I read North and South . The characters are so much more real as they are of the working middle class . It 's so much more accessible than the landed gentry stories that hardly anyone can relate to . Mr. Thornton is such a fun character that you can actually relate to . Great book .
5 #### I saw the video version of North and South before I read the book . Both were excellent . I was pleased that one of the violent scenes in the video did not occur in the written narrative . However the ending in the video was more to my taste than the original . Either way , book or video , I would recommend both be experienced . You will not regret the time you spend enjoying these treasures .
3 #### I read the series a long long time ago and remembered it as a good read . I decided that I would like to re - read it and ordered the first book planning on ordering the others as I completed them . I started the first and I do not feel that the book 's style holds up very well . I felt the characters and their flaws were over - exagerated and taken to the extremes . I did not connect with any of them and ended up " retiring " the book two - thirds of the way through .
5 #### I love this book . I saw the movie before I even knew the book existed , and when I found out that there was a book , I got very excited . The story is amazing ; I love both the hero and heroine . They make a perfect couple , and it is a cute story of how they make it into one another 's arms . It is because of reading this book , that I wanted to read more by Elizabeth Gaskell , who has become one of my favorite authors .
5 #### I have n't gotten to read it yet , but I 'm sure I will love it . I love this story , and I love Norton Critical editions , so I do n't think I can go wrong . If my opinion changes after having read the story , I will definitely let you know .
5 #### I was a little dubious about reading this trilogy because North & South the miniseries is seen in the Civil War reenacting community as Barbies in hoop skirts . This trilogy could not have blown me away more ! It was far more researched , structured , alive and wonderful than I ever expected . I could n't put it down . Highly recommended !
5 #### BOOK WAS IN GOOD SHAPE , HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING THROUGH IT , SLOW READING TO WORDY . GOT THIS BOOK IN A TIME MANNER .
2 #### I came out of my way to write the very same review that is already here several times . The typos of this book are proof of the shoddy editing - I do n't think anyone even read through it before sending it to print ! Furthermore , paragraphs are n't indented ( which is annoying ) , and the size of the book ( a large square ) makes it difficult to read . Here 's an excerpt so that you can get an idea of the horrible typos : " Their two nights at hotels had cost more than Mr. Hale had anticipated , and they were glad to take the first clean , cheerful for the first time for many days , did Margaret feel at rest . There rooms they met with that were at liberty to receive them . There , was a dreaminess in the rest , too , which made it still more perfect and luxurious to repose in . " See page 39 . I mean , you ca n't even read it ! ! I have NO IDEA what this means ! I love Elizabeth Gaskell 's books - but she should be treated with more respect .
5 #### North and South was a great combination of human interest / romance and labor relations / class differences . It reflected the strongly opposing perspectives of workers vs. management . In a history book , it would have been a boring topic but Gaskell presents each side 's motivation and agenda very fairly . The lesson seems to be that " we 're all in this together " so we may as well get along . Also , there was the age - old question of what is better , city life or country life . Gaskell pointed out the positives and negatives to both and I think that proponents of either side probably softened their stance . The course of the relationship between Margaret and Thornton mirrored the relationship between worker and management and perspectives of country vs. city life in that it was an issue causing hostility between the parties in the beginning and resulting amicably in the end . A great history lesson in a beautifully written work .
5 #### I am a professional photographer and I find this book compelling and inspirational . When my creative juices begin to ebb this is one of the volumes I always reach for ! A must have for anyone who loves America and photography .
5 #### Want to explore the early years of factories and unions ? Maybe you are looking for an intense romance fraught with misunderstandings but with a happy ending ? Interested in class struggles between the wealthy , the educated , and the poor ? How about seekers who are trying to understand social responsibility , or spiritual reasons for the unfairness of life ? This book has it all . Written over 150 years ago , it is still a gripping story with some new action on almost every page . Like many books of that time period , North and South starts at a slow pace , but it quickly builds speed as it goes . The free Kindle version has some typos , and the dialogue of the poor working class is sometimes hard to follow , but these are small things in comparison to the story itself . There is a very good BBC miniseries of the same name , made in 2004 from this book , that you will also want to get on DVD .
5 #### this book put too much beautification on the greatness of the north . were the people in north really got that big and kind heart like this novel described ? absolutely not ! the real truth behind the civil war as i 've been enlightened in other books were not so glorious and sublime . the more realistic reason that the north disagreed the south was because the industries in the north needed more manpower , i.e. , the slaves from africa , but the slave import business was controlled by the south , so the north found some excuses and showed great kindness to the slaved people . so like today , more false propaganda and kind - heart stories were created by the north . and do n't you forget , after the north won the civil war , almost 150 years later , black people were still suffered greatly and not completely as free and equal as the white people , north or south , more people were beaten , jailed and murdered that finally caused the civil rights movement . american apathy was no better but even worse , 1000 times more cruel and longer than what the black natives suffered in south africa . what we read in this novel and all alike by saying the white people in the north were kinder , gentler , more loving and care were nothing but white lies to beautify the white people , i.e. , the so - called love - thy - neighbor , turn - other - cheek - to - be - slapped - again christian people . and this is the ultimate truth and do n't kid yourself .
4 #### After seeing the BBC production of this book I was anxious to get the book and read it for myself .
5 #### I saw a battered copy in a bed and breakfast do bought this as a gift for my photography student daughter . 400 photographers go out on one day in 1986 and take photos of a day in America .
4 #### I purchased this book when I was in my early teens , because I had never been to the USA and wanted to know more than the touristy things , very good photography with interesting stories to match .
5 #### Though the day recorded in pictures ( May 2 , 1986 ) may have occured almost twenty years ago , the life ( and look ) of this nation has only made slight changes or none at all . People are still getting married ( page 118 ) . Babies are still being born ( pages 28 - 29 ) . Mount Rushmore still stands ( page 50 ) . People still worship their pets ( page 59 ) . People are still divided over abortion rights ( pages 62 - 63 ) Mary Kay salespersons still win Pink Cadillac 's ( page 140 ) . Siegfred and Roy are still among us ( pages 146 - 147 ) . Young families still share the joys of grocery shopping ( pages 234 - 235 ) . Liza Minnelll , though a lot " heavier , " is still entertaining ( page 87 ) . The Citadel still graduates cadets ( pages 74 - 75 ) First graders still share secrets ( pages 132 - 133 ) . Las Vegas showgirls still tout their " wares " ( pages 240 - 241 ) . And a " Bush " is in Washington ( page 106 ) . Like I said , little has changed in twenty years and this photographic day in the life of our nation shows that .
2 #### Since I loved the PBS series " Cranford , " I wanted more . The series are supposed to be based on a couple of Gaskell 's books , so I bought Cranford and this one . There was nothing of the TV series that came from " North and South . " The book was pretty slow going at first , but since I loved Cranford , I stuck with it . I 'm not sure that to enjoy the ending you really needed all of the little details . There is a family prominent to the story that added nothing and wasted a lot of pages , in my opinion . But I guess they are there to illustrate both sides of the economic life . It 's not a book I would read again . But the ending made up for all the slogging through I had to do to get there . Now that I 've read what I wrote , I 'd have to say that it really was n't worth all the time I spent reading it .
5 #### Enjoyed the book . Interesting and informative introduction . Good references in the back . Print small but readable .
5 #### This is a perfect DVD of the great mini - series of " North and South " - great to view on the DVD player . Love the story , and filming !
5 #### Wonderful book if you have n't read it then read it . If you have n't watched the movie buy it it 's worth the money . this is right up there with pride and Predjudice .
4 #### North and South delves into Victorian social issues . Ms. Gaskell describes the role of middle class women in nineteenth century society . The main character of the story is Margaret Hale , a minister 's daughter , although her mother comes from moeny . The Hales move from the south to the northern industrial town of Milton , The story skillfully explores issues of class and gender , as Margaret 's sympathy for the town mill workers conflicts with her growing attraction to the mill owner , John Thornton . Margaret befriends Bessy Higgins who works for JT . Too late , Margaret learns that John Thornton is a forward thinking mill owner who does care about his employees . I found the terminology a little difficult at times . I watched the movie version with Richard Armitage playing John Thornton and it is a wonderful love story . If you have the time it is well worth the read .
5 #### This book is a blend of Jane Austen - style stories , and some of Dickens ' romances like " Little Dorrit " and " Our Mutual Friend . "
5 #### I love this book ! North and South is my favorite movie , and reading the book gives more detail and character depth . Great read ! < > <
5 #### I had already fallen in love with the story from watching the movie and decided I should read the book . I am over half - way through and am very much enjoying this book . Gaskell is a brilliant writer with her ability to describe in detail without making the story line drag , in fact , the story moves surprisingly faster than I expected . For anyone who enjoys reading classic British literature I would highly recommend this book .
4 #### Gaskell is less well - known than she deserves , though recent miniseries of several of her works are helping to redress the balance . " North and South " is a powerful but accessible story , with strong characters and a vivid setting . Gaskell manages to include a wealth of information on social and economic conditions of the day without becoming didactic . Margaret is a fine character ; strong and self - possessed , and willing to entertain new ideas . Which also describes John Thornton . They have real chemistry , right from their first meeting . Her large cast of secondary characters are also convincingly drawn . The author says in a note that she was " was compelled to hurry on events with an improbable rapidity towards the close " due to publication limits , and that does show . The body count becomes rather distressingly high , and the lovely lingering progress to the inevitable conclusion becomes breakneck . But that certainly does n't spoil the reading experience .
5 #### I read North and South after seeing it on DVD . The book is as good as the movie - if not better . it is refreshing to read excellent 19th century novels that are intelligently written and that keep the readers interest page after page . Also , it is refreshing to read a novel minus profanity or graphic sex .
1 #### This is just a warning about this specific edition , published by Wilder Publishing . I purchased this edition over others that were slightly more expensive but ended up regretting it . It is rife with spelling , punctuation and grammatical errors . The errors were so egregious it did n't appear to have been proofread at all . I loved the novel , but the experience would have been vastly better had I chosen a book by a reputable publisher .
3 #### The PRINCESS AND THE GOBLIN proves yet another of MacDonald 's fantasy charmers ( q.v . AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND ) , as the novel presents the adventures ( psychological as well as physical ) of protected Princess Irene ( aged 8) and a brave miner boy with the unlikely name of Curdie . The tale involves the schemes of evil goblins who lurk below the earth , who exult to tease and torture the " sun people " as they call humankind . Can a mere youth foil the callous machinations of these subterranrean fiends ? Princess Irene meets a mysterious but loving old lady at a spinning wheel ( have we heard this somewhere before ? ) , while Curdie proves himself a useful ally to her King - papa . Her faithful but outspoken nurse , Lootie , learns some bitter lessons , as she is almost dismissed by the king and ( even worse ) by Irene herself . Grown ups must learn to believe what they hear from honest children ; children must learn to believe what can not always be seen or what makes scientific sense . Any little girl who sees herself as an unrecognized princess can learn to behave with the grace and dignity of a True Princess . Boys will admire the courage and resourcefulness of the miner 's son -- the only one in the kingdom to realize what the goblins are plotting . A quaintly spun yarn ( with gentle edification for children ) for readers of all ages .
1 #### I have never written a review before , but I ca n't restrain my contempt for Norilana . This book happens to be the beautiful , poignant love story I have ever had the pleasure to read . However , this particular text has been so badly printed that it absolutely overflows , if I can use that word in relation to a book , with typos ! It is so obvious that the text was never proofread ! Norilana should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for corrupting the text of this beautiful book to the extent that I was practically wincing every few minutes as I discovered another mistake . I dislike buying paperbacks , but I would rather have a paperback with the pure text than wade through another Norilana edition of anything again .
5 #### The book is in the condition it said it was in and it 's also a great read . I hope that whoever gets books from this place gets the same kind of service I got . Thank you so much ! ! ! :)
