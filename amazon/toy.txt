5 #### The stained glass pages are pretty cool . And it is nice how the black outlines are super dark and thick . And that the dragons are n't all fighting with the wizards .
5 #### My 11 y.o . loved this ... and so do I ( you know I really bought this because I wanted to see the pictures myself ... I'm just lucky enough to have someone I could justify buying it as a present for . ) Dragons and Wizards ... says it all ! With the wonderful see - through vellum like pages , that make it " stained glass . " Color it with marker , or anything else really ( colored pencil , watercolors maybe ) , and the light shining through the page makes it look luminous and gorgeous ! Even the perfectionist that gets intimidated with art and drawing tends to find these stained glass books easy to get results they are happy with , so it tends to be an enjoyable and confidence building experience . :)
5 #### The pictures are great , I 've done one and gave it to a friend of mine who likes dragons .
5 #### I absolutely love this book ! Its translucent paper make it super fun to use . I have been using Paint Brush Markers and Sakura Gel Pens on it with excellent quality . The only thing that I would recommend is a blank white sheet of paper to make the lines easier to see .
5 #### MY HUSBAND LOVED IT . HE IS IN TO DRAGONS .
5 #### Exactly as described , nice pictures , great transaction , thank you !
5 #### Sometimes you need something new and special that gives you 30 minutes of piece . I used these waiting at the dentist or a graduation or something . They are small so they slip into a bag and cheap enough , especially with the 3 for 4 price on amazon.com . The robots and funny faces are a lot of fun . Probably best at 3 - 4 - 5 rather than 2 because the stickers are small . I love all of the great not - licensed - character stuff by Dover .
5 #### These little books are great ! They are small , but perfect for birthday party favors , which is what we used them for ! There is a blank page after each page of stickers , so that 's where my kids made their robots . They were a huge hit !
2 #### This is indeed a small book . This particular ROBOT sticker book was at best , OK . Why ? Well , there 's really no space to create multiple robots . Stickers are not easy to remove . Not recommended unless you just got ta have it to entertain a child . But this may only last ten minutes . Plus side , small enough to stick in purse for travel .
4 #### I bought several of these as party favors at a robot themed birthday party . My son really seemed to like it and made a series of different robots . The only issue is that most of the pages are not such that they stickers can be re - stuck so we really only used most of the configurations once as we made them on regular pages rather than taking pieces on and off the robot at the back of the book .
1 #### total waste of money . the stickers do not stick down even once it is just a tiny amount of stickers which do not work , and that is basically it . I thought the backgrounds would make this special but it just is tiny and does not work . much better to simply buy packs of stickers and use paper the activity books in this series are better
3 #### This is pretty much just an average sticker book . It is cute , but did n't have as much variety as I had hoped . For the price , it is worth it though , my son will enjoy making his own sticker robot .
4 #### its a cute little book , but it 's a tiny little guy .
3 #### This is a tiny book . Only a few pages of stickers . The stickers do n't stick very well after the first time placing them . It did however entertain my son during a trip . Stickers for making 4 different robots , all different colors . I would suggest it for younger kids , my son is 3 .
2 #### They were ok but not really considered it a book . Really small disappointed !
4 #### This was a stocking stuffer for my son . It was cute and he enjoyed using it a couple of times . For the price of a little over a dollars did n't mind that he only used it a few times . It is hard to tell from the picture but this is small .
5 #### a wonderful little sticker book that i put with the robot two sided puzzle in a busy bag for a 3 year old .
2 #### The book is only 4 pages and it 's about the size of a 3x5 note card ... not much fun at all .
3 #### i think there are 4 robots in here to build . i was expecting a lot more . oh well ! got ta steer clear of the " little " books .
4 #### Most of the Dover Little Books are high quality . I use them to get those few more dollars for free shipping . My grandsons enjoy looking to find one . They will play with duplicates of ones they received before .
5 #### My four year old robot lover had fun with this . His five year old brother loved it , too . It did n't provide hours of entertainment , more like minutes , but it was a fun stocking stuffer and they really appreciated it .
4 #### I added this to a birthday present for my 3 - year old nephew . He loved it , but I was surprised at how small this was . In the back , there is a picture of a robot , and you " dress " him using the stickers .
5 #### If you have a child interested in robots this is a fun activity for them . It allows the child to build a robot with colorful stickers .
5 #### This was a great little book for my Robot " Boy 's Night " Party . Loved the robot craft in the back of the book :) Great price !
4 #### I bought this as a Christmas gift for my grandson . Its a sticker book . So how can I go wrong with this gift .
2 #### Not sure why there are so many rave reviews for this product . It is literally the size of an index card and only about 4 pages long ( some activity book ! ) The stickers are bright and colorful but there are only enough to make about 3 - 4 sticker robots . You could probably find something similar at the dollar store .
1 #### but definitly NOT ... tiny book .. make robot with stickers that comes inside ... whoo whoo big deal wow faint wow ... that s how bad
4 #### We bought this to give to young children that attended our wedding . Kid 's ranged from 4 - 10 years old . It would have been to have multiple robots to decorate , but the price of the book and actually the small size came in handy for us - perfect to give out to kids and fit nicely in a little treat box for them . This is great for a little gift to make a child feel special - and to keep them occupied for a bit !
5 #### This book is small in size and probably best for 4 to 5 years old due to having to piece the robots together without knowing what a robot is . My 3.5 year old did n't show much interest in it other than them being stickers . However , I saved it and he will more than likely go for it in a year or two .
4 #### Nice book but it was so small . I should have read the size of the book . It 's about as big as my palms . The activities looks fun for little ones , good for the car . It will keep him busy for a few minutes .
5 #### My 5 year old son loves robots , and he really loved creating his own robots with this little Dover book . As always , these are high quality for the price . The Little Activity Books are small , and will get you through a waiting room visit , or a restaurant sitting , but not longer than that . They are worth their small cost though ! Love it !
5 #### love this little book for an extra little fun stocking stuffer or reward item . Bots are a big thing with little boys !
1 #### Sticker Activity Book my arse . This " book " is 2 pages of stickers , folded in half and stapled inside a cover jacket . It 's not a book , and there are no activities to speak of , except for peeling off the stickers ( robot parts ) and affixing them to the back page . Oh , and did I mention this is TINY ? The whole book is about the size of a passport ( but with less pages ) and there is about 4 robots total on the little pages ( parts are parts , but I counted 1 head , 2 arms , 2 legs , 2 feet , and a body on each of the 4 pages ) . So that works out to $ 1.00 per assembled robot - total ripoff .
5 #### This occupied my almost-3 year old for nearly an hour . Stickers were durable and easy to peel . Afterwards , he kept going back to the box to see if there were more robot stickers to assemble in there . I 'll probably drop another dollar and buy it again for his Christmas stocking . Three cheers for the short memory of a preschooler !
5 #### This little Dover book is like the others of the series - fun and entertaining . I was not happy to see that the price on the back was $ 1.50 and I paid $ 2.51 with Amazon . I am used to getting a better deal than the stores , but this certainly was not !
5 #### My 4 year old loves this robot sticker book ! Yes , it is small , but its priced right for the size . This provided lots of entertainment for my son , as he got to create his own robots . He loves to intermix the parts and mis - matched robots . Definatly worth 1.50 .
4 #### My Grandson adores robots , I think Buzz Lightyear started it all ;-) These he has had great fun with . I did n't give it 5 stars only because like other reusable stickers they really are n't very reusable . They only stay ' sticky ' for the first few uses then they kept falling off which frustrated him . But the price was n't bad so as long as you consider them consumable and do n't plan on them lasting forever you 'll be getting a pretty neat product . He really did enjoy them a lot , he is age 3 1/2 ( does 100pc puzzles , builds with regular Legos , very mechanically inclined . )
5 #### Perfect for that long airplane ride for my almost 6 year old son . Small enough to fit into my handbag . The stickers can be re - used over and over again to make new robots . A must for any busy mom !
3 #### The packaging for a draw - your - own DC Universe makes it look easy enough , but think twice before purchasing it for your own beginning artist . It is entirely possible that he / she will be ultimately disappointed ( or at least frustrated ) that their art wo n't resemble the professional examples provided considering the minimal directions given . Four double - sided color pencils ( for a total of eight different colors ) , a black marker ( for bolding ) , speech balloon stencils , and an eraser are provided . The problem here is that it really becomes more practice in tracing than actually learning how to draw . Each exercise is four steps : 1 . a stick figure ; 2 . the pipes 3 . details ; and 4 . " detailed " details . There are n't any transitional instructions on how to actually get from Step 1 to the final image ; it is just a visual demonstration . This book is best for those amateurs with some basic art class experience in terms of knowing how to draw details once they 've have made the circles and connecting lines . Rating : 3/5 stars ( No recommended age , as any person 's artistic talent will vary , no matter the age . Instead , a beginning drawing class is best before tackling this book ) .
4 #### I 'm 32 and really need a hobby , so I bought this kit . The instructions were easy to follow , my only tips are to have more yarn ( I ran out of black on the first puppy ) and use a hot glue gun . I did this based on other reviews , did n't even mess with the glue that was included .
2 #### At age 31 I found these very difficult to make , I ca n't imagine how an 8 year old would do it by themselves .
4 #### We had a great time with this craft set .
5 #### Great product . Took a little practice and time , but after you get the hang of it . It turns into a cute cuddly little friend . Mine did n't turn out exactly like the picture , but it adds a taste of your own sense of style . They are super cute and comes with everything it says it will .
3 #### Super cute but I ended up doing them myself . Too hard for my 6 yr old to do . Not sure what the age is on it ...
3 #### It 's okay . I would rate it as 10 and up . . . . it is n't easy to apply the ears and eyes and have them stay . It 's definitely something that has to go on a shelf untouched after making . The yarn that comes with it will not make up many of these , so be prepared to go buy more yarn .
5 #### I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loved it very much .
5 #### Soooo cute and so much fun ! My non crafty husband made a puppy with each of my children ( 4 and 5 ) at Christmas and they turned out to be adorable and are still holding up !
5 #### My niece has had so much fun with this . She loves it .
5 #### Really cute ! ! ! My 9yr old and I have made lots of pom poms . Best of all , there s no mess to clean up and it could be done in the car , etc too . Love it !
2 #### Cute idea , and the basic steps make sense are are easy to follow if a parent works with the kid . I gave a low review because although my child was excited to take part in this , they get bored when you are doing the work ( trust me you will have to , my kid is in first grade ) and the glue provided SUCKS . It 's basically Elmers glue and it 's just not enough to keep everything together . I ca n't keep the ears or anything to dry and stay on without falling off . I would recommend hot glue .
1 #### BOOO UNLES YOU ARE PATIENT KNOW HOW TO MEASURE I DIDN'T HAVE THE PATIENCE NEITHER DID MY DAUGHTER . BORING UNLESS YOU ARE A CRAFT PERSON WHICH I AM NOT .
5 #### I purchased this so my kids could make gifts for others - and it turned out awesome . So adorable , the brown puppy turned out the best for us . It took a bit to get the hang of it , but went fast after they knew what they were doing .
3 #### This is too hard and for my 8.5 year old to do on her own and even with supervision it was frustrating . She knows how to make pompoms without this kit , so I was surprised that it was hard for her . She waited 2 years for me to get it for her so it was a bit of a disappointment . I packed it away for another time . The quality is good , instructions are decent ... so hoping in a few months we can try again with more success .
2 #### this was a gift for my daughter . I found it difficult to use
4 #### Once you get the hang of this , even a non - crafty person can make these . Fun craft to do with a 5 year old !
4 #### This was a present for my 11 year old daughter . So far we made one puppy . And yes , Klutz did not include enough yarn . We can easily buy more yarn , so this is n't a problem , more an annoyance . Instructions are decent . Our puppy came out cute . I do n't think she could have done it all alone . I enjoy crafting , so it was fun to do together . I am looking forward to making another one with her .
4 #### Really cute , REALLY time consuming and makes a mess . Daughter loves making these but would be better suited for ages 12 +
5 #### My daughter loves this kit , definitely worth every penny as she has quit an assortment of puppies to play with . Also make cute gifts .
5 #### My daughter thought it was really easy to put these together ! She had fun !
4 #### Bought as a gift & the 11 year old loved it !
4 #### 8 yr . old grandaughter loved it along with the ideas it gave . Perfect project for her .
5 #### Cool craft but is a lot of work and quite messy . The puppies are cute but there is a lot to clean up when you 're done !
5 #### wonderful product , keeps my kids busy . My daughter made a YODA for her dad :)
4 #### Very cute . A bit difficult for my 10 yr old daughter but with a little help she is getting the hang of it . Had to show her how to make the pom poms first and now she is doing okay . Product is very cute but I will say they do n't provide enough yarn so be sure to have some extra on hand .
5 #### A Christmas gift for my 8 y / o niece & totally by surprise her 11 y / o sister got the same exact one & she told me she had picked it out for herself . On Christmas day she sat on the couch & began making a white fluffy poodle I could tell she was really into it & enjoyed showing us what she did before we sat down for dinner . It was purely a coincidence that both of my grandnieces now have them . They make really cute & cuddly dogs , they are soft & not difficult to construct . I would purchase it again & highly recommend it to anyone who has a young girl who enjoys doing crafts .
5 #### If you 're patient , they come out really cute ! ! ! Not something a young child can do , so you definitely have to help if your child is under 8 or so .
1 #### Book is nice but Pom poms never come out right . Either book gives wrong measurements of string length or the Pom Pom make it come with does n't do proper job . I 've made many pompous before and this is a first time I could n't make Pom poms . So disappointing , paid too much just for the book pretty much
4 #### I had a set similar to this many , many years ago and spent a lot of time enjoying making the pom - pom animals . I ordered these for two little girls who I think will love them . Has instruction book on box . Gifts , so not opened yet . Rated 4 because I have not seen contents yet . May rate 5 when opened . ( Already rates 5 in my book just because it gave me some good memories of some old - fashioned fun . ) I may buy this item again , but not from Total Books . My shipping experience with them on this order was not good .
2 #### Came book only . If it 's just the book , it should be listed as a different listing entirely .
5 #### My niece loves this ! Her little puppies were so cute ! It is very time consuming though . She 's 8 and needed lots of adult assistance . The package only comes with enough yarn to make 4 puppies and only enough glue for one . So be prepared to buy more supplies .
5 #### Great birthday gift , very cute . Since we gave it away , I ca nt speak to how easy or hard it is to use but birthday girl was delighted
4 #### My 9 year old got this as a gift and loved the adorable puppies we made together . I think it might be too difficult for her to do on her own at least at first . My only complaint is that is did n't include enough yarn or eyes , ears etc . to make each of the 8 or 9 dogs pictured . Of course , yarn , felt , and buttons can be purchased and more dogs can then be made , but she was n't able to make her favorite dogs right away because there was only enough for 1 tan dog . ( black and white are also included in small quantities ) .
4 #### This is much harder than it looks especially when you have to make the legs and trim the face . To make a good Pom Pom puppy you need an old movie an awesome mama and last allot of coffee . I made a Pomeranian and it was so cute ( I did this with my mom and we were watching singing in the rain with a good conversation topic ) the next one looked like a mess ( I did this one by myself ) so if you like a good challenge than this is for you but if you switch from making bracelets too writing reviews ( like me ) than you just might need more help than you think . You can make up to 2 - 4 . You have to use thick yarn thin wo n't work ( it comes with 4 things of yarn ) . So if you can handle hours of trimming and cutting than get your scissors out , if you have to have a partner than pull 2 pairs out just remember it 's hard work and it 's so long .
3 #### The instructions are a bit confusing and my 7 year old needed a LOT of help . Plus there is n't enough yarn included to do any of the solid colored pups . However , the pups are cute once completed . If I had it to do over again , I 'd choose a different art project for us .
3 #### Book is OK . It was delivered in excellent condition with a little snow on it . But I think I am missing yarn ... there was not enough required tan yarn to finish the Chiuahua and my daughter cried . This book is definitely for 8 or older cause it was very hard to cut . It needs the patience of older kids . I should have waited a few years but very cute concept . My child is 6 years and we could only make one dog she was disappointed .
4 #### These are cute and the instructions are relatively easy to follow on most although I would have preferred a little more concise verbiage when doing legs or multiple colors . I feel a mom should have edited the instructions to find the weak areas that would clearly be cause for pause for little ones trying this on their own . One weird part too is when you finally start to cut the yarn the instructions indicate something like " you might find the yarn falls to the middle when you are cutting ... don't worry ! it wo n't fall out " when in fact OH HECK YEAH its gon na fall out ... unless you position your other hand to hold the middle of the donut appliance firmly to hold the shreds in place . Not a step for young ones for sure . This kits realistically seems to make 4 solid color pups and perhaps one leftover mutt but you only get 3 noses ( in my case . ) Overally , my child loves it and while I love it less so since I 'm actually the one stuck making them ..... you do get cute doggies and its something that you will improve on with each dog you make .
5 #### This is really a fun craft and fairly easy to do . The kit includes everything you need to make cute puppies !
3 #### This in an adorable little kit with many great ideas and a kit to get you started . My 7 year old and I loved making a Pom Pom pup together . The instructions were a little vague and unhelpful at times , but the overall idea was great . For the high price here , it would have been very helpful to have a little bit bigger of a starter supply and a video to help those challenged with the written instructions . My daughter was super excited about getting her Pom Pom pup kit . She worked very hard to earn her money for it . I guess the level of instructions were a bit advanced for her , as they were for me . She had gotten discouraged at one point that we did n't know how to do this . We basically made up our own instructions to finish our first Pom Pom pup , and she has n't picked it up again . Overall , it was a fun mother daughter experience with some challenge .
4 #### A nice craft - for my 6 year old would 've been impossible for her to do on her own - but we enjoyed doing it together .
5 #### I loved it . I do n't know if the gift recipient liked it or not since I never received a thank - you note . Oh well .
3 #### My daughter wanted this so badly . So she forked over her allowance and bought it . We 've used Klutz books for ages and usually have great success . This one was a bit of a dud . It was really difficult to make the pompoms using the enclosed pompom maker . They kept falling apart and once you 've cut the yarn , there is n't any way to fix it except to buy more . I 've done crafts all my life but I just could n't get how they wanted the pompom maker to work . My daughter failed and so did I. When it became unfruitful , she gave up . Since there are others who have made it work , I can only assume we were not doing something right . But if this is for kids , it should be fairly easy . Unfortunately , it has not been touched since the first few tries .
4 #### I bought this for my daughter and I to do together . She is five and a little young for some parts but we have had a great time making cute puppies . My only suggestion would be to buy a lot of extra super glue because the one that comes with it does n't hold and you 'll probably need extra yarn . One of my kits was missing eyes , noses and tongues but after a call to the manufacturer they sent me two entire replacements so I ca n't complain about that .
4 #### This was a gift for my niece , because she loves dogs . There are a lot of great ideas . I am going to add a few more supplies so that she can continue to add more .
5 #### I 'm a mental health therapist that works with kids , many of whom have anger control issues . All kids love playing Uno and this is essentially Uno with anger control tips to learn along the way . Although I felt that 20.00 was a little expensive for a card game , it 's gotten more than its fair share of use . It 's great to start conversation with kids who just want to play a game and are n't super interested in talking . I even had one of my clients ask his mom to buy the game so they could play at home . My one complaint is that the cards are very big ! It 's hard for a lot of my kids to actually hold the cards since they 're like supersized playing cards .
5 #### This game is basically UNO , but with fun " how to control emotions " suggestions on about half of the cards . It 's a great way to have fun and relax with your kiddo and occasionally bring up anger - management ideas in a non - stressful way .
5 #### Clients enjoy it ! The card questions have brought up good discussions and insight .
5 #### Wonderful tool for use when working with children with anger management symptoms / diagnoses .
5 #### I 'm a child therapist , and I love this game . Engaging , fun , and simple to play .
4 #### A little expensive , but a helpful therapy tool for working with the younger kids . It plays just like Uno and has questions on half the cards , which is more than enough . I 'm satisfied with this purchase .
5 #### I really like this game , it helps kids recognize anger and talk about difficult emotions .
5 #### The game is basically Uno with discussion cues on some of the cards . It can take a long time for someone to win the game too ... Our daughter has been having anxiety and getting angry easily lately . We noticed she 's been going to the red zone of anger so quickly that there is n't time to calm down and talk through what 's been upsetting her . Even after she calmed down she did n't want to talk about it . The day Mad Dragon arrived , we all sat down and played it before bed . She started opening up about all the things that have been bothering her and we get to tell her about similar instances when we were growing up . We love that it also reminds her about ways to keep calm and why it 's better than getting angry . Once in a while she 'll tell us how she did n't get mad at school like the Mad Dragon ! She asks to play it every night- so she clearly enjoys the game .
4 #### Good game for helping kids deal with anger . I 'm using both one on one and in group therapy . I think the price is high for a card game , but the game itself is a helpful tool to teach anger management .
4 #### Good game for helping kids learn to control emotions .
5 #### This game is a hit with everyone whoever created this gold star ! Not only is it fun it 's also educational .
5 #### This game is more fun and easier to understand than I had anticipated . ( Rules are basically the same as Uno ) I thought I would have to ' sell it to my students in 1st/2nd grade Resource , but they really enjoyed it and everyone had an answer for the questions posed along the way . It also encouraged my better readers to help others and share examples when they needed help ' getting it ' . I would recommend to any resource/ SpEd teacher working with social skills or behavior modifications .
5 #### Really better than expected ! Thank you so much for your speedy professional service
5 #### I like this game for reinforcing previously learned anger management techniques . It will not stand only as the only thing that will teach children anger management skills but kids seem to have fun with it . And since it 's played like Uno most are familiar with the rules already . I have used this for lower functioning adults as well .
5 #### This is working great and it arrived on time .
5 #### This is a good game to use even up into middle school . The kids hardly know they are even doing more than playing the game . The game can be slow or fast depending on how often you read the cards and do what they say . It offers the opportunity to do a lot of processing about anger and think about potential situations where you may be dealing with anger and what you should do . In a group , it leads to a lot of discussions .
5 #### My husband is a therapist and I came across these cards and suggested he give them a try in some of his sessions . I ca n't answer first hand since I 'm not actually the one that uses them , but he said they really grasp the kids attention and makes his therapy sessions easier . He has group sessions with high school kids , and he said the kids that normally wo n't talk during his sessions really opened up with these cards . He is amazed at how well they work .
5 #### My kids love love love this game . Wonderful anger tools & self awareness of their anger as well . It 's played like bingo with questions in the cards . I find it 's great for my clients ages 6 - 12 .
5 #### Very good therapy game . Also , because it 's played like Uno , I play it with my 7 year old granddaughter , who thinks it 's interesting .
4 #### I like them , but the kids get bored with all of the questions . The secret is to do every third one .
5 #### Very popular game in my therapy work with kids ! Love how they can relate it to playing traditional " UNO " game .
5 #### This is a favorite activity to use with children and their parents in my therapy office .
2 #### Its really UNO type game but anger control stuff ... I do n't like it due to younger children really do n't respond well to anger management techniques ... they do better with EXPECTATION management instead . These are ok , but i would n't buy them again .
3 #### Can be kind of difficult to play . Rules are n't very clear . Described as being like UNO . UNO is easier to play and for kids to understand .
5 #### I am a school social worker and I LOVE this game . My students also love it . Great for elementary aged kids and some early Jr High also enjoy it
4 #### I use this every so often with kids who could use help with anger . They like it and see it as a fun game .
5 #### This is a fun card game for helping youth talk about anger and coping ... played similar to UNO , some of the cards have questions which the players answer when they play the card .
4 #### My 12 year old son enjoyed the game - but it is hard convincing him to play . Time will tell if some of the excellent skills portrayed in this game transfer to real life .
5 #### This game is great ! It has lots of ideas to help kids control their anger and understand the potential consequences of their anger . It plays like Uno but requires the kids to answer questions . I use it in my counseling practice . I wish there were more great games like this for kids . They get to play a fun game and learn some valuable skills .
4 #### This was irresistible because my granddaughter loves this pigeon . It was fairly pricey for what it is , but sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and buy the toy .
3 #### My son loves the books , but was very disappointed in how cheaply this is made . One of the wings was half ripped off within the first couple days of normal play . nothing some needle and thread could n't fix , but now the other wing needs repair as well . Too bad it was n't made better , but I think all parents realize that toys are not built the same way they were when we were kids .
5 #### The grandkids favorite book . We read it every visit .
4 #### My 4 year old loves this series . I wish it was a priced a little lower though .
4 #### This is a bit smaller than I 'd like . It 's about the size of a beanie baby but not as floppy . My daughter loves it and it seems to be holding up well .
4 #### His leg came off within a month , but still a cute little thing .
4 #### My kids love it . It is smaller than I imagined . I think it 's a little overpriced for what you get . The 6 " height includes the spindly , floppy pigeon legs , which I did n't realize . I assumed the 6 " was just for the body .
5 #### l Recommended ...... It 's a great plush toy for kid 's or collection ....
5 #### So adorable and perfect with the book ! Ca n't wait to gift this !
1 #### If I could give this egg zero stars I would . It is poorly made and rudiculously hard to open . What should be a tender moment spent with your children is a huge headache . I had to use a knife to open it and the knife literally broke off . That is how difficult it is . Horrible product . Do nt buy .
5 #### A beautiful story , wonderfully written . A classic tradition for Easter .
5 #### great easter message in a world that is just full of easter bunnies ! ! Kids love it
4 #### I was pleasantly surprised the quality of the eggs . They are durable and will be a valuable spiritual and educational tool for my grandchildren .
5 #### Larger than I expected and absolutely beautiful ! I will be using it this week with my students at school . I know they will love it , and then I plan to enjoy it at home . Thank you ! Beautifully made , and I appreciate the instructions about how to gently open it the first time .
5 #### This set is in a convenient box and has many many little detailed pieces . My 4 year old loves designing different types of houses ! There are even great little pets that hang out in the windows and on the porches ! My kiddo loves letting the pets roam around the yard and check out all the features she places , which leads me to think she 'd really love more living creatures to inhabit these places . This would be a great travel toy because you ca n't play with it unless it 's in the box . Everything sticks in there . The one gripe I have is that it looks like there are 4 different cards to play with , but there are only 2 cards front and back , and they all fit inside the box , so you can only really look at one at a time , 2 cards max if you spread it out on another magnetic surface like a fridge . Not a big deal , but just a little crowded when trying to play .
5 #### We have several different sets of these magnetic toys . They are self contained -- no small parts all over the floor , very portabke and giid for many
5 #### This is a very cute puzzle and I love the zipper bag for storage . Our puzzles in boxes always seem to get destroyed and pieces get lost , but these bags make cleaning up and storage easier .
5 #### If your little one loves puzzles and this is in her age level , these pouch puzzles are the best thing I have found to take along . Flat , fairly small , light and uses a good amount of time to put together .
5 #### Again , a great price for a puzzle . The best part is the carrying case . You can take it with you without worrying about losing pieces .
5 #### A great puzzle for my 3.5 year old . I have bought a few of the puzzles in this series , and they are a great jigsaw starter puzzle . The pieces are easy to manipulate , and there are n't too many . It is easy for them to finish ( with a bit of help ) . The pictures are vibrant ( and non - commercial , which is a plus ) . The zippered pouches work well too .
5 #### Love the Mudpuppy pouch puzzles ! My children keep up with the puzzle since there is a pouch . It 's very easy to take along in a bag or backpack . Very good quality , will buy more .
5 #### LOVE these puzzles ! ! This one is a gift but we have several and my now three year old loves them . We 've had one for just over a year and it has held up very well !
5 #### Great puzzle for a 3 year old . Pouch makes it easy to t a me on trips . Good for development .
5 #### i am a customer from china , today i had received this toy for my lovely girl . it is very nice and my taughter is very like it .
5 #### My daughter got these as a gift and she loves them . She s one and will play with these on the fridge or dishwasher for 10 - 15 minutes . The design is very cute on them . Perfect size for little hands as well !
4 #### Love these magnets , they are adorable ! Just a little pricey and not a good assortment of the alphabet ; came with one of every letter but gave doubles of not most commonly used letters . Had to come back and by more sets to have all the letters I needed . Would still recommend these .
5 #### These are really cute and my two year old loves to see her named spelled on our fridge . It 's a cute way to teach them the alphabet . They sell these at pottery barn kids too but are cheaper on amazon ! If you are looking for cute letter magnets then these are them !
3 #### They are super cute but I 've had them for quite some time now ( maybe 6 months ) and several of them have fallen apart , and a few have broken . The cheapo plastic letters have held up much better . These are okay but I do n't think they are worth the price .
5 #### Even though my grandson is not ready to learn the alphabet , he loved moving them around on the fridge . Someday soon that familiarity with the shapes will help him learn his letter names more quickly .
5 #### My daughter who is 22 months loves these ... she plays with them for 20 - 30 minutes at a time which is huge . Be careful though , there are periods in there , so make sure to pick those out first .
4 #### These were smaller than I expected , but they are cute . I ordered letters and animals . I will have to wait until my daughter is a little older to use them .
5 #### Wonderful , beautiful letters ! ! Added this as a second set , so we 'd have enough letters for names , etc . Gorgeous and fun ! !
3 #### These are nice enough , but probably not worth the price . I did n't love how it 's missing certain letters . Not one " P " so my child could spell her name . Also missing other basic letters , while giving a few too many Qs .
5 #### Smaller than I expected but very cute and works well with steels .
5 #### My 9 month old daughter loves these . I put them on my dishwasher and she stands there and plays with them . They are a very pretty soft pastel pattern which I love because they do n't stand out as an eye sore .
5 #### I was hesitant to purchase these because some reviews said they were basically paper and fell apart easily . This was not the case with the magnets I received . They are really hard embossed wood / cardboard type material . My toddler has used these for a month , chewing on them , scattering them around the house , and they are still going strong . I 'm really happy with these magnets and i will probably purchase the matching number too . Oh , and the colors are super cute !
5 #### Love love love them , so much nicer than the traditional plastic letters .
4 #### Really cute & my daughter loves them . The quality is pretty good for what it is- some of the letters had some issues with the wood . Do wish it was laminated or something because I can see the top layer coming off after awhile .
3 #### These are super cute but it does n't take a lot to wear them down . I have them on a magnet board in my daughter 's nursery . Just from the few times I 've moved them around they have dents in them and the paper is coming off . They need to be more durable .
5 #### I absolutely love these letters , I bought 2 sets since the box only came with 40 letters and I needed more to spell out little messages on my daughter 's magnetic board . The colors are so sweet and girly !
5 #### I was looking for letters to accompany my daughter 's wooden easel . I am not a fan of plastic toys and wanted to find magnetic letters that were more attractive than the cheap plastic ones I 've seen everywhere . These were perfect . I ended up getting a set of uppercase and a set of lowercase . We 've had them for over a year and they 've stood up fine to my toddler 's use .
5 #### This puzzle was so much fun to do . Really liked the vibrant colors .
5 #### Colorful , fun , modern jigsaw puzzle . We love jigsaw puzzles and nearly always hate the art . This is a chic , cool puzzle !
5 #### Loved working on this puzzle as colors were bright and liked melted areas .
5 #### Great puzzle and size , our 2 and 4 year olds love it .
5 #### So adorable . The kid loves it . Also bought one as a gift .
5 #### My toddler loves these puzzles ! This one has a lot of great animals for him to point out and it 's colorful .
5 #### This little puppet goes perfectly with t he book Stellaluna . My 4 month old granddaughter thought it was great ( and delicious ) .
5 #### This puzzle went top a 3 year old boy . He loved the size on the floor and enjoyed finding with his Mom 's help , the pieces to create the total picture . Very good quality
4 #### This is 54 cards ; 6 shapes by 9 different colors . I was hoping this set was going to include 2 - D and 3 - D shapes ; was looking to expand my 2 year olds shape knowledge beyond the basic shapes . All in all using these cards I was able to teach him to specify the color first . Saying ' Red Circle ' rather than ' Circle Red ' . Good buy was just hoping for something else .....
5 #### My kids love these cards and there are so many color / shape combinations that they do n't become easily memorizable . Great purchase for the price !
3 #### It 's an OK product , the marker is not good at all .
4 #### Great product , but it is cardboard . Not as durable as I thought it would be , but it 's portable because of it 's small size . It works well , and serves its purpose .
5 #### perfect tool for learning how to tell time one on one with your child . straight forward , wipes easy , love that dry erase marker is included .
4 #### This is n't a high price item but it is sturdy and really helps in teaching children how to tell time . It is also a great item to bring along when going to the Doctor since it is all together ( not a bunch of little pieces that can get lost ) and will keep them busy while waiting . The pen writes and wipes right off the board . The hands turn easily enough for little fingers but with use ( I admit it was a lot of use ) they do get a little floppy so if you hold the board up , the hands fall to the 6:30 or thereabouts . Even so , for the price , it ca n't be beat !
2 #### We really love the 1999 version . this version lacks the looks and feel of the 1999 version . It looks a bit cheap . As far as rules and game is concerned it is entertaining . I would still trade this in for a 1999 version .
3 #### Nothing super fancy about this game but it 's still fairly solid . We are big gamers and have heard of this game for while and the ratings are pretty high for it so we thought we 'd try it out . The board itself is pretty boring and I thought I would like it or it would be too math oriented because of the buying and selling of stock but that 's not the case ! It is actually really easy in that regard . And it 's surprisingly satisfying matching up your square to the letter / number spot on the board . Not very complicated game play but still played well . Overall , a decent game . I would say it 's not a regular in our game play but we do bust it out on nights when we do n't want such an intense game or when we may have gaming newbies for its simple play . My only concern is that you need to not loose a single piece otherwise your game play will be messed up so if you are n't good at keeping all your pieces this game may quickly get passed over because of lost pieces .
5 #### Awesome game , family loves playing this . Get to see who the future capitalists will be in the family !
4 #### Let me get the bias out of the way first : my undergrad is in finance . If you are a finance major , or interested in fiance , stop reading and buy this game immediately . Background : Remake of the game from the 1960 's by 3 M of the same name . The object of the game is to profit by connecting two or more squares to form a hotel . If two ( or more ) hotels end up touching , they merge , with the larger hotel ( the one with the most squares ) acquiring the smaller one . Money is made by buying shares in hotels and having them grow . Bonuses are paid out to the majority and minority shareholders , and the process is repeated until the squares are all used , or no legal moves are left . Great strategy game with a enough chance built in to frustrate the best - laid plans . ( Invest in large hotels and be cash - poor , or invest in small hotels and hope for a pay - day -- lots of ways to play ) . Do n't let words like finance , shareholders , stock , or merger scare you away . The game is so easy , my six year - old daughter is able to play ( with help)--and do well ! A great , original game . My friends ( who are n't finance majors ) love it . Only four stars due to cardboard construction , and smooth board ( which allows pieces to " meander"--your OCD friends may go nuts ) . The older versions of this game had a raised grid to keep pieces in place .
4 #### we still play it . people seem to be pretty polarized about this game . some people really like it and some people really do n't .
5 #### Sid Sackson 's classic has been on my shelf since the early 80 's . Still is , but I had to pick up a second copy for our cabin ! ;D
5 #### I bought this for my son . He loves this game .
5 #### The classic Acquire does n't get old , and it packs quite a punch for its price tag . It 's a shame that Monopoly and Life have become synonymous with mainstream boardgames when this title was still around . The newest version is n't the most preferred since some older prints had a different set of components that could lock in place , but ultimately it 's the same game .
5 #### Fun game . A little complicated , but fun once you understand how it works .
5 #### Love this game , makes you think , but not too much . We have owned this game for years and purchased it for a friend because he liked it so much .
4 #### Buying and selling hotels sounds kind of boring on the surface . But if you went for that knee jerk reaction , you would completely miss this fantastic game . The game is simple to play , but requires a lot of hard decisions and some memory involved too . Now some people would complain that this game involves a lot of luck . It can indeed trip you up . Because you might get stuck and invested in a hotel chain that never goes down and you are broke for most of the game . That does happen every now and then . And it sucks when it does . But do n't let that turn you off to the game . There is a lot of serious strategy going on here . Since a person lays a tile down each turn , you need to buy stock in each hotel according to how soon you think it will go down . So if I love the game so much how come I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars ? Because this version of it is hands down weaker than the old version . The older versions of the game came with a plastic board where you could snap the tiles into place . This new version is a flat board that with one bump leads to it being messed up . Ugh Still , this game is fantastic . If you are a fan of Monopoly and want to branch out onto the next level , I recommend this classic game .
5 #### i love this game one of my favorite by fare
5 #### Hall of Fame board game . The game is easy to learn and fantastic for 3 , 4 or 5 players . Games go very quickly . This edition is a little cheap , but then that is the case for all games . If you like board games like Cataan , Axis and Allies , Risk , Monopoly or Scrabble , you 'll probably really like this .
5 #### It 's a fun game . A lot of strategy and every game is different so it has great replay value . It 's a classic .
3 #### For a company that was able to roll out Magic : The Gathering Trading Card Game with all the strategy packed into those cards , this game is lacking and misses the expectations that I had set for Wizards . An interesting game to help to explain to young adults about how Mergers and Acquisitions might work at a very basic level in this world ( M&A being a large section of open job opportunities in the world at this point ) but very basic , one track strategy , and lacking in overall fun honestly .
2 #### not that great a game . have only played like once or twice and do n't even know where it is now .
5 #### We were thrilled to find Acquire finally ; my husband grew up loving this game . Ordered it for my brother . The game requires strategy , planning , and never ends the same way . It is a classic , must - have addition for any game closet . It 's a little more time intensive , and the board is n't as flashy as newer games , but hey -- it is exciting to play . It 's all about the acquisitions .
5 #### great game , not stale ... kept us busy and entertained . No two games is ever the same ... We enjoyed it for sure .
1 #### A crappy cardboard ghost of the original . Hard to believe they did this , but they did . Shame on Hasbro . Disgusting .
3 #### Acquire is a truly brilliant and fun game . It requires strategy and planning and can be a lot of fun . I bought this game because so few people have heard of it and it 's great to introduce people to . But this edition is terrible . Previous editions had raised plastic boards and 3D pieces that locked on the board and looked nice . This is all flat cardboard tiles that slide around the board and both look and feel cheap . The previous ( 1991 ) edition sells on eBay now for $ 130 , way beyond any reasonable price range . If you love this game , this cheap cardboard version is your only realistic option until the makers finally decide to make a good quality edition again .
5 #### Played for the first time yesterday with 4 players . Took a few minutes to get everyone up to par with the instructions but flow picks up quickly . Many levels of strategy involved such as when to buy shares in what chain and whether or not block mergers to prevent competitors from cashing in on appreciated stock values . Kept everyone engaged throughout and the intensity picks up at the end when trying to decide whether or not to initiate the end of game play . My one complaint would be that previous iterations of Acquire had grooved slots on the board so that the tiles would not shift when others are being placed . Minor complaint but newer versions need to address it . Overall it is highly recommended .
5 #### Wrath of Ashardalon is a fun game . If you like dungeon style board games that use cooperative play mechanics , then you 'll really enjoy this . Unlike many other games in the genre , this game is fully cooperative . There 's no solo player controlling the dungeon and the monsters . Because of that however , there is going to be a bit of reading involved in any play session . Players end up controlling monsters on their turns as well as acting for their hero character . The monsters however follow a set of instructions located on each of their cards , sort of like a simple AI computer program . It works out fairly easily and is a lot of fun . There 's an adventure book which outlines the different scenarios for the game and it can combine with the other game(s ) in the D&D Boardgame series for more play options . There are many unpainted miniatures in the game along with a ton of cardboard chits .
5 #### Great games with awesome minis to compliment your collection
5 #### Lots of awesome miniatures and dungeon tiles included . Very high quality . I would like to get the other games in the series
3 #### This D&D board game offers a pretty fun cooperative campaign . It is compatible with the old 4th edition D&D and not the current 5th edition rules . It is also compatible with the other similarly shaped and sized D&D board games so you can choose to mix 'em and make your own house rules and campaigns with them .
5 #### A must have for beginning D&D players ! My sons love using this as a stand alone and will be adding more to it .
4 #### I 'm a huge fan of the traditional pen and paper style RPG 'S but as an adult man is it hard to get a group together and make time to play . This is a great little ( well ... the box is far from small ) intermediate . It lacks the story depth and such but it 's fun , and fairly easy . Heck , my wife even likes playing it
5 #### Bought this because I wanted it . All these D&D games are great .
5 #### Great game , but very difficult to learn . It took us two hours just to read through the manual , so like other reviews said , you have to be patient . My son wanted this game , and he 's 10 . I was n't sure it would be good for him , but he 's smart as a whip and helped the rest of the family figure it out !
5 #### We have collected all of the D&D board games , and this is among our favorites . Stand alone games can be a few hours or you can do campaign mode which can last several sessions , much like a standard D&D campaign . Highly recommend for groups who never seem to want to DM but still want to play . The minis can be painted or left plain . They are excellently detailed , as are the player cards and other components . There are so many components we ended up having to use ziploc bags to keep everything organized . Great addition to a group who does n't mind long winded games like Risk . We did end up having to implement our own house rules for things like traps which can sometimes bring the game to a grinding hault . Groups who are used to house rules will have no problem adapting the game to fit their group dynamic .
5 #### We have Drizzt and enjoy playing it . Even our younger kids are able to join in . ( They are ages 7 & 5 ) . We have n't cracked this one open yet ( Father 's Day gift ) , but expect nothing less than an amazing fun time .
5 #### Be careful ordering this . My disk 5 was corrupted and scan disk could n't fix it ! Had to get Wizards to send another , which they did right away . Graphics : excellent VGA graphics . Make sure you have at least 8 mb of ram , because when Ashardalon appears during the final chapter it WILL freeze up your system ! Sound : will not work . Have the latest SoundBlaster card . Ca n't get any help on this one . Gameplay : as long as you got the system requirement you 'll have a great time . Light dnd gameplay that certainly satisfies the itch , especially if you ca n't get your dnd group together . Much better game than Menzoberranzan
3 #### This game gets some things right . The components are well manufactured and will likely last for many a playthrough , the system is simple and pretty easy to master . Beyond that , it 's just mediocre at best . The gameplay is shallow , lacking anything but the most superficial of narratives , the character development / leveling and the combat system are oversimplified to the point of dullness , the environments are monotone , and the theme is superficial . Markers and tiles just feel lifeless and nothing compels the player to keep playing once the thrill of repeatedly rolling a d20 ( the ONLY die in the game ) wears off ( which probably already has or you would n't be reading this ) . Little flexibility in character customization , no damage randomization , a shoehorned encounter system that typically throws out non - sequitur attacks and penalties , and lackluster scenarios that read like 7th grade recess fiction . I will say that the minis included in this game are well modeled and of good quality . I think this is where the game gets its five star ratings . Once the thrill of opening and looking at a box of toys wears off , though , you are left holding one intensely flat gaming experience bag . I 'd recommend looking elsewhere for a solid dungeon crawler , because this one is just not quite it .
5 #### With tons of replay value , this tense , cooperative adventure has quickly became one of my favorite casual games . You would think that , without a DM , the pacing would n't flow , but the designers were clever in forcing you to keep exploring to avoid hazards and traps . You never know what could be slithering around the corner . What I love is how customizable it is . Yes , you should follow the rules to a T , but you can also shuffle in pieces from other D&D board games like Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt . Doing so can create massive mazes of randomized monsters . If you 're getting even more invested , create your own heroes and villains from scratch by rolling in Reaper or other mini figures . You also get a horde of miniature figurines that would otherwise cost $ 50 so the value is well worth it . I only wish I 'd found out about these games sooner .
5 #### I have n't actually played the game , I bought it just for the minis , so this review pertains to the minis only ... They are very nice , and you get a lot of them for the price : 1 red dragon 1 otyugh ( big tentacle guy in back ) 1 rage drake 1 gauth ( like a small beholder ) 3 bears 3 gibbering mouthers ( blob monsters ) 3 grell ( brain monsters ) 3 kobold warriors 1 larger kobold warrior 3 devil warriors 3 cultists 3 orc archers 3 orc warriors 1 orc shaman 3 duergar ( dark dwarf ) guards 1 duergar captain 3 snakes 1 female dwarf fighter 1 female elf paladin 1 male human cleric 1 male dragonborn wizard ( could probably pass as female ) 1 male half - orc rogue
4 #### The game is n't nearly as fun as D&D , but it has lots of items that can be added to your current D&D game .
5 #### Finally played it with my wife and kids . We had hours of fun . Took a bit to figure out the rules , but , seriously , and entire saturday afternoon and night dissapeared . I d want those hours back , but who cares , we were slaying grell and kobolds .
5 #### This is by far my favorite out of the D&D Board Games . Fun and easy to learn . I even got my family to play it with me .
5 #### great figure booster for normal dnd have n't played the game yet .
5 #### This game is very fun and all of the materials in the game are nicely made . It is n't just cheap toys . I also loved the shipping , came very quickly .
4 #### I would have given it a 4 if my Cleric did n't fall into a pit on the first turn . I could n't roll my way out of it ... damn .
5 #### Great game if you like dungeon crawlers . My biggest complaint is that the rules are not very clear on many aspects especially monster movement and placement . Do these monsters walk right into our caltrops ? ! Of course they do there is nothing specially stating how they move . The game also could be a tad harder as we usually have little to no trouble beating it so I decided to include a picture were we were smashed into the ground by our enemies !
5 #### As a disclaimer , one of my villain cards came with a factory defect where the machine burned into it but that should be a rarity . As far as the rest , these are the BEST miniatures I 've ever had . The Cave Bears are my wife 's favorite , while I LOVE the Otyugh ! The insane number of Orcs , Duergar , extra Kobolds and devils is frickin ' AWESOME ! ! ! Seriously , this is more well balanced with even more new game features that stand to be even better than the previous Castle Ravenloft game .
5 #### A simpler take on Dungeons and Dragons . No need for a DM , the game plays it out for you . Do you just want to dungeon crawl ? Hack and slash your way to victory ! Solo missions are available and this game can be mixed easily with other editions of the games ! Tons of cards and miniatures . Worth every cent .
3 #### It is ok because the game is a tad too mechanic , almost soulless . If you are into hack and slash , then this may be good for you but there is no room for role playing ( not even a tiny bit ) the cards have the briefest descriptions , and most basic imagery . Neither of which stimulates imagination . The nice thing about this huge box though are the minis . Tons of very high quality minis ...
5 #### My husband and I have been playing RPGs since , yes , the late 70s . I stole my brother 's Basic D&D set , when he left it on his shelf and did n't touch it for over six months . He never missed it . I state this to let the reader know that I do , indeed , have a hefty background in Dungeons and Dragons . My son just turned 11 . He 's been gaming with us since last summer , so he 's getting the hang of this cooperative roleplaying thing . Last night , we sat down to play this , with our partner , so we were a group of 4 . It took some head - scratching , and re - reviewing the rules , and on - the - spot house - rule - making , but we had a blast . We had a BLAST . We won the first scenario , but lost the second one ( ran out of Surge markers ) . We 'll be painting up the miniatures over the next few weeks , and definitely going into our Family Game Night rotation , with Talisman , Ticket to Ride , Risk , Monopoly , and Fluxx .
4 #### gave it four stars because of the total increase in difficulty , if you are just starting out with these boxes ... get legend of DRIZZT , its easier to grasp . i combined this box with drizzt because i enjoyed the monsters as well as the very cool treasure cards ! ! however the encounter cards in this box are crazy ridiculous !
5 #### This was given as a gift and the recipient was thrilled . The game play is perfect for both advanced players of D&D and those who are just beginning . Gameplay can be incorporated with other game systems . The ' minis ' are awesome and are capable to be utilized in other games . The cards and puzzle board pieces are sturdy and are of a good quality . Highly recommended .
5 #### Item arrived on time , packaged well , undamaged , no complaints of any kind with purchase . I have enjoyed playing the other two D&D board games with my kids , I am sure we will enjoy adding this one to the mix . I do n't feel obligated to stick to every last detail of the official rules , the wonderful thing about D&D is the flexibility it gives you to streamline things as you see fit and add in other things for variety .
4 #### In a nutshell , it is 4th edition DnD with tabletop miniatures and maps included . it has the " core rules " incorporated for a board game edition of DnD and allows for mixing and matching between this game and the other two titles of this genre . I have a few friends over once in a while to play , and it 's nice because we can geek out without having to go through all the headaches of keeping up with full blown DnD " stuff " ( character sheets , and special rules , and new books , and edition changes , etc ) . Not quite as much fun as I used to have playing first edition rules when I was a kid , but it fits the bill for what I need at this age . This is by far my favorite of the 3 titles ... I think a game called dungeons and dragons should have you entering a dungeon and fighting a dragon . This one DELIVERS and then some .
5 #### My son loves these games , this is his third one and the boys play for hours ! I like the fact that it gets them off the computer and using their minds !
5 #### I bought the game expecting that if I did n't enjoy the game , it was still a good price for a box full of mini 's to use with other games . But the game if a riot to play . It 's a random draw system based around a few key structures to provide a point to each dungeon crawl . You could play the same run over and over and it 'd probably be a few hundred times before it came up exactly the same . A sense of desperation , but still not to tough . It can combine with Castle Ravenloft and The Legend of Drizzt board games , each a stand alone set as well as this one . A lot of online game modifications if you ever get tired of the main rules . A few rules to learn , then most of the rules are given on the cards that are used in play . One nice feature , 1 - 5 players . If combined with the other titles , you could potentially play 1 - 15 players , though that 's a lot people for this type of game . Each player is partially running the game and playing at the same time . The more players , the more monsters and traps and such , so it scales nicely in difficulty with however many players you have . The mini 's are unpainted , but still really nice looking .
5 #### I got this for my nephews because all they do is play video games . This is something a little more social and creative than shooting people in the head over and over again .
5 #### Probably the best of the three D&D board games ( Ravenloft , Ashardalon , Drizzt ) . The game itself is a big box of stuff ( miniatures , maps tile , game pieces , rulebooks ) , so its a lot of fun to open . The quality of everything is VERY good , so this game is going to last a long time . Very replayable , and even supports playing solitaire ( for those nights when everyone is out of town ) .
5 #### Once I opened the box and unpacked everything I was ecstatic . The tiles are nice and thick so they should hold up well to countless replays . The mini 's are great and as far as I can tell , it 's all compatible with the RPG game . I foresee me running encounters and campaigns using the components from all 3 boxes . Great buy .
5 #### This is in my opinion the best dungeon crawler out there . It can be setup , played and tore down all in under 2 hours . It makes a fun ride , and is fun with your kids too ( mine are 5 and 7 ) .
5 #### I own this and Castle Ravenloft , which are the two I would always put together . WoA is what most recommend as the one to get if you just get one -- it 's difficulty is average ( unlike CR which is cruel ) and the heroes are good . These D&D games are so much fun because it truly is a " system " of sorts . You will end up having a ton of little figurines ( sadly not painted the way some other games have them , but then again you get so many of it it only makes sense ! ) , a bajillion little tokens , and an amazingly well illustrated rulebook , along with a really good collection of scenarios to play ( a lot of 'em ! ) . This game , when you have the 1 - 2.5hrs needed for some of the scenarios with friends , just plays so well with the whole group . It 's truly cooperative , every character is different and everyone can contribute into the fun . I do suggest that if you buy this game , play it for a bit w/ the base rules , and if you ever start feeling like you are finding it " a bit mechanically repetitive " then pause , go to boardgamegeek and find the variants ( one I published in fact ) that allow for an " Initiative " system - it will change everything and you 'll be back to enjoy this game in no time ! Absolutely worth every penny when it is ~ $ 40 .
5 #### I bought this game as a cheap introduction to what D&D world would be , and to introduce my GF and some friends to a boardgame with a little more RPG Elements than just rolling dice and killing stuff , the game was a real success the gameplay is easy to learn and the game may seem to be very straight forward but it will depends of the people playing it how fun can it be I really recommend it , I 'm 100 % buying the other 2 games
1 #### Hated this product . Predictable . Not fun . It attempts to be a fast setup table top game but feels as a meshed together mess of crap . Often times I thought " this seems like d&d battle .... Just kidding " . We never played it again after one play through . Would not recommend this for an older gaming group that enjoys board / card ga , es like talisman and 7 wonders and ascension . F
5 #### This game has grat mechanics . I think many get it expecting to have the kind of experience you have within the standard D&D RPG , but this IS a BOARD GAME ! Albeit ; the play is great , but there is just so much you can do with randomization . That 's randomizing tiles , treasures , etc . All these cards are not as awful as several people have said in negative comments . It uses actual 4th Edition D&D and it plays well for people who just want a casual night of gaming with family and/or friends . It 's nothing extravagant but it will keep you in D&D without having to be a DM(Dungeon master ) . That is plus for me , since I have been a DM all of my life and never had others who could DM but once or twice . So yea , if you love good boardgames that the family can enjoy or just to have a casual night of gaming , this is the game for you . I would suggest watching Rodney Smith 's " Watch it Played " series on this game which he has on Youtube.com You can see it taken out of the box , set up and played and make a more accurate decision on whether to buy it , it helped me a lot ! [ ... ]
1 #### I had high hopes for this game , as I am a big fan of Fourth Edition D&D ( though if you like 3e , enjoy it ! I 'm not going to tell you one is better ; I 'll just tell you which one I prefer ) . I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such , so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it . Sadly , all that could n't rescue this game . It is exceedingly repetitive . Play about 3 turns and you 'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you . The game is hopelessly shallow , based on so much chance that strategy is non - existent . Despite the modular tiles , the game offers virtually no customization . The pieces seem to be well - made , and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D , since the store I bought it from does n't do returns . However , the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself . I really wanted to enjoy this game , so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts , before accepting the fact that it simply does n't work . Extremely disappointing .
3 #### My 1st biggest disappointment with this box set is that it needed about double the number of sheets . There 's 10 sheets and they are double - sided , but most of the " other " side are n't very imaginative . In fact , most of them are plain cement tiles . There are some cool useful tiles , but only one of each . Such as a bookshelf that 's 2x4 but there 's only 1 tile like this . There should have been more doubles of these kind of tiles . There 's a web that 's 2x2 but only 1 again . Really disappointing . There definitely should have been twice this many sheets . So if you 've got nothing else to decorate your mat this is a good start but if you 've already got plenty of decorative tiles you should pass on this .
4 #### Versatile and somewhat convenient , you will likely have to spend some time beforehand to set - up your dungeon scene or you may have some interruption to game play . Still , I prefer them to dry erase at this point because I am terrible at drawing / sketching anything forget about to scale . These tiles also work quite well with 25 mm miniatures so I feel they are a great value since you can usually get them under $ 20 a box .
5 #### I DIG THIS ! It 's a shame that 5 - 6 years ago I was n't running any RPGs . I probably would have had these tiles already . This set is very versatile and will really enhance my battle mats for my players . I 'm glad they are still reasonably priced and I 'll be getting the other 2 master sets I 've found here on Amazon . The box they come in are even wilderness tiled so you can potentially have multi - leveled terrain . It also cuts down a bit on setting up a random or story encounter . I will usuallydraw out the battle maps on a large grid map before it happens , but now I 'll be able to just drop terrain where I might need it .
5 #### Tons of tile selections and look great on the table .
4 #### Great tile set ! I use them a lot in my games . Many pieces with endless dungeon making possibilities . You do wanna make sure to have a non slick surface under the tiles or them will move around . I flip one of my rubber game mats over and it works . Some times ill but a clear plastic board on top to hold everything in place . That 's mainly if its a large dungeon and I want to have it all ready to go before my group comes over . Definitely worth the money to had a little color and visuals to your rpg game .
5 #### The tiles are just as i hoped they would be . The graphics are very nice and the board is sturdy and should hold up well .
5 #### before this I hated running any RPG campaign dealing with towns because it kills the momentum and just becomes 2 hours of haggling for magic items . This helps open up story ideas and plot hooks .
5 #### Great start for any Wargamer looking for Orcs to add . and just perfect for everyone else looking for bad guy miniatures in general .
4 #### Honestly , the game itself is not for me ( it 's a tactical game , and I prefer dungeon crawlers ) but it is fun to play and it allows me to expand my DnD board games and my Descent : Journeys into the dark bard games . Bonus ... the minis are pre - painted , so one less step to be able to use them and the map tiles fit with descent and DnD. OK game ... better when used as a DnD or Descent expansion pack
5 #### I love this game and recommend it highly . Its easy enough to learn and has very clear rules and a cheat sheet that keeps the game flowing . One of the best things is that although each army is customizable most people just play the premade as they are well thought out and it really simplifies and speeds the game up because you do not have to go through the tedium of picking and trying to figure out synergy and which card works best with which . I just wish they would produce some more sets .
3 #### The master tiles set was a great idea but as a whole , they 're disappointing . Dungeon ( this set ) is the most useful in my games because the environment is the most varied . But even this set suffers from esoteric images that I 've never used more than once . The Wilderness and City sets are practically useless because the tiles do n't have very much variety and I would rather just use a battle mat with wet - erase scenery drawn on . On the plus side , they are well - made , durable , and vibrant . Having a sturdy box to hold them all is also nice .
5 #### I ordered this as a " what the heck " buy , since I 've never had tiles before , I was n't sure if I wanted to dive into them and the price was irresistible . This tile set is an amazing set for the price ( I got it for just over $ 12 ! ) . The tiles are extremely well printed on very heavy card stock ( 2 mm thick ) . Just poring over them and looking at the details has got me thinking about how I can use them . Others here have given excellent descriptions as to what you 're getting , so I 'm not going to repeat them and my set came exactly as all the others described . I am very pleased with what I got . So far I 'm having fun just playing around with layouts !
5 #### This a perfect must have set ! It really helps my group better plane fights and helps add a lot of eye candy to your gaming .
5 #### Useful if you do n't have a grid to draw on or if you want to add something to your grid .
5 #### I bought these because I play D&D and it 's a great price for the minis . I 'm very pleased with the quality of the minis . I have n't even played the Dungeon Command game yet , and I 'm already satisfied with the quality of the minis for playing D&D. I 'll write an update once I have a chance to play the Dungeon Command game to give a review of it too .
4 #### However , the game was actually in better shape than some I 've ordered that came in boxes , as there was no damage whatsoever . So possibly this is a good way to send games , but I was a bit puzzled by it when it arrived . Either way , it worked this time , and the game arrived well within the expected time frame for delivery .
5 #### These just make the game come alive . Battles go much more quickly and smoothly . Very nicely designed , and a great way to give detail and depth to battles .
5 #### I use these all the time . They are perfect for creating your own dungeon or copying one that has already been published . I have not had a single time when I wished I had a new tile . I use this in combination with the Shattered Keeps Map Pack and I have run 3 quests using only these . They 're great
4 #### This is easily one of the most usable tile sets i have purchased , its got a lot of heavy duty tiles and great artwork . Some of the pieces are a bit obscure and do not have the versatility while others can be fit into many situations . I would recommend it to any DM / GM ( screw you wizards and copy writing that term ) .
4 #### I have recently gotten my sons involved in D&D. As a newly minted Dungeon Master with a full time job , it 's tough to be able to construct new maps / locations for our quests . This allows me to toss together many different scenes in a little amount of time . Each tile is mad of sturdy cardboard with semi - gloss printing , much like a cardboard puzzle . They are two - sided , so one side might be a road , the other a grassy knoll . I could see having a few more of these for larger campaigns .
3 #### It 's an alright enough set , I was expecting some better tiles , like small rooms and such , but for what it has , it gets the job done .
4 #### Lots to like here , Good variety , outstanding artwork , good heavy cardstock , You wo n't create massive dungeons , but the ones you lay out will be very nice . I recommend using this along with one or two of the smaller tile sets , maybe Caves of Carnage and Urban Underdark .
5 #### makes map making easier when creating and adventure for your party . and is easy to set up . and take down . I would recommend it to any D&D fan
5 #### This is one of the most versaTILE ( pun entirely intended ) things that I have gotten as a DM . The tiles can be used over and over in different combinations without seeming familiar . There are a good variety of generic tiles that will not make a person think " Oh , I 've seen that rock formation in the last encounter . " However , there are also some unique tiles that give players a sense of importance when they see it . With the right settings and plot , you could run an entire campaign with just this kit . It should be noted , however , that this works great in conjunction with the other Master Sets ( I personally use the dungeon set as well ) to expand your settings .
5 #### Excellent set of tiles with a good variety of rooms and hallways . A little skimpy on " furniture " and dungeon dressing , IMO , but for the price I 'm satisfied .
5 #### Pros : Durable , attractive , useful for almost any constructed dungeon ( not caves ) , can be built into semi-3D structures by putting books under them etc . Great value ! Box is two big tiles ! Cons : Take longer to set up than drawing out a map on a Chessex battlemat . That 's my only complaint .
4 #### We set our campagin in the Woods so these worked well . We use them for other settings too , just have to use some imagination .
4 #### They are what they are supposed to be . The cardboard is rugged the artwork is good and they get the job done . All in all a good product .
4 #### If you want something other than a large battlemat , this set of tiles is a good starting spot for a DM . Problem is 80 % of the pre - printed modules you have will not use the majority of the tiles in here , and you will need 2 for most dungeons of descent size . Still if you are looking for a way to laydown a map instead of drawing it , you ca n't go too wrong here .
5 #### I was not a huge 4th Edition D&D game fan when it came out . That confession done , Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro have won me over with their fantastic gaming props . The entire set of essential tiles are fantastic ! The quality is top - notch . The tiles are two - sided , and each of the sets contains numerous add - ons that allow nearly endless varieties of terrain for encounters . Since all of the tiles are done with symetric , equal squares for the grid , everyone of the sets is geomorphic . You can use the wilderness set with the city set to create a park in a city . You can use the dungeon set with the wilderness set to create a gothic , evil clearing . The only limit is your imagination . Truth be told , I use this tile set with all of my fantasy role - playing table - top games . For the price , it would be hard to imagine a better deal . Well done Hasbro ! In service , Rich [ ... ]
3 #### I have quite a few sets of most of the Tile sets that have been released to date . I was really looking forward to this set and I must say I was disappointed . Quality - wise , from a materials standpoint its just as good as the all the previous sets , but the tiles were rather boring and uninteresting . Most I already had from other sets and there was really nothing that made this set stand out or make me say " cool " . All in all , I would say a very middle - of - the - road product .
5 #### Just got my box in the mail . This set contains over a dozen thick card - stock dungeon tiles and rooms for the D&D4 game . Some are reprints of previous dungeon tiles but no matter , this is meant to be a core - set . If you are new to D&D 4 then you should pick this up , it has enough tiles for a modest sized dungeon crawl game . I 'll probably pick up a second box set to expand my tile sets . What is excellent about this set is that the box itself is a large sized dungeon room ( both lid and box ) . While I still use a battlemat this is great for adding more atmosphere for specific dungeon encounters . Wizards D&D are really putting out good quality products with this Essentials line . While touted for D&D this set could easily be used for other fantasy RPG games like Warhammer or Pathfinder too .
5 #### Lords of Waterdeep is by far one of my favorite board games . It 's a worker placement type game , that is great for 2 - 5 players . This game is set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe , and while knowledge of the history is nice in that it would will let you recognize more of the land marks , it is not at all necessary to enjoy the game . I 've played lots of worker placement games , and this remains one of my favorites as it 's a solid middle ground , between rules heavy , and rules light . I highly recommend this board game .
4 #### My husband and I love Lords of Waterdeep . This is by far our favorite two player game so we were pretty excited when the expansion came out . The new quests , intrigue , and building cards are great . Adds some new fun ways to play . I do find that the new lords are pretty biased though . Some of them are shoe - ins to win the game and others are almost impossible . My husband and I are busy discussing the ways we can modify these new lords to make them more fair in game play . I 'm sure other people have been thinking the same .... But other than these new lords , the new game play is fun !
5 #### Great expansion to Lords of Waterdeep . This expansion adds three different levels of play so you get a lot out of it .
5 #### If you love Lords of Waterdeep , you MUST have this .
5 #### This is an AMAZING add on . The first time I played Lords of Waterdeep , we played with this , so I thought the skulls and different things were all part of the game . I was actually a bit disappointed when I played again and it was n't part of the game . Lords of Waterdeep is my favorite board game , and this just makes it all the better !
5 #### Adds so much more of the best parts of waterdeep to the game , and turns the 2d chess game of quest completion into a 3d game of corruption and deciet !
5 #### Got this for a friend to go with the first one . I ca n't say enough good things about this addition . It adds a whole new level of challenge and complexity to its companion . It 's a must buy !
5 #### Makes an awesome game even better , and opens up more space for a sixth player to join in .
5 #### Love the expansion of skulls and more abundant spaces to put my " agents " on .
5 #### Scoundrels of Skullport is a double expansion where one or both parts can be added to the base game to add more worker placement spots . My group always plays w/ both . Pros : -New boards w/ more worker placement areas . -New Lords , buildings , quests , etc . -New twist w/ " corruption " . Cons : -Set up and break down of the game is a chore . For best balance , when playing w/ both expansions , some of the cards are removed from the game . This means everything has to be sorted before the correct number of random cards can be removed . You could get around this if you picked your least favorite of these to leave out permanently , but otherwise , these are supposed to be random . -The Xanathar Lord sucks . He seems to be a bit handicapped .
5 #### This is great if you want to play with 5 - 6 people as it opens up the game more . Skullport makes the game a bit more confusing , and our playing group usually does n't play it . But we love Undermountain . Big thumbs up from our group !
5 #### an Awesome Tabletop game , great for intrigue and a little sabotage of the other players
5 #### It took everything that made the original Lords of Waterdeep awesome and improved upon it . The quests , intrigue , buildings , all the new component simply adds to the depth of the game without complicating it . This is by far my wife and my favorite game and expansion .
5 #### This expansion allows you to add players to Lords of Waterdeep . It 's our favorite game with groups of 3 - 5 . It adds an additional character , buildings and a few new elements of game play .
5 #### One of the best expansions ever ! Well worth getting . I will not play the base game without this expansion . Get it now
5 #### One of the best and frankly necessary add on 's . If you like waterdeep you need this , its a perfect expansion non - convoluted adds a great deal and well designed .
5 #### Great addition to the game ! The expansion is actually two expansions in one and allows for 6 players . I feel that in order to play both expansions at the same time 5 or 6 is the number to play with or the buildings do n't really come into play . The new spaces are quite powerful but do come with some drawbacks to discourage players from using them exclusively . I lost 81 points the first time I played this expansion , be warned . The dividers for the pieces is n't as robust as the original and in fact mine came broken . The color of the cards is slightly different on the back , not too different that they would be noticed from a distance . The Lords for the expansion are very difficult to get the bonus points with . Pros : Extra player new spaces leading to new strategies Cons : Inferior dividers for storage
3 #### This game has two expansions in it . Skullport kind of sucks Undermountain is pretty cool
5 #### This is a must have expansion . The boon of euro style games has brought expansions to base games to the US . Many expansions really are n't that necessary but this is one that really adds a lot of variation to your game play . The base game is fairly basic and is a great entry level worker placement game . With this expansion you add several new gaming elements into the game and make it more of an intermediate game . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Lords of Waterdeep is an awesome game and so are the two expansions included in Scoundrels of Skullport . While I think that the game becomes ' crowded ' when trying to use both expansions at the same time , they are great additions whether used separately or together . The corruption influence adds a nice mechanic to the game that tends to bite greedy players in the end . The only minor issue that we have with the entire system has to deal with inadequate scoring and building tokens . We regularly exceed 200 points before the end game ( and > 300 rarely ) and have had several occasions where there were not enough building owner counters . Neither are deterrents for such an excellent game however .
5 #### I 'm usually quite skeptical of expansions . But , being a fanboy of the Lords of Waterdeep core game ( it 's one of the best games out there to be honest - if you like worker placement / euro style games ) I kind of felt I " had " to buy the expansion . Guess what ? You HAVE to buy this expansion . It 's absolutely essential . It brings an intelligent and logical series of additional rules / mechanics that make an already good game , great . I never really felt anything was lacking from the core game in the sense that , " oh boy , this is only mildly playable but lacks a lot ... guess an expansion will be coming soon ... " Which is my main complaint about a lot of expansions ( play Lord of the Rings : LCG to understand how a core game lacks key components to fully flesh it out ) . However , this expansion will make you wonder how you ever got along without it ( it 's that good - but does n't feel like " a fix " to the core game ) . Buy it .
5 #### Amazing expansion to Lords of Waterdeep . I love the bigger reward missions , but the best part of the expansion is undoubtedly the addition of corruption . Must have expansion .
5 #### A must - have for fans of the base game , Lords of Waterdeep . This expansion comes with two " Modules " , or ways to augment the base game . Each module comes with its own set of buildings , intrigue cards , quests , and lords . There are symbols on the cards to distinguish between " Base Cards / Buildings " , " Undermountain Cards / Buildings " , and " Skullport Cards / Buildings " . Players can choose to play with both modules as well . The Undermountain module adds a mini - board which provides 3 new locations . The quests involved with Undermountain usually take more resources to complete , but the rewards are greater . The Skullport module contains 2 mini - boards , one with new locations , and one corruption tracker . Corruption is a new resource with this module . It can help , but it can also hurt . The expansion comes in a nice box ( unlike the base game ) and if you remove the insert and put everything in baggies / containers , you can fit everything in the nice new sturdy box .
5 #### The base game is extremely fun and easy to learn , even to teach to non gamers . I usually do n't include expansions when introducing a base game to someone new on a first playthrough , but with this game I absolutely make an exception . This expansion does SO much to enrich the already great experience of the base game , that I would say it is completely necessary to play with the main game . If you have never played lords of waterdeep , you need to , so go buy the main game now ! If you have lords of waterdeep , then you probably already have this in your collection .
5 #### This expansion was fantastic . The new mechanics add a great new set of options to utilize during play and really made games alot closer , as you can utilize the new mechanics to make interesting plays and comebacks . Well worth it for existing players .
5 #### An excellent expansion to Lords of Waterdeep and most importantly it adds a sixth player option to the game .
5 #### I love these expansions . Undermountain contains many big epic quests with high rewards , and encourages generosity when it requires you to place pieces around the board . Skullport is so lovingly tempting with its corruption . Allowing the big plays to come easy with just a small sidenote of a corruption , it can get out of hand depending on how badly you want some stuff . The only downsides are the flipped backs of cards and the differences in card sizes . Not a dealbreaker , but I wish they would modify it match and it would just be more seamless in looking better together with the main game . All in all , each expansion is fun and exciting .
5 #### Our group of friends gather weekly to play board games and the original Lord Of Waterdeep is a favorite with everyone . The more novice gamers find it accessible and fun and the hardcore gamers love the depth of strategy and re playability . Everyone appreciates it 's pacing as well , as it is a fairly quick game even with 5 players . This expansion , Scoundrels of Skullport adds many great new features . It essentially adds two possible new game modes . One simply expands upon the base game , adding more challenging but more rewarding quests , new lord cards , and new buildings . The second part adds the new corruption mechanic which is a lot of fun , and a great way to breathe new life into the game if you 've played it often with the same group . All pieces and packaging are of the same high quality fit and finish of the original game . If you enjoyed the base game , this is a must have expansion , and a great value for the price .
5 #### The Expansions ( 2 in this bundle ) , can be played individually or concurrently allowing players a wider range of options . The inclusion of corruption tokens on one expansion board increase agents advantage but reduce overall points means game scores can be a lot higher than with the base game . While the other is just a mix - up of standard board choices . Added buildings and lords add more variables to the game as well , and can bring new life into what might be getting to be a dull game if played too often . As with the base game , good strategy is needed to take most advantage of the added possibilities .
5 #### Me and my wife play Lords of Waterdeep more than any other game . The expansions have only made it better . We 've enjoyed both expansions and then have played with both combined . Playing with both at once with two people is crazy ... it 's hard to determine a solid strategy ... but it 's a lot of fun . We are so looking forward to playing the expansions with larger groups of people . I 've played a lot of euro - type board games and this is my favorite .
5 #### This expansion pack is a great addition because not only do you get to play with 6 people now if you want you also get new quests that go up to 50 VP in value . I would say it would be nice if the graphics on the cards were easier to distinguish for when you separate them back out , but that is a minor concern compared to the fun it adds .
4 #### This is a really fun expansion to the great Lords of the Water Deep game . I gave it 4 stars because it can get a bit boring after about 7 - 8 games . But it does add to the play in different and fun ways . I find the cards that came with it more entertaining then anything on the board . the concept of skulls ( and negative points ) and derivatives of this is quite interesting particularly at first . You can incorporate this in . I will say though that if you are a savvy group of players you can learn to master this rather fast .
5 #### I have many of the new games that have come out . In fact , a whole wall top to bottom . Out of all those games , my family and friends have played this one more than many of the games we have . I really really love this game ! It is my first pick when people come over to play and they ask what should they play . I recommend this game .
5 #### Big hit for my great nephew ! Fun playing with him every though every turn was " HIS " turn .... LOL
5 #### Purchased as a gift for my great nephew who is fascinated by equipment / trucks / tractors . He just turned 3 and seemed to be excited by the gift at his party . My grandson has enjoyed similar games , and the quality of this one and variety of matches is great and leaves " room to grow " mentally as children age since you can add or take away the numbers of cards / equipment you play with depending on the child 's ability . . Good quality and includes some unusual pieces beyond the typical bulldozer and dump trucks . I would recommend .
5 #### Great memory game for boys who love construction . My grandson ( 3 years ) is a little to young to play the memory game yet , but he loves to look at the cards , sort them etc . The game comes in a nice sturdy box and the cards are good quality too . I play with with only with 10 card sets right now which is more than his ability .
4 #### I have a three year old son and 18 month daughter . Lots of different trucks , even some new ones for my son ( which is saying a lot since he has at least 20 + different books about trucks ) . Cards are board and sturdy so my 18 month can handle them without causing damage . We have to start with 1/2 the pack as there are so many .
5 #### I was looking for a memory game for my 3 year old grandson and tripped across this . I ca n't wait to play it with him on Christmas day . He loves earth moving vehicles . The game pieces are sturdy and the items are labeled-- which is great because I would n't want to confuse a backhoe with a front end loader !
5 #### My son is 2 so a little young for the full game . I pull out 10 or 15 o the tiles and we either play memory which some times he figures it out and other times he does n't .. Which is to be expected . Or else we lay them face up and match that way . I also have him find certain tiles like where is the hard hat . This game is great for expanding their vocabulary ! We talk about what each tile is and he repeats what it is . This game will last many many years and I love how many tiles it comes with . You really can make it a challenging game of memory by using all of the tiles . Great game !
5 #### Okay , I babysit young boys a lot and bring this along . They love to play it , it 's sturdy and has a great box that does n't collapse . I usually end up playing with about 24 to 30 pieces for the 4 year olds and IF I get to select I pick the items that are n't construction vehicles , like the cone , boots , stop sign , gloves etc . Too many kinds of excavators , shovels , rollers etc for me ! But I guess it helps keep the peace since the kids almost always win !
5 #### They r better that I expect it , they r pretty big , an very colorful , and we got then before my daughter 's bday , she love them , thank u
3 #### Wish they were full sheets but still great . My daughter loves stickers
3 #### The stickers are just like in the photo . Very colorful and comes with 5 , long strip of sheets . These are paper stickers and tend to rip off as you peel them off the sheet . What upset me the most is that this sticker pack only cost 1.00 at the POUND store . Which is the same as the $ 1.00 section at Target ! ! The price here is ridiculous .
4 #### They 're nice , big , colorful stickers . You do n't get very many for the price , but it 's hard to find Peppa stickers anywhere else . Shipping took a few weeks as expected .
4 #### The stickers themselves are great . The package comes with 5 sheets that I separated for goody bags . However , each sheet is adhered to a thin piece of cardstock with double sided tape making it time consuming to take off . If not careful you could easily rip the sheet of stickers while removing from packaging . Removed a star simply because of the packaging ; again the stickers themselves are great .
2 #### They are cute , but definitely not worth the $ 6 that I paid for them .
3 #### The stickers were very cute , and my three - year - old daughter love them . But as far as stickers go , they were not so great . The stickers kept separating themselves from the sheet and it sort of made them difficult to peel . Probably would not order ones like this again . But , like I said the stickers were really cute .
5 #### Even bigger than expected my kids and their friends love them
5 #### My daughter loves her stickers ! Awesome seller ! Thank You ! :)
1 #### This says it is 5 SHEETS when in fact it is 5 strips of paper . Definately NOT worth the money . The stickers were hard for the child to remove from the backing as the backing came off of the sheet with the sticker .
5 #### Great gift for our wedding party at our Dr. Who Themed wedding . Everyone loved their gift ! Reasonably priced , and so much fun :-)
5 #### This is a great game for serious game people ! Easy to play and quick to pick up !
4 #### Bought this to play with my 11 - yr old Dr. Who fan . Style of play is similar to Pokemon but much easier to learn . Although it says it is for 2 or more players , in my opinion game play is much better with more than 2 players . We got stuck at times with only two of us playing , although it was still enjoyable . Certainly all of the Dr. Who associations add to the fun for fans of the series .
5 #### My 12 year old daughter 's favorite game . She is a fan of the show but you do n't have to be a fan to play . We like the mechanics of passing cards you do n't use to the another player which is an interesting dynamic . Great game
5 #### Oh this is just so fun for child and story teller . I bought the paperback book , the old lady , and the bean bag animals . I liked this story as a child and remember it making me laugh , and now I can read it to my 2 year old and laugh with her . The doll is just like the book and her mouth is wide and stomach deep enough to fit all the bean bags . The mouth is the only opening so you 'll have to remove the animals through there as well . Although I wish the doll had a velcro opening in her belly to remove the animals . The bean bag animals are n't very creative , just a picture on a piece of cloth that 's cut in near shape of the picture , filled with beans . Overall I 'm very happy and for me it was worth the expense , for everything it came out to $ 34.77
4 #### This is a very cute , well - made doll . Just be advised that you need to purchase the animals ( and book if you want that ) separately .
2 #### It 's a cute doll . I thought she would be bigger and that her " stomach " would be bigger too . It is n't easy to remove animals from the dolls ' mouth .
5 #### I bought this doll for my 4 year old boy and for my class as I am a preschool teacher . It is perfect ! The children love it , you have to by the animals separately and also the book but this trio will last for years and it is always the favorite hands on story for preschoolers . I used to have one in my previous school but it belonged to the school so This time I bought my own set .
3 #### I thought she would be bigger and that her " stomach " would be bigger . I 'm not thrilled about paying as much as I did . It 's a cute doll , though . It 's also really lame that the doll did n't come with the things she ate .
5 #### love this doll and all the stuff she can stuff in her mouth ! ha ha We bought the book that has the image of this particular doll on the front of it and my 3 year old is just mezmerized by how the images match . As we read the story she picks out and stuffs the corresponding item into the lady 's mouth , which just tickles her ? ? ! lol The doll comes with every item in the story : fly , spider , bird , cat , etc ... they do all fit and my daughter thinks it 's fun to put these items in her mouth while counting and then take them out to make sure they are all still there . It 's a nice little before bed treat for us both .
5 #### Really cute doll , fairly good size too . You have to buy the bean filled animals separately , Also bought book to go along with it .
5 #### this was perfect to go with the 7 bean bags , I just wish they were not separate orders .
4 #### I bought this , along with the 7 bean - filled animals that go with it , to go with the book that I bought for my sister - in - law 's baby shower . She loved getting one of my favorite childhood books along with the doll and animals to make it even more fun . A unique gift that no one else thought of . The packaging it came in could have been a little nicer since I was giving it as a gift , but it was n't that big of a concern .
5 #### I love the old lady doll . My granddaughter loves this story and with the book , the animals and the old lady , we will have lots of fun ! I would recommend this doll to anyone .
4 #### My grandsons have enjoyed this during their younger years . 3 - 4 Big pieces make it easy to play with for young hands . Numbers are a an addl feature helping them learn the order up to twenty .
2 #### I am devasted ! ! Got this for Christmas for a grandchild just received it and the box it completely ripped in back ! ! ! NOW what I am not rating for the puzzle but for the packaging ! Will you replace it or send a new one ..........
5 #### I 'm very pleased with this puzzle . First each train car is 98 % complete on each piece . It leaves just a small part of the animal(s ) " missing " which helps the child locate the next piece ( for example , part of the 5th seal is missing on the # 5 train car -- my nephew looked for the seal 's face in order to find the # 6 car as he does n't yet recognize the numerals . The pieces are thick and will last a long time . The pictures are attractive without being too busy although the pics on the higher numbers are not placed for easy counting .
5 #### 5 and 3 year old boys love this puzzle . They do it on the floor several times and count the numbers . It 's cute , they also love trains so the perfect puzzle for them .
5 #### Great puzzle to help a little one learn their numbers ! So helpful that each number is a separate piece . Highly recommended by this K/1 teacher !
4 #### The Alphabet Train was a big hit in our house , and useful for working with letters , so we got this one . My kid has n't picked up all the numbers yet , but so far its been fun .
5 #### My son loves to put this together and take it apart . He loves that he can count the animals or objects on each car to see which one comes next . Only downfall is that its really long and take up a lot of space . We use on a wood floor , I imagine that it would be difficult to keep together on carpet .
5 #### My daughter loves this toy . She makes all kinds of cool tings with it . Its good quality and has a nice heavy feel to it .
5 #### Creative gadget ! Purchased for our 19 year old son and he loves it . He keeps it at his desk and will fidget with it every now and then . Great quality , helpful booklet enclosed . Highly recommend .
5 #### Very fun . The whole family loves this one . Even my 3 year old can put it together and has learned all about magnets because of it . My husband loved it as a stocking stuffer
5 #### Excellent toy . Endless creativity potential . Smart purchase for any age . I mean , it 's a ball made of trianguloid magnets . You simply can not go wrong .
5 #### This is a weird toy ( is it a toy ? ) My child saw this somewhere and wanted it . Santa obliged him . Now the rest of the kids want one too . he magnetic ball can be taken apart and reassembled into different patterns . Surprisingly to me they have a fun time with it . There is n't much to it , but it is unique and still gets played with 6 + months later .
5 #### my 4 year old grandson loves making different things with it . A GREAT learning tool / toy for hands on puzzle solving .
5 #### My second one , this one for my grandsons . I keep one in my office ( I 'm a therapist ) . It 's very soothing and challenging at the same time .
3 #### other brands are better , the design of this brand makes it too easy . the pieces are also smaller than another brand so i would nt give it to a young child , either .
5 #### This contraption is fantastic . The book has some great ideas and such but my son loves to just take it all apart and make different shapes with it . Each piece is outfitted with a positive or negative magnet so they do n't all fit together but it 's fun to get a few and mess around with . It 's been thrown on the floor just in an attempt to reassemble . Truly a fun toy that keeps his hands entertained when he 's thinking .
5 #### I decided that there was no way this would stay together if it were at home around my kids , even though one wanted to get it for another as a birthday present . I talked them into something else , and took this to work . They play with it when they are at the office with me , and I like it when I am on conference calls and things . I do n't get a lot out of the book , but it is entertaining .
5 #### Bought this and the Y - ball for our grandson who likes mazes and puzzles . He absolutely loved them ! Played with them " constantly " for the whole two days he stayed at our house . At first enjoyed trying to build different designs with them but then got the most enjoyment out of rolling the balls across the floor and over and under objects and watching them crash and explode . Never seemed to tire in putting them back together .
4 #### Good product . You can construct a lot of shapes with this product . Good for educational purposes ! ! The only complain is the magnets are slightly weak .
5 #### Our family really enjoyed spending hours competing with each other with this toy . I could n't imagine why they thought it was so fascinating because I do n't do well with these kinds of things , but the others did . In fact , the larger , more expensive Christmas gifts were ignored quite a bit of the time because they could n't stop playing with this .
3 #### " A Creativity Tool for Innovators " is great marketingspeak , but it 's a lie . After making a few patterns over the course of a few days , you and your kids will grow bored by this thing . It 's more like a toy you 'd buy on a lark at a dollar store ; " It looks fun , and it 's only a buck . " At this price range , I expect some longevity or some real true fun , and this thing provides neither . * * * EDIT ( three years later ) * * * -- my two year old boy is now turning five , and he ca n't get enough of this thing , mostly because it 's a BALL THAT " EXPLODES " when you throw it or drop it .
3 #### I know I 'm going against the grain giving this only three stars but it is a little frustrating to work with . I 've had plenty of hands on tactile ' toys ' and this one should have delivered but it really falls short in comparison . The object is to rearrange the pieces to an unlimited amount of variations including ' real ' or abstract shapes . The problem is that the magnets are not really strong enough so they tend to slide around way to much to hold a shape . We have made a bunch of star shapes ( we being my kids age 6 and 11 ) but even they are running out of ideas . The best thing is if you drop the ball , it shatters into 30 pieces . If you like tactile things , I would recommend Bucky Balls ( sometimes known as&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Magnet - Balls - Magnetic - Ball - Puzzle / dp / B003D7CFTQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Magnet Balls - Magnetic Ball Puzzle</a > ) . They are strong and have endless possibilities . I would also recommend&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Tangle - Therapy - by - Tangle / dp / B000F8I5AE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Tangle Therapy by Tangle</a > .
5 #### I 'm a tacto - phile , as well as a magno - phile , and this ' toy ' is an excellent blend of creativity , simplicity and fun ! The look and feel of the individual pyramids is very pleasant , and the fun of being able to take it apart and see what you can create is a blast ! I wish I had two ( or three ! ) One word of warning to parents : Kids will want to play with this . I make it a point to never let my kids play with mine unless I am watching them closely , because the pieces would fit in a mouth , and are pointy enough that they could cause pain if applied incorrectly .
5 #### My kids love this toy . There are so many ways to play with it -- the magnets add an extra dimension to the creativity .
5 #### This is just a fun , creative toy . It starts as a ball and comes apart into mini " pyramid - like " pieces . From here , you can use your imagination and create new objects ( animals , stars , etc . ) . It also has a strangely soothing feel when you are putting it back together . The only drawback is that the magnets could be a little stronger . Sometimes it is hard to get your new creations to stay together because they slip . However , overall this is a really cool toy . Good for kids and adults .
5 #### This game is a lot of fun . My wife and I play with our 11 year old and despite my superior intellect ( kidding ) , everyone has won a couple games . Beyond that , however , these cards can be used for literacy - building and team - building games in the classroom ! You get 118 cards with individual letters or common two - letter combinations ( QU , IN , ER , TH & CL ) with a point value reflecting its use in English words . I ve come up with three other ways to use this deck and I hope to have more to share with my AVID teachers !
5 #### This is a GREAT game for 2 players or more . I ordered it , because I played it and loved it at a friend 's house . If you like Scrabble , you 'll like this game !
5 #### This game is a lot of fun and the price was amazing . I 've seen the same game in stores with a little fancier packaging for three times the price . Great deal
5 #### Good quality cards . Very fun game . Great for all ages over about 8 . We play without scoring with kids , and it 's pretty cut throat for the adult scrabble and boggle fanatics . Really love this game and we play it as a family about 2 - 3 times each week - probably 10 times as much as all our other games . Highly recommend of you like words , spelling , and the strategy of points .
5 #### I love word games , and this is one of my favorites . It 's easy to play with people of all ages !
5 #### A very nice ... and useful book ... for making Quiddler an even more educational card game than it already was ...
3 #### Here is a tip . Toss out the rule about allowing players to use a dictionary . We played one round and felt frustrated because players kept on using archaic words of which they had no idea even existed before they found them in the dictionary . Seriously , it was pathetic . I took some solace in that I won the game without having to lean on a crutch . The game is kind of fun , not as fun as Five Crowns , however . I guess there is some value in improving vocabulary skills .
5 #### Great game for new spellers or struggling ones to build up confidence . Great game for mixed ages . Love it . We bought the original first and it was too hard , then saw this and tried it and the kids love it . All their games are amazing !
5 #### Great family game . Good for a fun night together . Got this for my Scrabble loving brother . He loves this even more .
5 #### My wife and I love this game , which lasts about 20 minutes to a half hour , and is n't as concentration - intensive or as long in duration as Scrabble . The rules are easy to pick up , and it 's a fun game for those who love words . If you 're not a good speller , pass this one up .
5 #### this is a great game for kids . the adults enjoyed it too !
4 #### Fun game . You can make it quick and easy for younger children or make it more complex for older children and adults .
4 #### Love playing Quiddler and this dictionary helps with the words ! A little different to use but had two dictionaries going at last card party . I bought 2 more as gifts as we are all Quiddler players .
4 #### Delighted to have this game , which we have enjoyed playing with friends .
5 #### I bought this for my sixth grade class . They love it ! Is a fun family game for kids around 8 up to adults . Similar to Gin Rummy but with letters instead of suits . Bigger words = more points .
5 #### bought for my grandson who really loves to play this game
5 #### Our family absolutely love this game ! We play it one on one or as a family , sometimes with extended family as well ( aunts , grandparents ) and everyone love it ! Your goal is to create words from your letter cards . Each card is worth a different amount of points and you try to create words that worth the most points . You write down the score of each player and add it at the end to see who won by getting the highest amount of points . It 's easy to understand the rules , so you can get in the game quickly even if it 's the first time you 're playing it . The game can be as short or as long as you want and the kids ( and some adults too ) learn a lot of new words from it . Very enjoyable and highly recommended from ages 8 and up .
5 #### This has been a really fun family game ! We all enjoy word games . This is light enough you can keep the TV on in the background , and chat when not playing , but requires thought and planning - and then some luck ! It does n't take too long either - you can do a quick round and move on to other things if you like .
5 #### Love this game . It 's a family favorite . Bought 2 as a gift for my son and daughter who have their own houses now .
5 #### Quiddler was a surprise game gift that everyone loved to play .
5 #### Just got mine and super happy about it . Quiddler is my family 's favorite game !
5 #### I love regular Quiddler and have bought this for my great niece and nephew . Great for reading and thinking skills . I think they will enjoy playing this with their mom !
5 #### Great game to play as a family . We try to have family night once a week . I will be sad when my kids grow up and there wo n't be anymore game night .
5 #### I really enjoyed this game . It 's fun , and different . It can even be played as a one player , which I like
5 #### I had played this game before so I knew what I was buying . The game belonged to my ex - boyfriend so I decided to buy my own deck . You do n't have to have a huge vocabulary to play this ..... although I am sure it would help .
5 #### We enjoy playing Quiddler very much . The game from Amazon was easy to get and met all of our expectations .
5 #### Great game . We played this game with 4 adults and 4 children ages 7 - 12 . Everyone loved it . We helped the children make works when necessary but I love that this fun game can be educational too .
5 #### The kids and parents loved it . A good learning tool .
5 #### My husband and myself love this game . I am not a good speller and I can play this game and win . It can be a pain at times because of some of the rules but we bend them from time to time ! You can build any where from 2 letter words to 10 depending on the stage of the game you are on . Some times the smaller words will bring the most points ! We have 2 sets now ! I keep one at work to play at lunch . Yes you can play solitaire ! But I play like it 's 4 people playing and I do n't cheat to win a hand . Love it love it love it !
5 #### Have n't played with other people , but I 've been enjoying the solitaire mode of play .
5 #### Received in timely manner and product as described . Grandkids had never played this game but think they will enjoy it .
5 #### Ca n't wait to play this ! Brand new . We played it at a friend 's house and stretched our minds and laughed a lot .
5 #### Again , another game I purchased based off the reviews here at Amazon.com ! This game does not disappoint ! It 's like Scrabble meets Rummy ! Love it . I play this game with all three of my kids ( ages 11 , 9 , 8) and we have fun . Now , there are times they need help spelling a word here and there so I assist when needed . ( would be better to play with all adults - but this is reinforcing their vocabulary and spelling ) I just love this game .
3 #### The directions are convoluted for even me . The kid had no idea how to play through the rules . Ended up just spelling words for points and fun .
5 #### This company makes a number of games . The first one I got was Set . That was great , and so is this . It is sort of like Scrabble with cards , but easier for younger kids to play . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Super fun game ! Our family loves it . Great for 2 + players !
5 #### Fun game ! Took my 8 yr old a little time to accept it , since it 's not as flashy as Mille Bournes Racing Game or even Zeus on the Loose , but now he loves it .
3 #### Like the concept of the game - if you are a wordsmith you will too - but the instructions are vague and not easy to understand . Had to go online to get instructions that made sense .
5 #### real learning tool for kids to have fun at the same time
5 #### on time as described , Iam happy with it and would recommend it to others
5 #### My husband , my 7 1/2 yr old daughter and I LOVE to play this game !
5 #### Teaches your kids a fun way to read . My kids have never had so much fun learning ! ! ! !
5 #### A wonderful and fun game and could be so helpful with today 's generation and their poor spelling skills . I HIGHLY recommend . Young and old alike . As young as a smart 8 year old can participate . :-)
5 #### Fun family game . Gets you thinking . Maybe harder gor younger children . Has instructions on how to play solitare too .
5 #### This game is a lot of fun . I like it better than Scrabble because you can make any word you have the letters for , whereas Scrabble only allows you to play a word if there is a place on the board to put it . I 've learned some new words from playing this game so much . The only annoyance is the need to shuffle the discard pile 3/4 of the way though a game because there are no more cards left in the deck .
5 #### I purchased this junior version to use as a fun learning tool while homeschooling kindergarten . It is terrific ! We play almost every day , often at my son 's request . I do help him a lot but the more we play , the more words he is able to construct on his own . The cards are colorful and bright , and they have pictures and word suggestions that we have found to be very helpful . I highly recommend it .
5 #### This is a fun way to play a less intensive game of Scrabble and it travels well . We are going to play it with our grandkids as it is good practice for constructing three letter words . Of course by the end of the game you have 10 letters to use so that some words may be longer than 3 letters , but still can be if that is the measure of your vocabulary . A great game for kids and adults alike .
4 #### Relative to the number of cards it came with , the box was huge and had a lot of wasted space . Not sure what the reason is for designing it that way , but the game is really fun !
5 #### My family really enjoy this card game . It 's a card version of Scrabble and is a faster playing game then Scrabble . All - in - all a great family game !
5 #### On vacation my husband and I played Quiddler with friends . It was so much fun we decided we wanted to have it . I ordered the game on Amazon and after not playing it for a couple of months we opened the game with our neighbors a couple of days ago . We quickly remembered how to play and 2 hours later had played 2 games and laughed a lot . We anticipate our next game .
5 #### This game was a blast . We had tried Quiddler Jr , , and had a blast with that , so moving up to the next version only made sense . We found that the game was a ton of fun and that you were definitely challenged to think on your feet and come up with words that will bring you to victory . This is a game that you will bring out over and over again . You will find that it will bring you closer together , encourage a broader vocabulary and spend some true quality time together ! * I received this for review - all opinions are my own *
5 #### My students have a great time with this game and love it . It is good for students needing help with English as well as students who are fluent . This is the first time my students happily look up words in the dictionary . Good for math too since they have to add up points on each card for the word them make . Fun game
4 #### My grandson is in kindergarten so this turned out to be just a bit premature for him - the hint words on the cards were just confusing to him - but he loved keeping score with the " coins " . I think I 'll put the game away until he 's in 1st grade and knows how to spell more words - and am sure it 'll be a hit then .
5 #### Great fun and addictive - can play for hours or just a bit . Enjoyed with two other players as much as with three other players - which made it much more difficult .
5 #### I am always looking for a great family game , and while I have tried other Set Games in the past , I had heard great things about Quiddler . This is the Junior version of Quiddler and it intrigued me , as I was wondering whether my seven year old would be able to play this by herself or not . In playing this , the cards are wonderfully made with great imagery and graphics and many colors that truly drew my youngest daughter in from the beginning . I came to find that she did need some help at first as only being in first grade had some limitations in regards to the breadth of her vocabulary . As we played though she got better and better and after a few rounds she had the hang of it . By the end of the game she was asking to play it again . This game really challenges you to think and be creative with your words as well as encourages your kids to learn more and more words in the end . This is a great game that I would encourage for all families ! * I received this for review - all opinions are my own *
5 #### I love this game . If you are a word game person , this is a wonderful game for a small group . At least six can play together . You make words with your letter cards . First three cards , then 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 with each round of cards dealt . You can earn bonuses for longest word , most words per hand . Tricky letters such as the QU combination have higher point value . It is a fairly fast moving game and lots of fun for word geeks like me . There is also a way to play it ala solitaire , but I have not tried that .
5 #### THIS IS A FUN CARD GAME FOR KIDS AND ADULTS .
4 #### got this for my family as a gift and they seem to be enjoying it , I have not played it myself .
5 #### Super fun game , even better if you know more words than your opponents
5 #### If you love words and forming letters into combinations of words this is a wonderful game . Not only is it fun in a group , but I have played the solitaire version with the instructions they provide inside . It is just like solving the daily Quiddler word sets they provide in some newspapers . They suggest that you are allowed to use a dictionary if it is not your turn . This is not allowed in Scrabble and I am not sure it should be allowed here . Nevertheless , use a Scrabble dictionary if you decide to play this way . fact that you start out small with only three cards in first round and increase a card each round gives younger children a chance to play as a family game . Cards are colorful and durable . In fact I would recommend you use a card shuffler with this game since the cards are quite stiff and number 108 in number . If you are a fan of jumble words this also gives you an edge in this game . Instructions provided are very concise yet clear .
5 #### We have had this game for over 4 years now and we absolutely love it ! We are a family of 6 and play this game at least once a week . At first only the older kids could play , the younger kids played with an adult on a " team " . Now we are all readers and everyone is able to play ! This game is a lot of fun , such a small amount of money for so many years of fun !
5 #### This game is a blast if you enjoy word puzzles and such . Competitive gameplay that 's great for just two or for larger groups . The basic goal is to use up all of your cards in each hand to spell words of three or more letters each -- the catch being that each round you add another card to your hand , so you have that many more letters both to use and to puzzle over how to use . My wife and I love this for date nights at home .
5 #### My husband and I LOVE this game . It 's easier and less intense than Scrabble . We wore out the first deck of cards and we 're busy using a second deck . We actually play 20 rounds - the first 10 have no bonuses and then the 11 - 20 rounds have bonuses . By the end of the game , with 20 cards in our hands , we often use the chair next to us to keep track of everything !
3 #### Okay game , but not nearly as much fun as I thought it would be . Quiet game good for all ages , just not exciting . Good for camping .
4 #### Fun easy game to play . We did find that the rounds went really fast , so my family altered the rules to make it more like a Phase-10 game with words . So , overall a good game to have on hand -- can be really easy or made more difficult .
5 #### Nice card game variation of Scrabble and Bookworm Adventures . Family age ranges from 30s to 80s . Game plays longer than expected with them as the forced draws and math can add time , which is fine . Took me a while to read the instructions , but everything made sense once I dealt the cards . Fantastic gameplay and it 's very fun . Unlike Scattergories , random chance plays a huge part , but there is strategy with the bonuses .
4 #### This is a deceptively simple word game that may enjoyed across many skill levels and ages . My kids who are teen and pre - teen play it and I 've used it during sessions or groups with individuals diagnosed with Autism . It 's a lot of fun and easy to learn . It is also very portable which is good for family trips or use in multiple locations .
5 #### Make words with three letters , then four , then more . The game is like Five Crowns but it uses letters instead of numbers and suits . It is fun and challenging .
5 #### This game is a lot of fun . There is very little set - up . Games go relatively quickly . We play it together as a family . My 12 year old step - daughter loves it .
3 #### cards do n't seem like thell hold up for ang length of time
4 #### Recommened by a friend but have n't been able to use it much
5 #### Play this game a lot with our kids ages 7 - 20 . You get cards and have to build words . Very very simple to explain and play . Not a ton of rules . What I love about this is that many ppl can play ( we have a large family ) and in each round you get more and more cards . My kids do n't like to read and definitely do n't like word games and yet they enjoy this one a lot . We played last night and when it was over they wanted to play another game but we said another time . Score big time for Quiddler ! ! !
5 #### This is a heck of a fun game if you like word games . It 's like Scrabble without having to set up the board and flip all those tiles . I have an excel spreadsheet that can be used as a scorecard . Has places for up to 6 players . Post a comment to this comment with your e mail address and I 'll send the spreadsheet to you .
5 #### Great game ! One of my family 's favorites . It 's also educational for the kids .
5 #### Great card game for the whole family . A lot of fun to play with the kids and their friends , too . A fun way for the kids to learn to spell without even realizing it .
5 #### Set Enterprises INC is the genius behind Quiddler Jr , an educational game that is so much fun kids do n't realize they are learning . I think my favorite kinds of games to play are word games and I have been looking for word games to play with my son now that he is learning to read . When I found out Set Enterprises INC was making Quiddler Jr I was ecstatic ! Quiddler Jr is a word game for kids or for really young kids an alphabet or phonics game to start with . Diva plays with the game as an alphabet refresher and for learning letter sounds and sometimes just to identify and help say the names of things on the cards . She has a slight speech delay so practicing all sounds helps . My Gentleman is just barely learning to read so we play as a phonics refresher and a sight word refresher but having to find the right letters and sounds that make a sight word . Ill try to explain but first Ill explain how to play with those who can read but even before that I will tell you a little about the box and all that . Because that is important information too . For more on my review and how I adjust Quiddler Jr visit http://mygeeklings.com/quiddlerjrreview/
5 #### Very interesting game . Give it a try , you wo n't get bored .
4 #### A friend told me that she played this when she was young , and could n't find it anywhere . I asked if she had heard of Amazon.com .
5 #### We have not played it yet but I was very surprised at the huge size of the BOX ! ! ! ! ! Pretty big to take with us on vacation . It would have been good to give me the exact dimentions of the box before I ordered it ! ! !
5 #### My 7 year old grandson plays this game in school and requested it for Christmas . It is currently one of his favorite games .
5 #### This game is addictive , and our family members who ca n't compete at Scrabble or Boggle sometime win this game , and they often request to play it . My husband and I play at least 2 games of this every evening . It takes about 10 - 12 minutes for the two of us to play a game .
4 #### Quiddler is a very attractive game and if you like Scrabble this is a different way to play it . A challenge for the words lover . Good for smart children as well .
3 #### It is a little confusing to use at first . We will try to use it again and reread the directions .
4 #### A fun twist on word games . This game is good for all ages . Even those not that into games have found this one fun . A good family game .
3 #### Did n't find the instructions to be very clear . Have heard good things about this word game and plan to enjoy playing it when instructionbs are deciphered .
5 #### Awesome game ! We got this for Christmas after playing it at a relatives house . We have so much fun with it ... even my kids love this game and they have fun trying to figure out ways to use all the x 's and z 's . Very fun family game for those who can spell :)
5 #### Although I read the rules that came with this game , my son and I made some rules of our own , that I think are most appropriate to his level of current knowledge , and that I think can best help him learn from playing with these cards . If we only have 20 minutes , that 's enough time to have some fun with this .
5 #### Cards have great art work - good game for young spellers or not so wordy person - so , best if played with same educational level
4 #### This is a really fun game . It 's easy to pick up , and easy to teach . The cards feel pretty solid in your hand , too . We 've had to put a time limit on turns though , otherwise people can end up pondering their options for way too long .
5 #### Great game . A lot of fun , and simple rules . Very enjoyable if you are a word - y person . Get this game !
5 #### and Quiddler ! Perfect afternoon or evening . I 've enjoyed this game [ a LOT ] with just one person and a group . It is very adaptable , like Bananagrams . So , as much fun as WORD WITH FRIENDS is a great time , try this in reality ! ! It 's a challenge , if you let it be !
4 #### Bought this as a prize for an event . I personally have not played it but the recipient was please to win it and had played before .
5 #### I bought this for my sister 's birthday and we played it . Very easy to learn and a lot of fun . I will now buy one for our home .
5 #### I sent this game to my nephews and nieces in Germany for the rainy days during the summer vacation . They loved it ! They did n't mention a language problem , so it must be a good choice even for non English speaking countries .
5 #### I have a group of ladies who come to my home almost once a week to play Quiddler . We 're all senior citizens and feel it helps keep us sharper . It 's also good for children ( ten and older ? ) to re - think letter order . I do like this game very much .
5 #### We loved this game - - so much so , we purchased the deluxe set also . By switching the new cards from the Deluxe set and placing them in the regular set , we now have a great gift for another couple to enjoy !
5 #### A friend introduced us to Quiddler , and we 've introduced it to other friends . I like a lot that we can play with kids -- they like it and although their vocabularies may not be as extensive as some adults ' vocabularies , the kids are really quick to see possibilities that some adults miss -- and it works for parties of 2 to 8 . Easy to learn and easy to score and it 's not endless ( like Monopoly ) .
5 #### I was introduced to Quiddler in Italy and I am hooked . It is one of our favority family games . You must add it to your game collection .
4 #### We have really enjoyed this new game . Even the teenagers want to play . Great fun for family night or game night with friends .
5 #### This is such a fun game . It is like Scrabble and Rummy combined . We ca n't stop playing it . I would recommend this game to any word builder enthusiast !
5 #### Our family loves this game . We have worn a few out . It 's fun and quick . Scrabble can tend to get long and boring , especially with several players . This game goes more quickly , but is still mentally stimulating . I think it lends itself better to fun interaction .
2 #### We love " SET " and were excited to play " Quiddler . " We found the rules to be absurdly complex . We also found that playing by the rules was not much fun . Just to explain - Quiddler is just a deck of cards with letters and point values on them ( and they are beautifully illustrated ) - it 's a no brainer that you can just deal out cards and see who can make the most words , or the highest point words - it 's basically like a deck of Scrabble cards . And , the game is fun if you play this way . For us , the problem was trying to follow the written directions / rules included with the game - we found them to be absurdly complicated and really not that fun . We wound up just playing by our own rules . We enjoyed it mildly , but would probably rather play Bananagrams or Scrabble . This was only our first time playing so , if our opinion changes , I 'll update this review . For now though , it 's a weak 2 stars .
5 #### My family played this game at a reunion and it was a blast so we ordered us our own game . Played it while traveling on the trains through Europe and loved it . Also played it with friends who loved it so much I gave it to them for Christmas . This game is a blast and will make you think . So much better than playing Scrabble ... why do it with cards
5 #### I enjoy this game a lot . But I have to admit that among our friends I 'm one of the few . A lot of people get frustrated with their inability to make words with the cards they end up with . I enjoy the challenge though . I also like the change between rounds with the differing number of cards .
4 #### I 've now had this game for years and it continues to be one of the favorites within the household and among the gaming groups I play with . Particularly enjoyable for those who also enjoy word games in general , and in particular a good game to introduce to Scrabble fans who may not have experience with many / any other word games . If there is a flaw it 's that outcomes tend to be a bit reliant on one 's initial draw - it 's common to not make it around for even a whole round before someone is able to " lay down . " That could be a plus , though , if you prefer games that have a fast pace . And in any case is still a test of skill with creating words given limited resources .
5 #### We love Quiddler . It is a nice two person game but can be played with more players . Being a game playing family , it was hard once we became empty nesters to find something to play for just us two . It is not a long game . It is not a complicated game . It is just a simple fun word game . We have given this game as a gift to all of our adult children , added it to a few wedding gifts and have brought it to people 's houses as a hostess gift . It is a great thing to bring along on trips .
5 #### We love this game ! We play it at home with the children & at church with the ladies ... this is a great , fun game for all ages ! !
5 #### This is one of those games that keeps coming out at parties again and again . It 's quick and easy to set up and the rules are not complicated . The play goes quickly but fun enough to puzzle your mind and make you laugh . It 's easy for most age groups to play , and not slow and hard like scrabble can sometimes get . VERY FUN ! !
5 #### I had played this game before and decided to get my own . The game is very easy to learn and is quick - playing . No chance to get bored ! Have not played it with younger children yet , but if they have basic reading skills it would be simple for even them . I 'm a pretty competitive game player and Quiddler definitely provides plenty of opportunity for that . Would recommend this if you 're into word games .
5 #### This card game is a very educational game for our grandchildren . We enjoy it very much . Have lots of fun playing the game with our schol age grandchildren .
5 #### I love pulling this out when I have a bunch of friends over ! It 's great since you can have 1 - 8 players . It 's hilarious when people try to justify a made - up word they want to play ! Great for family gatherings too since it 's fun for adults or kids !
5 #### This is a great game and can be played with a wide range of ages and spelling abilities . I highly recommend it !
5 #### I bought this for the kids for Christmas , but my husband and I play more than anyone . We usually play , just the two of us , after the kids go to bed . It 's good fun . The kids enjoy the game , too , but are n't as avid as we are . Then we bought Four Crowns and Set . We play them all , but Quiddler is our favorite .
5 #### This game is very fun . Takes some thinking and that makes things interesting . I feel it 's a little overpriced , even on sale , because it 's basically just 2 decks of cards .
5 #### As I noted in my title , I think that 's the best way to describe this game . Letters that are more difficult to use have higher point values , though there are some " Qu " cards vs. just a " Q " card , but that also makes a difference in points . It 's quick to play , easy to catch on to and very portable . Scrabble is one of my favorite games , but takes seemingly forever to play - this provides a very enjoyable word game experience .
2 #### The only interaction is that during your play / turn you get to chance to choose from the discard pile and only the card that the person before discarded . It 's also too easy to make words and go out , two rounds is the norm ; and the larger the word made means nothing extra . The high review average for this game says something about the people posting reviews in general .
5 #### We have 8 children so we look to buy games that many people can play and different age groups . This game covers it . It is educational and fun . It has a competive edge . You spell words with the cards that you are given . The first round you get 3 cards , 2nd round you get 4 cards , and so on until you have 10 cards . The younger children have just as much of a chance to win because you can spell small or big words . We have almost wore this set of cards out . It is small and compact and can be played just about anywhere .
5 #### I bought this game for my 12 yr . old grandaugher . So far we have not used it , so I ca n't say how much she likes it . It looks like it will be fun though and educational .
5 #### Easy to play and understand , this word game is great for the " spellers " in your family . My 7 & 8 year olds found it a little frustrating once we got up beyond 6 letter words . However , my 10 year old loves this game . I am sure you could make many variations using this card deck .
5 #### Played this at my son and daughter - in - laws , liked it so well had to find it and buy it .
4 #### This is a great game to learn how to spell and increase your vocabulary - both adults and kids .
5 #### I had read the reviews prior to the purchase . Considering this is an award winning game , I was sure it would be a good buy . It is a good gift for kids who love words and a first fun game with words before graduating to the Scrabble . Personally , I think it is more fun than the Scrabble for 7 year olds . The 7 - 8 year olds I bought this game loved it . I got two of them from Amazon . Fabulous gift !
5 #### We play Quiddler several times per week . We play it after a hard work day . We play it whenever we are tired . We play it anytime that we are n't interested in or ca n't agree on television . ( You 'll actually be able to downgrade your cable connection , just because " Quiddler " is more fun , relaxing , and entertaining . ) A good raucous game of " Quiddler " is pretty quiet . You 'll be too busy checking spellings in your dictionary , switching cards around to stimulate new words into your brain , be anticipating the next possible letter that you might draw , making decisions , and plotting your strategy . But best of all , this is a game that a person of 12 , 30 , 50 , 80 , 90 , or a 100 years old can all play together . Everybody can win . Everybody has fun . And everybody will have more energy when it is over than when they started . You might want to maintain your health , so that you can be your best at " Quiddler " . It will show in your score . One Tip , the game changes in speed and enjoyment according to the number of players that you have . I like 3 players , but two is pretty fine also . 4 is ok , but I want to break out a second card set and play two games at once if there are 6 of us . Have fun .
5 #### Had never heard of this game but after reading other reviews decided to buy it and give it a try . Lot 's of fun to play , game is fairly short so you 're not stuck playing it forever either .
5 #### This game is great ! Both my 5 year old and my 15 year old play this ( together ) . The educational value , along with the fun , make this a must have game !
5 #### What a great way to keep my son learning both in school and out . He introduced our family to this game after playing at school during indoor recess . We like the way it helps build vocabulary for the younger ones and stretches our strategy skills for the older ones . You try to find long words or multiple words using the cards you have with each letter being worth points . The longer you play , the more cards you get in each round . Board games take up so much space , so it 's nice to have a small deck of cards to pull out of a drawer with the same impact on fun ( if not more ) .
5 #### What a great idea ! I love Scrabble , but even in the magnetic portable versions , it 's not quite as portable as I 'd like . Cards are much easier to carry and there 's less likelihood of losing a card from a deck than a letter from Scrabble . Both the multi - player and the Solitaire options of this game are a lot of fun . Plus , there 's excellent educational value in both learning to spell and strategize . I 'm hoping the company brings out a version of this game for my iPhone . It 's a lot of fun and I enjoy the different challenge . Rebecca Kyle , February 2009
5 #### Games with our family and even games with friends have become very competitive . Through 8 rounds each player must utilize as many of the cards in his hand as he can by making words out of them . This is basically like scrabble in your hand , but you have to try to use all of your letters at once instead of in individual turns and you do not play off words made by other players . You are on your own to turn your cards into words . It 's a fun game that can be played for hours . I will admit that when we play we keep a dictionary nearby for help . Cheating ? Maybe . But it makes the game more fun . And it is always funny when you get to use a word you learned playing Quiddler and you get to laugh when you remember how you learned it . When my family gets together Quiddler comes out of the box . We do n't have anyone younger than 23 at this point . I am not sure this game would be fun to play across generations when younger people were involved . The gaps in vocabulary may be to wide . But we have a good time when we play . Our vocabularies are all equally small ! ( Except Mom 's ; she always wins . )
5 #### I bought this card game mostly because of the great reviews it received from other customers . I was not disappointed . My 10 year old son and I have tons of fun playing this game , along with Five Crowns , which we bought previously . If you like word games like Boggle , I would highly recommend this card game .
5 #### We have been playing Quiddler for years and are always introducing friends and family to this fun game . I purchased 4 to give out for Christmas gifts . Even sent one to Italy this year . It 's a nice balance of luck and skill . If you like scrabble , you 'll like Quiddler . It 's a shorter , less intense game and helps everyone work on word skills .
5 #### Quiddler is like scrabble with cards . educationally fun for the whole family as long as you can spell 3 - 5 letter words .
4 #### This is a fun game . When we played on Thanksgiving with about 5 of us and had a great time . I plan on playing again at Christmas with the family .
5 #### I received this at my last birthday party and we had 7 adults willing to try it out . Took a while to play , well over an hour , but it was a lot of fun for everyone I think . Not sure about all the rules ... we collectively thought the " can only use dictionary when it is not your turn " made it too easy for folks to hog the help . It feels like a cross between Scrabble and cribbage .
4 #### This is a fun game . The rules are similar to Gin -- get each card in your hand into a straight before your opponent does and you win . But instead of suits and numbers each card has a letter or pair of letters , and the goal is to make words . The first hand is 3 cards , the second hand is 4 cards , etc ... on up to 13 cards . I like this game because unlike Scrabble , the person with the amazing vocabulary does n't always win , because several short words are just as effective in using up your cards as one long word . ( In fact , you get a 10 point bonus for either longest word OR most words ) . So my 8 year olds are n't outgunned by their word - loving elders . As a nice plus , the art work on the cards themselves is well done . The only minus is that the deck is double sized ( 110 cards ) and so shuffling is a bear . Would also have been nice if they included a container that held the whole deck ( instead it comes with a tray that has slots for 2 half decks . )
5 #### For those who enjoy stretching their verbal abilities a little bit and doing puzzles , Quiddler is a great addition to the games closet . It is a quick learn , easy to play , and more accessible and portable than most other word games . Easy enough for children , clever enough for adults .
5 #### I was pleasantly surprised by this game . We broke this out at our holiday party . A half a dozen people who had never played Quiddler before sat down , learned the rules in about two minutes and really enjoyed the game . Then , when those people got up to socialize , a half dozen more people who had never played Quiddler before sat down in their places . They learned the rules in two minutes and really enjoyed the game . That says it all .
5 #### While I have always enjoyed board games , word games specifically have remained challenging for me . I refuse to play Scrabble with my husband , as his skills are superior to mine and it is intimidating to play with him . Hooray , Quiddler has given me an edge into what I term as word games . I only have to be concerned about the cards in my hand , while playing attention to the discard/ draw deck - easy verses the interconnectivity of letters on a board which only multiply . Each player starts with 3 cards during the first round and the number of cards dealt increases by one in subsequent rounds . The game seems to become more challenging in later rounds when you have more cards in your hands and are trying to create words and " go out " . Enjoyable with two or more players !
5 #### This is like a Scrabble game , but with cards . It 's great fun for all ages , because the first hand is dealt with 3 cards and you have to make a 3 card word . Then with each successive hand you made a 4 card word , 5 card word , etc . Because there are several 2 letter cards , these words can actually be 1 , 2 or 3 letters more than the card count . It becomes more challenging when you get to the 8 and 9 card words , but that just makes the game more fun . Quick paced .
5 #### This is is FUN and EXCELLENT to play ! ! ! ! ! It is like scrabble but with playing cards . This makes it easy to transport . The pictures on the cards are fun to look at at you can tailor this game for younger players by spelling simplier words . We 've had lots of fun learning how to spell words and challenging some of the stranger words we spell . ( My friend even looked in the dictionary for some ideas to use for the harder letters like X , Q , and Z ) . You can get points for having the longest word or the most words and the letters you use to spell the words and you can play with just two players . It 's fun and fast to play , highly recommended .
5 #### Picked up the card game this weekend , have been playing the Quiddle daily puzzle ( solitaire ) online at [ ... ] for several weeks . We played several hands last night . All I need now is a new dictionary !
5 #### We love this game ! The cards are beautifully designed with Celtic calligraphy , and the game is clever . You play a total of eight hands in which you progressively get dealt more cards , until you reach ten . The challenge is to make words ( short or long , it does n't matter ) out of the letters in your hand . You have to use all of the letters in your hand and discard one card to go out . After that , each player has one more opportunity to make words . Then , points are tallied . This game is different every time we play it . We are constantly surprised at the great words we make . This game would appeal to card game lovers , word lovers , and strategy lovers . It would also be a good game for youngsters , as they can use their existing vocabulary ( and maybe even win ! ) , expand it , and manipulate it to its fullest . As one of our more simple games , I know this one will be a favorite for years to come !
5 #### This is the game where Scrabble meets Rummy , with a touch of Hooked on Phonics thrown in for good measure . Quiddler is certain to entertain you for hours . This game will help sharpen your vocabulary skills in a short period of time . The game progresses from 3 card hands to 10 card hands , and point increase accordingly . You have to constantly be thinking of words and new words as the play continues . Once you start playing you start thinking , a refreshing change in a game . Quiddler is a true family game game that will certainly challenge even the smartest . You can take this game on the road , camping or even flying and have a great time . For those on a price consciuos budget , this game fits right in . About the only drawback is the fact that once you discard the card is gone . I think adding a " rummy " like rule of taking all the cards might add for more competition and higher scores . overall this game is sure be a party favorite .
5 #### I bought this card game for my mom for Christmas . Everyone in my family loves it , from my 10 year old son , to my 73 year old Dad . My mom and dad play it every night of the week now . They 've never done anything like that before . Dad always got impatient with scrabble and other word games because they take a long time . This game is fast paced and lots of fun . I 'm on the web site right now , buying another deck for my brother and one to have at our home too .
4 #### My kids love this game and so do I. The best thing about this game is that using little words is all right so all ages and vocabulary can play together . IN fact my 8 years old whips my 11 year old all the time . I have also played this with adults and enjoyed it immensely . We did add one rule when playing with my young kids ... If you want someone to help you after someone goes out , you can ask and if that person helps you , he gets 5 points . I also limit my vocabulary to words my kids do or should know when playing with them .
5 #### This game is lots of fun for almost all ages !
5 #### Great game - pay attention to the age range . I did n't . I was buying for a 10 year old spend the night party and accidentally got the adult version . My fault . But still a game the girls can play just probably not as fun as the kid version .
4 #### This is a fun game for a mom meet up night with a few bottles of wine involved . It 's great for getting to know people you do n't know well or think you know well . Super fun !
3 #### I got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband for us to play . I thought it would be a thought provoking game where we would discuss the question , but instead found we would just ask it , answer it and move on . Probably more our fault than the game but does n't really give us much of a sense of " fun "
5 #### really fun game for cheap . fast shipping . Also good conversation starter
5 #### My daughter and I already played this game by making up questions of our own ... So I was excited to see the actual card game on Amazon because we like the game and after a while it gets a little difficult to think up new questions . The game comes with 160 " would you rather " questions and two choice chips . There are two game play options . I will share Game Option # 1 : Each player draws one question card . The youngest player goes first . Read a " would you rather " question to the group . Secretly make your choice by hiding the appropriate Choice Chip inside your closed fist ... Blue chip # 1 is for the first scenario and Red chip # 2 is for the second scenario . One at a time ... each player then guesses what you choose . After all players have made their prediction , you ( the reader ) reveal your choice by showing the chip in your hand . Each player who guesses correctly is awarded a " Would You Rather " Question Card from the deck . You win after you successfully collect 5 " Would You Rather " Question Cards . Example of a question : Would you rather fall from 30 feet into a briar patch OR climb up a 30 foot wall covered with thorny stems ? Great for a kids slumber party , birthday , long car rides , etc ... It can be quite hilarious at times !
5 #### Funny as hell . We had hours of fun . Good stuff for parties .
3 #### ehhh . Played this as soon as the girls opened it for Christmas . I think we had fun for a little bit , but the newness wore off quickly on this game . Good thing it was cheap !
4 #### I got same game but for 4 $ somewhere else this price is way to high for a card game . My 4yr old do n't mind the game . He says its OK .
3 #### fun concept . Game gets old fast as there are not a lot of cards and the ideas are so outlandish , they are easily remembered from one game to the next . It is quick and easy for many ages .
5 #### Great conversation piece ! My daughter uses it with her " little sister " and with her friends . Some real ' thinkers ' in there !
5 #### WE NEED TO LAUGH MORE IN LIFE .. DON'T TAKE LIFE SO SERIOUSLY ... THERE 'S A NERD IN ALL OF US .... FUN GAME ... WE USE THIS SO MUCH THE CARDS ARE BENDING IN HALF ...
3 #### Ehhh .... fun but only about 50 % of them were worth talking about .
4 #### really fun and awesome topics and love how they rate the embarrising to mind complex to random not very manny cards included though
5 #### Purchased for my 10 year old grandchild . Opens communication , fun and silly , raises some ethical questions too !
3 #### 3 - 1/2 stars . I bought these cards on a whim for a dinner party , that actually ended up being cancelled do to storms . Later I would discover this is n't the sort of question an answer game you wish to play while eating or drinking because of the hazards of choking . Because of laughing and maybe some gagging if you have a weak constitution more than once I asked what , was that ? Unsure that I heard the question right . It 's an okay .
4 #### Cute card game , great for traveling with teens or other adults . We travel by car a lot and this game is small enough to keep in the glove box and have on hand when the boredom sets in .
5 #### This is just such a fun game . Our kids have enjoyed this game for a long time and it never gets old . We play it in the car even without the cards to help us . Gets the imagination going !
3 #### Bought this for a 17 year old girl . Cards are probably more appropriate for tweens or younger teens , esp with today 's technology , these cards just did n't hold an older teens interest .
5 #### While on vacation my kids ' got hooked on the Would You Rather Questions that we found . So we got the card game for home to play as a family . It 's fun to play with the whole family !
1 #### very small print . can hardly read the cards not very fun . i do n't suggest you buy it . wish it was better
5 #### At our house we love to play games . We added this to our collection and it has been a hit so far ! My kids love to play it .
4 #### This is a really fun conversation starter , especially on car rides . When we started playing it , we put the little tokens back in the box and never looked at them again . We found it a lot more fun to just ask and laugh at the responses and justifying why you would pick one over the other . Our games usually wandered off the cards whenever someone thought of something , but if you were stuck you could use the cards . I would recommend a purely cards - only version , no tokens or ' rules ' just give us the scenarios .
3 #### We played this game as a family over Thanksgiving . There should be a way to randomize which question is asked off every card . Otherwise , what happens is children in the 8 - 11 year old age range ask all the questions that have to do with nudity and/or bodily functions . The fun quickly pales for adults . If we were playing it again , we would probably set up a randomization system -- colored straws or colored disks to draw , and then ask the question . Some of the discussion is fun , and I think some of the value of playing with a family is that older people can sort of show younger people how decisions can be complicated .
1 #### One of my students said he loved this game , so I bought it for my son . I did n't realize that there were two versions of it - one for 7 + and this one for ages 12 + . The 12 + game has a LOT of pretty gross questions in it . None that I would use with a student or want my children exposed to . There are a lot of other games out there that are a LOT more " mature " and are also very fun . the 7 + version is o.k . still a few gross questions but not as many nor as detailed as the 12 + version . The " tag suggestions " state " good fun " , " family game " and " silly " - none of which I would categorize this game .
5 #### This is a game he and his friends play all the time , but without cards , so he loved the option of showing his friends , look this is a real game .
4 #### Gave to an 8 year old . Four adults played it with him . We all had fun . Did not play card game , we took turn asking questions .
5 #### this game is so much fun with the whole family
5 #### Some are dumb , some are gross but exactly what it says it is : a bunch of questions where you have to pick what you 'd rather do . I keep it in the car for road trips .
2 #### Some of these questions were very disgusting and not appropriate . i bought these for vactaion with a 46 year old , two 9 year olds , two 11 year olds , a 76 year old , a 51 year old , a 47 year old and a 45 year old . overall really did n't like it
5 #### My 9 and 8 year - olds liked this activity on a recent road trip . They are boys , so the gross ones were their favorite . They even started coming up with some " would you rather"s on their own . It was a nice break from their screens !
5 #### great game for kids and parents alike to play together . really alot of fun to use . makes ya think out of the box . great product .
5 #### Fun and easy card game for road trips . Entertaining for the whole family
3 #### PLayed on bus trip .. KInda boring . Not especially for adults , i guess .
4 #### THis is a fun little game that gets kids ( every age ) thinking !
1 #### Horrible card game , was n't fun . Highly predictable . Do n't waste your money .
2 #### This game sounds fun but my teenager hated it and the preteens who played with us got bored of it quickly . The questions are appropriate for kids but really dull for anyone ages 10 + .
4 #### exactly as expected . Compact enough to take out with us .
3 #### The games is better for a younger age set . Played it after Thanksgiving dinner at my parents and they just did n't enjoy it . I thought okay .
4 #### This is good for laughs , on a car ride etc . Takes up little space in the car and is n't an electronic device . Win - win .
1 #### Sadly , this game had questions that were actually too gross to answer , so we were unable to play the game after about five minutes . And I thought my kids had an ultra silly sense of humor , but this game took it farther than even they thought was funny .
5 #### My son loves this game . We do n't play it as you 're supposed to , but we like to read them to each other . Very kid friendly and funny for adults too .
3 #### It 's an ok game . Once you 've played they really ca n't do it a second time because they 've already been through the cards .
5 #### My granddaughter loves it , I find it rather gross , but it 's for kids , not grownups .
5 #### Enjoyed playing this with the family . The kids like to read the questions while we are making dinner , etc .
3 #### Its a bit crazy but does make you think- I use it with teens who do n't talk too easily .
5 #### Great game for the entire family , and portable enough to be a " travel " game in the car . Great fun for EVERY age .
5 #### Great game to play as a family ! We play in the car and it keeps the kids busy and thinking !
5 #### my kid and I played this on our car trip . Loved it !
3 #### It 's a good game for a 7 year old grand - child who loves to play board games and cards . Easy to travel with .
3 #### I wish that the individual compartments could not come apart . It should just be one piece and not 3 , that way you do n't need to keep holding them together with the rubberband . It just makes it kind of inconvenient .
4 #### A little smaller than I expected , plastic boxes , easy to open and handle for a child .
5 #### Great product ! ! Fantastic quality and good size ! ! My children are very excited to start saving there money ..
5 #### This jar is a sweet addition to teaching our daughter about money . We love that it is color coded so she can put the color with the action .
3 #### We love the concept and it 's worked as far as teaching my daughter the basic idea of Saving , Spending and Sharing , but I think a little more money could have been put into the actual product itself . I feel a little ripped off for what I paid and what I got , but I do feel like it was worth it , if only to teach my daughter these valuable financial and life lessons .
5 #### Wish it had a better base to put all 3 jars in . They just get separated and spread all over .
5 #### My son uses this everyday but really does n't get the concept yet about sharing and spending . He just wants to save all his money and not spend any of it . lol I was using a ziplock bag for all his birthday money before so this is a good buy for us .
5 #### Love this ! ! Such a great way to help kids learn about money !
5 #### Bought these for my 6 and 2 year olds . My oldest is learning about saving , tithing , and spending money so this is a great visual for him and the ledger helps teach account balancing . My youngest just loves putting coins in the slots !
5 #### Great idea and a great way to teach my 3 y / o about money , saving , spending and donating . Also makes helping around the house fun .
5 #### Great way to teach children about the art of saving , giving and spending .
5 #### The perfect ' piggy ' bank ! It identifies the key elements of handling money - save , spend , donate ( share ) . The only think that would make this coin bank perfect would be a way for the three pieces to snap together so that they are able to stay together in their nice shape by something other than a rubberband .
5 #### Love teaching my kids to give , save and share . You 've made it so simple and they look forward to using this !
5 #### This has been so great for teaching my kids about money . Before we just had a piggy bank for each of them and my son never wanted to spend his money on anything . This was kind of a good thing , but at the same time , I wanted him to feel free to spend his money some of the time . The Moonjar makes it easy for him to divvy up his allowance and birthday money . We also love the " How the Moonjar Was Made " book .
5 #### Great tool to teach and I llustrate financial management to kids and adults . I do n't use this to actually put money in it . I use it as a tool in teaching financial management . I love how each bank is colored differently ( red , blue , green ) to be easily distinguished from one another . These do not hold a lot of money , but does hold quite a bit . I relabeled my banks to be 10 % Save , 10 % Tithe , and 80 % Spend ( Expenses ) . I just put a white label on the front of each bank . I love that the banks fit like a puzzle making a hexagon shape which takes up less space and is easy to transport rather than have three separate squares that do n't fit so nicely together .
3 #### A good teaching aid but I think the price is a little high so only giving 3 stars for good education and 2 stars off for being too expensive . Honestly , I was forced to buy this . Otherwise , I would 've just buy 3 different piggy bank at a much lower cost that would do the same thing .
3 #### I love the idea , but the execution is weak . It 's three separate containers held together by a thick rubber band . They could have put more thought into it .
3 #### Not what I thought . I do like the multiple slots as we teach our children about the different important things to do with money but the jar is n't connected . The three colors are separate and only held together with a big band . I wish they were held together better than that . Besides that it works fine . You can remove the lid from each of the canisters .
5 #### Fabulous idea for kids . My kids both enjoy spending sharing and saving with this bank
5 #### My girls , 5 and 8 , love this piggy bank . It 's made of tin so if they drop it , it does n't break . It 's a wonderful concept . Save , Spend , and Share . They really like writing down how much money they have in the little checkbook that it comes with . It also helps them learn how to save and share .
5 #### My daughter loves being able to organize and designate her money .
4 #### Great tool for the kids to learn about money and spending concepts .
5 #### We bought this for our son when he was 5 . The three separate compartments are great , I like that it 's made of metal not plastic and I like that it can be rubber - banded together or separated . It 's very sturdy and has survived being dropped and knocked about . He loves portioning out his money into the different areas and seeing how it grows . We are n't using the little bank book yet , because he still puts money in randomly sometimes , so we 'd have to count it constantly . It will be nice to use in a couple of years though .
5 #### great way to start the kids learning about money and responsibility . Wish there was a better way to hold it all together than a rubber band .
3 #### I love the concept of this ... I do . And this looked really nice from the picture . But the piggy bank actually separates and the yellow stripe around it is a rubber band ... not a fan of it . It just seem like for the price , it should be held together better . Each section does open easily by an adult , but my toddlers have n't figured that out and I do n't think they 'd be able to do so easily which is nice ( it 's kept out of their reach so we have n't put that to the test ) .
4 #### Helpful way to teach kiddos about money . I wish there was a way to keep then connected without the cardboard .
5 #### A wonderful way for my sons to learn how to save , spend and share ! ! Well - made ... Highly recommend !
5 #### My son loves his moon jar . This is a wonderful way to encourage saving , sharing & spending .
5 #### We 're doing the " spend - save - share " allowance thing with our nine year old daughter , so I was looking for a bank that would make that simpler . I was a little hesitant to purchase this because it seemed on the smallish size and a little pricey , but it 's been a GREAT bank . The bank itself is translucent and slides out of the sleeve it arrives in , so you can see the money that is inside and how it builds up . It holds both change and paper money . The three parts of the bank come apart , so your child can bring the " save " part with her to the bank or bring the " share " part with her to local orgnizations ( we volunteer at a local animal shelter , so she brings the little " share " section of the bank with her to the shelter and puts the money into the donation box ) , etc . It also comes with a little bank book , so your kids can input the money as it comes and goes . All in all , I think this is a great introduction to actual banking , as well as a great way to watch money grow over time . Very neat , and great quality .
3 #### For the price I wish it was a bit larger and sturdier .
5 #### Perfect gift to teach a young one . Very pleased .
5 #### I had not realized this was a sturdier version than the one I already have . We received one several years ago for our older child which was a sturdy cardboard . This one is a hard plastic and much more durable . A good thing for our ' less careful ' younger child .
5 #### Love that the save / spend / give away lesson is taught with this bank . My son loves to take his money and split it up into the three categories . In fact , he 's only 7 and recently saved enough to buy his own iPod .
5 #### Got everything as described and promptly . THANK YOU AND WILL BUY AGAIN ! ! ! !
5 #### Perfect for my 4 year old . We are trying to teach her about money . I will agree that this is just three separate banks kept together with a rubber band but I love that it divides it into 3 categories : Spend , Save and Share . It helps me teach her that there is more to money than just getting it and spending it . I will say I have not looked into this program beyond getting the bank so I ca n't comment on any other aspects ... just the bank . I also love that this is a metal bank instead of something breakable like ceramic or glass and also more durable than plastic .
4 #### Love the concept of this piggy bank . Great for teaching how to save , spend and share money . Only drawback is the band that keeps the 3 separate compartments together is not super tight . It needs to be lose to allow room for them to come out , but I feel like it does n't keep them together very well . I wish I would 've bought one that was 1 piece with different compartments & tops .
5 #### I have five children so got one each for my 8 girl , 10 and 11 year old boys . Works real well . Teaches them how to divide there money into three groups so when time for siblings birthday , mothers day , Christmas they do n't have to feel there saving is going away but just use the " account " money box for sharing . Also the Savings box money can not be used and we put into the bank account when it gets a large amount which teaches them saving for the future . The spending box they then can focus on something they want as if they keep spending they will never have money to buy . We do 50 % savings 25 % spending 25 % sharing . Also there is a record book I help they with to keep track no one is taking there money and they are not using there save money .
5 #### This is great for teaching my kids good stewardship of their money . Buy this kind as opposed to the cardboard version . I bought both kinds and I 'm having to replace the cardboard ones already . Great for incorporating math if you divide the money in percentages .
3 #### As many others have stated , for the price you can probably make something yourself , but the concept and design are nice . Helpful kit for teaching young kids about money .
5 #### These are a must have for any allowance - savvy family with kids ! What a great way to teach children to track their money ... savings , spending and , best of all , GIVING ! They seem very durable . We 've been pleased so far !
5 #### The Moonjar Moneybox concept is on the money . Save , share & spend is simple enough for even a young child to grasp . At the same time there are many teachable momemnts . The passbook and educational information is interesting and not overwhelming , according to my 8 year old son 's response . Finally , the product is sturdy , yet accessible . We 've had other " piggy banks " that are too easy or not easy enough to get into ( i.e. transferring accumulated funds to the bank , etc . ) . We are really growing with this product , and I will be purchasing more as gifts .
3 #### This is a nice and attractive bank , but it 's just tin , and in retrospect , since I shopped for this item in an attempt to help my son save and manage his money , a wiser move would have been to save the $ 25 and create our own bank using empty cans or jars . You could decorate three cans or jars with felt or fabric and they would do the job just as nicely . At 5 my son could care less if the money were kept in a fancy or man - made bank , but he would 've had fun creating his own bank and I would 've felt a little less guilty not having spent $ 25 + shipping and handling on this . The plus is that the 3 sections fit together nicely and thus do not take up much space . I 'd give this a higher rating ( for the value ) if it cost $ 10 less .
5 #### We started using this with our kids when they turned 4 . We thought we might be a bit on the early side , but they have learned so much about money in the past year ! This is a great system and I highly recommend it !
5 #### This is an excellent game for 2 - 5 players , and especially for kids . I was initially put off by the theme and the mentioning of winning the $ 1 million dollar prize on the advertisement . I immediately thought there would be paper money involved and it would be like Monopoly where I would have to be a banker,,,and yech . But no , I was WRONG . There is no fake money involved ! Just little cards with different colors . Easy , but challenging . It is a game where you can be nice and not mess with your opponents supposed destination , or you can try and block them . You get points according to the tracks you lay and connections you make . But please , I love Amazon , but their Days of Wonder games are all overpriced . You can get this and their other games much cheaper on designated game sites . Do a search , read other reviews , boardgamegeek is a wonderful place to look and compare games . This was one of the first games I bought and I just keep finding more neat games to buy that you ca n't find here . * * * Fast forward 2010 * * * This is still a great game , that has n't changed . Just want to note that Amazon does have better pricing on this and other games now , especially when free shipping is involved .
5 #### I adore this game . Its super simple to learn , fun to play , takes a little strategy , but is overall just fun !
3 #### Granddaughter lost interest . Might need 3 or 4 to play to make it more fun . Did nt teach states like I had hoped .
5 #### Super fun game that even my youngest can play ! Fast to learn , about 1hr to 1.5hrs of playtime . Great quality board and pieces . My only complaint is that the cards are small . In some of the other versions they are full sized cards , but this version they are not .
5 #### This game is lots of fun ! The first time you play it , there is a slight adjustment period where you learn the rules and try to adapt a strategy . By the time you play this game for a second time , you 'll be ready to conquer America and the railway system . I particularly love the symbols that coordinate to the colored railways and cars , for someone who is colorblind , it is a relief to not worry about mixing up colors on the game !
5 #### Very fun game . Not quick ! Do n't get me wrong , it 's nothing like Risk ! If everyone knows how to play and you rush them all ( next person starts their turn while previous person is still laying their trains down on the board , etc ) and you go super quickly you can play a game in around 30 minutes . A leisurely pace takes 45 to an hour , depending on how much explaining you need to do or if you do a practice round and on how many players are participating . Our 5 year old even loves it ! He 's getting the hang of it and only needs minimal help . Our teenagers and on down also love it , as do we , the parents . For some reason it 's extremely satisfying to complete your routes ! !
5 #### amazing family game for those who are looking for a simple game to play with those old fogeys that wo n't play anything past monopoly .
5 #### Great game for kids and adults . Our 7 year old loves it
5 #### Awesome game . Play often with my 9 - year old ( just the two of us or with others ) . Since you get different routes every time , it does n't get boring , even if you play frequently . Teaching the kids strategy .
5 #### Great game for the family ! Make sure to get it when on sale !
5 #### Husband heard of this game and thought it sounded fun . Opened it up and to be honest I was a bit intimidated . There are a TON of pieces and with 3 little kids all I could see was stepping on a tiny train in the dark because the kids managed to get the box open when I did n't know about it . After playing a few times I have to say it 's a blast ! Our 7 year old daughter even enjoys playing . While she ca n't hold the cards to keep her tracks a secret it 's simple enough that she can follow along and does very well . We 've played just the 2 of us and with multiple other players . Still terrified of stepping on one of these little trains barefoot in the dark but it 's work the risk .
5 #### I had never heard of this game but my boyfriend said he used to play it when he was younger . I bought it for him for Christmas and we have played it numerous times already . This is such a fun game , even though I lose practically every time , lol ! !
5 #### We just discovered this game at a game night event last month and I had a gift card so decided to order it . We LOVE it ! My 11 - year - old son and I play together and really enjoy it . It 's not too complicated but does require some planning so you do n't lose too many points at the end . I want the rest of the versions now !
5 #### Purchased as a black Friday deal . We have enjoyed this game and after a couple of rounds our 9 & 11 year old are learning the map and starting to build strategy . Glad we decided to purchase it !
5 #### Ticket to Ride is probably one of my favorite board games to play . It 's easy to teach the rules of and can engage a family for 1 1/2 hours . Geography , spatial planning , and double digit addition are things your kids will work on when playing this game . But you do n't need kids to play this game !
5 #### This is a great game ! Very easy to learn and very fun .
5 #### My family and I LOVE Ticket to Ride . It is a fairly straight forward game that can teach kids of railroads as well as where cities are . You are basically trying to claim track and get your color train cards to their destination by collecting colored cards that match the color on the track . It is fairly easy to learn and takes about an hour to play . Great for the whole family !
5 #### Very fun game ! Great for family game night :)
5 #### Fun game for the whole family , as long as the family can read . It 's not Monopoly , so no one should end up murdered either . Good fun game that we 'll enjoy for years to come !
4 #### This game is so much fun ! I play it with my friends and 11 - year - old daughter and we have a blast . Its not a game my 8 - year - old enjoys as it requires patience and strategy .
5 #### Ticket to Ride is a game where you build trains to different locations in the United States and Canada , it is a very fun game , my family was obsessed with this game for approximately a week or so .
5 #### My only complaint is the train pieces , they are plastic and the same car in different colors . I wish they were wood and a variety of different train cars . And it would be nice if they stayed on the board better . One little bump and they scatter . It would be neat if they fit into groves like the old school scrabble boards . Or maybe magnetic .
5 #### Game for my sister . She loves it . Her and her hubs play quite a bit . We also own this game ( it 's in a different box for those wondering ) and enjoy it very well .
5 #### Best game we have played as a family in a long time ! ! ! Ca n't say enough good things about this game . Fun for 2 players as well as more . You really do n't know who is going to win until the very end when adding up your points . This game is fun for those who are n't even all that found of board games . A little spendy but well worth the $ $
5 #### We are a game loving family and Ticket to Ride did not disappoint . Our 7 year old twins were able to play with minimal help from us and they really enjoyed it .
5 #### My kids ages 11 - 14 boys and girls . Love this game . They gave played for hours . A must get . My husband and friends even enjoyed this as well and they never like games .
5 #### Very fun family game that everyone can enjoy - I completely recommend this game .
5 #### Moved to the " play often " shelf of our game closet . It 's everything you 've heard . It 's really fun . Requires planning and strategy . My son learning names and locations of cities he 's not familiar with in the US . Ca n't wait to get the European version . A definite buy , and keep .
5 #### Perfect ! Exactly as described . Purchase this , you will not be disappointed !
5 #### What a fun game , easy to learn and loads of fun ! ! ! ! ! ! We are having a blast with it .
5 #### This is one of our favorite " new to us " boardgames . It is easy enough for kids but competitive enough for adults . You can play cut - throat and block your opponent , or play leisurely and connect your cities . With so many expansions and maps , this will stay in our rotation for a long time .
5 #### Our family LOVES this game . It does n't take too long , once you play a practice round it 's pretty straightforward . I was winning every round until I shared my strategies with my 9 yo son . He creamed me last time . I 'd say if your kiddo is old enough to appreciate boardgames involving some strategy , they will like this . We want to get the Europe and Asian versions and have family " train master " tournaments .
5 #### Fun game enjoyable and pretty easy to get into , great gift .
5 #### So much fun ! ! ! Long pamphlet for instructions so take time to study the rules before playing .. once you figure it out it really is a fun game ! !
4 #### This is a future classic board game like Monopoly and others , but is a far better game than any of those past classics . Everyone should know how to play Ticket to Ride . It is an easy game to play with good strategy involved if desired . This is a great game to play with family due to its simple rules .
5 #### So fun for our whole family ! We love playing together or without our kids . It 's easy to simplify the rules for younger kids who may not like the tickets .
5 #### Everyone declared this game their new favorite game after our first play through .
5 #### Are a couple of adults , adults plus kids , or group of adults at a party . It is a strategy game .
3 #### Fun for the 1st maybe 30 minutes . I do n't understand all the hype . Less painful to play than monopoly but still , takes longer than my kids and I have patience for . Do nt see my family picking it up very often .
5 #### One of best games we 've played . Right up there with Settlers of Catan .
5 #### Good times . The kids love this game and its played regularly on game night .
5 #### Really fun game ! I love that you can play with most one other person .
5 #### We got this game for Christmas so have only played it a few times so far but it was easy to learn and begin playing . My 8 and 10 year old kids love it as much as my husband and I. Our board does n't lay super flat is my only complaint so the trains tend to slide a little but I 'm hoping it will flex more over time . I definitely recommend it for a fun family game !
5 #### Having played this game multiple times with all ages 8 - 65 years old , we have made a few modifications . At the beginning of the game , we deal out six train cards instead of four . We also can draw cards and play trains in a single turn . I agree with other reviews that 2 - 4 is the ideal number . It is a favorite game now in our family . Last January on a no school day , we had three games going and then a championship game and a consolation game . The kids , aged 8 - 12 , only played one game but enjoyed playing and were competitive players . The championship game was game on and very competitive !
3 #### LOVE THE GAME . I took off two stars because when I received the game and unwrapped the shrink wrap , everything on the inside of the box was covered in a fine white powder , like baby powder . It was really strange and a little unsettling .
5 #### I LOVE this game ! It has to be my favorite board game ! It involves strategy but its not just another strategy war game . :)
4 #### This game is a lot of fun . Based on previous reviews , I never read the instructions just watched a YouTube video on how to play . Its pretty simple and all 3 older kids ( 6,8,9 can play without trouble .
5 #### This is a great game ; part strategy , part luck , and all fun ! !
5 #### This is a fun game . We play this whenever we have company over . It 's an easy game to learn and very enjoyable to play .
5 #### Love this game ! I 've given it to both my sons . It 's not as intricate as the Catan games or monopoly and can be played in a reasonable time frame . It combines luck and strategy .
4 #### Great game , we both - kids and adults love it ! The only thing that I noticed is different from " Ticket to Ride : Europe " , that this game 's cards are very small in size , not typical size and not convenient to play . Thank you .
4 #### Fun , entertaining game . My 8 year - old needed some help and lost interest after awhile , but my 11 year - old enjoyed it .
5 #### We LOVE this game ! It is an excellent mix of skill ( mostly ) with a little chance thrown in . We mostly play with adults but we can even dumb it down and play with my 7 year old ( though I would recommend buying the kid version if that is your regular plan - which we have too and love ) . We like Catan as well and they are similar style . A typical game takes about an hour with experienced players ; a little more time if you are new at it . It does n't take long to learn but you want to keep playing because you learn new strategies each time . It does take up a large amount of space to play it and the spot has to be stable and flat because otherwise little trains go everywhere . You need a decent score keeper to make it easier on everyone .
5 #### My sons favorite game . Even the adults enjoy it .
5 #### just played out for the first time with my 8 year old . The instructions are a bit complicated but once you start playing you quickly get the hang of it and it turns out to really be quite simple . It 's a really easy fun game for the whole family !
1 #### This is a counterfeit game . When you try to register it the serial number does n't work . The board does n't lay flat and it has cracks in it . My friends had the same thing happen to them . If you want this game go and buy it from a store where they are more likely to have a real one that you can actually play . In case you are wondering I bought directly from Amazon not from a third party .
5 #### Our whole family loves this game . It 's a game that kids and adults can pay together and both would find it fun and challenging . Just came home from a weekend with my niece and her family and we had a really good time playing this . Highly recommended .
5 #### My husband and I are big TTR fans . We started out with the Europe version , bought several other versions and we just not got the US version . This game has a lot of replay value . We enjoy playing this several times a week . It 's always something different because there are so many variations with the routes that you can draw ! It keeps things fun and entertaining . I will say that I was surprised by the small size of the playing cards . In the Europe version , the cards are the size of playing cards , but these cards are much smaller . Nothing bad , just a funny little difference .
5 #### The board was not completely flat when opened up , so I put a very heavy large book on it overnight and it flattened right out !
5 #### Great game . Kids love it . They are age 9 - 13 ,
1 #### Loved the game the few times we got to play it . However , the board fell apart and it 's less than a month old !
5 #### Been wanting this game for years & the Hubz bought it for me as a Xmas gift . It 's great fun & if you love strategy games , you 'll love this game .
5 #### Strategic game and fun . Takes about an hour to play .
5 #### I 'm semi - new to the tabletop gaming world . This was the first game I purchased that was n't a " classic board game . " I love it . My family loves it , and you can simplify the rules to play with younger children as well . I recommend it for families !
5 #### excellent and fun game . great geography reference for kids and old alike . Good mental .challenge for old folks .
5 #### Great game for the whole family ! ! Just bought several to give as Christmas gifts ! !
5 #### This is our go to family board game . Ages 40 , 13,11 . Fun and can be completed in less than an hour . Like any board game reading the instructions the first time can be a daunting task , but well worth the effort .
5 #### Bought this for my step - son and his wife . They love it . Found out my 74 year old mother and her 83 year old friend also have this game and play it often !
2 #### Great game . But the board is so severely warped that it 's practically unplayable .
5 #### It 's rare to find a game that everyone in the family loves . This is that game . With most games , we get one of 3 scenarios in my household . 1 ) my boys like it . They 're a little older and we play a lot of strategy games . My daughter ( who is the youngest ) does n't win these often and either tires of them quickly or does n't like them at all . 2 ) My daughter likes it . These tend to be games steered more towards chance where strategy is not so important . The boys generally only tolerate these because I make them play ( got ta keep it fair , you know ) Or 3 ) a few games are somewhere in the middle that none of us loves but none of us hates either . The compromise game . But with Ticket to Ride , we have a real winner . There 's enough strategy in it that you can make or break your game on your own merits , but there 's also enough element of chance in it ( and the strategy is n't typically too deep ) that younger kids will enjoy it too ( as long as they 're old enough to grasp the game mechanics in the first place ) . Light - hearted , fairly fast - paced , and - excuse the cliche but seriously - fun for the whole family !
5 #### Bought this to play with my 7 y / o , we figured it out pretty easily and it 's not too hard for him to play . Only played it once so far but he 'll get better strategies after a couple times .
2 #### Ordered for my sons birthday , opened it up today to play and the board is damaged . Before we even take it out of the box the game is already falling apart . Very disappointed ...
5 #### Great game ! T2R games are a huge hit in our family ! Works great for gameschooling and learning geography !
5 #### Very fun , easy to learn board game . One of our favs ! We play it all the time . Play mostly with two players but we have played with up to four and is still fun ! Family favorite .
5 #### Fun game - losts of pieces , some strategy needed to win . Not your average board game - but that is what I like .
5 #### Neat strategy board game . My two teenagers enjoyed playing this with me . Would recommend for family game night !
5 #### This game is to much fun . We play almost every day . The kids love the cut throat aspect and set out to block each other at every turn .
5 #### Love this game ! I 've been playing it with my boyfriend lately and we both enjoy it a lot together . Will have to play it with other people sometime !
5 #### Two mid - life adults playing board games --- we are n't the only ones . This game came highly recommended and it is enjoyable and playable by two people . I think it would be better with three or more since there are elements that would be benefit from more defense .
5 #### If you do n't own this game , you need to . If you do n't like trains , it 's not a big deal . I thought this game sounded boring and boy was I wrong ! It 's so much fun . Great family entertainment . I recommend it to everyone .
5 #### My older children , ages 8 and 10 , love this game . It takes patience and strategy and stretches them more than some other games we have . Mom enjoys playing it , too !
5 #### I love the game . It 's a good game to play with friends . There 's strategy and also some luck which always allows the game to be different every time !
5 #### Absolutely love this game ! Ticket to Ride ( aka Ticket US ) was the first game in the series , and is probably the best introduction to the series , as it 's easy to pick up and does n't have the twists and added elements that the other complete games or map collections in the series contain . Players acquire colored train cards to try and complete the route cards they drew and kept at the start of the game . Long train routes ( typically in the southern US and up in Canada ) are worth the most points , but it can be hard to get the large numbers of the same color train cards needed to complete them . * Official game rules say that in double routes ( 2 tracks connecting a pair of cities ) can only be used by one player and then that connection is blocked , but my family always plays by the rule " if the route is there , it can be claimed " and use both tracks between the cities .
5 #### Fun game ! I love that it 's two player so my husband and I can play !
5 #### Beautiful board game with little trains . So much fun to play and learn the USA .
3 #### Ticket to Ride is okay . It 's obviously a gateway game . At the time that I bought it , I was new to the euro gaming scene . I did n't buy it because I was on the fence about wanting to play such games , but because it was known to be such a popular game . Since having bought and played so many deeper euro games , I kind of wish that I had n't bought this one . Sure , it 's a good game , but definitely for the lighter gamer . Still recommended , though .
4 #### Fun game , but the cards are way too small ! and difficult to hold . Why could n't they just make them standard playing card size ? ! Had to buy the larger cards in the expansion pack , and frustrated that I had to spend extra money for this .
5 #### Alan moon really did a good job with this little number !
5 #### I really enjoy playing this game . A little skill and a little luck make the perfect family game .
5 #### A great game to have in your game collection ! This game is a classic , loved by many . All the friends I 've introduced this game to always request to play it again on our game nights , so I 'd say it 's a hit . Very fun , an interesting variety of strategy to choose form , and fun game board .
5 #### I can see why this game became an instant classic . Finally picked up this game after seeing it at the top of every blogger 's " Top # # # Games " lists - And it 's a blast . It 's an easily accessible game , yet still deep enough to reward " power " gamers . It does a great job of building tension , as well ... As you see the trains your opponents have remaining to place begin to dwindle , signifying the end game - And you still have two routes in your hand that you 're trying to complete . I see this becoming any family 's go - to board game .
5 #### I love this game . I 've bought it as gifts for a lot of people . We play games at every family gathering and this is a game that my youngest cousin ( age 9 ) can play just as well as my grandfather ( age 88 ) . It 's a simple concept that everyone can grasp , but skill is required . Everyone has a different way of playing the game , which makes it even more fun ! I love this game ! Can play it for hours !
5 #### wonderful game , I have the 10th anniversary edition , which while more pricey I think is well worth it ! ! !
5 #### My whole family loves this game . You wo n't be disappointed . Fun and entertaining every time we play .
5 #### This is a fun game for our family . Our children range from 11 - 15 and we all like it .
2 #### Pretty complicated for 8 year olds . I 'd raise the min age to 9 or 10 .
5 #### This game is fun ! My husband and I both liked it and our other favorite game is Catan .
5 #### I have to say this game is so much fun . Whether it be with 2 or 5 players you never know who is going to win . I highly recommend this game to any tabletop player .
5 #### We got this for the kids for Christmas and it is a super big hit ! Lots of fun . The youngest that plays it is 9 , so it works well for younger kids too .
5 #### I keep buying this for friends birthdays and etc . so yes this is a great game . Not very hard to understand or over complicated . Sheldon would love it its trains !
5 #### This was a gift but I 'm told its excellent
5 #### Bought based on reviews . This has become our family favorite game . Everyone , young and old can play ( young for us is age 10 ) and we played over and over and over on our last vacation . This is a seriously awesome family game ! I would say it 's a great addition to anyone 's family game selection .
4 #### It 's a fun game ... but not a replacement for Catan . It 's pretty easy to learn and fast moving . Not too challenging - probably good for tweens and up .
5 #### Really fun game ! My family plays this game quite often ( children ages 8 & 11 ) . Gameplay is pretty simple , yet there is fair amount of strategy that can be used . The game board and pieces are all nicely made and fit well into the box when being stored . Would be a great addition to family game night !
1 #### Very complicated and too hard for my family to learn . We returned it .
5 #### My wife and I love this game . The fact that we can play it with just the two of us , or with company is a big plus . Have never been bored playing and once we start it usually consumes the rest of our night .
5 #### Our family loves this game . Mom , Dad , Daughter ( 13 ) , Son ( 10 ) .
4 #### Recommend watching the YouTube video or something to learn how to play , rules might be more straight forward if they were in Chinese . Also make sure you have plenty of time . Takes less time to play than Monopoly , but longer than Chess . 9yo likes to play , 7 yo loses interest , grandmas ca n't understand it , and PhD Uncle kicked our butts .
5 #### Ticket to Ride is a fantastic game for middle schoolers and older . The kids will love building a track of trains . It 's a lot of fun !
5 #### This is a great game ! The whole family loves to play it ! It makes you think and plan ahead . Worth the money .
4 #### Great game to play with family and friends so simple to teach & play
4 #### Good game just really expensive for what you get
5 #### One of our favorite family games . Simple mechanics , strategic and fun . Buy it today !
5 #### First up , do n't get hung up on the train theme . This is a strategy game about connecting paths . The rules are really simple and everyone can play . I would suggest that this game is for anyone 10 and above can play this game competitively with each other . The game has you start off with tickets . They are the hidden goals of the player . Your job is to build routes ( place trains ) to connect them . You will need to complete them before the route is taken by other players . I currently have 9 different versions of this game , and after you master this one , I would suggest adding the 1910 expansion , or the Ticket to Ride Europe version .
5 #### this is a very fun game , we have enjoyed playing it a lot . Highly recommended for friends and families alike .
5 #### This is a great game ! The adults enjoy it as much as the kids !
5 #### My boys and I like this game . It 's quick to learn and fun to play . Is a good family game and so far everyone we have introduced it to enjoys it also .
4 #### I like this game , it takes some strategy to win , but it 's also simple enough for younger players to get the hang of .
5 #### The perfect game . The board and pieces are visually attractive and it requires a good dose of strategy without becoming overwhelming , it is in fact quite easy for new players to pick it up . No dice roll ( great ! ) , it is fun as you play and a match takes around 60 min ... Typically everyone feels it has a chance to win until the end , so it is quite engaging all the way . It does not create direct conflict among players so it is great option for families and close friends , nobody will start arguing in the middle of the match ( unless you forget to take your meds ) . It is best played with 4 players . It is fine but crowded with 5 people , it is fine but not as exciting with 3 , and it is ok with 2 . Recommended !
4 #### We got this game as a Christmas gift , and have enjoyed playing it numerous times already . It has similarities to Monopoly and Risk --- collect cards , claim your ground , earn points --- but the overall strategy is learned easily and the game can be completed in less time . We 'll probably try the European version of this game after mastering this one . You win the game by scoring the most points , and points can be earned in several ways : completing a preassigned start - to - finish destination route ( Chicago-->L.A. , for example ) , claiming smaller routes between different cities , creating the longest continuous route on the board . Some achievements are worth more than others , so prioritizing your moves is a must ! One note about gameplay : the board has the train routes marked in colors , and a few were " too similar " for a slightly colorblind guy in the house to discern easily . It 's nice that the game makers also tagged the routes and playing cards with a unique symbol for each color , problem solved !
3 #### Nice game with quality pieces and game board . Good for teaching children planning / goal setting , organizing and implementation . It was an expensive game in comparison to my usual game purchases . Though we just finished reading as a family Around the World in 80 Days , unfortunately , this game did not wow us and we have yet to play it a second time .
4 #### This should be on most every " typical family " game shelf . Replaces the slot usually reserved for the ubiquitous monopoly board with a board game whose competitive gameplay keeps every player involved for the duration of the game . Unlike monopoly , game length should n't unnecessarily drag on ( if you 're taking more than an hour or two you might be doing it wrong ) . Gameplay works for 2 - 5 players but this board shines at 3 - 5 players ( for a great 2 - player variant try the Nordic Countries box ) . Add the 1910 card expansion pack right away for higher quality cards and a pile of destination tickets that will ensure that every game feels different .
2 #### Many of the cities on the gameboard are in the wrong place . For instance , Duluth , MN is drawn where Minneapolis and St. Paul are located . Annoying .
5 #### Christmas gift . Everyone I 've talked to that has played it says it 's really fun !
5 #### Fairly simple game . Lots of fun ! My wife and I play this with our parents and siblings and it 's a blast !
5 #### My kids fell in love with this game , so we gave it to our cousins for Christmas . The cousins are homeschooled and informed me that there is a curriculum that goes along with the game . I had no idea .
5 #### Simple to learn / teach , takes about 5 - 10 minutes to read through the directions the first time . I love that this game moves quickly , is very dynamic , and does n't take too long . There are many strategies that can be employed throughout the game but it is n't a real mind - bender . Very competitive but my friend ( who is notorious for being a sore loser at games ) was able to enjoy this both when she won and lost because it 's really a mix of luck/ strategy/ just how things land . You most likely do n't know who will win until the very end so every moment is fun .
5 #### I ordered this for a Christmas gift for my boyfriend . He is big into Asian stuff and last year I ordered him the Ticket to Ride Asia edition , however it was an expansion . This Christmas , I decided to get him this set so he can actually use the set I got him last year . Ca n't wait to see his face Christmas morning .
5 #### We love this game . Does not hold the attention of my 7 year old , but my 11 year old really enjoyed playing it . My husband and I sometimes play it alone when the kids go to bed .
5 #### I purchased this for a grandson 's 11th birthday . later in the day several were playing ... 11 year old up through age 52 ... all with engineers ' minds ... They loved it ... kept them busy for a few hours ! ! Later the 11 year old played with another group of adults who said it is a great game .
5 #### We love playing this game at home when we have friends / family over . We like that you can still carry on a conversation but have fun playing this game . We are excited to introduce this to our kiddos once they 're old enough to play .
5 #### Great game ! We purchased this as a gift for a family member and enjoyed playing it all together . It requires strategy but is n't difficult so young people can enjoy it too . Play time goes by much faster than Settler 's of Catan which is nice especially when you 're playing with inexperienced or young players . It 's one of our top favorite games .
5 #### Really enjoying this game . It 's fun with two people . Figuring out how / when to mess with your opponent 's routes and when to focus on your own ( 45 train cars goes fast if you forget to work on your routes ) is fun . Games take a while ( 45 min . avg for us ) but are n't too long and there 's plenty of variety so far so replaying is fun , too .
5 #### This is one of the most intelligent games on the market . So many options that you are fully engaged in the game every minute .
5 #### Our family gets hours of fun out of this game ! I love it because it brings a little geography to the kitchen table . It 's also super fun for all ages , we have 3 generations sitting together in one place , scheming on one another . We never tire of playing . I also highly recommend getting the expansion for it , it makes it so much more fun !
5 #### This game is great ! It has quickly become my families favorite game to play . My wife and I were introduced to it at a couples game night party . The rules are pretty straight forward and easy to learn . Like most fun games it is easy to learn and hard to master . I 've played this with my six year old and he gets the concept pretty well . The only thing we 've done differently when he plays is we show all of our train cards rather than keep them secret . The build of the game is very good quality and hopefully will hold up to the test of time and multiple plays .
5 #### My children and I absolutely love this game . My kids , ages 12 and 9 , started playing this game a few years ago . My 9 year plays it well - often winning . I like that you can use different strategies to play . If you do not know what you are doing then you still have fun and you can always play to block others and make things difficult for them .
5 #### Very fun game of strategy once everyone knows the rules . The rule book is n't very clear and the game varies slightly from the electronic version
5 #### Great game for the family . Our kids enjoy it a lot and we like playing it as well so it is a double win ! !
5 #### really fun new game to play with the family
5 #### Love playing with the family . Better than having them watch TV and take a large portion of the evening to play after dinner .
5 #### This game is so fun for the entire family ! It is n't too long , so you are n't committed to hours of play , but long enough that you get some quality time . My 9 year old is able to play and understand the rules , but it is also fun for just the adults . Highly recommend !
5 #### Fun game - the family voted that it 's a keeper .
5 #### GREAT GREAT GAME ! Not too difficult to learn the rules(kids are 8 and 12 ) , but the play is not boring at all . completely recommend as a family game !
5 #### Essential board game for anyone who plays board games . To the last generation that had Monopoly & we now have Ticket to Ride . This game is played by my wife and myself on a regular basis & my 7 & 5 year old love it as much as we do . Great family game & also a great game to introduce to non - gamers . It has tons of replayability & always is great competitive fun . If you like games you must have this in your collection .
5 #### Great fun ! We love this game . Great for family time . I really enjoy this game , so does the whole family .
5 #### A delightful entry into " heaver " games ; this is the lightest they come . Draft cards to claim routes and beat competition into various citys . My son played at 5 years old and had fun without knowing the " take that " element of gameplay .
5 #### Everyone that 's played this game with us always has a lot of fun . You can play with several different strategies and each one can win if done well . It does leave a bit up to chance to get the right cards and the right train sets , but still pretty enjoyable .
5 #### We love this game . Interesting enough for adults , easy enough for a 10 - year old to pick it right up . I ca n't count how many times we 've played it since buying it earlier this year . If you 're new to strategy games , this is a good place to start . I look forward to purchasing the expansion boards soon . I do wish there were a way to vary the game if you 're playing with the same people over and over ( you catch on to one another 's strategies pretty quickly ) , but the main way to keep it interesting is to play with different players . I 've played with all ages , anywhere from 2 to 6 players . It 's been fun every time .
5 #### Every family should own this game ! It has provided numerous hours of family fun ! I actually now purchase it for families as a Christmas gift . Small children can even participate with older siblings or adults .
5 #### A classic gateway game . It 's been around so long for a reason : An accessible , fun title for small groups and large ones alike . Has some unique elements I have n't seen in other games yet , and several others I see copied but not done as well . Components are nice and the theme really shines through .
5 #### Super fun and love the fact that it is pretty simple to understand makes it a lot of fun ; especially with some bottles of wine !
5 #### Great game for family or friends . This is really fun and was easy to learn , though has enough strategy that it gets more challenging with time !
5 #### I have bought several as gifts because it is so much fun .
5 #### Our new favorite board game . It is totally worth it and a great game for 4 - 5 people . It is what Monopoly should be .
5 #### My family and friends love playing this game ! ! We love that it is different each time we play it plus we all have different strategies that we use ! I would recommend getting the expansion pack as well .
3 #### Not sure what all the fuss was about with this game . It is confusing to learn but once you do , it 's easy to play . My 9 year old and 12 year old played the game with me . We liked it , but I would n't say it was fabulous .
5 #### So glad I bought this game ! have to say that Ticket to Ride has become an ultimate favorite for us . As far as I am concerned , even when I lose it 's a blast ! It 's so much fun plotting to get your stations connected , and those of you who are particularly cut - throat can look for ways to cut off your opponents from getting the most direct route to connect theirs . For me , this is one of the best board games ever . There 's no just tossing dice and moving a little piece around a board , and it can move quickly , so you have to be always thinking ahead to how you can best make your connections . Totally recommended for friends and families !
5 #### Great game . Played this with friends over spring break and really enjoyed it . Definitely some strategy involved , but easy to explain and different every time .
5 #### Never heard of this game , just stumbled across it ... Tons of fun ! We even have a version for our phones now !
5 #### My 8yo son likes this game & we like playing with him too ! Takes some strategy & about an hour to play , but fun game .
5 #### This is one of our favorite games to play on board game night . We had stopped playing board games for a while but decided to give this one a try . I must say that it is a very entertaining game . The board is well constructed , and we love remembering the names of major cities and where they are located . the little trains are a nice nice . The best part is that A game can be played in a little over an hour , no more 3 hour games of the past .
5 #### Love this game ; it 's a family favorite ! However , I wish we could play with more than 5 . ( There is 10 in our family . We make it work . ) My 6 year is a champ at this game so do n't let the age range fool you . I was amazed at how quickly he picked up the locations of the cities . I 'll be buying the Europe version as well .
4 #### Fun family board game . It really only took one play through for all of our kids to really understand and like this game . ( age 9 + ) The game play is also varied enough that it seems like we can play it multiple times without getting too much repeat . Overall I 'd say this is a great non board game player game .
5 #### We have had this game for a few years and we find ourselves reaching for it constantly . It is great for 2 players and multiple players . Very simple game that involves a bit of luck and strategy . Every Time I visit my parents , they ask that I bring this game for us to play as a family and I usually end up leaving the game with them to enjoy together until my next visit . ( I guess I will just go ahead and buy them their own when I finish this review ! ) . At the time that I purchased this in 2010 , the game was very expensive to buy on other sites and Amazon had the best price , which is awesome . I am going to buy the other variations , as well . I do wish there was a way to be a bit more sneaky and strategic , as I do feel a bit guilty when I blatantly block my mom and dad 's train routes , but it is still a very fun , easy to play game !
5 #### I love ticket to ride ! My 6 year old will play with me , but I do have to help him with where the cities are . He has fun figuring out how he is going to get his train there . I give him easier train tickets and we only do 1 at a time so that it 's not too overwhelming . We both love it !
5 #### One of the best board games I 've played in years . My 9 year old loves it as does my husband . This came highly recommended by my board game lovin' friends and I am a convert as well .
5 #### A really fun game and easy enough for older children to play but challenging enough for adults . A great introduction to learning to play the more challenging European version of Ticket to Ride . Also great geography lessons for children .
5 #### Such a fun game ! I just wish the expansions were n't so expensive , considering they 're just a small deck of cards .
5 #### How can I even begin to express how much I love this game ? ! My family plays this nearly every week . It brings out some fun competition and each game is different depending on what destination cards you draw . Our game has survived through many vacations and it is so easy to teach and catch on to . I am hoping to expand and purchase more versions of Ticket to Ride or " Trains " as my family affectionately calls this game . 10/10 would recommend .
5 #### Our family loves this game ! We try to play board games as a family at least once a week , and this game is often one of our top choices . The objective is to connect as many rails as you can . As the makers recommend , our youngest player is eight , but we began playing it when he was seven . We 've also played with adults who enjoy it just as much as younger players . Average game time is around an hour , so it 's a great way to unplug from the TV , computer , tablet , etc . and simply spend time together . We look forward to getting some of the other editions ! Recommended for : family game night , strategy enthusiasts , families with children ages 8 + , train enthusiasts , players looking for a longer game .
4 #### This is a really fun game . It 's fun because you never play the same game twice , it 's different every time ! You also have to interact with the other players in order to block then from taking your spot . Be careful because some people get really vindictive when they play this game . Basically you have routes that you have to build across the United States . The more routes you build the more points you get . When you finish your mission you get more points . It 's really fun .
5 #### Love this game my 6&8 year old are enjoying it too !
5 #### This game is so fun and I loved the quality ! Highly recommend
4 #### We are a family of board gamers . TTR USA is simple to learn and play . My two boys 7 and 9 year olds pick up the game easily . However , it is IMHO pretty predictable after a few games - you sort of can remember what routes you used to build and hence can guess what your fellow game mate is attempting to plan . it is n't as complicated nor challenging as our fave game - Settlers of Catan . But it does nt take as much time to finish a game as Catan does . Overall , on its own , it is a game easy enough to provide family fun or among friends and my kids after playing a few times , are able to set up the game and play with other kids without supervision or guidance . But for me , it does n't have the " oomph " factor like Catan . That 's because I am a Catan die heart .
5 #### Wow . We wanted something for game night and this one is it ! It is really fun once you figure out how to play , but boy is it worth it ! There 's so much strategy , I have a 9 and 12 year old that both caught on quickly and it was game on . Definitely recommend .
5 #### Great light board game to introduce people to more advanced game mechanics .. Just be sure you have a stable table and no toddlers around to mess up the pieces !
5 #### Very fun game - a little pricey , but well made and over all worth it if you love board games . My 85 year old father could play it without too much difficulty and really enjoyed it , as well as my 30 + sons and myself ( 60 + ) .
5 #### My adult children love this game ! The quality of this product is wonderful !
5 #### CLASSIC ! This is great fun ! Easy to learn , hard to master ! Can you build the most routes ? Get the 1910 expansion ! The cards that come with the game are small . The expansion replaces those cards with normal sized cards . This game will last at least an hour with three people . You take turns collecting cards that you essentially use to buy different routes to complete . The routes are semi - chosen by you . These are on cards also . You get points based on the tracks that you claim and the routes that you complete .
5 #### This is a really fun game . The instructions are pretty straight forward . The game offers good strategy thinking for the whole family . A simple game that can be played multiple times . The game does n't take long to understand . My family had a lot of fun playing this game . We enjoyed trying to out play the other .
4 #### Would be nice if the board had notches for the trains so they would n't slide everywhere
5 #### Fun game for all ages ! My 6 and 9 year olds were able to catch on quickly and loved it , and it was still challenging enough to keep the adults entertained . We look forward to getting more versions ! It 's also a well made game and I love that all the pieces have their own spot in the box .
5 #### This is a great family game - easy and quick to learn and with enough variety not to get old .
5 #### great game , took a little bit to learn , but it is a great time that allows the family to disconnect from the digital world and play an out fashion fun board game .... even better it makes you think and use your noggin
5 #### This game is a family favorite . You use train pieces to make trains to destinations in the United States ( ex . Houston to Miami ) . This game balances strategy and luck nicely which I really enjoy . It can be a pretty long game depending on how many people you play with , but it 's great for Family Fun Nights . There is also an app version that is really fun to play .
5 #### We really love this game . We are senior citizens , so it took a while to get all the different rules down . But our grandson loves to play , he 's 13 . Not sure about an eight year old . My question is when I try to play on my Fire tablet , I can not " choose cards " . The instructions has no reference to drawing your cards . I 've tried tapping twice ; touching and holding , with no luck . If anyone has a suggestion , please advise .
4 #### Cool two player game ! Easy to replay and easy to understand but still challenging . I play this with the kids and they love this board game .
5 #### Great board game ! Highly recommend it for a family game night .... just make sure you have at least 2 hours play time .
5 #### One of the most enjoyable games our family has played in a long , long time !
5 #### Awesome game . Ca n't wait to get the other versions .
5 #### Want to hate your friends and family , get this game !
5 #### I 've only played this with 2 players so far , but I imagine it would be even better in a group . One of my favorite times to play this game is with my boyfriend after work , when we 're both a little mentally dead and we throw some Friday Night Lights on Netflix and pull out Ticket to Ride . It 's a nice way to be able to interact with each other , but it 's not too mentally consuming -- we can watch TV and maybe space out some , but turn play is short so we are n't bored . That said , I DO wish there were ways to amp it up and make it more complicated . I 've been told the European version is better for this , and I 'm curious whether the expansion pack would add layers of difficulty . The different strategies right now are pretty limited . I 've had the game for about 3 months and have n't gotten tired of it yet ( maybe played 5 - 10 times ) , but there are only so many different ways to win . I 'd be interested in an expansion that restricts certain actions so that it had the option to require more brainpower . For kids , though , this is perfect . Sort of makes me wish I was a nanny so I had kids I could play with .
5 #### Son really likes this game . He is eight years old and it really getting into board games . This game has enough challenge to keep him interested but not too much that it is overwhelming . It also forces him to read the route names and learn so geography , this is a plus .
5 #### possibly the best family game for 3 + ever made !
5 #### This is a really fun game ! I highly recommend it .
5 #### Great replay ability . Fun for everyone . Easy to learn . Lots of fast action , depending on the players . Get cards that you predict will make the train route the whole way before the game is over . Make the longest train for more points .
5 #### Superfun ! Was able to play with as young as 8 year old . Lots of competition so cooperative type people might not love it .
5 #### Great game to play with people of all ages . Simple yet requires good strategy .
5 #### This is such a fun , timeless game ! Easy to most everyone to play . Requires some level of attention but allows conversation as well .
5 #### I love this game . We own a set and have purchased some for friends / family . It is fun for families without kids but is also fun for families with kids .
5 #### Really fun game to play . My enjoyment actually begins the packaging and artwork of the box and even instructions . Sounds foolish I suppose , but it gives a certain feeling of blowing the dust off of a very old and lost treasure and engaging entering secrets of the past , like something a scene from an old movie , or Raider 's of the Lost Ark. Anywho , I do wish the board had been better constructed , ours tends to rise instead of lay flat . Kinda annoying , but rather minor inconvenience that will hopefully lesson with more play . I bought this for the whole family , remembering how much fun my siblings and I had playing board games - something I fear is lost on the video game generation . Thus far , only my 7 yr old and I have played the game . He loves board games and I have bought hem several variations of Monopoly . It takes a few plays - and several trips back to the instructions - before the strategy and beauty of the game begin to unfold . Once you 've mastered the details of the rules , one can concentrate on trying to build one 's railroad empire . Then , you will have days of wonder .
5 #### Great game ! My family of 4 enjoys this game . It 's different from most games as you have to build your railroads and plan things out . Can get a bit frustrating if someone blocks your plans ... but all in all , I would get this again . We love it . Great design , great board , good pieces - fun game .
4 #### Great fun for all ages . It would have five stars if the cards that are used in playing the game were bigger so shuffling them , which happens many times during the game , was easier .
5 #### Ticket to Ride takes exploring the country and world by rail to a new level . Learn the countries and cities of the locale , while you try to complete your routes . Each game is different , thanks to the wide variety of routes and the random draw of the cards . The high - quality components make playing time after time a pleasure . And they even include spare trains in case a few get carried away during clean - up . Return in time to the era of the railroads ! Our family LOVES all the incantations of Ticket to Ride , both in real games and the phone apps , too . Each one has slight variations on the rules , and each requires a little different strategy . My grad school kid plays Ticket to Ride at game nights , and my college kid plays in the " common room " with her friends . But it 's simple enough that my 9 - 17yo nieces and nephew like to play , too . Even my reluctant - game - player husband gladly plays along with Ticket to Ride .
5 #### Given to 10 year old grandson , who requested it for his birthday - played at Christmas and truly enjoyed it .
5 #### My kids still play this game whenever there 's a family gathering . It 's a favorite .
5 #### A classic , my family and friends love to play
5 #### We are n't really gamers , but I had been wanting to find something for our family to play that would be fun for everyone , not too hard , not totally luck , and did n't take hours and hours to play . This game is perfect . It took about an hour to play with 3 people , and 1- 1/2 hours with 5 . It was great for everyone . My 8 year old picked right up on it , and almost won the first time she played . Last night we played with adults and teenagers and everyone loved it . I ca n't wait to play again . It 's a must have !
5 #### one of the best games that i have ever played . It is a must have for anyone that owns board games . collect colors to build railroads from city to city . really fun , does nt really have that take that aspect , unless you go out of your way to figure out what others are doing . GO BUY THIS GAME ! ! !
5 #### This is a fun , easy game . It is easy to play , which means not looking for directions every time you do n't know what to do . You keep score on the board and build trains to and from different places in the USA . There are cards that tell you which cities . Everyone had their own mission as well as trying to stop others to achieve their missions . I have to say , our game came in a smashed up box due the delivery . Amazon made right with us . Their customer service is amazing .
5 #### Great family game ! . Everyone I 've played this with picks it up really quickly and enjoys the game play .
5 #### This was a gift and then said they loved it !
5 #### Fun game . We played it at Christmas and our niece(10 ) and nephew(12 ) were able to play it with their mom helping them with the strategy against the adults .
5 #### What a great board game ! I got it for kids for Christmas and we all played it during Christmas brake . Lots of fun ! Highly recommended .
5 #### After researching the top games on Amazon for Christmas gift ideas , I landed on this game . The reviews that I read sounded fun , so we decided that this would make a great gift for our oldest sons , ages 9 and 10 . I knew this game had to be a top seller for a reason , but I was seriously blown away by how fun this game is ! This game utilizes both strategy and luck . Our kids are able to understand the rules and provide very good competition to the adults who join in . This has become a favorite and we 've been playing it several nights per week for over a month . Typically , it takes an hour and a half to complete the game , and each time we play new critical thinking skills are used . I would recommend this game for ages 8 and up .
3 #### Very confusing game to start up and play . Whew .
5 #### We picked this up for family game nights . We 've only played it a few times so far , but we all really liked it . My kids are 11 and 8 and both were able to play by themselves . However , while the 8 year old understood how play when it was her turn , she failed to understand or comprehend the overall objective- which is to complete the routes you picked ( and kept in your hand ) . At the end of the game , while she had the most points for the number of rail cars , she ended up getting the most deductions for incomplete routes . So that resulted in a number of tears on her end and her insistence that she hates this game . However , when an adult is helping her and she is frequently reminded of the objective , she did better . So , perhaps it 's not the best game for an 8 year old to play on her own . It 's better for slightly older kids or if an adult helps the younger ones . Even so , we enjoyed the game and plan to buy the European version as well as more games from Days of Wonder .
5 #### We LOVE this game ! At first the instructions seemed a little daunting to us , but after a quick google search we stumbled upon an extremely helpful video done by the actor , Wil Wheaton . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHmf1bau9xQ Once we learned how to play , we were able to quickly and simply explain the rules to our 9 year old daughter in minutes . We originally bought the game for her . But to be honest , my husband and I have enjoyed playing it so much that I think we 've played it 4x as much as she has . It 's a very basic strategy game - Your goal is to have the most points at the end of the game . You gain points by claiming routes and completing destination tickets . We 've tried playing the game with a couple of different strategies and no two games are ever really the same . It 's a fantastic family game for up to 5 players , great for children and/or adults . Highly recommend it to be added to anyone 's game collection .
5 #### I purchased this game after reading the overwhelming positive reviews and they are all correct . This is a great game ! I have been playing it with my 13 and 11 year olds and we are having a blast . No two games are the same . Lots of fun !
5 #### This has become our new favorite family game . I had never heard of it until a month ago and decided with such great reviews I should give it a try and order it . My sons are 6 and 8 years old and both love it equally . We love strategizing our routes and showing each other what we have been planning at the end of the game . It truly is a fantastic game and I can see why it is so highly rated .
5 #### If you are looking for a game the whole family will love , get this game . It is colorful , well built and fun . My son loves maps and trains , so this was a win - win . You draw out destinations your trains need to go and you build tracks between here and there . Other train makers can block your path on the way to their destinations and you may have to find another route . We played on Christmas day and we had a great time . This is a well made game and should be in every game - loving family . We are considering purchasing the other versions as well . Good times for all . Update : Just have to say this really is a great game . We play it all of the time . Buy this game !
5 #### I purchased this board game for my daughter for Christmas and the entire family jumped in and played . While not as simple to learn as the directions / reviews state , we did learn pretty quickly how to play and strategize . We struggled to figure out the reasoning behind the destination tickets , but things got clearer when we got help by checking out the many reviews / instructions available on YouTube and elsewhere online . The game goes pretty quickly . It took us about an hour to complete , and we all thoroughly enjoyed the game . The board is quite attractive to the eye and included pieces are well made . There are several other versions of the Ticket to Ride series , and I recommend that you start with this one because of its simplicity . This is an excellent family night board game . Put away the electronics , turn off the TV and gather the family together with this fun game .
5 #### Everyone loves it and plays ! I would say ages 6 and up ... the App is fun too !
5 #### We loved this game , our 7 year old had trouble playing by herself , so we played in teams .
3 #### My kids love board games . Favorite right now is Settlers of Catan . This game not so much . They still never finished playing a whole game as nobody really enjoyed playing . They tried 3x . a lot better games out there .
5 #### fun way to strategize and learn US geography . takes only 1 game to understand how to play . young and old can enjoy as long as they can remember that you have a limited number of tiles and should not over commit .
4 #### Okay , if you like Forbidden Dessert , then this is my second pick . Great game and the more people that play , the more challenging it becomes . A must have .
5 #### This game should be in everyone 's collection . I agree with the age 8 + recommendation , because it does take some strategy and planning . Think Catan minus trading . You buy tickets from one location to another and then strategically map out and build a route using colored train cars . When playing with 4 or more players it can get difficult to take a direct route to your destination , so strategy is key to keeping up . I would recommend this game to people who are willing to sit and play for an extended period of time and are familiar with / ready to learn strategy games .
5 #### I grew up playing Rail Baron , which is an awesome train game but very complicated and takes a long time to play ( seriously , it makes Monopoly look speedy ) . This game feels like a simpler version of Rail Baron , where they kept all of the fun parts . I like that it takes some skill , but not so much that the game is constantly held up while players contemplate their next moves . And you can make it as competitive as you want , by concentrating on your own trips or by purchasing routes that other players will need . You are not set up to fail , like Pandemic . You have to collect resources , but there are always options so you wo n't get stuck waiting for wood and bricks like in Settlers of Cataan . It 's just fun for the whole family .
5 #### Ticket to Ride is a great game for both new comers to modern board games and for veteran players . I want to stress that the game takes on entirely different mechanics for people that play it often . When you first start playing the game , you stay pretty focused on simply making your routes and generally trying to stay out of other peoples way . It 's not hugely interactive and can sometimes feel like multiple people are playing independent games on the same board , only interacting if their paths happen to cross . This completely changes when people get enough experience to start knowing the different routes by memory and start to be able to keep track of their opponents cards and draws . You can start to get a lot more intentional blocking and racing to claim certain key segments , which makes the game a lot more of an interactive and feel more " high stakes " . It also does n't ever really feel " old " or " played out " . Great classic game .
5 #### The game is a fun concept . It moves fairly quickly and only takes about an hour to play a full game . Strategically , there are many options making this highly re - playable . My 8 year old loves the game and has legitimately won a couple times . Be careful when playing with family because it is easy to play defensively by constantly blocking others and spoiling their plans which can lead to less fun experiences ....
5 #### This is an awesome strategy game . One of my new favorite games next to Settlers of Catan .
5 #### What a wonderful game - filled with strategy and challenges . It 's pricey , but it sure beats Monopoly and Uno .
5 #### SUCH A FUN GAME ! SO COMPETITIVE . Prepare to ruin friendships when you steal lines in this game . Seriously . It 's a lot of sun . Lots of planning , but still a fairly fast paced game . Requires thought , but not too much . It 's like a more fun , more competitive monopoly .
5 #### This is such a fun game ! My husband received it as a gift for Christmas and we have already played in multiple times . This is a great strategy game , very fun for adults but also for teens , my 15 year old brother loves this game .
5 #### Perfect game for our family to play together . Great for kids and adults alike .
5 #### A modern classic board game . This game is one that everyone should have . It is super simple to learn , and appeals to a big audience . Board games can be a weird thing , sometimes describing a board game does n't sound like any fun . But , when you play it , somehow it is . This is one of those games that you do n't actually know who won until the very end of the game , which is a huge plus for me . Nothing is more boring than a 2 hour game of Monopoly that has a very obvious winner 30 minutes in . If you are looking at ticket to ride games , start with either this or the European version . PROS : Super Easy to Learn Fun and Simple Gameplay 30 - 60 minutes to play ( More like 60 with newbies , 30 with some experience ) CONS : The cards included are small . If you buy the 1912 expansion , you get larger cards that replace them Completing 5 and 6 train routes usually ends up being the best strategy in this version . I would rather route completion being most important . Another thing that can be fixed with expansions or other versions though . Those looking for deep game play should look elsewhere . This is a great game , but it 's a casual experience . Overall a great casual board game for any group of friends or family . This is a modern classic . Get this or the European version ( Slightly more complex )
5 #### Love this game ! Great game for friends or the family . I recommend this for the hardcore gamers as well as the part time game night crews .
5 #### Great and fun game to play with 2 people or more ! ! Always a hit !
5 #### I first purchased this game in 2006 when my husband and I were dating . He is a locomotive engineer and train nut , and I saw this for the first time at a neat San Francisco game shop . I bought it and gave it to him as a Christmas gift . He loved it and we played it a lot while we were dating . It was fun to play with just the two of us or when we had a group of friends get together for a game night . You do have to think and develop a strategy to achieve success . It 's great to play with two players or several . We have given this game as gifts to other families , and this one was purchased as a gift for a family with children who are 8 and 10 . They love it too .
5 #### We love ticket to ride ! Such a simple game to play but SO MUCH fun ! We play it as a family several times a week . When grandparents come to stay they know they 'll be getting asked which color trains they want before their bags are unpacked . The instructions are easy to read the game is simple in concept but it 's so much fun to block a path or complete your trip ticket ! If you can do both at one time even better . It 's great because we never know who is going to win . We 're pretty hardcore about it . I 'll block my kids in a heartbeat lol ! This game is completely worth the money . Go ahead ! Do it !
5 #### I have seen this game around for a long time , but I never wanted to drop the money to buy it . I found a good deal this Christmas season , so I purchased it . I wish I would have PURCHASED IT SOONER ! What a blast ! Definitely worth the high price !
5 #### kids love this game . hours and hours of fun for them .
5 #### You can see my full video review which also teaches how the game works here - http://www.gameboygeek.com/#!ticket-to-ride/c17gj
5 #### Our whole family loves this game ! We have two boys 6 and 8 , and right now they play as a team and have a great time . The 8 yr old could play on his own , but he has more fun helping his brother . It took us a couple of games to start playing with strategy ( trying to get longest routes , blocking others ' routes ) , but now is pretty simple to understand - but still challenging !
5 #### I am not a board game person but my wife really wanted this ( She 's into board games ) I 've got to say , it is a lot of fun . Easy to learn . We figured it out in like 10 minutes and have played several times .
4 #### This is a fun family or friend game with multiple goals that can be used to make the experience more customized to your skill or experience level . For example , you can learn as you go , playing the basic game , but then create other goals for yourself during the game to balance your game play with the others at the table . This game plays well for our kids ( 8 and up ) who are generally experienced with games . The concepts are not too difficult , and the gameplay is competitive , but not cutthroat . When I first encountered this game , I was turned off by the train focus , but really the trains are just a conduit to express the game play concept . There could be many other environments applied to the game .
5 #### LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME ! ! ! ! super fun ! my entire family gets super into this game when we play it . my parents think its wonderful , and my older brother is gets super competitive ! ! ! ! ! I would defiantly suggest this game for anyone ages 10 + . My boyfriend liked it so much he bought it as a christmas gift for his parents ! :)
5 #### A great game that gets played a lot in my family . Literally hundreds of times !
5 #### We LOVE this game ! We play this at our usual game nights every week , and particularly love this game because it is fairly easy to pick up and understand . Like most games , this does take a long time to play- about 1.5 to 2 hours . But it is worth the action ! We have some older friends in their 60 's that have even enjoyed playing this game- and they are gamers AT ALL . Its a good one to introduce people to .
5 #### THE RECIPIENT 'S WERE DELIGHTED . BOTH GAMES ARRIVED ON TIME .....
5 #### Excellent game , model the possible actions for each turn before play so everyone is on the same page . Took several hours with 3 players , but we loved every minute . Friendly competition reigned , but nothing as obnoxious as Risk . Will play again . Only criticism : for 3 , there were not enough cars to cover every track , which was our objective .
5 #### This is a gift for our friend who is a big train buff . The reviews are very promising .
5 #### After reading reviews saying how great this game is , i decided to try it . I found the instructions to be super complicated , but as soon as we started playing , it was so easy to understand - even for my 10 - yr old . I 've only played a 2 - person game so far , but i 'm loving it . The games move quite quickly , and learning geography is a nice bonus .
5 #### One of our favorite games . Able to play with kids and adults . People come over and they all want to play ticket to ride .
5 #### Family favorite . Great for kids and adults . Good replay value .
1 #### Bought this game based on all the good reviews . Just sold it for cheap at a yard sale . Hard to figure out and nobody in our family liked it .
5 #### I absolutely love this game ! It is one of my all time favorites and love introducing people to it
5 #### Great Family Game ! ! Entertaining enough for adults .... but also easy enough for my 6 - year old to play competitively !
5 #### great family game . helps my son also learn the united states and the geography .
5 #### Awesome . I love playing this game with my friends . It 's really amazing and captive . Thanks
5 #### AWESOME game ! I love board games , my kids love board games , my husband does n't .... but even he likes this game ! Different every time you play it , you are able to hold a conversation while playing , it is fast moving ( but takes about 1 hour to play ) , and super fun .
5 #### Fun to play . Learned to play it with my 14 year old grand - daughter .
5 #### this game is awesome . so much fun with family and friends . well worth the price
5 #### Our family LOVES this game ! Family game night inevitable involves at least one round of Ticket to Ride ! It 's made for 2 to 5 players - occasionally when we have more than 5 players - we make everyone double up and play with teams . But no one minds because it 's such a fun game . After the second or third time you play it - you 'll come to pay more attention to what other players are doing - and it can get kinda cut throat ... LOL
4 #### Pretty decent game , though it can drag on towards the end as players keep drawing and drawing filling their hands with cards waiting for the right one
5 #### Super simple dynamics , and a great game for friends , family , kids , etc . ! Easy to learn , and variety of play is good .
5 #### Nice , easy and fairly fast paced . It goes well with out family game nights . Can give you some anxiety whilst you wait for that one colour you need complete a line but good fun . I also recommend the Europe version . I think I prefer that one a little more as it has stations that allow you to use other people 's lines . It causes less fights
5 #### This game is a blast to play , especially with people who are n't used to non - traditional board games ( Monopoly , Risk , Clue , etc ) . Little downtime between turns , simple to learn but difficult to master , Ticket to Ride is the best way to get non - board game friends into the whole speil !
5 #### My 8 year old just got this game for his birthday and we played for the first time last night . Everyone LOVED it . It was a little slow getting started since none of us had played before and were n't familiar with the strategy , but once we got started , everyone- including my 6 year old- picked it up quickly and really enjoyed the game .
4 #### I think this game is better suited for our nephew than us . Great game and he loves it but we would n't buy it for ourselves .
5 #### Great game for 2 to 5 players . Have to use much different strategy the more plays you have .
5 #### A great game to convert classic gamers into modern gamers .
5 #### Sister 's family have been playing with this game for a year now and they love it . They have a large family and everyone is able to play .
5 #### I bought this after watching a YouTube video showing how it is played . This is by far our favorite new family game . My older children ( ages 10 & 8) have no issues understanding how to play , and have picked up on strategy after playing just a few times . Less complicated than Risk and more complex than Clue , which makes it perfect for our family . This will be a family favorite for many years .
5 #### This is a great game and a great franchise . I played the iOS version and then bought this . It 's even better in person
5 #### Arrived as described and as promised . Great game ! ! ! My children are older and we had a blast as a family playing this game . Enough strategy to keep you interested but simple enough to have relaxed family fun .
5 #### Fun game and everyone who has played has caught on quickly ( except for one person who is elderly ) . Game has a good replay value since the destination cards you receive are random each game . There is also an expansion for this that would make the game more fun as well since it offers more destination options . I like that when we play the first person out ahead is n't always the one that wins , strategy and luck are important in winning .
5 #### Got this as a present for my husband and he is in love with the game .. It requires a mix of strategy and luck .. A bit difficult to understand at first but once you start playing it becomes super easy . Played with my 12 year old brother who also loves the game .
5 #### Hands down one of the best board games I 've ever played and also helped renew my friends ' interest in board games . Buy this game . You wo n't regret it .
5 #### Easy to learn and fun to play . Even little kids can get in on the action if they team up with an older kid or an adult .
5 #### Grandkids like to play it and it is a great game
4 #### Family fun game ! I think it 's an expensive price for a game but it 's obviously fun enough that I spent the money on it .
5 #### Fun game for all family members 8 + . We 've bought this game for our family and given it several times as a gift . This is a family favorite .
4 #### It 's a fun game . It takes strategy and builds thinking skills . We have played it often when friends are over .
4 #### Our family loves this game ! I saw it at Target but was able to buy it on amazon for $ 20 less . Very glad I did . This is easy enough for all ages but allows for strategy and keeps you interested . This game is one of our new family favorites .
5 #### BEST GAME EVER . This was actually the last board game I played with my Dad before he passed away . I will always play it thinking of him and his model train set that he loved . A great game for young and old , we will play it for years to come . My husband and I love to play a 2 - player mega game , where we each choose two colors of trains and play until we run out of ticket cards or trains . Definitely more fun than a short 2 person game . We use the rules like there are 4 people and see who can have the longest continuous route . Great with a cold beer and a good classic movie .
5 #### Such a fun family game ! I bought this for my husband after we played it at a friend 's house . One of my the reasons I bought it is because we can play it just the two of us as well . I love that it has an expansion pack . Once we get better at it we will buy that as well . Really fun and challenging game . There is a a reason it is one of the top games !
5 #### A great basic staple for anyone 's tabletop collection . Ticket to Ride is not only fun , but also ( somewhat ! ) educational for those of you who , like me , are not so good with basic geography . I like that you can keep score during the game ( exercising those math skillz ) using the border of the game board and that the scoring markers and train pieces are nice 3D tokens ( wooden and plastic respectively ) , as opposed to the cardboard , 2D crap you see everywhere these days . Some things to keep in mind : even though you can play with five players , I would recommend keeping it around three or four unless you impose a time limit on turns because people can take FOREVER to make decisions , which can stall gameplay and turn it into a " when is it my turn again ? " type of game . Overall , Ticket to Ride " is a very fun game and great for a family or friends boardgame night .
5 #### This is the game i use to get friends and family into board games . Simple rules make it ideal to pick up and play .
4 #### Fun party game but not so fun you want to play it constantly over and over . Its a good game to pull out every once in a while with a group for 4 or 5 . Ticket to Ride is not too difficult to learn we had kids playing as low as 8 years old but I would n't recommend it for anyone under that age . I bought this game for around $ 35 but I think it 's worth it at about $ 30 .
5 #### My wife and I absolutely love this game ! It is very easy to learn and play , but there is an opportunity for deep strategy . The concept is simple : collect cards and build trains to connect destinations using those matching cards . You can choose to connect the destinations that will give you the most points , choose the routes that give you the most points , or try and block your opponent from reaching their destinations . This game can be learned in a matter of minutes and is very fun to play over and over again . The game board and parts are made of quality materials and I expect this game to last for a long time . Definitely recommend this game . We play with 2 people , but it is fun with more as well !
5 #### It 's a great game . We play it with our board gaming group each week and we really get into it - almost too much . Lol
5 #### One of the best games I have tried . Great family game or starting game for people who want to get into tabletop games .
4 #### My children ( ages 12 - 18 ) and we the parents enjoy this game . It was easy to understand and was pretty quick paced . We purchased this off of a recommendation of a friend of ours . Not bad . Looking for something that was different than your normal board games and we ordered this one and Catan .
5 #### All ages of the family love this game , Granna in her 60s , parents in their 40s and kids in their tweens and teens .
5 #### An easy to learn and set up game that 's fun for a group of people . I 've heard it 's a great introduction game to more in depth games and I would have to agree to that . There are many different strategies to play out and you have to adjust as you play .
5 #### Great game for the whole family ! From Elementary age children to adults ! Hours of fun ! The expansion pack provides regular sized cards and more destination cards . Would recommend purchasing the game along with the expansion pack .
5 #### Do you love board games ? Do you love something with a little strategy that does n't take hours to learn ? Are you sick of the same tired old ideas being reproduced in some " new " game ? Welcome aboard Ticket to Ride . Ticket to Ride is a refreshingly fun game that is great for the entire family , or a group of adults for that matter . It is a quick game to learn , even a novice can have the hang of it in 15 minutes . Select your missions , draw your cards , and lay tracks across the US to begin racking up points . The game play moves rapidly enough to keep it from getting boring and there is some strategy involved but not enough to make it tedious . This is a favorite both with our family and with our friends when they come to visit . There is nothing bad I can say about this game , it is definitely in our top three all time favorites .
4 #### Great game , works for all ages . Has strategy and is insanely easy to pick up . It 's a great game to own as a gateway to harder board games .
4 #### Hey , this is really fun ! I do take issue with the assertion that the game can be learned " in 5 minutes , " though . For our family if was more like 15 or 20 . Not that it 's difficult , but it does take some time to read through the rules and understand the setup and game instructions . Once we got rolling , though , it was a lot of fun , and I can see why it 's so popular . We have young kids ( 7 and 10 ) who both picked it up ( the 7 yo with some help ) and who are looking forward to playing again . Our only complaint is that the train map labels Minneapolis , MN as Duluth ? I guess they did n't think map accuracy was terribly critical . It does n't impact the game in any way , it 's just a weird thing to get wrong .
5 #### Love the game , my friends are I are addicted to it . Update : We played as a family game and my niece loved it too . Bought another one for her and she is happy with her holiday gift now :)
5 #### This is such a fun time and great game . So fun to play in our family . Great for adults too
5 #### Such a fun family game . This is one of our favorites to play on family game night .
5 #### I had heard about this game so i defiantly wanted to pick it up and it did not let me down . It is very fun . It is a strategy game but its easy to pick up . I 've had friends play it who are n't into board games and they really enjoyed it . Great game to pick up
5 #### I love this game . I can play it with my friends or my grandkids . We plot and scheme to get the longest railroad .
5 #### We love this game ! It 's one of our favorites . We take it to all our family gatherings and always enjoy a good game .
5 #### Kid likes it a lot . To help learning curve , there are ' How to Play ' videos on YouTube that help a lot . Paying time is about 1 hour which is good for younger kids .
5 #### Great game . My 8 year old loves it and my 5 year old can play with just a little help . It is a lot of fun and does n't get old !
5 #### Great game for Family and Friends alike ! I would recommend for any group that enjoys games .
5 #### Apparently they do play board games in college . This is all the rage on campus and a request from the dorm .
5 #### This is a great game . Our family really enjoys playing this and it has become a go- to game in our house .
5 #### Fun and very involved game . It 's not for little kids though . You have to pay attention and it takes awhile .
5 #### We have n't opened ours yet but we bought it after playing the same game with our friends that already owned it . It was so much fun , we had to get it . The game is somewhere between Risk and Monopoly , except played out quicker(not too quick ! ) and had just enough strategies to keep everyone happy .
4 #### This game is a lot of fun and we have played it with board gamers and non - board gamers with positive outcomes each time . Only negative is that it does get repetitive after a few plays and you can quickly devise strategies that will easily help you win . There are expansion packs for it that might make it a bit more difficult or more fun , but we have n't tried this . If you 're looking for an easy to get into , relaxed game then try it out . You 'll probably enjoy it .
5 #### Love this game . The whole family has been able to play easily . This is the kind of game that can get complicated by how aggressive the play is . A great game for family game night because it does not have a huge time requirement so allows you to play other games in the evening . Nice finish for the game and pieces .
5 #### My favorite game . Love playing it no matter how many times I 've already played .
5 #### This game met all our expectations ! We played it at a friend 's house and had a good time , and thought it would be a good game for the kids to play , ages 6 and 9 and also be educational for them . The game came in good condition , no complaints from us here !
5 #### My husband and I really enjoy this board game . It is a lot of fun to play with both 2 and 4 players . I purchased this game because it is by the same creators of " Catan " and I am extremely happy with my purchase . I would recommend to anyone who loves playing board games ( I have actually already recommended two of my to buy it ! )
5 #### Kids love this game . So much fun ! It 's been awhile since we 've found a game that the younger kids like playing with our older daughter . Great game for a wide gap in age groups . :)
5 #### Stands the test of time ... our family still plays this after 2 years !
5 #### Incredibly , this game brings me back to the world of childhood . Big thanks to the developers of this board game , which tried their best . You can call your friends and I 'll guarantee you that the time flies by and fun . So , this game allows you to travel through rail , to buy and sell tickets . To some extent this is like travelling in a time machine , because all objects are made in the style of the 19th century . This is a game for adults and kids !
5 #### We love this game . Instructions are a little confusing at first , but once we started playing we could n't stop . Probably best for age 10 and up .
5 #### We LOVE this game . We play Settlers of Cataan and Risk , etc . and this game is shorter and fun .
4 #### It 's an ok game , great intro for beginners . Not a lot of conflict or backstabbing , most people have fun with it . I do n't play it as much now because I feel there 's not as much replay value in the base game , but will pull it out if there 's someone new to board games who is interested in learning .
5 #### So my wife and I enjoy playing board games together . This game is , hands down , one of the best family games out there . No wonder it 's one of the top sellers on the market . It 's a casual game and mildly competitive ( tactical train placements ) but gives you enough goals to never get bored . The more players there are , the more fun it is .
5 #### great game for middle age kids - boys especially
5 #### Fun game that is a reasonably quick play . My wife and I have played this on our own and also with a group totaling 5 players . It is a fun game that is different each time . It is not a terribly long play which makes it great for a quicker evening game . I 'd say our games ran about 30 minutes . I 'd recommend this as a great game to have . I do wish the cards were larger though as I find them difficult to shuffle because of their size .
5 #### Was n't sure about this game but we ended up loving it . Play it with the grandchildren and it is easy enough for the young ones but still fun for the older ones .
4 #### I bought this because my adult cognitively disabled son likes trains and because it has favorable reviews . I am pleased with the game : the physical components are solid and attractive ( but the train cards are too small to shuffle easily ) . The rules were clear and we were up and playing with a minimum of effort . The game is simple enough that my son was able to play independently and even win a game , but there is enough variety and challenge to keep adults interested for the course of the game . It takes around an hour for us to play , meaning we can play once or twice in an evening . For an adult it is not an intellectually demanding game ; it strikes the right balance between relaxing and entertaining . If you have been playing standard games like Monopoly and Clue , Ticket to Ride will be an excellent addition to your repertoire . If you 're new to boardgaming , it 's a good place to start . If you 're a hardcore , experienced gamer it probably wo n't keep you entertained by itself , but it 's something you can play with kids and beginners , or just for a little light entertainment . For us , it 's hard to find a game that can entertain all of us without being too difficult for an adult with a cognitive disability . Ticket to Ride hits that sweet spot .
5 #### Fun family game . We play with all our members - youngest is 7 . younger players may need a little help reading the cards and understanding where things are on the board at first . But it works .
5 #### Great game ! The whole family loves is from 8 year old daughter to 70 + grandparents . Highly recommend !
5 #### GREAT GAME ! I have an 8 year old son and a 12 year old daughter and we love playing this game as a family . Takes some time to set up and learn how to play the game , but it 's great family fun !
5 #### This is such a fun game for our whole family . It 's a fun way to learn the location of the 50 states . As a homeschool mom I am always looking for ways to make learning fun . We play with our 7 , 9 and 11 year old kids and they all enjoy it .
5 #### My family loves it . The game looks so much better in person . Its real fun and easy to play .
4 #### Novel and lots of fun ! The number of players is quite limited because of the finite number of tracks available , so be aware of that . Score - keeping is a bit of a pain , too , especially if you 're used to playing the app , which does all of that for you . But still definitely worth getting if you have a boardgame crowd !
5 #### I 'm on a board game kick especially after Table Top .... I 'm an avid Catan player ... I just picked up Dead of Winter ( excellent game ) , Last night on earth , Flash Point , Pandemic , 7 Wonders ( not a fan ) , Love Letter , Munchkin ... and after rave reviews and making it to the must own / have list now Ticket to Ride . With the games mentioned above ... the issue that happens are rules ... most games there are a lot of rules . They become difficult to remember and basically you end up playing and winning or losing incorrectly . Not Ticket to Ride ... it took about 5 - 10 minutes to fully understand the game and after a couple of moves you totally get the game . Super fun , easy to play and there are strategic / gambles that you make .... like how long do you gamble on a route ? What routes are other people doing ? Can you stop them or should you hold out for that one color train card ! ? !
5 #### Kids loved this game . Adults joined in and played on their own once kids went to bed . Highly recommend .
5 #### This is easily one of our families favorite board games . Our whole family loves to play this game . Lots of strategy involved , although it is pretty easy to learn . Be prepared for some " heated " discussions ! One thing to note ... we added a " house rule " to this game . We use a die to determine how many train cards to pick instead of only having to pick two train cards . This makes the game go a little faster ... although it is very annoying when someone rolls a " 1 " !
5 #### My kids new favorite game - and mine too ! They love the concept and having to plan out their route and possibly blocking their sibling or parent IF they can figure out where we are trying to go . I love that it makes them think BUT games can be as short at 20 minutes , or up to an hour , but not never ending like Monopoly or Settlers .
5 #### Ticket to Ride is worth every penny . It comes with tons of replay value , it 's great for table top parties and get togethers with friends and family game nights , it 's incredibly fun , and a single game takes anywhere better 30 mins to an hour depending on the board game experience of everybody playing .
5 #### We love this game . It 's a great game that both kids and adults can play together and both will enjoy .
5 #### Interesting game .... but requires lots of focus ... not for younger children or infantile adults .
5 #### CLEVER game . Not fast paced at all , but keeps your interest the whole time ! Excellent !
5 #### Bought this for my daughter and her family for Christmas ( 2 boys ages 11 and 8) . They really enjoy it a lot . She specifically wanted the version that was n't too competitive , and this is it .
5 #### We are avid train fans , and I waited to buy Ticket to Ride until my kids got old enough to play it ( 6 and 9 , no problems aside from the little one 's occasional struggles with the concept of playing fair . ) The playing time can run a little long -- not unlike traditional Monopoly , which sometimes is a fast affair and sometimes drags out . But we have thoroughly enjoyed Ticket to Ride since Christmas , and already have expansion packs on the birthday wish list .
5 #### Great game ! I 've heard about this game for several years and finally had the opportunity to play with some friends . I had to buy my own . The difficult part was to choose which country to purchase .
5 #### My son says this game is terrific for his kids .
4 #### I played last night for the first time . Once with 2 players and another time with 3 players . I like it cause the rules are pretty simple and it 's fun ( maybe it 's because I won twice ) ! It 'll be interesting to play with more than 3 players because I 'm pretty sure your routes will get blocked more often . It is a little pricey but the quality is good for what you pay for .
4 #### This was purchased by our SGA for the students to play .
5 #### I love this game and we got it as a family gift however I have n't played it yet so ca n't comment with any authority . I love the idea and the pieces !
5 #### Awesome Game ! Purchased two years ago and the whole family still enjoys playing this game . My kids were 6 , 7 and 8 when I got it and everyone understood the rules and how to play . Now that they are older , they are beginning to play more strategic ( thanks to their dad ! ) and it 's become a cut throat game night for us . But all fair in love and war ! Would definitely recommend if your family enjoys playing board games !
5 #### Love this game ! It really is a game you can plan with just about any group and have a great time . Not too thinky and not too simple . Highly recommended for any level of gamer . Use this to hook non gamers !
5 #### Great game . Fun to play and takes some planning .
5 #### Pros : Great easy game to play as a family Does n't take too long to complete Great strategy game , makes you think Cons : Instructions are poorly written , had to YouTube how to play
5 #### This is a balanced simple game that is fun to play over and over . Yes there are expansions galore . No , you do n't need to buy them all . If you get one expansion pack , I 'd suggest Ticket To Ride India . It 's a crazy mash - up of cities , so less predictable to play for North Americans . Here 's how the game rates following my Five Gaming Criteria that I use for all game reviews : 1 . Competition : This game is competitive , with players facing off against each other . But the competition is very mild as winning is determined by a final tally at the end . I like games of this kind , so give it a high score for competition . 2 . Design : A simple design , nothing frilly or fancy . However , the design works well and does n't get in the way . I give it a moderate score for design . 3 . Enjoyment : This is an enjoyable game in that you can talk to each other while playing , take it easy , etc . I think the simplicity of the game makes it more fun to play . 4 . Learning Curve : This game takes very little time and energy to learn . If you 're not able to learn games like Civilization , this game is for you . It 's very easy to play . 5 . RePlayability : We 've played this game over and over again . While expansions make it more replayable , given the new terrain in each one , even just the original board / game is replayable . I give it a high replayability score .
5 #### Good game . I bought for my 8 year - old girl who loves board games a lot but it took a while for her to understand the rule and the concept .
5 #### Fun family game . Kids age 7 and 10 love it .
4 #### Pretty fun ! We 've only played it with two people , but I think it would be pretty fun with a group . Easy to learn , friendly for all ages .
5 #### Wow , indeed . From the very first move to the end , my heart was pounding , it hooked me with all the decisions to be made : do I get cards , do I get the wild card , do I lay track , do I lay track to thwart other players , do I get more tickets ... and yet , there was never a moment of " analysis paralysis " , the game kept < ahem > chugging along , and there was never a time that I felt any of the players no longer had a chance to win . Great game .
5 #### This is one of my favorite games ! We play this all the time with friends - it 's quick to learn and not super complicated . Older children - probably 9 or above - would be find learning to play as well .
5 #### I have played this game again and again with my 11,8,7,6 , and even my 4 year old ! ( with help from Mom and Dad of course ) it is interesting and keeps their interest for the whole game was hesitant but I am SO glad we bought this game thank you !
5 #### Very fun and challenging game ! I really like that you can only do one action per turn and it speeds up the game . Games really only do last 30 - 45 minutes once you understand the rules .
5 #### Our new favorite family board game . A game that is fun , requires thought , planning and is a blast to play . I highly recommend this game for those people who like games such as Power Grid and Risk .
5 #### Fun game . Got it for my husband for christmas and we 've had fun with it !
4 #### I 've played this one plenty of times in the past but decided to get a new copy for myself and my wife ( I left my old copy with my ex wife ) because I thought it would be great for playing with her family . Truly this is a great family game with fast play and easy rules , people of all ages can enjoy the game . That said the rules still have a few errors in them and as always the game is a little predictable without the expansion ( you get to know the destinations very rapidly ) . Despite these limitations , this is a good game for families and friends .
5 #### Once we played the game we were hooked . Fun for 2 - 5 players , which is great because it 's hard to find games that are fun for 2 . Takes less than an hour for my husband and I to play a game . Our family has played it at least a dozen times since Christmas --- still fun . Highly recommend it for ages 8 to adult .
5 #### This game is my passion , and I 'm not even that big on board games . I just love the complexity and the element of chance . Each time we play , the game seems different and it 's a great family bonding experience .
4 #### Fun once you get the hang of it . Family of 5 playing for the first time it was a bit hard with having to explain the details to young kids ( 7 , 9 , and 10 years ) . Once we finished though they said they enjoyed it . Expensive .
5 #### This is a great game . Takes a little multitasking , so to speak , but so much fun to play after you learn how .
4 #### We LOVE this game ! It 's really such a blast to play . We saw it on Table Top and had to have it . We also purchased it for my niece is is on the spectrum for autism . We did our research and it 's a great game for any age .
5 #### My daughter thought this was a great Christmas present .
5 #### Love this game . Wish more than 5 could play at a time .
5 #### Great game . Dare I say I like it more than the kids even :)
5 #### We have been addicts since Christmas ! Most of the game we are quietly freaking out that someone is going to take our spot on the board . Kind of stressful but so fun !
5 #### When looking for games that we can play with our extended family , they need to have the following criteria : 1 ) no acting , drawing , or creative stuff for the shy people , 2 ) no complicated or changing rules for the impatient people , 3 ) at least 4 players . A friend suggested Ticket to Ride and hit the nail on the head ! Everyone was happy and we 've played it at holiday gatherings the last two years .
5 #### I have been considering this game for years ! this year I finally bought it for my 8 and 10 year olds . I was n't sure what all the hype was about and could hardly believe that there 're were so many positive reviews . It is like no one gives it negative reviews . Well , after playing , I can understand why . It is a really fun game and has a lot of replay value . The instructions were fairly clear , although I had to reread a couple of the sections because I was confused . The best thing is to read them and start playing and some of the confusion clears up as you go and refer back to the instructions . I think we will play this game quite a bit .
5 #### What is not to love about this game ? The rules are fairly simple and easy to follow . The set up is very easy and quick . The game play needs you to think and put some thought into your strategy . It is quick and easy to learn and younger children can probably pick up the point of the game quickly . We played with an 11 year old but a smart kid who is 9 or 10 could easily play with no problems I believe . Do you use your pieces to block other players ? Do you start to lay down track just anywhere because it might help you in the future ? Do you take extra route pieces because then you can pick and choose your routes ? How do you use your turn because you can only do one thing- draw cards , play cards to make a route , a pick new route cards ? My youngest , age nine , who is a get up and go full of energy kid , enjoyed playing this game with the family . It is not a short game ( It took us about an hour to play our first game but the time in play has decreased to about 30 minutes or 45 minutes now ) . Lots of fun . Well worth the money . Enjoy .
5 #### I first encountered Ticket to Ride with my family back home and decided to buy it to play with college friends . We all love it -- it is the perfect game for players of all ages , well balanced , strategic , and well laid out . I highly recommend this as a family game , a game with friends , or even a game with archnemeses . The best part is that it 's really hard to tell who 's winning until the end !
5 #### This is probably our favorite game ! Ticket to Ride can be played by adults and children together with out the adults needing to " let " a child win . It teaches strategy , is simple enough to allow for conversations during play , and is easy to learn ! I love how much geography my children have learned through these games ! We now own both the US and European versions . ( Note , the US version is far more similar to the current geography than the European version is to current European geography . It provides for good conversation about the change of political borders and city names . ) We 've given this as a gift multiple times as well . ( The children in our home who can play this independently are ages 7 , 9 & 11 ) .
5 #### We love this game ! I knew I just had to purchase it for a 9 - year - old boy that asked for board games for Christmas .
5 #### This game is the absolute favorite in our house , from ages 8 and up .
1 #### I am not a huge board game player so I am not speaking from a place of master knowledge however , I am totally dumbfounded by the amount of reviews of this game let alone the high stars of this game . Can you say , " boring ? " Seriously --- are people starving for stimulation in a board game since othello or risk that they would rate this 5 stars ? This game is so boring that it will put a 2 year old to sleep . Yeah ... yeah ... yeah you have to look at your train cards and destination cards and figure out how do I get the most points from " A " city to " B " city but what a snore ! We did not even finish the game . My kids love board games like monopoly , clue , life , and risk so I purchased this game for us to play over Christmas Break ... We quit after playing 15 minutes --- so stupid .
5 #### Do n't let the number of pieces overwhelm you- the game is extremely quick to pick up and its intensity is measured only by your playmates .
5 #### Just try not to like it , I dare you . Blessed with an easy rule set , fun presentation , and the fact that everyone is in the game right up to the end , Ticket to Ride is one of best games I have ever played . Luck , strategy , and the ability to screw over your friend & loved ones . This is the game that should replace those moldy old family game night staples like Monopoly . It may not keep the kids off their phones , but it can make them forget about it for an hour .
5 #### Fun . Easy to learn . Easy to play . Quick games . It requires strategy . Not much chance involved at all . No dice . Depending upon the crew you play with , it can become quite cutthroat . That said , it can be a fun family game as well . My crew is cutthroat and we enjoy it a great deal .
5 #### I am ADDICTED to this game . Since getting it a couple of weeks ago my bf and I have played it almost every day . Also taught my dad how to play in 5 minutes so it 's great for newbies .
5 #### This is a great game . It has ended up in regular rotation during Sunday night game night and has simple rules that are easy to learn along with a very competitive structure .
5 #### This is one of the best easy to learn games out there , and nobody I 've introduced it to has ever been disappointed . It is simple to learn , but there is still a lot of strategy , which is the best thing that can be said about a game . I 'm looking forward to playing it with my kids when they get a bit older .
4 #### The family is split on this game . Husband & Son like it .
5 #### Ticket to ride is a fantastic game and i can not sing it 's praise enough . Ticket to Ride is a Gateway board game that will unlock a world of many other games in your future , but even after that happens you will still come back to this undeniable classic . Great for children and adults ticket to ride plays up to 5 players as they collect tickets and try to connect the cities listed on the tickets by amassing colored train cards that match corresponding spaces on the board . Buy it today and show your family that friends do n't let friends play monopoly .
5 #### Great game for an adult game night or to play with your kids / family . Our 10 yr old son loves it .
4 #### Fun game . The instructions were hard to follow so we watched a how to on YouTube and then had a blast .
5 #### This is a great game and one of my favorites . It has enough strategy and different aspects to keep people engaged and definitely requires some thought to win . Only 5 people can play , however , and the more people that play the longer the game takes to complete . Two players can get through a game in 45 minutes to an hour .
5 #### We 've had a very good time learning and playing this game , and recommend it as a great family activity . The game 's minimum age recommendation seems about right . Some reviews mention how easy it is to pick up , but the typical initial reaction in our group was that it was a bit complicated . That feeling was gone after about 15 minutes of play , so do n't be discouraged at the start . The object of the game is to score the most points through completing rail routes and destinations . The game offers the opportunity to either work on your own score or block scoring by opponents . That enhances continuous and humorous interactions between players , and makes for a lot of fun . We 've also found that it takes a little longer to complete the game than noted in the instructions ( maybe 2 hours ? ) , but that time will shrink over time and play can always be halted sooner if so desired . We recommend the game , its a lot of fun !
5 #### This is another one of our favorite board games . We highly recommend it , as it is easy to set up and learn . This is a great game to take with you on a family vacation . We always take it with us on our cabin vacations . A+ !
5 #### My husband and I play with our 8 and 10 year olds . They both really enjoy it . The 8yr old just turned 8 and can play . He is a little slow on his turn but really does understand what he is doing and loves it .
5 #### Great game for kids and adults to play together , even my 6 - year old can do it !
5 #### My brother bought this game for my then-6 - year - old daughter , and it immediately became her favorite game EVER . Having said that , I also completely agree with other reviewers who have stressed that the age recommendation of 8 + is accurate . However , if you have a " gifted " child with an insatiable hunger for new and better challenges , then by all means give this game a go with your 6 or 7 year old , but they 'll need to have an astonishingly long attention span or the whole endeavor will turn out poorly . This game is actually fun and engaging for adults as well as children , so if the kids are n't ready for it yet , it 's not a total loss . I 'll never play Monopoly or Life again ; I 've been thoroughly converted to more ambitious games , thanks to Ticket To Ride !
5 #### A fun strategy game that is easy enough for small groups who may have trouble with more complicated games like Catan or Munchkin . You collect colored cards and lay them down in sets to create your train routes . It 's easy enough to modify for a child as well .
5 #### Just an awesome Game . Easy to play while drinking , not too much thinking , but stragity is invovled
5 #### Yes , this is the best board game I 've played for a long time . Easy to get into but still requires thinking and strategy . I would highly recommend this to anyone .
5 #### While this game is a lot of fun I have notes . Some people are complaining this game is too complicated . I had three people all completely drunk play it for the first time and they all figured it out . Though I would not recommend playing with drunk people as they take forever to take their turn and have to take frequent urination breaks . I would suggest using an egg timer for those fun sponges . My daughter is 5.5 and she figured it out . I mean she did n't completely get the strategy but she knew how to play the first time out . So it 's not too complicated . Others have mentioned they do n't like when their routes get blocked . Boy so many comments I could make to those crybabies . This is the god damn industrial revolution people welcome to ' Merica . I ca n't hear you ducks quacking becuase I 'm up here soaring with the Eagles . I like the quickness of the game played it four times with friends at a cabin last weekend . I actually think I enjoyed it the least of the five or six people who played and I am still giving it a five star review because I really feel the replay value is there and also like I 'm just scratching the surface of some of the complexity of the strategy that can be used .
5 #### Our kids love this game . One thing is that it says it takes a half hour to play but takes us much longer .
5 #### Fun , entertaining game for kids and adults . My third grader loves it , it 's too tough for my kindergartener .
5 #### Fun game . Would like to try the other sets . More fun with 3 + players .
5 #### This game has become one of our family favorites ! I play with my eight year old son , my seven year old daughter , and my five year old daughter . It 's a great game and finally after months of me winning every game , my kids have all beaten me at least once ( and I do not believe in throwing a game ) . The board is set up like a map of the United Sates and each person is giving routes that they have to complete . You get points for completing your route , or you lose those points if you do n't get them . The concept is relatively easy , but it 's a lot of fun ! I only have one real issue with this game and that is that the cards used are small cards - not your standard playing card size . It 's terribly annoying for shuffling , etc . I really wish they 'd make them standard size instead .
5 #### Great buy , love playing this game with my family .
5 #### This game is so much fun . I 've played many times at family gatherings and have finally gotten around to purchasing this for myself .
5 #### This was one of the first designer board games I purchased because I loved it so much . It 's simple and easy to teach but hard to master and has a lot of strategy and replay value . When explaining it to people it 's hard to get them interested in a game where you lay trains and build tracks across the country but everyone I 've taught has really taken to it .
3 #### Kids would give this game 5 stars . Mom would give this game 1 star . Kids say it is a lot of fun , but the mom ca n't stand to listen to all the fighting and yelling this game creates . Game seems to be mostly the luck of the draw , and being sneaky ( so says the little brother ) but if the little brother puts a game piece in a spot that blocks the impatient , older brother , you will see why this mom does not allow it to be played anymore . :)
5 #### Ticket to Ride is simple a lot of fun to play . The directions to play are easy to understand and to follow ; there is no complicated parts to assemble ; and it is very easy to set up and play . Playing time runs about an hour , with three of us playing . Some strategy is useful in winning , but simple straight forward play can also help you win the game .
5 #### This is a fun game to play , and it is n't hard to set up or figure out .
5 #### Great game for anyone ! This game moves really quickly with 2 people so it is fun to play multiple rounds . I love how you can decide whether or not you want to play maliciously ( i.e. , take over someone else 's route , or be nice and find a different way ) . Great game all around and have gifted it twice already !
5 #### We 've really enjoyed this game ! My Dad , who is n't really into playing games with us even plays ! It 's a great family game . Lots of fun and different every time you play ! I am very happy to have used my birthday gift card on this game :)
3 #### I wish there was more interaction between the players . The only time you really interact with the other plays is to say,"I needed that route ! " . It really seems like all the players are playing their own game and then just compare scores at the end to see who won .
5 #### this is one of our favorite games to bring out when we have company over
5 #### This game has a good mix of strategy with luck . The rules are very simple that no one will feel overwhelmed .
5 #### This was a gift to family members at Christmas . They thoroughly enjoy the game .
5 #### A very simple game with very simple mechanics . Like most simple games there are only a small set of winning strategies / gambits . But once you get 3 or 4 people around the board who know those strategies the game comes to life . You have to act and react to each player as they play or else your strategy may become obsolete . As for playability , there is virtually no down time as each player can play their turn in mere seconds so the games proceed at lightning speed . It is quite amazing how quickly all of the train cars are deployed . All in all a highly recommended game . Good for kids 8 and up ( in my experience ) .
5 #### This game is quick to learn and easy to play while still carrying on a conversation . My adult friends love it , while my teenagers are n't so enthralled . Of course , that could be simply because I am making them play a game instead of sitting in front of the computer . But when the adults sit down to play , we will still be going at it many hours and games later .
5 #### This is the game that got me started into the hobby a few months ago . I had never played any other board game beside Monopoly and Parcheesi ... so this was it . What else can I say about this game that has n't already been said .. it is pretty much the perfect gateway game , the one that you can show to someone and who does n't play board games and probably hook him / her into it . It 's one of my favorites and it 's pretty much as you can see in all the other reviews , a game that 's in every gamer 's shelf . If you like having fun , GET THIS IMMEDIATELY .
5 #### great game . love it . received in great condition and very quickly .
5 #### My all - time favorite board game . It 's a great 2 player game , which my husband and I have a hard time finding . If you 're looking for a new game , this one is a must try .
5 #### I day I received the game from ThinkFun I sat down to play it . My original intention was just to see how it worked as it has a very interesting look to it . However , I ended up playing for over an hour and worked through the first 10 challenges . I had n't realized I had been sitting for so long because I was having so much fun moving the little cars around to allow the red car to move forward and out of the gridlock it found itself in . I had things I had to do , so I put it away , but no more than an hour passed before I had the game out again and worked through several more challenges . I found the game to be extremely fun , challenging , and addictive . I think that anyone of any age who loves puzzles or other similar games will love Rush Hour .
5 #### I love this game ! I like the new modern more age neutral look of it . It is challenging enough to get the attention of an adult and fun enough to keep a kid entertained for hours . There are so many challenges to complete ! It is well worth every penny and a great addition to anyone 's game library ! Check out my more detailed review with pictures here : [ ... ]
5 #### A great game for all ages ! Even though the " kids " no longer live at home , our family still enjoys getting together for board games now and then . This is a great addition to our lineup of classics ! The rules are a bit complicated , but are easy to pick up once you start playing the game . This game can be played in a very friendly way or very competitively , so it 's lots of fun for the whole family . You never know who is going to win until the end .
5 #### Love to play this version game as well as the others . It has been a family favorite .
5 #### This is one of the most fun games we have ever played . We love it and everyone we introduce it to loves it . This game is easy to understand and VERY easy to teach to new people . You SHOULD get it and you should also get the 1910 Expansion pack . You will not regret either purchase ! Worth the money ! ! !
5 #### This is a great game for competition . If you buy one everyone will be over your shoulder in awe telling you the next move to make . Great game and the levels are fun to figure out as they get harder .
5 #### This is an incredibly addictive game . We loved playing ! My son and I sat for hours going back and forth setting each other up . As a homeschooling mom , I love that I am able to use a game that is fun but yet as a tool for learning logic . Beginner all the way to advance . You will be challenged . * I received the game for free from Think Fun in hopes of an honest and fair review .
5 #### I received this game gratis from ThinkFun via Tomoson.com I love this game ! My husband loves this game ! My kids love this game ! It has hardly made it onto our game shelves before it 's pulled back out and played with more . This is a game that will definitely stay out for easy access . It 's fun to see the kids faces light up as they finally figure out how to free the red car . I would highly recommend this game for anyone that enjoy a quick game that makes you think .
5 #### I got a game to review , and my kids have played it again and again ! I love that they really have to think . Logic seems to be undervalued these days , so any opportunity to boost logical thinking skills is good , in my opinion !
5 #### This was a gift for my daughter who 's family lives out of town . They liked the game so much that we purchased one for ourselves .
5 #### Cards are smaller than pictured , but the game is enjoyable you just need to remember to plan very carefully what routes to keep and what not to even try to do .
5 #### I bought this for my children ( ages 12 and 13 ) and it has since become our favorite family game . The game can take two hours or so to complete , but everyone stays engaged the whole time . The board has different routes that players can make between cities . Each route offers a set amount of points and the player with the highest point total at the end wins . I think that this works so well for a variety of age groups as it does not require any prior knowledge about geography . However , it is also challenging enough to keep adults interested . Awesome family game ! Highly recommend !
5 #### I always thought this game was seemingly babyish , what , with its title and images of a map with train markers . However , I played it the other day with a friend of mine and absolutely loved the game . I was so wrong about my initial assumption , this is a very fun and thought - provoking game . It requires strategy to complete your objectives , as well as requiring you think one step ahead of your opponent(s ) so that if they happen to block your preferred path , you can still complete it with the most points while still saving the most amount of trains . A very competitive game , and a HUGE board . Seriously , the biggest board I ever had in a game . Very fun game for the family , or for friends looking for a little bit of a different game than the traditional monopoly or life . Seriously , get this game and you will not be disappointing . Amazing and extremely fun game . A little difficult to learn at first , but play one game just for fun and you will understand it , as that is how I learned ; at first my head was exploding with all the information being thrown at me , but halfway through the first game , I was really grasping the rules . One of my new , favorite games . How much did I liked it ? I bought it the next day .
5 #### One of my most favorite games . It 's easy to learn , different , and has a perfect combo ( imo ) of strategy and luck .
5 #### For me Rush Hour will always be the Classic solitaire brain game . I 've owned the original since the 90s and have every version that ThinkFun has made since . So I was thrilled when ThinkFun sent me a free copy of their Brain Fitness version to review . There are so many things that I like about this game . First , I like that there are fewer pieces . Set up is much easier . Also , I love the red , black and gray color palate . It has a very 1950s Mad Men / Dragnet feel to it . Finally , because it has a more sophisticated look , my 9 and 12 year - old are all over it . Honestly , you can not go wrong with ThinkFun games . There is one ( or two or three ) for everyone ! I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again , every year I bring a bunch of ThinkFun games to our family reunion and they are the big hit with everyone -- kids , parents and grandparents .
5 #### Right away we opened the Rush Hour game and thought it was great ! It says this is designed for 8 and over but I have to disagree . The kids play a similar penguin game app on our phones where they need to move ice blocks to get the penguin out and so they found some of the challenges easy for their ages ( 5 and 3 ) . There are 80 challenges so you wo n't find yourself memorizing any solution too easily . Read more on this and other products [ ... ]
5 #### Great game . Its simply to learn yet the game lasts long enough . Good for 2 players as well .
5 #### This was our first Euro - style board game . We bought the board game after getting it for the iPad . Love that it is so easy to learn , so you can jump right in , and it has great replay value . My 6 - 1/2 - year - old plays it regularly with no problems .
5 #### Love this game ! My family is huge game people and we love this game ! It can be played with two people which is nice for just my husband and I to play . My ten year old niece can even play the game .
5 #### Such a fun game . A mix of luck and strategy is needed to pull ahead and build the most routes , or the longest routes , across the map of the U.S. I 've played it several times with strangers at Phoenix Comicon , and it never fails to entertain . This is one of those games that you can play with adults and with kids that can pick up relatively easy games . I play with my 8 and 10 year olds , and they have fun with it . This is one of those games that you can see in action on the Geek & Sundry show , TableTop ( on YouTube ) . I highly recommend watching that episode and all the others .
5 #### played this with my 9 year old ( he loved it , and played by the rules ) and my six year old ( she got the concept of how to claim a route - but was unable to claim the route specifically to a destination card - though she loved it too ) . it took us around 1 hour to play the game . i tried playing ticket to ride europe with them too - but they found it too complicated . in addition when my 9 year old plays this with friends - he 'll have a much easier time teaching them the rules on the usa version .
5 #### This is a fun game ! No matter whether or not 2 or 5 players are playing . It is not super involved and usually takes less than an hour to play . Great fun ! The only draw back is the size of the cards .
5 #### It is a good family game that requires some strategy . Game does n't take too long , sweet spot for number of players is 3 to 4 , with 3 being ideal ( shorter game , but enough players to be interesting ) .
5 #### The game is kinda easy but yet interesting . Good time spent with the family - we played it several times in 2 weeks and it has not annoyed us yet .
5 #### I bought this for my adult children . They love games that are not so easy ... and said this game can be played on many levels . They enjoy the challenge and the fun ... and seeing how differently they all think . It is well played .. over and over . Each game is a new adventure .
5 #### Ticket to Ride is amazing . It is simple enough that my 6 year old daughter can play , but has complex layers that make it fun for me . It is a game for the whole family that we can play again and again . Choose your tickets ( destinations ) and build your train route between the locations , but watch out , others can block your path making you take a longer route . This game has tons of replay value and is a great game for the whole family !
4 #### A classic tabletop game , simple to learn with tons of replay value . But the cards , ugh I did n't even open mine I just ordered the 1910 expansion and used those because my fat fingers can not deal with those tiny cards . I guess it can help the game fit on a table better but really blah !
5 #### We wanted a game that our 13 would like . She likes to play Catan and thought this would be a good fit for her . We were wrong- all of us love it ! We have a 5 , 7 and 13 year old . We have to help ( play as a team with him ) the 5 year old but otherwise we are good to go ! Believe the reviews ... it 's great !
5 #### Despite being aware of this game 's popularity , I would not have expected a game about train routes to be very entertaining . However , I was very pleasantly surprised . This game was easy to learn how to play and highly enjoyable , even for only two people . My boyfriend and I like to find games we can play together that do n't require more than just the two us to play ( or to be fun ) , and this game has quickly become one of our favorites . I would recommend this to adults and kids alike because it is easy and family - friendly , but it 's also not so childish that adults could n't enjoy it on their own .
5 #### Do n't be deceived by the somewhat disturbing characters that are depicted on the game 's box art . This is quite possibly the best board game you will ever play ( other than Ticket To Ride Europe , which is even better , having benefited from all the years of playtesting that the original got in the hands of the public ) . It 's quick to learn , fun to play ( even with only two players ) , and has infinite replay value . You can add even more replay value by adding the 1910 expansion , and/or the Alvin and Dexter expansion down the road . The quality of the components is very good ( certainly not the best out there , but durable and well built ) . My only minor complaint is that the cards are way too tiny , but if this is an issue for you , it can be rectified by adding the 1910 expansion , which features replacements for all the original cards , plus new destination tickets . Believe the hype on this one ... I was skeptical , but so glad I gave it a try . We are now huge fans of the Ticket to Ride series , and we own Europe , Africa , and the original , all of which are super fun to play , and they only take about an hour to complete , making it perfect for any evening .
5 #### Love the game and this product lived up to what I remembered . Want to buy sleeves for the cards but the game played great .
5 #### I just love this game ! Bought it for my birthday and it is always one of the games we play during game night !
5 #### For those of you who are interested in playing a boardgame , but have really no experience in playing them , this is a great start . Anyone over the age of six or so should not have a problem sitting down and enjoying this beautiful and sleek game . The mechanics are very easy . Collect cards with train cars of the same color to buy enough train cars to cover a route . If there is five blue spaces you need five blue train cards . It really is that simple . There are some wild cards and destination cards that add a bit to the variety , but the what makes this game fun is it 's simplicity . Grandparents to grand children can all sit around the table and enjoy this one . My wife and I play and she loves the fact that she can beat the snot out of me in this game .
5 #### I recently wrote a review for the Forbidden Island board game . In it , I said that I have been playing board games for a very long time and it is getting harder to find games that I can say are actually better than most of the games I have played before . Forbidden Island was one of them that I would say that about and so is Ticket To Ride . Like Forbidden Island , Ticket To Ride is very easy to learn and to teach how to play . It will appeal to players of all ages . You play as the owner of a railroad line and you are trying to fulfill contracts by placing trains on routes that connect cities all over a map of the United States . The more contracts you can fulfill , the more victory points you can accumulate . There are a lot of expansion sets released , with lots of new maps from all over the world and many more ways to play . Ticket To Ride is a must have for any board game collection .
5 #### This is one of the few games that can have five players . We had played it at a friends house , and we knew it was going to be a family favorite . It does take some time to play , close to an hour with four or more players , but is good for a variety of ages . Our players include three generations from 11 to 65 , and we all love it !
4 #### Ticket to Ride is a good family and/or friend game . Easy to learn , fun to play , and the pace is fast . Looking to add the ' 1910 add on ' that introduces different game play and more destination cards . With four or five players I believe the game is best . A definite keeper .
5 #### My husband started playing this game and taught it to the rest of us . My kids and I love this game . It is the coolest and most fun family game we own . We ca n't wait to get the extensions for it .
5 #### We have been looking at this for a long time but just never bought . We finally did . The game play is quick which keeps things moving and interesting and there are enough options to need some strategy . My six year old even understands the game play and works through his own strategy to win the game . We also have a family of five , so thankfully this works perfectly for us .
4 #### Fun game for the whole family ! Takes a few rounds to play without having to think too hard . Enough detail to make playing often enjoyable . I have played this a few times with my husband and two sons ( 11 and 16 ) . We have made a habit of playing family games at least every couple of weeks . Often we will play a game every evening during holiday breaks from school . I am impressed by this game and hope to purchase other Days of Wonder games in the future . They are a bit pricey , but much better than you average board game .
5 #### We loved it ! So much so that we had to order the card game version . This is definitely a game everyone should have in their collection !
5 #### My family is huge into board games , especially strategy based games . My children and I got this game for my husband for his birthday and right away we became addicted to it . It is for 2 - 5 players , but the more players there are , the more challenging it becomes because everyone is competing for areas on the map . There are cards you get that require you to connect your trains to 2 cities . You have to keep at least one in the beginning of the game , but can draw more later on . These become important for getting a lot of points . However , not connecting your trains between those cities means you lose points . It is a highly strategic game and players can cut off other players from continuing on their path , and with several players , the board gets crowded , making it a challenge to connect your cities , which is a lot of fun ! My family thoroughly enjoys this game . It is good for both families with children as well as adults .
3 #### I do n't want to sound like a complete pessimist here . I still did enjoy this game pretty well , and I love board games of all types ! I was just disappointed to buy and play such a highly acclaimed game to find that the mechanics do n't allow you to do much . I play a wide array of games with lots of different people , so i know that casual games do have their place . My group has found that games like Pandemic or King of Tokyo are still simple enough to draw new people , and they allow for more fun game play . Ticket to Ride is a pretty good family game , and it could still be fun to play with groups of friends ... I 'm just looking for more in a game . Even some of the people who were new to games did n't feel that there was a lot you could do in Ticket to Ride and did n't find it very exciting . I know lots of people love this game however , and it may be good for other personalities . I would rather go for games like Pandemic , Carcassonne , King of Tokyo , Castle Panic , Scotland Yard , etc ... I always loved train games too though , so this game will still be played , it was just a little disappointing .
5 #### Great for family game nights ! Easy for our third grader to understand and dynamic enough to keep the most savvy adult gamer engaged . Highly recommend .
3 #### We have played this game for years , and have fun at it . The only issue that drives us to different games is that the game keeps everyone so close in score , that it always a fight right up to the end . There is not enough strategy to keep our family interested .
5 #### This game is such good fun ! With two people or with more , we really enjoy playing it . We are n't really board game folks , in fact we only own this one and scrabble but we bought it after playing with some friends and having a great time . For reference , we 're in our late twenties and not particularly " wholesome " types who stay in all the time . We have not played with children so I do n't know how this would go over with kids . It 's a long game and requires some concentration , but with a few beers we played happily well into the night .
5 #### This game is a lot of fun once you learn how to play . I gave this present to my 6 year old grandson and he loves it . The beauty of this game is you can buy additions to keep it exciting .
5 #### Our whole family loves this game ( age 7 and up ) . We also own the Ticket to Ride Europe version , which has some other neat strategies . This is well worth the purchase and makes a good game to play with friends because the rules are easy to explain quickly . I highly recommend .
5 #### My family loves this game ! It is the first game of choice whenever we get together plus two of my adult daughter 's own the game too . I will probably buy the expansion set soon so that it will be challenging . Kids pick up this game quickly and can learn a little geography along the way .
5 #### Ihad my doubts at first . Let 's face it , when someone says " Let 's play monopoly , " the first thing you think of is Oh no ! a long boring game . Well , that was my first impression when my husband suggested buying the game . Totally changed my mind from the very first time we played the game . We have family night and couples night with this game . It is fun and worth the investment . I know it 's a little on the higher end of cost but it is lots of fun .
5 #### We are Settlers of Catan board game fans through and through , but we needed something that was comparable in fun so we could take a break from Catan . This is perfect . It is very easy to learn and very easy to teach to newcomers . The game play is also very simple ( but you use a lot of strategy as well ) . Ticket To Ride also has a few small expansion that we love as well !
5 #### Great Family game ! ! Whole family loves it ! ! Got it for Christmas & played it everyday for 3 wks ! ! Then at least every week since ! ! Whole Heartedly Recommend ! ! You will be glad you did ! !
5 #### Inspired by Around the World in 80 Days , Ticket to Ride is a blast . I was impressed with how involved yet laid back the gameplay is . This is a quietly strategic game that will challenge you to make the right moves at the right time . The concept is to travel to and from specific destinations , but the key is that no one is aware of where you are going or where you are starting from and the routes to each destination can vary depending on the cards you have in your hand . You can select multiple routes , which allows you to travel to different destinations at the same time , and while you do get points ( visible points ) for each route to lay down , you get extra points tallied at the end of the game for each ticket you complete , and because you keep your tickets hidden from other players , no one is aware of how many you have completed and how many points each of your tickets is worth . In other words , when we played this the other night I was in last place on the board and wound up winning by over 70 points because I had completed far more tickets than anyone else ! This was a blast .
4 #### Very entertaining and strategic board game . Great for ages 9 and up , for ages 8 and younger , it is difficult as the true concept of the game may be a tad complex .
5 #### This is probably the best game to get non - gamers into Board Games . It is so easily to pick up and learn the rules , while strategic enough that expert gamers enjoy playing as well . This is my wife 's favorite game and we have bought all of the expansions . This is a reoccurring game on our regular game nights . I will add that , it is great that this game can also be played very well with only 2 players .
5 #### My family loves this game . We have 3 kids ages 5,9,13 and we can all play together . We just do n't make the littlest take any destination cards .
5 #### When the kids come to visit this is one of the GO TO games we play . Great fun - we have played for hours .
5 #### We really enjoy this game . My son is 6 and he needs a little help figuring out routes but he loves it . He loves playing games and this game is no exception . We 're eager to get some booster packs down the road .
5 #### Love this game ... My husband loves board games and I 'm not always as enthusiastic but this is one I find I can enjoy with him .
4 #### This is a great family game as well as a competitive game . Each game takes about 45 minutes which is great .
5 #### This is a quality constructed game , with terrific artwork . My family and I have spent hours devising our routes across the US and sabotaging said plans . It 's easy enough for the kids , and introduces really important concepts like bluffing , deception and sabotage . As a responsible adult , I really enjoy this game because its really easy to bluff and deceive kids . Heh , they never see it coming . " Hey , I thought you were going that way , but your card says a different route ! " Gets me every time . Or , " Hey I needed that line ! " Yeah kid , I know you did , I know . Good times . In all seriousness , it can be a riotous good time , and rewards strategic thinking . Just like all good games .
5 #### Ticket to ride is a game of strategy that 's enjoyed by many at my house . Simple to follow and so fun to play . Great family table game . =)
5 #### Played it a lot with my family and my 8 year old has caught on enough to challenge for winning the game . Simple enough to learn and strategic enough to be fun again and again . Perfect Family Game ! ! !
4 #### This is a fun game , but it takes a while to play it . You 'll need to play it once to get all the rules and understand the strategies .
5 #### Played it at a friend 's house and loved it enough to order it for ourselves . Its really easy to learn and does n't take a whole lot of time ( 30 min to an hour for 3 people depending on well you know the rules ) . Everyone else we 've played it with loves it as well .
5 #### Great game . Really highlights the idea of simplicity and fun . Sure there are more complicated board games around , but this one you can pick up in 30 minutes and teach to an 8 year old . By the end of the hour , you will feel like you are racing to build your train route across the United States while competing with your opponent . There 's a reason this game is so good . Children love it , Adults love and you will too . Not sure about all the others , but this is the one that started it all .
5 #### I had no idea this was a board game until my friend introduced me to the greatness that is the Days of Wonder company . I usually play this every few weeks . The setup is pretty simple but you definitely have to plan ahead to win at this game . I 'm looking forward to buying some of the expansion packs .
5 #### Ticket to Ride is an easy to learn game for 2 to 5 players . Three or more is ideal . Each player draws three tickets and has to choose which routes to fill . You may keep one route , or all three . Each route has a different value depending on how difficult or long the route may be to complete . You draw train car cards of different colors and try to save up to " buy " your route . The person who gets the most points at the end wins . Very easy to play . It is my 9 year old 's favorite game . We love it so much , we just ordered Ticket to Ride Europe .
5 #### This game is great for a family game night ! We love it . Our children range in ages from 10 - 2 . We let the younger kids help place the trains for the older family members or draw the cards . Fun fun game ! We really love it for family game nights !
5 #### I bought this for me and my husband . We love to play , I just wish the game lasted longer between two people .
5 #### Good game play and a lot of fun . Player turns go pretty quickly with the exception of picking extra tickets , but that is not unexpected . Play it a few times to get a handle on the strategies , but that is not an issue since replayability is very good with this game . It is easy to teach and had been a hit with a variety of different people . I am always willing to play a game of Ticket to Ride .
5 #### I brought a bunch of friends over to play board games and none of them had even heard of this . Within only a few minutes , they all fully understood the game and a couple of them are planning to buy their own copies of it now . It 's a great game and worth the buy for playing with friends or family .
4 #### This game , along with Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne , is one that I always use as a ' Gateway Game ' to get friends and family who are not serious board gamers hooked on games . Ticket to Ride is easy to teach and learn , fun to play over and over again , and does n't take too long to get through ( most games lasting under an hour ) . The game does n't suffer from a lot of random chance ( e.g. no dice rolling ) and relies on player planning and skill to win . There is the option to go after other players and have a pretty cut - throat game , but that is not necessary to gameplay if it is not your style . If you are already a big fan of board gaming but you have n't played any of the Ticket to Ride games , skip this one and go straight for Ticket to Ride Europe . It has a few additional more complicated elements such as ferries and tunnels , and a more complex and congested map board .
5 #### We got this game for our friends and family for Christmas , and it was a big hit ! Love it . Would recommend for anyone .
5 #### As thier name implaies , Days of Wonder publish solid games , with outstanding mechanics , fantastic art work and all in a box with pieces to touch and move around ! What more can the little kid in my big kid body what more !
5 #### We got this game for Christmas , and decided to try it out a few days later . Ever since we opened the box , we basically have n't been able to put it away ! It 's SO MUCH FUN , and totally addicting ! Basically , the goal of the game is to score points by claiming routes on the map , and eventually linking destinations together . It does n't sound very exciting , but it 's awesome . I 've been telling everyone about this game , and no matter what you read in these reviews , you should 100 % own this game . It 's great for family , game nights with friends , or even just a 2 player game ( how we play ) . It 's GREAT . BUY IT !
5 #### If you 've ever been on Boardgamegeek.com or seen bloggers , reviewers , or anyone talking about Boardgames over the past few years , you 've probably seen this mentioned . There is a good reason for that . This game is FUN ! Very easy to learn , looks beautiful , plays in about an hour . What more could you ask for ? I 've taught many people to play it , and not one person has n't enjoyed this game . Buy it !
5 #### We 've been playing this game with friends of ours for a long time . Got it for my wife as a Christmas gift and we 've played it at least once a week since either with each other or with friends . Fairly easy to learn and play , helps with thinking out strategies and plotting . If you 're looking for a game the whole family can enjoy , even younger kids , this is a great one .
5 #### Ticket to ride is a game my son wanted for Christmas . He has alot of fun with it and at a fair price !
5 #### Probably one of my favorite games I 've played recently . Not overly complex and very entertaining . Price was very reasonable when compared book / game stores .
5 #### This is a fantastic game to play with friends and family . Challenge scales from 2 people to 5 . Even my little children got into helping out the adults play !
5 #### This is my families first experience with a game like this and we love it ! We had so much fun playing together and how refreshing not to play a game with money . This game is high quality and focuses on points . This game is not overly complicated like others we have attempted to play and takes about an hour for players of 3 - 4 . I love that there is a little bit of strategy and people can block off you routes if they catch on to where you are headed . This will be a family favorite !
5 #### We enjoy playing this game as a family . It is quite fun and can be a learning experience as well . I highly recommend this . It is also a plus when you can use it as family time around the table . You will be surprised what you can learn about your own children just by playing a game with them .
5 #### This game was recommended to me by my adult son . It is a lot of fun for everyone when we get together on the holidays . They also make an additional version that involves European train travel that is on my " to buy " list for next summer . It is an enjoyable way to enjoy an evening or a rainy afternoon . It would be a bit complicated for younger children , but they could partner with a big person and older kids would enjoy it .
5 #### This is a great game . We have played it constantly since we 've given it to the family for Christmas . Other family members bought it after playing it with us .
5 #### I played this game with a group of people that have played literally 100s of board games , and it was a ton of fun . I bought it for my parents , who only play about 2 board games a few cards games , and they loved it as well . Might be a little hard for a kid to win , as it does require a bit of strategizing .
2 #### This game is ok for what it is . It is a simple game where you try and get multiple cards of the same color , to match up with the corresponding colors on the routes on the map . You score points for going from one city to another , scoring more for larger routes . You draw " destination cards " that have 2 cities on them , and if you connect them you score bonus points . The game consists of players making their own routes longer , or blocking other players . Not very much to it , and it is really annoying when 5 turns go by and you never get the cards you need . There is a decent amount of strategy in this game , but it is nowhere near as fun as Power Grid , Carcassonne , Puerto Rico , or 7 Wonders . I have tried to enjoy this game , because the hype must come from somewhere , but to no avail . If you want to begin getting into fun board games that are not too difficult , but better than monopoly or sorry that you grew up with , I would recommend 7 Wonders or Carcassonne .
5 #### Great game , lots of fun . I even simplified the rules and had my 4 year old playing . Really a lot of fun even with some novice game players
4 #### Ticket to Ride is easy to learn , fairly quick to play . It is a great gateway game from traditional American games into the ( to me ) more fun world of Euro games .
5 #### This game is so much fun ! As a young adult , my friends and I have a great time with it . It might be too complicated for a young child , but is one of my personal favorites .
5 #### This is a great game . It takes just a few minutes to learn , and will provide you with hours of fun
5 #### With in two days had the family loving it ! Easy to learn and good for young and not so young alike .
5 #### Great game ! Everyone loves easy to teach and quick game play ! Love how fast turn play is , no one is waiting around waiting for their turn . Even teaches a little geography ! Pieces and art very well made . Love it !
5 #### purchased after playing at a friends , very fun easy to learn . have purchased 2 more as gifts . gift receivers loved to
5 #### Ticket to Ride is a game my family and I have been able to play over and over and over again . It 's one of the best new games I 've played in years . I have the game , expansions and even the iPad version . The classic physical board game is still my favorite with friends , but the digital version allows you to play against an AI pretty easily with no change in gameplay . If you know a computer scientist , math major or engineer , they will find the mathematical puzzle of solving the " Shortest Path " problem fascinating . A great gift for a friend or your family .
4 #### This is a great strategy game this is easy to learn for anybody . I would recommend 3 + people as it can get old quickly for only 2 people . It is a great game to play over and over again .
5 #### Great game ! Our 7 year old can play with only a little help . We are glad we got it , it will be even more fun when our kids are a bit older .
5 #### Oh my Gosh ! We love this game ! This is a fast game to learn and does n't take hours to play . We have spent many fun hours playing this game together and we have loaned it out to friends as well . I recently just bought it for my married daughter for Christmas and she loves it also !
5 #### wonderful game for all ages which is why we bought it . the whole family loves to sit down and play this together . first got it when our youngest was 10 .
5 #### Best . game . ever . I 'm so excited that we finally had enough money to buy this classic , timeless game . I wish it were n't quite so expensive , but as you see , it was good enough to save my pennies for . :)
5 #### Awesome game . I 'm currently addicted to the online version of this game , but I 've played the real thing as well . It 's a great game for 2 - 5 people . Honestly , I think it 's more fun if you have 3 - 5 players because there 's more potential for your planned routes to be disrupted . When you play a computer , it 's not really out to get you , I do n't think ... people , however , are often out to get you . You know your true friends when they relish the thought of purposefully foiling your perfect train route . I like that it 's a relatively quick game with a definite end . Some games ( like monopoly ) are great but there 's the potential for it to run very , very long . When this game promises to be done in about an hour , it carries out that promise . Lots of replay value here because there are numerous routes . At the same time , it 's an easy game to learn , so you can teach a new bunch of people how to play in just a few minutes . The slight downside is that it 's only for 5 players . We 've played with 6 before by doubling up , but it 's not exactly conducive to huge gatherings . Have fun .
5 #### Highly addicting playing with 2 or up to 5 players . Very great game for the whole family , highly recommend it .
5 #### One of my favorite games ! It 's pretty easy to learn and pick up on , and gets addicting once you get the hang of it .
4 #### This game is very easy to learn ( I do n't understand any of the negative reviews saying it 's " too complex " ) and lots of fun , as long as you 're not the big loser in any particular game . Imagine getting hemmed in and locked down in Settlers of Catan , multiplied by 100 . That 's how frustrating this game is if you happen to choose the wrong path cards which ( unbeknownst to you at the time ) conflict with someone else 's ambitions . Satisfaction with the game is very hit and miss , as it can be VERY tedious when you have no chance of accomplishing your objections . Part of the appeal of the game is also one of its biggest drawbacks : you can easily see how well you 're doing compared to everyone else , which means that you can also tell very easily when you have no chance at all of winning .
5 #### This is a great game that even my kids like to pay . It includes elements of both luck and strategy , and it is one that I really enjoy playing with other adults , as well as with our kids ( we do make some modifications so our 5 and 6 year olds can play along ; we play with all our cards on the table so they are visible to all the other players , and we do n't play for points ) . This is a fun , award - winning game that really is fun for the whole family ( ages 8 and up ; with modifications we play with ages 5 and up )
5 #### I love this game , it 's a great intro to euro - style board games . It 's easy enough to understand , but it 's complex and deep enough to satisfy the adults as well .
5 #### This is a great game because it 's a simple concept ( enough for young children to play ) but still has a strategy component . Take too long in building a train , and someone else takes it , which ruins your entire game plan . Overall , it takes roughly 45 - 60 minutes to play , so this is a bit of a longer game . It 's great construction and has held up well to a lot of use . This is a game in our rotation that we play at least every few game nights .
5 #### We 've owned this game for a couple of years and bought this one for some friends ... who wanted it after they played it with us .
5 #### There are already tons of reviews of this game . None of the reviews are less than three stars , so that should already speak volumes about it . I really ca n't think of anything new to add that has n't already been said . I and my game group play this regularly and have n't tired of it . It is also a great game for people to get into the board gaming hobby .
4 #### Ticket to Ride is the board game I most often reach for when I have family visiting . For the middle - school aged nephews and the " hard to teach an old dog new tricks " crowd , Ticket to Ride is very easy to pick up on the rules . And those rules ? They can be boiled down to " It 's like Gin Rummy ... with little plastic trains " . Collect cards of matching color sets , then use those sets to claim your tracks to connect cities into a grand network . But watch out for your fellow railbarons , who might have designs for that Los Angeles to El Paso route ! Even though I also play quite complex and multi - layered board games , I 've never not had fun with Ticket to Ride . It plays quickly , and even the slowest to learn players pick up on how to do well in just a couple rounds .
5 #### An easy game to learn , but with endless strategy and luck . Good for 2 - 4 players . Build your routes and block your opponents . Fun for anyone 10 + in age .
5 #### So much fun . We have bought this game for ourselves and everyone in our family . So much fun . Only 5 players can play .
5 #### This is my go to game that I bring with me for new gamers or gaming groups . It 's one of the essentials to own . Easy to learn , fun to play . mechanics are rock solid , and the components all just work .
5 #### Great game for kids , parents , and grandparents . I highly suggest the getting the expansion with the full size cards . Easier for kids to handle and grandparents to read .
5 #### This is a great game for friends for family game night . You can play with 2 - 5 people . My kids are 7 - 8 and they enjoy playing this . It is a great game for adults too .
2 #### I got this game as a present and the reaction was not so great even after playing it .. too much luck involved
5 #### raved about it ! It looked like a good game for the family , so I got it for a Christmas present . I think the kids have gotten to play it once or twice , but the adults in the family invite friends over for game night and this is the game of choice . It 's been fun watching my niece and husband invite her brother and fiance over to play this game . They went out and bought one of the other " Ticket to Ride " games as well . It 's a keeper and definitely worth the money . A GREAT break from TV !
5 #### I lose games of luck , ca n't get a break . But strategy games I love , and this is one of my favorites !
5 #### Best train game ever . Over millions sold and it is a all time favorite . Very easy to teach and play . A definite must buy !
5 #### Something about this game really draws me in ! I could play this game every night and never lose interest . Every game is different . Every game takes skill and strategy and not just luck . Part of what I like about this game is the quality of the design . The instructions , the inserts , on down to the box it comes in are beautiful . When I 'm playing the game it makes me feel like I 'm actually building real - life train tracks ... this is probably aided by the introduction to the game where it tells about rich old friends meeting once each year and betting on who could get to a certain destination cheapest and fastest ... or something like that . I would recommend this game to anyone . It 's challenging , pretty , and fun .
5 #### My wife will actually play this game with me ! It 's not really for just 2 people , since there is n't a whole lot of competition to get the tracks you want , but it 's still a good time , I 've heard of playing a third person between the two of you , for extra competition / fun , but we have yet to do it , it 's fine with just the 2 of us .
5 #### This is a fun game but the cards that come with it are too small unless you are a child . If you buy this game , be prepared to purchase the expansion pack which includes normal size cards . If also adds additional routes and playing strategies so its worth it anyway .
5 #### My daughter and her husband are addicted to this game ! It game quickly , packaged nicely . They play this for hours .
5 #### My wife found this game and we got it for our grandson . He likes playing it so we achieved our goal .
4 #### Ticket to Ride is a really easy and simple game to pick up and learn , but if you do n't have any of the expansions to add more complexity , it 's almost to simple for its own good as the replay value is greatly diminished , but I still like to pull it out and play it every once in awhile .
5 #### My nephew ( 14 ) suggested this game for my son ( 7 ) . It could n't have been a better suggestion . Our son loves trains and understand math well enough to enjoy this game . It 's actually fun for me , too . It 's really a smarter version of Monopoly .
5 #### I 've known about this game for a while and I can not believe it took me so long to actually buy it . Very easy to learn the game and get playing , but unless you are playing nicely , takes a long time to master . There are so many ways to try to get to where you are going , counting out how many trains left , spaces required , what you can get away with to screw over your opponent . Game is awesome . I can not really do it justice in words . Easy game to learn . Highly strategic . even my 5 year old enjoyed it for the 20 minutes I could keep him interested !
5 #### We love this game ! It 's just challenging enough to keep you interested , yet easy enough to understand that you do n't get annoyed from thinking too hard .
5 #### There are n't enough adjectives to describe how much fun this game is to play . The instructions & rules are straightforward and the quality of the game pieces is very high . Pros : Provides great entertainment value for all ages . Anywhere from 2 - 5 players can play . Takes only 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete a game . Plenty of strategies to use to win the game . Educational , especially for children . Learn a lot about US & Canadian geography . Cons : Very addicting . This is one of the most interesting games that I 've ever played . What makes it especially fun is that it can be played by fairly young children , right through older adults . While the game is pretty simple to play ; the strategies involved can become quite interesting . The game offers thrills and excitement and one becomes more adept as time goes by . Another great aspect is the fact that it 's very difficult to become bored ; you can play for hours on end and never lose interest . The game is very educational , as it requires a player to visualize how to route your trains and it teaches a great deal about US and Canadian geography . I ca n't think of a game in recent memory that offers so much for both children and adults alike . This one 's a winner .
5 #### My friends and I absolutely love this game ! It is quite fun and very entertaining . I enjoy playing this with about 4 people total . Anymore and things get a little messy . I like this game too because it does n't take a very long time . It runs about 45 minutes .
5 #### I really like this game because it is not overly competitive . Since you have private goals , it is more positive than some other games that are based on pulling other players down . I also like how simple it is to play . Since it does not take a lot of time to explain , it is easy to introduce the game to new players .
5 #### Simple to learn but different every time you play . The single or double routes between cities is a great detail that makes it already customized to the number of players .
5 #### This game will provide hours of fun . There is mild strategy involved , but not too complicated for your casual gamer . This is a nice game if you have a hour to kill . I have recommended this to friends and to my knowledge , no one has said " I wish I did n't play that game " after completing the game ( unless they are a poor sport ) .
5 #### This gave is worth it if you like the US ( or any other version ) of Ticket to Ride . It 's worth the money .
5 #### This is one of the greatest games ever made . Perfect for my family because it 's easily learned , has some strategy and is fun . We had to search around the net to find answers to two questions not clearly explained in the instructions , and an inner corner of the board is peeling slightly , but those are very minor issues . I 'm planning to get very comfortable with the game and then buy the 1910 expansion pack . Then we should be all set for many years to come .
5 #### My entire family loves to play this game and when friends come over , they also ask to play . I also bought the extension pack of more travel destinations for even more routes to travel ! ! !
5 #### We love this game too . The replay on it is high and the strategy is easy once you play a couple times . I just wish this version had more routes . We have bought India and Switzerland s an expansion , but holding off on buying TTR Europe because I can not justify spending so much on yet another version that is almost exactly the same s this one .
5 #### I played this game first on iPad ( also a blast ) and recommended to a co - worker who came back the next day raving about how much he loved it . Since then I 've also played the actual board game and I ca n't say enough good things about this game . Pretty simple rules to get started , and once you do the fun never stops . Even in games I 've gotten clobbered , I still have a great time , and my girlfriend loves it too . This is one that you can play with your whole family and easily teach any guests you have to play . There are a lot of little train pieces that could get lost in a party but other than that minor concern , I ca n't imagine anyone not enjoying this wonderfully original , beautifully presented game . All the praise is deserved .
5 #### ITEM OF EXCELLENT QUALITY , GREAT PRODUCT , GOOD PRICE PRODUCT , GREAT AND INTERESTING GAME , LOVE THE GAME , ITEM CAN ENTERTAIN FOR HOURS . A++++++
3 #### The game itself is OK . It 's simple and easy to explain , and there are some interesting interactions . I do enjoy the geography aspect of it . My first complaint is the game play seems a little too slow . In our games , we probably all spend around 10 - 15 turns at the beginning just taking cards , building up massive hands that are difficult to hold and sort . Taking train cards 2 at a time , with 8 different colors , it just takes such a long time to get the 5 cards of one color you want to start laying track . It seems like the 5 face up cards quickly get to being 5 cards that no one wants , so they just sit there unused for the most part . People build up massive hands because they are hesitant to reveal where they are going until they can build multiple routes at once , for fear of starting , then getting blocked . My second complaint is that the plastic train pieces are cheap and too light . Because they are so small and light , they are a little difficult for an adult to manipulate . I would have much preferred painted wooden pieces like the roads in Settlers or the pieces in Agricola . These plastic train pieces just give an overall below average tactile experience .
5 #### My family and I love this game . It is simple , competitive and only takes about an hour to play . I do recommend the expansion pack for it adds a more diverse and unpredictable game . this is a must have for any family that loves to play board games with teenagers .
5 #### This is a great game . I was introduced to this game by my daughter and her husband . It takes skill and strategy to determine the best way to build your tracks and get from one city to the next without having to take the long route .
5 #### Is a great game that adults and kids can play together ! ! It takes more than two hours to finish a game
4 #### I did n't think that I was going to like this game going into it , because the game is about building train routes and not very complex . I was wrong . This game is just pure fun to play . There 's nothing like working towards a specific goal with no idea if it will all pan out in the end and then seeing your game long plans come together at the last minute . Actually completing those city to city route objectives was the source of the most satisfaction to me not necessarily scoring more points than my neighbor , which is rather refreshing in a game . The game components were nice although the very small size of some of the cards stood out immediately . They are still workable for adult hands though . Some of my train pieces were chipped slightly and appeared to have some grime on them , which was odd . Also the game board itself did n't like to lay completely flat on the table . Game component issues aside , this is a very fun yet simple game to play for the entire family .
4 #### TTR is pretty much my goto game for any group of folks ' new ' to modern adult board games : -very simple gameplay - draw some cards , play some matching cards , put trains on the board , lather rinse repeat -rules can be taught to even attention - deficited folk in a matter of minutes . No long boring recitation of rules . Just unpack start playing and explain while executing first turn(s ) . -while simple to play / teach , there is enough strategy in the game to keep more experienced players ' in ' the game -short play time and quick turns prevents new players from becoming bored and losing interest . Also permits firing up an immediate second game if the first go is a hit .
5 #### I bought this game for my father who is really into board games . The whole family loves to play Ticket To Ride . It is the perfect balance of strategy and simplicity . Even my 7 - year - old nieces and nephews enjoy playing this game with each other .
5 #### This is a great game ! Easy to pick up on , so it 's great for new or inexperienced gamers . One of the great things about this game is that , while it IS good for newbies , it is still a lot of fun for those who are more experienced gamers . Just make sure the table legs are equal so the table does n't rock ... Um ... Oops . lol
4 #### We like this game . It 's easier to play online because there are so many pieces . We do n't play often . It does get a bit boring if you play too often with friends and family . If you play with the same people and the same board you just get to know their strategies .
5 #### Sometimes it 's hard to find games for just two people so I was thrilled that this was one of them . I 've played it 5 times and have lost every time but still think it 's great . That is the sign of a good game . :)
5 #### Though just purchased last month , this is by far our favorite game . Even my 7 year old son loves this game , though he prefers the card game version because he ca n't get his routes blocked . Simple to learn ( 5 minutes to figure out ) , but every game is complicated due to competition for routes and constant recalculating of routes .
5 #### This is another one of those games that is a fairly simple concept and rule set , but provides a challenge every time and never seems to get old . It is currently our family favorite .
5 #### I absolutely love this game . It does not take forever , easy to learn and it requires enough strategic thinking to keep you occupied till the end of the game . I just wish more than 5 people could play because I almost always have at least 6 people that want to play games .
3 #### This book is geared for older children and even adults . The stories are good but not appreciated by most young children .
5 #### Like this game ! So much easier to play than the Asian and European versions . Have enjoyed this with our friends .
5 #### Purchased as birthday for our son . It has become a family favorite . A larger than typical game board ; well made and nicely packaged . Planning to buy the expansions and alternate versions . Decision to buy was strongly influenced by the " Spiel des Jahres " award .
5 #### This is a fun strategy game that our whole family likes to play . It is well made , sturdy and the cards wo n't fall apart anytime soon . It takes a little time to learn how to play , but it is well worth it !
5 #### This game is wonderfully fun . Your kids ( and YOU ! ) will learn about geography in a new , fun way ! It 's a good game for 2 - 5 people and is simply a beautiful game - from the pieces , the cards , and the board . Be sure to put on 1940s music as background when you play it !
5 #### My family and a friend only just played it once so far and the game is lots of fun . It 's great to have a game with no dice , not two long , and requires some strategic decisions / choices . My only issue was with the directions in which it was not initially obvious that you are supposed to discard your cards ( into a future recycle stack ) once you claim a train route , or maybe I was just having a brain glitch . Anyway , its a great game and my kids really want to play it again tonight ( even though they lost to the friend the first time ! )
5 #### During the holidays , we played it nightly , 2 games a night . Great fun ! Great gift idea too ! So , we sent it to my sister 's family !
5 #### Fun for all ages ! Gives a good opportunity to try thinking and planning ahead , and teaches geography in an enjoyable way !
5 #### I bought this for my dad , a train enthusiast . I 've played it twice and have enjoyed it very much and he seemed to enjoy playing it too . It 's not overly complicated and easy to learn , yet challenging all the same .
5 #### This game is amazing and it is clear how it has won so many awards world wide . I would recomend this for any family .
5 #### This game is easy to learn and is a fun game especially if you like trains as we do . A game of strategy and teaches children to learn to think ahead .
4 #### This is a fun game for families or casual game players . It has a fun premise of trying to build out a rail network to collect the most points . There is not much strategy involved as it is much more oriented toward random distribution of the cards . That said for a 45 minute game it is fun !
5 #### My husband and I enjoy board games and would definitely recommend this game . It 's can be very challenging and after you play it a few times you 'll begin to develop a strategy . Lots of fun !
5 #### We love this game . My 6 , 8 , and 10 year olds enjoy . Its fun enough that I never mind playing with them . Its easy to learn . It also has a very nice box with each game piece having a place . This makes for organized storage and game set up . Huge plus for this house full of toys .
5 #### I got this as a present for my 9 year old nephew and we played it several times together as a family . My 8 year old niece figured it out quickly and so did the grandparents . The game is fast paced and requires both skill and luck to win . Everyone in the family enjoyed it . The game pieces themselves are well made , and the box is well designed to store the game . I highly recommend it .
5 #### This is a fun game for families as up to 6 people can play . My 8 & 9 year old sons really like it , although it is a little to difficult for my 4 yr old .
5 #### This is such a fun game , and simple to teach others . It can be played with 2 - 5 players , which is great for nights when my husband and I want to play a board game , without inviting people over .
5 #### This game has been great for family game night . I like the game because it involves logic and planning in your routes , and luck in getting the cards you need and filling your route before an opponent . Depending on your opponents , you may also be trying to beat them out for routes , or blocking .
5 #### We just received this game at Christmas . Only played it once and we modified the rules a bit to get started because the kids were getting impatient with us adults trying to ' learn ' it . Our daughters are ages 7 & 9 , I think once we play a few more times it will become easier and we will learn more about the strategy , but even the first game was fun , even though a bit involved to get moving in the beginning and never having played before .
5 #### We love this game . It 's not hard , but it does require strategy , so it keeps your interest . Great game to p , ay with friends and family .
5 #### My seven year old has ADHD so we are always playing boards games as I try to limit electronics as much as I can . This was a big hit with him . Holds his attention and is educational in learning the map . It is just me and him so it is also a big plus that it is fun for just two players . Some games just are n't good for just two but this is good for two .
5 #### After watching Wil Wheaton 's show Table Top on youtube I got very excited about playing this game with my family . I recieved it as a gift for Christmas and we emediately opened it up and started playing . Ticket to Ride is a very simple , elegant , strategic , and above all fun game where your overall goal is to score as many points as possible by claiming train routes across North America . You do this by collecting train cards of different colors that match up with the various routes on the board in order to claim them . At the start of the game you are given tickets with different routes planned out and bonus points attatched to them depending on the difficulty of the route . The strategy comes into play because their are a limited number of routes on the board and the other players are also trying to claim them . This game is loads of fun for kids and adults , and I highly recommend adding it to your family game night portfolio . Do n't be afraid of the price either . You will be playing this game for years to come and more then get your moneys worth out of it .
4 #### I am sure the fact that I won decisively the first time we played has Nothing to do with my positive feelings about this game ! :) Seriously , though , it 's a fun play for a group of 4 or 5 adults . Relatively quick and easy to understand , but with enough chance that the smartest guy at the table ( i.e. my husband ) may not win 80 % of the time like he does in many other games . There are also enough hidden point multipliers that the winner may not be apparent until the game is nearly over , which helps those who seem to be trailing keep up their interest . I am sure we 'll be playing this for many weekends to come .
5 #### We got this for our family for Christmas and it was great . The game has a similar feel to Settlers , but is n't quite as cut - throat , so it 's easier to get through a game without people feeling frustrated at each other . I can see why this game has won so many awards . I also love that it comes with three extra train pieces of each color so to account for pieces ever getting lost . The only thing we did n't like was that all the cards are very small ( about 2 1/2 " tall ) making it very hard to shuffle them ) .
5 #### My 8 - year old loves this game . It is the perfect game to introduce him to more difficult ones . If you need extra help with the instructions , search on youtube , where you can find some guides on how to play . Have fun !
5 #### love this game . we have made our friends learn to play it and have even bought on ipad for traveling .
5 #### This is one of our favorite games to play ! Add on the expansions and you are guaranteed hours of fun !
5 #### Awesome game for friends and family get togethers . It is just one of those good wholesome games that make you think the entire way through it plotting your technique as well as how to possibly screw your opponent . Hours of endless fun and gaming ! ! ! I would give it more stars but 5 stars is the limit !
4 #### There is a reason that " Ticket to Ride " has sold over 2 million copies and has won numerous awards in several countries . I had not even heard of this board game until recently but after receiving it from Amazon last week our whole family became addicted and we have played it almost every day . It 's simple enough so that young children can learn it but has enough strategy that there are entire web sites dedicated to playing it more thoughtfully . It really is a great game . The only negative aspect is the high cost . I bought it from Amazon and that was still expensive . Ebay and others want between $ 40-$50 for it . It 's just a board , cards , and plastic pieces - no justification for the price . If you can get past that - there are no other downsides . I 'm glad we bought it .
5 #### This a fun , quick paced game that my nieces and nephews all the way up to my parents enjoy playing . I probably play this more often with an all adult group and everyone that has played has enjoyed the game . It gives a good sense of American geography and more importantly offers our family the chance to play a fun game , that no one tires of playing . Very well done .
5 #### This is a great game , lots of fun for many different ages . Get the family together and have some fun !
5 #### I was already very familiar with this game , but it still fabulous ! Bought this one especially to teach my 5yo twins how to play . They need a little help still , but are able to grasp the basic concept .
5 #### It just might be . at least top 5 in my book . I would recommend this game to anyone , I bought this copy for my sister .
5 #### My wife and I like board games , but have a hard time finding new games for adults . We first caught wind of this game on the YouTube show Table Top . When we first got this game , we did n't quite understand the rules and went through a couple of rounds playing wrong . Going back , the rules were pretty simple , we had just overlooked one thing . This is the most used board game at our house and is far more fun for us than any of the games we had been playing ( more traditional board games ) . The quality is amazing , the cards are a heavier stock than a cheap playing card , which will help the life of the game , and the playing peices are nicely made . I even like that the map give a little bit of a geography lesson to us everytime we play . We like this game so much that I have bought two of the expansions for christmas hoping to give the game a different twist . I think that is one of the greatest thing about this game , it can be changed simply by getting a new board and a new deck of tickets .
5 #### My husband loves this game and ensures everyone else will love it . We got this for my brother 's family and may buy it for my sister 's too .
5 #### Everyone loves to play this . Great family game while learning a bot of geography as a bonus . wish they made the cards big again .. this comes with the tiny cards .
4 #### The game arrived quickly in perfect ( new ) condition . Ticket to Ride is a great game for the casual or the serious gamer . It is very simple to learn , but play can be quite complex due to competitive elements . It has a great light feel such that you can still have a conversation while playing without feeling you have to concentrate overly much on the game . That said , if you want to concentrate and strategize , there is still plenty of that to be done . This game is ideal for a board - gamer like me : a serious gamer who mostly plays with casual gamers , since it appeals to both . Overall , it is very fun and has great replay - ability . Good buy ; I would buy it again !
5 #### Ticket to Ride is an excellent game for 2 - 5 players . The dynamics change significantly with the number of players , but they 're all fun . I highly recommend getting the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Ticket - To - Ride-1910 - Expansion / dp / B000K8FYAS / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Ticket To Ride 1910 Expansion</a>&nbsp;for more routes and a larger card format .
5 #### This is such a fun game , and it move so quickly it really keeps the players on their toes to act quickly and stay focused . The rules are extremely simple , and its a great game to play with beginners due to its simplicity . High education rating for geography within the United States ( and any other country that you play ) .
5 #### Saw this game on Wil Wheaton 's Tabletop series on youtube and decided to pick it up for family game night ... so glad we did ! First night provided hours of fun . My kids ( ages 6 - 10 ) were able to understand the concept ( although my 6 y / o still needed a little help with names on the routes ) , they were able to keep track of points easily and were even competing for longest route at the end of the night .
4 #### One of my favorite games of all time to play with the entire family . Even the wife likes this one !
5 #### This is a fun game for players of all ages . The board depicts a map of the United States ( in this version ; other versions exist for other locations ) with train routes of appropriate lengths between major cities . Players have tickets from one major city to another . In order to get credit for that ticket , the player must build their train between those cities . Combine routes to get points for more tickets . The game requires logic in that you need to plan your route appropriately ; longer legs earn greater point values . A good time is had by all !
2 #### I did n't like this game because you can make your strategy at the beginning of the game and one person can make a move that will totally stop you from succeeding . I do n't like games where you ca nt follow your strategy through the game or that each player has one movement per turn . This was just a frustrating game for me , even when I won .
5 #### Ticket to Ride is one of the best games I have ever played and it quickly became a family favorite and classic . It is the only board game my mom and my mother in law will play due to the easy concept . We purchased the 1912 expansion and have replaced the tiny color train cards with the larger cards and we like it better - easier to hold onto . We never get tired of playing this game !
5 #### My wife and I bought this game , and we absolutely love it ! Wish there were more games like this ! You WONT be disappointed .
5 #### We got hooked on this game and every time we take it to a game night with friends that have not played it before , they buy it as well . The only drawback is that there is a player limit of 5 which limits us when we have two other couples over for game night .
5 #### Who knew building train tracks would be fun ? In this game you have to build tracks around the US and secure the routes that you draw on your cards . Its really fun to try to build your routes , and once you get 4 players involved the competition factor really ramps up because you will all be going for those middle spots . Not much coop factor here unfortunately , but still makes a fun family game with no too much fighting or rule book checking .
5 #### I ca n't say enough about this game . This is one that wins many times when asked what to play in our family and it has been a long time favorite . I wo n't spend a lot of time describing the game as that is easy to find elsewhere on [ ... ] and here . What is important is that this game can be played with as many as 5 players ( although I wish it could be more ) but can easily be played with 2 and the age groups can really span 6 or 7 up to any age . The game board is quite large so requires some space to play it and there are a lot of pieces . The cards and pieces however are very durable and last for multiple playings . The add - ons for the game add a tremendous amount of value although I 've only played other maps online and using their iPad version . That said , I still prefer the USA map . Honestly , if you do n't have this game , you owe to yourself to buy it and complete your collection . I ca n't recommend this game enough !
3 #### I bought this to play with relatives over Thanksgiving & we all found it intriguing . But ... I was expecting it to be more fun to play & it was n't . You had to focus on your cards & the routes that other players were taking . There did n't seem to be any element of surprise or fun . It can introduce children to strategy & risk & make them think more about geography & distance in traveling , but there 's very little math & not much skill involved . And there are so many game pieces ( trains ) that can get lost . In the end , I would have rather chosen a party game to play than this board game & it would likely have cost less , too .
5 #### I first saw this game at a local store and the owner let me play it with him before I spent a fortune on the game . I loved it ! It was easy to learn and fun to play . It also helped me out with my locations around the U.S. I liked it so much , I was able to find it on Amazon and I bought it for my niece as a Christmas present . She 's only 5 and having a GREAT time playing it ! The board is built solid . The game pieces and easy to use . And the rules are very easy to learn . This game is a MUST HAVE ! ! !
4 #### I got this for Christmas , and what a fun game . We played with a variety of people and age levels , and everyone seemed to enjoy it . It is n't complicated , so even if you have younger people ( or a lot older , for that matter ) , they 'll be able to play with you . The game also takes a reasonable amount of time , meaning that it is n't very lengthy like Settlers or even Monopoly tends to be . You should be able to get a few rounds in during a game night with friends .
5 #### I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we 've played it several times already . We love strategy games ( other favorites : Carcassonne , Blokus , Settlers of Catan , Santiago , etc ) . This one has a fairly easy learning curve but enough of a strategy element to be entertaining . Our eight year - old played with us and totally got it . I also love that it moves very quickly . You do n't spend a lot of time waiting for others to take their turn . I would definitely recommend this as a good game for a family who loves to play games together .
5 #### I absolutely love this game .. it is by far our first pick when choosing a game to play . The only thing is I highly recommend getting the expansion card pack ... it makes it much easier and more fun to play . It 's easy to learn and once you have learned it the game goes fairly quick . My only complaint is that some of the capitals are in the wrong spot on the map :)
5 #### My son is a game designer and buys games for us to play . This is one of my favorites -- I've even won a few times over my sons who are both smarter than me . As an educator , I think it 's a fun way to learn geography . We love playing it over the holidays . It 's not too easy and not too difficult . 2 to 4 of us have played it and enjoyed it equally . I see this Christmas my son is asking for the 1910 version , as it 's on his wish list . I want to try the Europe extension so will ask for that . This is a quality game that everyone should enjoy .
5 #### Ticket to Ride is one of the best games ever . The best part is that it is also one of the easiest to learn . I taught my 8 year old brother a week ago and now he plays it as well as anyone . A great game for the family or for just with your friends . I am a huge board game fanatic and this is easily one of the top 5 games we go to the most often . If you are interested in trying out strategy board games for the first time , this is definitely the one you want to start with . Simple rules and yet lots of fun . It 's even a ton of fun for those who do not like to think too much just to try to troll and block others ' routes . A must own ! PS . avoid the expansions . they 're not very good .
5 #### What a fun game ! Got it for my grandkids but my adult sons also loved it . The whole family joined in on an evening of fun . Probably for age 8 and up . Each player draws cards for their destinations and then chooses other cards for the appropriate paths to the destination . Points are earned for the various trips and moves . Lots of pieces ( trains)are needed to play and ca n't be lost so I marked it a little down on durability . Good for learning maps , math , and making choices . The older ones used strategies to block each other but the younger ones were content with making it to the right city . Everyone kept very attentive and wanted to play again and again .
5 #### I 've been buying several board games to get the family ( parents and 2 kids , 10 years , 8 years ) spend more valuable time together . Amongst several board games we found this a great game . Highly recommended .
5 #### I bought this and pandemic and turned my 1 game night a week into 3 - 4 game nights a week .. now I interact with friends / family on game nights instead of txting , emailing .. etc .. tv is left to play music ! ! Wife indicated this was her favorite game ever ! but it .. you wo n't regret it .
3 #### PROS : Easy game to learn , Educational for US . Geography , Moderate luck factor . CONS : Not recommended for avid game players . Only moderate strategy . Ticket to ride is fun , it 's got some strategy to it , but I 've played better . In fact , the European version adds a few more variants that greatly improve on the game . I would recommend this game for beginners . For highly competitive game board fanatics , one or two plays of this version and you 'll move on . Best just to skip to the European version .
5 #### I purchased this game for my 7 - year - old for his birthday , as we always get him a game for one of his gifts , and he loves trains . The game , which is for ages 8 and up , took a little bit of explaining , but he now understands it and loves it . To make the game a bit simpler , we are not using the " ticket " cards for now . This is something we will add once he can read and do math in his head a bit better . I would definitely recommend this game . It 's something the whole family can enjoy .
5 #### When it comes to games there are few that interest both me and my wife . I like competitive strategy games and she like more simple family friendly ones . This game is the best of both worlds . Whether you are a hard core board - gamer looking for strategy and competition or looking for a easy game to play with your anyone from your kids to seniors , this game is for you . It is simple enough to explain in less than 5 minutes but compelling enough to keep you coming back for more again and again . As a side note I would highly recommend that you buy the 1910 expansion with it since it provides 36 additional destination cards and reprints the originals to a more manageable size . Hop on the train of Ticket to Ride and you wo n't be disappointed !
5 #### Ticket to Ride is well made , fun for our whole family , and I like that my son is picking up a bit of geography as we play . I 'm sure we 'll pick up the 1910 expansion for the normal size cards and additional routes . My ONLY complaint about this game is the tiny cards . This game is a favorite and will be enjoyed for many years .
5 #### Why do all the best board games originate from Europe ? I read about this game on an on - line game site , highlighting some of the best family board games out there , and this is one that made the list . It looked fun and easy - to - learn , so I picked it up in time for the holidays . I had a lot of fun playing this with my family over Thanksgiving and Christmas get - togethers . The game is simple to learn , simple to play , and is really pretty casual . There 's a small amount of luck and strategy involved , but most people can play this on an even footing and it is not geared towards competitive game - play . More fun with the full five players on the board , it can still be finished in about 1 hour of play . I highly recommend trying this game out !
5 #### Just bought the game and played it for the first time yesterday with 4 players . Good game to get the wives involved that that is n't too in depth in terms of multiple levels of strategy that scare away casual players . The destination tickets add the variety to keep it fresh each time so that it 's not always a race to get the 6 space routes . The lack of dice help to keep chance ( luck ) to a minimum other than the rail cards that you draw . Highly recommended .
5 #### I have been searching for 2 player games to play with my wife . This game rocks . It is well - built and easy to learn . We can play an entire game in about 30 minutes . I can see how adding more players will completely change how the game is played .
5 #### This is a great safe kid friendly family game . Our family has enjoyed playing this one . See who can take over the most tracks and win .
5 #### We play ( a bit modified ) with my six year old and she loves it . Really takes only 5 minutes to learn . I highly recommend this game as you can play with adults and older children by following the rules exactly , or play with younger children by modifying the rules a bit ... asking for an expansion pack for my birthday next year !
5 #### This is a WONDERFUL game ! Fun for the whole family ! The item was shipped very fast , and was still in the wrapping ! Great item a must have !
5 #### I do n't have much to add to the other reviews , other than to throw my two - cents in the ring to say this is an excellently engineered ( no pun intended ) game that has provide our family ( 3 boys ages 7 , 9 , and 12 ) endless hours of fun . We play it so much that we do n't even take the time to count of the points anymore as it 's just fun to play the game . Not many games can say that . Improvements : For the price , it would be nice if the larger cards from the expansion pack were included vs an additional expensive add - on . Also for the price , it would be a nice touch if the trains were wooden vs plastic ( feels cheap ) . Recommendation : Do yourself a favor and pick up the 1910 Expansion Set while you 're at it for the larger playing cards . This makes it easier to hold all the cards in your hands . Summary : If you 're looking for a game that is pure joy vs American - based games that are " kill your opponent to the very end and make them miserable along the way " , give this game a try .
4 #### I like the idea of a game , but I like Europe version much more than this one . Less relying on a lack and more on making decisions .
4 #### This game is easy to learn and quickly fun , but we did n't stay into it very long and do n't see us playing it long term . I can see this forgotten within a year unfortunately . We enjoy a game where there is some amount of conversation after the game about the strategies used and reasons for some decisions . We do n't find ourselves doing that much . We like it for from 2 to 4 players , thinking 5 is too many . The game does change quite a bit with different numbers of players , which is nice ( variety ) . We think it has the right mix of luck and skill . It can initially seem too luck based ( draw bad cards ) , but you realize there are strategies to deal with that . Quick to set up and put away , and well made . Quick to play ( less than an hour ) . I suspect people who find Settlers of Catan and Dominion fun but too involved might like this . The on - line version is great because it is so convenient . It shows you the cities you need to connect which is really handy . It is I think $ 10 per person for a life - time account . When it 's just my husband and I we prefer to sit with our laptops and play that way . ALSO - you can try it before you buy it that way . You can make an account for free and play 5 games .
5 #### This game is really easy to learn and lots of fun . It works best with three or more players . It moves along pretty quickly and requires a good combination of strategy and luck . We really enjoy it !
5 #### This is a fantastic game for family game night . It 's easy to play and learn and accessible to gamers and non - gamers . It 's a great way to introduce people to " real " board games . If you like this I highly recommend trying out some of the other " euro - games " . Check out [ ... ] . It 's a great community and a good way to discover and become addicted to a new world of gaming . I never new so many great games existed . BGG blew my mind and now I 'm totally hooked . But beware , if you go down this road , be prepared to say goodbye to Monopoly , Life ... etc forever .
5 #### Everyone in our family enjoys this - aged 9 through teen years and to the adults . What we love is how we can play together in competition while also working on individual goals . Each player has to try to gather enough of the right colored cards to make train route connection across North America , earning points as your train route grows in length . Players try to block each other . Strategy can be simple for the younger kids or more complex for the adults . It is best played with 3 or more . I like most that 5 can play easily .
5 #### Got for son for x - mas , just turned 7 . He has always been thrilled with trains , and loves board games . Opened up on X - mas , was so surprised when he seen all the contents , and mapping . 3 days after the shock of the Wii wore off we started playing during his winter break . Now play at least once a week . He is getting better with the strategy of the game and point scoring . Can play in a short period of time , moves along fast once you learn how to play . It is a little more expensive then average board game , feel that is well worth it .
5 #### great family game ... short learning curve . we all loved playing it . It kept the interest of the whole family . I got the gift over christmas , and we played it multiple times over the holidays ... and are still playing it . ( 2 days ago ) . great family game . everyone loves it ... of ALL ages .
5 #### We bought this game to play with a 9 year old grandson who loves board games . We are sick of Monopoly and Clue , etc . I found this game mentioned in a recent issue of Shop Smart magazine and immediately looked it up on Amazon . This game , the basic US version , was fun and interesting and taught our grandson names of the cities plus how to spell them . The game is fun , fast , moves have to be strategic ; there is no play money involved ( no banking yeh ! ) and the competition between players is more civil as the board is large , the train routes are many and options for your turn are many . We also bought Ticket to Ride Europe to play with adult friends and it was also a lot of fun -- although we had a bit of trouble with the city names , as they are spelled for locals . Also played this version with grandson and he caught on fast and learned to find the unusually - spelled city names . We plan to buy more of these games for our other grandsons .
5 #### Incredible game for almost any age group . This board game has everything going for it . It is a great deal of fun , as each new game requires a different strategy from the last . The overall strategy tendencies are difficult to master , and after having played this game 50 times or more , I am still trying to decide the best strategic approach . It is very easy to learn , and after one play through you will never need to look at the rules again . The game is expertly constructed using materials that will not break or wear at any time in the near future . I plan to realistically have played this game thousands of times before any pieces need fixed / replaced . A group of my friends have a movie / game night once every week , and this seems to be the one game that everyone is always in the mood for . Overall , a great value for the price . Great gameplay , and loads of fun ! Fun for gamers and non - gamers , as I have not found anyone that dislikes this game .
5 #### My husband and I enjoy playing board games with friends and have found that this is a great game to teach beginner / intermediate players . It does have a good amount of strategy , but the rules are more simple than some other strategy game so it is easy to get the hang of it the first time you play .
5 #### This is such a fun game to play . I love it because their is strategy involved but it is easy to explain it and play it right off the bat . Their is n't a lot of instructions . We love it and also played it online for 6 month strait after we got it . Great for all ages and learn about where the different states are and places .
5 #### This is one of the most fun board games I have ever played . The game takes minutes to teach and from there the strategies to win are endless . It 's also one of the most original games I 've ever played . Very different from all the other typical board games you might have played like monopoly , life , sorry , etc . , The packaging and design is great . The board is sturdy and well decorated . You get tons of little plastic trains along w/ some extras in case you lose one or two along the way . I wish the cards could have been a little bigger but it 's nothing that detracts from the overall game . The cards even have symbols on them so if you 're colorblind you can tell the difference between cards . Nice touch . Overall , a great family game . A great game to play w/ friends who have never played " different " board games . My wife and I are addicted to this game . She loves playing it and that says a lot b / c she is not into board games that much . I highly recommend .
4 #### The first in the Alan Moon Ticket To Ride series is a great game . TtR America is really a game where you are searching for the best path and trying to take it before your competitors do . In addition it requires you to find a path and on some level manage your resources ( cards ) . When we first got this game my friends and I played it incessantly . The one problem with this game is that a very strong strategy for winning also makes it a lot less fun to play . One of my friends who plays it always goes for the finish all the 6 length train strategy which considerably shortens the game and often does not give the other players enough time to complete their destinations before the game ends . We have found that if multiple people try and get the 6 length trains it balances the game out again .
5 #### Whether you are a hardcore board gamer or not you will love this game ! The rules are very simple and easy to understand . I 've bought this game for everyone else in my family and we all love it . Game is based on completing routes across the USA by picking up different colored cards and using them to place your limited amount of trains on the board for different amounts of points .
5 #### This is a great game ! My family and I ( we 're all over the age of 18 ) love it and play it every time we get together . It 's definitely not for younger kids . It 's a pretty easy game to pick up and teach others who have never played before . The only bummer is that only up to 5 people can play at once ! We just wish at least 6 could play . I would n't even try to explain the directions here because it might sound a little silly but it really is a fun game !
5 #### This game is really fun , easy to play , and moves quickly . We really like playing this with friends even when our kids are around because it does not require your 100 % attention all of the time .
5 #### I , like many others , first heard of this via the Xbox Arcade version of it . The game itself is a great balance of simple rules with rich gameplay potential . It 's an attractive game ( lot 's of little pieces though ! ) that draws people to it . Good for getting people who do n't like other German board games ( Catan , Carcassone ) to play . Can also play a reasonable game with only 2 people , although 3 - 5 is ideal . The only difficult thing is the cards . They are tiny little things , and the game uses a LOT of cards and demands reshuffling them frequently ( the discard pile ends up with groups of like cards ) . This is difficult to do due to the size of the cards . I believe there is an add - on ( 1910 ? ) that contains bigger cards .
4 #### This game has simple rules but that does n't mean there 's not strategy . I like this game a lot . I only take off 1 star because you need a very large physical playing space and the pieces are awkward to place on the board . A+ for rules and concept . B- for execution .
5 #### This is a very good and very expensive board game . The mechanics are exceptional and the replay value is huge . I 'll trust that other reviews have gone over the basic mechanics . Let me just say that the play factors of planning your routes , dealing with the cards that are available and sudden changes necessitated by opponents taking routes you were counting on is very entertaining . A video game version of this is also available on Xbox 360 LIVE arcade . You can purchase it for either 600 or 800 points ( see&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Xbox-360 - Live-1600 - Points / dp / B000B9RI14 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Xbox 360 Live 1600 Points</a>&nbsp;and others ) which works out to considerably cheaper than the board game and allows online multiplayer . A demo of this is available as well . There are several expansions / variations to Ticket to Ride available involving new maps and / or mechanics , but these are not included in this core product .
5 #### This board game seems to go over very well with anyone that I introduce to it . I have yet to find a person that does not enjoy its simplicity and strategy . Do n't pass this one up !
5 #### This game is quick , easy to learn ( one practice round & you 're off & running ) , and fun . Easily grasped by kids from 7 - 8 on up . We had it out last weekend and it was played for hours on end . Plays quickly enough that a game or two can be played between dinner and bedtime during the week . . . it 's a nice way to get the whole family together . This game makes a good gift . . . . well , our visitors have all ended up wanting their own game . Amazon 's price with free delivery is competitive , at least when i made my purchase . We started with Ticket to Ride then moved to the European edition . . . that seems to be a good transition . Then tack on some of the Expansion games if you want . Have fun !
5 #### I was introduced to this game a few months ago at a family gathering . We are a family that likes to play a lot of games when we get together and this one was definitely the favorite . After playing it there - I went right home and had to buy it for myself . I really enjoy this game because it has a lot of different strategies that you can use , but is not so complicated that it 's exhausting . Even if you 're losing , it 's still SO fun to play and you really do n't know that you are losing until the end of the game anyway . I HIGHLY recommend this game ! ! ! We love to play it as a couple , as a family , and with all our friends that we can rope into it ! ! !
5 #### This is a great medium concentration game . The strategy is not too tricky , but challenging enough to hold your interest . Basically , you either collect or play train cards on your turn . You need to have the same number and color to play on a route , and then you connect your routes to match the bonus on your ticket . The score for routes increases by the number of train cards needed , from 1 point for 1 to 15 points for 6 . My only complaint is that there are a few tickets that might be weighted a little high and lucking into one of these on the initial draw gives a slight advantage . You get a higher bonus to connect farther apart cities , but some of these have longer routes between them which give you a bonus already . Overall , a solid and very fun game . I have not yet had the chance to play it with 2 , but I know from experience that it works equally well with 3 , 4 or 5 .
5 #### We play Games and this one is a favorite . Two can play but the fun factor raises as more people compete for roads . Highly recommended !
5 #### My wife and I enjoy games -- usually more of the thinking kind -- risk , scrabble , etc . This game kept popping up , so I gave it a shot . You can learn it in 5 minutes , but it is a blast . Lots of strategy ( which I am still ironing out ) and a enough luck to change things up every time you play . I would definitely recommend the 1910 expansion pack , though !
5 #### This is a great game and is easy for anyone who can count up to 6 . So you should be able to find someone to play with at all times . I 've owned this game for 2 years and anytime we have someone over , they suggest we play it , nobody has had a negative experience with it .
5 #### Like most of the " classic " games ( Risk , Monopoly , etc . ) , this game is relatively easy to learn and has that elusive perfect combination of strategy and luck that makes it so much fun to play . There are also several different legitimate strategies you can use , which always makes for a more interesting game . Unlike Risk and Monopoly , though , it does n't take a week to play -- more like an hour . This game works well with lots of different ages and groups and is almost as much fun to play with two players as it is with four or five . This is my new favorite game !
5 #### Players start the game by drawing cards which give them train routes across the US they should aim to create . During the game , they create train routes , earning points for each segment created , plus bonus points for completing a designated route . It 's a strategy game with a dose of luck . But compared to Ticket to Ride Europe , it is less cutthroat , and harder to thwart other players . The game is fairly predictable , but fun and appropriate for both adults and children , groups of up to five as well as two players . It 's also good for those who want exposure to U.S. geography . A fun , well - made game . Recommended .
5 #### This is a very fun and educational game . Players use cute trains to build " tracks " across the US to different cities completing a card that details what cities need to be linked to get points . Its very easy to learn . The only thing is that it can be complicated to score the game - we tend to do it at the end of the game rather than trying to do it during play . This is one of the few games that is fun with just two players . Very Entertaining ! ( ticket to ride Europe is also fun ) .
4 #### THis game only got 4 due to the luck factor . No matter how well you play , you could just draw bad cards everytime . That is it . Other than that , this is a wonderful , wonderful game . This IS the perfect game to get people into Eurogames like Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne . Easy to explain - 5 minutes tops . Fast to play - 1 hour . Good strategy . Good theme . You even feel like you are being educated at least a little bit in the area of US geography . Bottom Line : Best family board game in existance . Anyone can learn to play it relatively quickly .
5 #### This is an absolutely wonderful game . I own about 300 games , and would easily put this up in the top ten of them . It 's great for kids and adults , it 's easy to learn and explain , it looks great , it does n't take too long , it 's a great combination of luck and strategy , it plays great with 2 through 5 people .... I could go on and on . But why take up your time when you could be BUYING THIS GAME ! ! Congratulations to Amazon and Toys R Us for noticing this gem .
5 #### my kids love it ! so much fun ! they never got bored with the elf on the shelf
5 #### My wife who has celebrated Christmas her whole life did n't want the elf at first and I 'm rather new to Christmas so I went ahead on my own and my children went crazy for their elf and loved finding it every morning .
5 #### Bought this for my 6 year old nephew . He truly believed that he was being watched during the Holiday Season .
5 #### This is a great kit and the elf is very authentic looking .
3 #### Super expensive for what it is . The elf is tiny . I admit the presentation is very nice . It comes in a beautiful decorative box with a book explaining to kids how to act with the elf and the history behind it . My daughter loved it but I felt like I was robbed with how much I had to pay versus what I got in return .
5 #### Bought this for my young grandchildren and boy was it a hit ! Love to keep the magic of Christmas alive for young ones . Our 9 year old granddaughter also loves her Elf on the Shelf , but her time believing is closing in I fear .
5 #### Every household with children needs an elf on the shelf ! I bought this for my classroom and soooo happy I did ! Book is hardcover and box is sturdy for years of protection ! I bet you could pass this down for generations ;)
5 #### This is the funnest little tradition for small children . We got our elf and his name is Cosmo . My 2 year old had such a blast finding him daily . I ca nt wait for next year for him to reappear . It is a bit expensive but it is worth the experience you will get . He comes with a book and you can go online and register your elf and get a birth certificate and a letter from santa .
5 #### I finally caved and entered into the hellish tradition of Elf on the Shelf . Needless to say , it was a huge hit . The elf himself ( ours is Bubbles ) is n't extremely detailed , but I 've come to appreciate his simplicity . The book the elf comes with is a plus and has a page to further personalize the book and the elf .
4 #### His hat comes off too easy , but love it !
5 #### This is a wonderful addition to the Christmas traditions ! It came promptly , well packaged and the kids loved it - would buy again .
5 #### My kids love this thing . It 's kind of fun to come up with new locations and my 3 year is always so excited to look around and find him .
5 #### Every child needs this extra cutie watching them and reporting their behavior . Great purchase and idea !
5 #### Well made eith a great book for toddlers and a good place to store the elf until next year .
5 #### we had the best of fun with this elf . We just never knew what to expect from him . He made his way into the fridge , sneaked into a bag of corn puffs , took a picture of his rear end in the copy machine amongst other non mischievous adventures . He was a busy busy elf .
5 #### Exactly as pictured . My only problem is I wish the manufacturer would make the elf have wires in its arms and legs so that he can be positioned in any way as I always thought that was the case anyhow ... it would n't be hard to do either .
5 #### It 's the Elf on the Shelf , what 's not to love ? So cute and lots of fun . We will have this for years to come .
5 #### 4 year old had a blast this December with his Elf friend !
5 #### Oh what a pain in the rump it is to move this guy around and set up some scene every night . But how fun it is to watch the kids search for and find little " Tommy " . My 3 are very young , so the magic is real . Wo n't last forever , but it 's been a fun addition to this Christmas .
5 #### My girls ca n't wait to get up and find Jangle ... our little Christmas elve
5 #### We needed a second elf ! Significantly cheaper than our 1st and same cute look only differents is he s a boy and our 1st was a girl !
5 #### Cutest story and tradition ever ! My 5 yr old talks to him every night and loves waking up to find " Red Rider " . He 's sad that he has to leave Christmas eve but knows he 'll be back after Thanksgiving .
5 #### Oh what fun this is for our son . He loves it & so do we . :)
4 #### Fun but I wish the arms and legs were wired
5 #### Fantastic little elf ! Nice packaging , and the book was nice too !
5 #### This product came quickly and packaged beautifully ! Our 3 year old twins were old enough to try out this Christmas tradition . Our little guys named him Ce - Ce and love searching for him every morning . Very well made and sturdy ! I highly suggest this if you would like to add some more Christmas magic to your home !
5 #### My son loves it . I wish it had velcro on the hands though . It would also be better it it was able to form a bit in positions .
5 #### My kids have one and love it . had to get one for my niece and nephew ! Plus it keeps , them , on , their toes , until , Christmas .
5 #### my son absolutely loves his elf . What a great book and doll .
2 #### I m pretty excited to start this tradition . I m not sure what happened but my book box is a little damaged . I know it should nt be a big deal , but Ill be saving it for hopefully the next decade and it stinks that it will not be perfect to start . The amazon box was not damaged so it makes me believe it did n't happen during shipping .
5 #### Really fun tradition . My son looks for his elf every morning . He has gotten really good since he 's been around . We had a hard time getting him to go to sleep on time .
4 #### This little elf has brought so much happiness to my little man ! He gets so excited during the holidays to wake up and see which fun new places buddy the elf is hiding !
5 #### Got it for a good price compared to the local retailers around me . Seems to be made well .
2 #### I am a teacher , and I bought this for my students and I to enjoy during the holiday season . I 've found that the little elf is n't made well enough to withstand 40 little hands trying to see it . The head is heavy and the rest of the body is lanky , which I understand the point of but it 's still difficult . I did n't find the book to be cute as much as creepy . It was a fun tradition for the kids , but for this adult , it was hard to remember to change it every day , lol . I think it should come with a list of fun places for the elf to go .
5 #### My son loves this ! ! ! ! ! We started already . He 's 7 and believes . I So easy to move around without him knowing . The story book really slammed it home .
5 #### Bought this last year for grandkids . They loved it . Their parents had even more fun moving the elf every night to see their little ones eyes light up each morning to discover that the elf had come back after reporting to Santa at the North Pole . Had to order for my next grandchild turning 3 .
5 #### This will be sent to my granddaughter from the " North Pole . " These are so fun for kids .
5 #### We love him and always will . This is a must have for your family to pass down .
5 #### Ca n't wait to begin a new tradition with my grandchild next 2018 holiday season as the child get a little older .
4 #### SO excited ca nt wait to have some Christmas fun with my kids , now that they finally understand the holidays ..
5 #### A perfect gift for my grandsons . It was what I expected .
5 #### This Elf on the Shelf was a huge hit for our four year old . The elf " arrived " the day after Thanksgiving to encourage good behavior . It came with a book that we read at least 100 times before Christmas . We can not wait for our elf " Jack " to arrive this year .
5 #### One of my kids favorite Christmas traditions ! The ideas are endless . Everyone should have an Elf on the Shelf !
5 #### I got this to prank my co - workers around the office . I ca n't wait for December so I can start planting it around ! ! !
5 #### I bought this for my nieces and nephews a few years ago and it has become a fun Christmas tradition for my sister and her kids . They love it when the elf shows up after Thanksgiving . Their favorite thing to do each morning is to look around the house and try to find out where he " landed " when came back from the North Pole . It is so cute watching their imaginations while making memories that they will always remember .
5 #### What can I say he 's an elf on a shelf the original one and only . Mint condition and super cute . My daughter has wanted us to use these for years so I finally broke down and bought one . It 's well worth the money . Amazon prices ca n't be beat .
5 #### My 3 year old loves her elf ! She gets so excited to see her elf every morning during Christmas
5 #### Ordered this for a friend of my daughter 's . It arrived on time , and our little friend was THRILLED !
5 #### My 4 year old grandson wanted his mom to send elf who he named Red back to Santa .
5 #### Was so glad we ordered this . It came super fast and our family tradition started on December 1st .
5 #### Great product . " Harold " is such a welcome addition to our family during the holidays
5 #### My 3 & 4 yr old loved this . Everyday was a new adventure ..
1 #### For this much money , I 'd expect the legs / arms to be wired . The arms are sewn together - and the legs are unpositionable . There 's no way you can pose this elf . He has one position . That 's it .
5 #### My children loved the book and elf ! We now have a new family tradition at Christmastime !
5 #### This is our family 's first Elf . He is adorable and we 'll see him every year after Thanksgiving . There are so many ideas on Pinterest so you do n't have to worry about what to do with him every night . : )
5 #### Loved it . Price , speedy delivery and quality were awesome
5 #### Great fun for whole family --- makes a wonderful Christmas tradition ! ! !
5 #### Who does n't love this guy ? My daughter 's elf disappeared ( elfin magic ) when he needed to appear this year ( a promotion ? ) and I promised her a replacement ( we contend you have to be referred by a current elf family ) . It arrived quickly and jumped into action . There is a lot of competition among family elves . Thank you !
5 #### My boys LOVE this thing ! My 9 , 7 and 2 and a half year old sons love seeing what our elf has been up to while they are in bed or at school , ( the older ones . ) . This last December was our second Christmas with " peanut " and they ca n't get enough of his antics . I think it was a good purchase even if he is a lot of work . My family is happy with our elf on a shelf .
5 #### This was the first year for Elf on the Shelf in our home . I am so happy the book came along with the elf because we did n't have any idea how it all worked . Kids loved it and it is now a new tradition in our home
5 #### Had too much fun setting up this little guy up :)
5 #### Such a cute idea for a Christmas tradition with our toddler ! He gets so excited to wake up and find out where his elf 's new lookout spot is .
5 #### Ordered this for a baby shower gift I 'll be attending the first of January . That way baby Cameron will have his elf with him from day one . We of course have our own , Zippy , and this little guy is the BEST tool for keeping kids on their best behavior during December and they are just so much fun ! I hate that some adults have turned something so wholesome and sweet into something dirty at times , but hey , Santa watches them too . So when they get coal in their stockings , they should n't be surprised . Every child needs their own Elf . It 's as simple as that . Even a wee baby newborn coming soon .
3 #### Kids are loving this tradition but with so many tutorials out there explaining how to put wire in your elf 's arms and legs so it bends , and Velcro on it 's hands so it can do more , why have n't they come out with a newer version that does not require people to jerry rig their elf so it does these things ?
5 #### So excited ! Elf name Todd ( my son says ) is here and now we ca nt wait to find him every day !
5 #### Love love it and my boys love it to .
5 #### He is perfect and hanging out in my wine bar ... Naughty elf getting drunk !
5 #### Our Grandchildren love this tradition . They 've had LOTS of fun with Gordon , Wesley , and Charles .
5 #### Perfectly wrapped and boxed easy to open . But be careful it opens on the right side it is hell with two little magnets . No tape . What a wonderful gift . When you get it , you go online and register it you will receive a birth certificate via email you get to name it . Give it a date of birth A wonderful new Christmas tradition .
5 #### My daughter is in love with her elf ! Only change I would make is to glue his hat on . Will probably end up doing that ourselves . Excited to start such a fun tradition !
5 #### This is an excellent product and an excellent tradition . Our kids love it and so do we . I only have positives for this product and the seller .
5 #### Okay , my kids are ages between 18 and 28 , and my parents are in their mid 70 's and my brothers are in their fifties , that did not stop me from ordering four boy elves in the UK and two boy elves and a girl for the United States . Yes , we are all ready having fun with these little guys and they have all been named and have now all been adopted by mischievous grown ups ... it 's official as we all have birth certificates ! How can I say anything negative about an elf ... other than the havoc and destruction these little things are creating . Products arrived by elf carrier and were early than expected with delivery times . They arrived well packaged , with a book ( must read it sometime ) and website page so you can officially adopt the little blighter . [ ... ] [ ... ] [ ... ]
5 #### Adorable little elf . Myvkids were so excited to meet him . His hands are sewn together , which makes it very easy to pose him in all sorts of cute poses . There are some elves out there that look cheap , with ugly faces . This is one of the cute ones !
5 #### Families thrive off of tradition . It brings each other closer together . This is a great traditional to bring to your family . I 'm thankful I began this year . My son 's so excited .
3 #### It 's a nice presentation , but should cost like $ 19.99 . Elf is decent quality , but you can see all the glue lines and cheap stitching . There are no wires in the Elf , so not as posable as I expected . Buy the cheaper ones available on amazon if you do n't need or want to book . The book is cute until you get to the full page illustration of praying childern , no good way to skip this part without having to explain what they are doing . The book is still usable but if you do n't want introduce your kids to religion , you can to glue the pages together . The story still makes sense . I was hoping for no religious message . We love Christmas but prefer to keep it secular . Please do n't post a bunch of hater " war on christmas " responses . I have no problem with merry xmas , or with others having a religious celebrations . Santa and elves are typically a secular alternative .
5 #### I bought these for my grandsons . It 's great to bring them out after Thanksgiving ! They report to Santa on the kids behavior . My daughter started this with her daughter at 3 and she gets really creative doing it nightly , such as where she puts it and has the elf leave notes and treats . She puts her in a different spot each time so her daughter has to find her Elf that she named Faith .... I decided to buy for my two grandsons so their parents can start this tradition too . I just bought my granddaughter the reindeer so the Elf can have her friend . This item comes with the story as well . It 's perfect to do with your children and see them get excited daily up to Christmas Day . Great value and fast shipping .
5 #### It was a HUGE hit in my house ! Too bad I never heard of this years ago ! .It does get difficult though trying to figure put new original ways to hide and get him into mischief . Fun though
5 #### It 's not even Christmas and he has been so busy ! Cooking , working on his car , posing for a fashion shoot ! Unfortunately he was captured by some rogue soldiers , but recovered nicely !
1 #### Book came damaged ! Tha back part was unattached ( hence the 1 star ) , anyhow the story is beautiful and the elf is great , my daughters are super excited about it !
5 #### Love this book and outfit ! Perfect surprise for a birthday !
5 #### Had another son , so we had to order another . The hope is one day we 'll pass them along to each boy for their future children .
5 #### I was hesitant to purchase this . $ 30 seems like a lot for a small toy that does n't really get played with along with a book that you read one time per year . My five - year - old found this completely magical and was very excited to find the elf every single day . He is already looking forward to the elf coming out again this year . I had my reservations , but I would highly recommend purchasing this as it can be a treasure for years to come !
5 #### I love this tradition . It 's so fun for the kids . Pinterest provides many ideas for elf
5 #### I got two years of solid enjoyment out of doing this . Then my kid got too old and grumpy for it . I still bring him / it out anyway . Forget lame kids , this elf on the shelf is now for me !
5 #### My order was complete had everything that was discribed and met my expectations .
5 #### I got this set and the video for a gift for someone and it was a huge success , the perfect gift !
5 #### I bought this for my children and they absolutely love this guy . I almost had to buy one , as so many of their friends had one , and even their class had one . For the money , I think it 's definetly worth the happiness it brings to children . I will most likely buy another one for next Christmas , the kids just have so much fun with it .
5 #### My nephews loved their Elf on a shelf . We had a lot of fun with it .
5 #### The grandkids were all into the Elf on the Shelf ( they named theirs Scout ) . My one grandson told me that he was hoping he would " accidentally " see " Scout " move from one place to another , but he was afraid it might cost him Christmas presents . I got tickled hearing his story . What a great way to keep the Christmas spirit alive . I recommend this to anyone .
5 #### Had looked all over for this little guy . All local stores were sold out . Purchased it for my mother for Christmas . Come to find out , she had gotten me one also . My kids are a little older ... so it 's usually me ( mom ) that wakes up and finds what mischief the little guy has gotten into during the night . So it 's fun for older kids too !
5 #### A wonderful tradition . my grandson loves this especially seeing where he has landed the next day . Also help keep your little ones on their best behavior as Elf reports to Santa !
5 #### My grandchildren and their parents had too much fun with this .
4 #### This is a cute production and a nice holiday tradition . I read it to my son and he picked a name . I voted for Skippy or Jingle bells . He picked Fred . His mom thought of all sorts of hilarious props and scenarios for Fred . We are going to keep doing it long after he figures out the whole Santa thing because it is lots of fun to come up with different ideas . It was so popular this holiday season that stores were sold out in our area . While I think it is a tad overpriced for a doll with felt points for legs , it was cheaper on Amazon then it was in the stores . The shipping was fast and it was well packaged . This is a holiday keeper .
5 #### love elf on the shelf - kids named him Zoomi - Zoomi is very mischievous at times
5 #### Fun ! My husband and I had fun coming up with new places to hide it while my son had fun trying to find it !
4 #### I only bought this because our kids came home from school begging . It is too expensive for what it is worth . Do n't feed into the pressure ! ! !
5 #### I ordered this for my grandkids who were in danger of being put on the naughty list . My daughter has been wanting one for her kids for ages , so I thought this would be the perfect time to order it . I had it delivered to their house and they thought it came right from the North Pole ! They absolutely loved the story that came with the elf . My daughter and son in law had fun thinking of new ways to put their Elf on the Shelf every night before the kids woke up . The kids started going to bed without a fuss , and one even woke up early and started cleaning her room without being asked ! With their Elf partners help , they stayed on the nice list and Santa finally came to see them with lots of goodies and toys ! The elf was very nicely made , the packaging was cute also . The story was cute and the kids loved it . I should also note that even the scheptical 7 year old believed it . This has created a nice new tradition for their family to have each Christmas , and many memories .
5 #### Love our elf on the shelf ! Came with the cute story and was in perfect condition .
5 #### This is as fun as you make it . My granddaughter got her first Barbie , and since Toy Story has Barbie and Ken , I found her using the Elf as a replacement Ken .
5 #### Finally got to use it but kept forgetting to replace it kids loved it ..
5 #### Elf on the shelf , what more do I say ? Get him before he destroys your kitchen !
5 #### My granddaughter loves coming over to see where the elf is hiding .
5 #### I LOVE this product . I could not be anymore satisfied . This will become a tradition now and will be carried on for years . For 25 dollars ? That is more than worth it to me . My child named our elf Train and he caused a lot of trouble around the house ! He also helped keep the kids in check , because the elf is always watching and listening ! So much fun all throughout December , and to be able to see the wonder and joy in your child 's eyes every morning when they wake up to see the elf in a new spot is irreplaceable . I recommend putting wire into the limbs so he can bend into positions . I used a lot of tape before I found the right sized wire .
3 #### Geez . An overpriced book . The elf is ok . Would be better if the arms had a way to bend them and make it pose - able .
5 #### Ca n't wait for my grandson to meet him next Christmas
5 #### We caved and purchased this terrible creation . Our kids love our elf , Snowmint . He really did make the kids act a bit better and I had fun moving him around the house every night !
5 #### Love the whole elf on the shelf storyline and idea . My elf came in really fast and we had no problems with it at all . My kids were excited to open the package and read about their elf . Great product and great seller . I recommend this to anyone wanting a magical experience with their children .
5 #### It was our first year for elf on the shelf my kids loved it ! !
5 #### Great Product & she Loves the hardcover book included , telling his story ! !
5 #### We have used this for 2 Christmas seasons . Our 5 - 6 year old loves it and raced to find it eack morning
5 #### Purchased for use in Alzheimer 's unit . Fun for residents to look for elf each day .
5 #### Packaged well and nice item . Got a jersey for it as well to make it more like my sporty nephew . Kids liked this elf .
5 #### Wow ! My son is captivated by the story and the elf itself . Highly recommended .
5 #### First year for us . My two year old loved his Sprite .
5 #### George the Elf arrived promptly at the end of November . The book that he brought with him helped our daughter ( almost 3 years old ) get acquainted with Santa 's intelligence operative . After arriving on the first night , George began his mission to spy on our daughter and ensure the big Jolly guy had the information he needed to determine if our daughter was naughty or nice ... Every night , he left our location to quickly relay info the Santa and the Claus Intelligence Agency . Each morning , much to the surprise of our daughter , he would be found somewhere conversing with her toys ( and closest confidants ) or , most commonly , creating a little mischief . I personally believe this was a way of testing our daughter to see which side of the list she would be on . Luckily , our daughter seemed to have passed these tests with flying colors , because it appears that George called in for air cover on Christmas Eve , judging by the gifts that Santa brought . Overall , we were a little worried that our daughter was not quite ready for her very own operative , but we were pleasantly surprised at how much she talked about George . We 'll welcome George back into our home next year , but I 'm going to need to have a little conversation with him about the toothpaste on the bathroom mirror ...
4 #### I little pricey but what can ya do . I wish it had some flexible little poles within the elf to make it easier to put in positions . Regardless my kids loved the idea of the elf ( Peter Brown Pan ) .
5 #### As much as i ca n't stand this little guy , and really hate dealing with him . My kids love him and makes every morning exciting as they go searching around the house for him . Just as described .
5 #### Excited to have gotten this for great friends of ours . Everyone needs an Elf on the Shelf !
5 #### Perfect my kids love their elf a great tradition for the holidays .
5 #### Arrived in excellent condition . The box that the elf comes in is reusable and even has a place to store the book that comes with it . I was very satisfied . Thanks guys .
1 #### I was almost going to buy one for my daughter , since she was kept asking one for the house . Thank god I saw one at Costco that only cost you $ 15 VS Amazon $ 29 - 39 . I am very pleased I bought one from Costco and quality is way much better compare to Amazon ones is plastic . Costco ones are nice quality made and looked great . Totally worth it .
4 #### This was a big hit this year with our daughter . She is 8 and we were not sure she would enjoy it . We were very wrong . We brought this out after Thanksgiving , read the book and have been enjoying the " crazy and weird " things this elf does every night . On a few occasions , our daughter swore he moved when we were not home and even left it a picture and notes . It is nice to see her wake up happy and ready to find the little rascal . The elf itself consists of a typical stuffing material and is pretty bendable and strong . We have had him bend - hung - flattened and he is like new with no signs of any issues . The box it comes with is very solid and makes for a great sturdy storage for in between seasons . Great idea that once you buy it , will provide years of enjoyment . Highly recommend . Might even be adding the girl version in the future . I took one star away as the hands lacked an important feature . They come stitched together which limit the function for positions , etc a great deal . They should put strong magnets in the hands so that you can separate them and use them for metal object ideas , etc .
5 #### ELF JACK HAS BEEN WELCOMED TO OUR HOUSE AND KIDS LOVE HIM !
5 #### Fun tradition to do with the kids . My roommate has a 4 year old and we have been enjoying our elf all season .
5 #### Great item to have around Christmas . Adds a little Christmas Cheer
5 #### So cute ! I wish it was n't so expensive but its a cute idea for a Christmas tradition .
5 #### my 6 yr old truly believes ahhh to be young and believe in magic
5 #### This has become such a wonderful tradition for my five year old . We love seeing the adventures of our elf Zart , .
5 #### This Elf on the Shelf is so much FUN ! I have seen this product available for years ! My oldest is finally old enough to understand and get the Elf on the Shelf . ( Ages 3,2 , and 1 ) my Three year old every morning gets so excited to find our Elf " Spike " and understands what the Elf does ! My two year old goes along with his older brother . I would recommend ages 3 and older . For the product ... The package is comes in is sturdy and is nice to keep everything together in . The Elf is made very durable ! The book that comes with it is NICE ! It 's a hard cover and the pages are a think paper . In the back of the book it has an area that you write when your tradition started and your elfs name . It 's a cute and easy read ! My boys love the book so much we read it every night before bedtime ! I would recommend this Elf on the Shelf package to anyone ! It 's such a FUN new family tradition I ca n't wait to do every year with my family !
5 #### Purchased to start a tradition for my son . Live the idea and live it comes in a nice package for the book and elf . Each year we can put away and will stay very nice .
4 #### A lot of money for a felt elf and a book but the kids love it . If you 've never done elf on the shelf I 'd recommend reading the book and preparing your story for the elfs entrance before introducing it to your kids . I almost screwed it up . My 3 year old does n't quite get it yet but my 9 year old loves looking for him every morning .
5 #### So far my kids have really enjoyed reading the book and looking for the elf every morning to see where he 's at .
5 #### This was the best money spent ! ! ! ! My 6 year old read the book and has not questioned brushing her teeth because Larry the Elf is watching . I need an elf for every day during the year .
5 #### Kids Love it , and we love it cause they do . A++++++
5 #### This is one of my favorite holiday traditions . My children waking up and trying to find where he is now . I think it 's a fun tradition for children and parents alike . I would recommend it !
3 #### The case arrived with the elf loose in the box . The wires that hold him were undone . The stickers were unattached showing that someone previously owned / opened this elf . The elf and the box were in good condition . The book was also in perfect condition . I was n't going to be picky and return the product since there was nothing wrong with the elf or book . My kids love the elf so I 'm not going to give a bad review .
5 #### Everyone keeps saying they do n't like the book because it gives the kids the wrong idea . This totally gave my daughter an eye opener . She recently started preschool , and it has been extremely hard to wake her up . Ever since Scout ( the elf ) came to visit us she has been on her best behavior . She even falls asleep on her own at night ! Which is something I have n't been able to do for years now ! Every morning she wakes up before school all bright eyed and bushy tailed to find out what Scout did over night . This is a HIGHLY recommended product ! ! My daughter loves Scout !
5 #### Arrived quickly . And in perfect shape . My kid loves this . We search for the elf in the book and he loves finding him around the house . This is such a cute tradition . Great price too
5 #### I ordered this and sent it to my sister for her kids . I got one for my son , and it is a GREAT tradition . It is such a great thing for the kids and they get so much joy out of it . My son acts the best around Christmas because of " Kevin , " his elf . I wish they had one of these for every season ! lol
5 #### It was a gift for our niece . She was happy and super excited about it !
4 #### the book is nice and the whole concept is pretty good . however , i do n't like the fact that my child wants to act so much better when there 's supposedly a magic elf .. darn kid should be good all the time ! ha . anyway , it 's fun and easy to think of even VERY simple ideas for the elf to go . however i wish the hands had velcro or something because having his hands sewn together makes things tricky .
5 #### Your kids will love this ( named ours chippy ) they will behave now until Christmas because they know santa has a person watching them.hahaha
5 #### If you have kids and do t already own this buy one now !
5 #### Love this product ! My children enjoy finding the elf ( ours is " Eddie Eggnog " ) every morning leading up to Christmas . Helps ( a little ? ) to keep them behaved believing that he 's watching them and reporting back to Santa . All in all , a good little set , and well worth it just to see my kids interact with his " antics " .
5 #### This was one of the best purchases I made all year ! If you have kids and do n't have an Elf on the Shelf yet ... go buy one ! My husband and I had more fun than the kids did with this ! Great holiday activity and the kids could n't wait to see what our Elf got into every night . Loved how it came with a special hardcover book and in a keepsake case .
4 #### Wish his hands would separate and be bendable with wire inside .
5 #### I got this as a gift and did n't quite understand why someone would give an adult a doll so I just put it on the shelf . This thing is creepy ... Day 1 : found elf sitting in a different spot , maybe someone else moved it . Day 2 : found elf on my bathroom floor after I swore I saw him in the living room this morning . Day 3 : finally set up a camera , saw him moving in the middle of the night . Day 4 : ran it over with my car and threw it in the garbage but that night it found its way into my bed . Day 5 : I could n't take it anymore so I moved out of my house . It 's the only way the elf has left me alone . If you get this as a gift , all I can say is RUN ! ! !
5 #### fun tradition . Our family loves it so I bought it for my sons school class to have
5 #### So far we really enjoy it . First year trying it out .
5 #### Gift for my great grandson and he will love it I 'm sure . My granddaughter loved the idea of this new tradition .
5 #### just received it in the mail yesterday but ..... not planning to announce the arrival to my 3 year old son till the night after thanksgiving . I never thought i would buy one and really did n't get the point of it but then i read up on the story and how fun it is for the kids and i had to do it . I ca nt wait to read the book to my son , give the elf a name and make a game of it each day looking for the elf around the house .
5 #### Great gift set with the book and elf . Ca n't wait to get started !
1 #### We received it as a gift from my sister in law ( considered to be a verrry smart woman by the way ) . I decided to open it when my child was 2 y.o . So my child took it " to play " , and I never saw the elf until Easter . I asked where is the elf ? My child answered : He is far away , you will not find him ! Another time I said to my child : That bad elf will take all of your toys if you will keep misbehaving ! And my child said : No he will not ! Ha - ha ! He is a simple toy ! And started to laugh ! I never read to her that stupid " book " of course . And the toy elf is still somewhere in her toy chest I think .
5 #### This little guy is a lot of fun ! This set is a great Christmas tradition for any family , classroom , organization , or group to have . The story is very cute and the illustrations add to it . Not only does the story serve as a nice book to read , it also contains the " instructions " required for having an Elf on your shelf . The packaging looks nice sitting on a bookshelf and stores easily . The little elf is made very well , which is good , because he / she is probably going to be put through quite a bit ! Pick up this set and get ready for some Christmas fun !
5 #### Fun for our 6 yr old son to have this . Husband moves it every night and leaves a short note .
5 #### My husband hates this thing . I absolutely LOVE IT ! Especially when I can scare him in places where he least expects it . Have you seen a flying shoe because a grown man was scared that something was in it ? It 's great . I was hoping to pass along to our child , but found out we ca n't so , that 's fine . We 'll keep between ourselves . I came home from work one time and he had little bottles of liquor all around him .... Elf of the Shelf had a rough day , where he was found with Tylenol the next morning . :) See it 's fun even among adults !
5 #### Great Elf on the Shelf . My grandson loves it .
5 #### The g'kids just love the process of the Elf .
5 #### Great new tradition . Lance , our elf , came straight from Santa 's workshop . He is a happy elf . Not devious like many I have seen posted on the web .
5 #### Our granddaughter and grandsons adore the Elf on the Shelf fantasy . Their moms take quite a lot of energy and imagination to place the elves in different positions and with different accessories each day prior to Christmas . The storybook is engaging . However , I 'm not quite sure whether they truly believe that the elf is " watching " them each day . Yet , they enjoy the daily event of finding their elf . It has become a sweet memory of childhood .
5 #### I love my elves . I bought one for each of my young children and they engage in silly antics as a group , just like my kids do ! I wanted one for each of my children so I can pass their elf on to them as a keepsake when they are older to hopefully use with their own children ! ! !
5 #### This has been the most fun and memorable holiday tradition I have ever done as a mom . I hope my kids pass it on to their kids . Great idea and so fun for the while family . Even once the kids stop believing , I imagine it could still be so much fun . Best part of our holiday season for sure ! ! !
5 #### I purchased this to play around with and make an adult version with my husband . We would put our elf into some pretty hilarious situations . Everyone we told about it got an absolute kick out of it and thought it was hilarious . If you do n't have kids you can still purchase it and have fun . Us adults like to have fun too and let our inner child out every now and again .
5 #### My family had a lot of fun with this . We got a lot of ideas for jokes from Pinterest . Apparently there are entire online communities devoted to using this toy for practical jokes .
5 #### Introduced our toddler to " Elfie " last year . By about the third or fourth day he was starting to get the idea of looking for him around the house . We enjoyed it , but do n't ever forget to move him ! We had to explain to our son that the elf was coming down with a cold and must have fallen asleep early one night instead of reporting back to Santa . He bought it thankfully .
5 #### Love this product and fun Christmastime family activity ! Will be making this a yearly tradition:- )
5 #### My kids LOVE our elf and they really enjoyed hearing the story .
5 #### First I have to say that our house does n't use this as leverage . I merely do it for the fun and magic of Christmas . This is my second elf for my second child , more so I can give them each their elf when their adults for their family traditions . My oldest loves this elf because he makes messes , sends and receives mail from other elves , leaves treats , and plays tricks . It 's just silly fun ! A couple times a week we read the cute story that comes with it to remind our sons the reason he 's here and the other nights we read real reason for the season stories . Yes , I spend about 20 minutes a day every other day or so making the elf do the silly things but I laugh hysterically the entire and my child thinks it 's magically so I 've had 2 of the best Christmas 's ever so far ...
5 #### i LOVe elf on teh shelf . this came fast and from a great seller i would recommend . cantwait to start it this year with my son !
5 #### Even though I think this elf is creepy as Hell my kids both love it .
3 #### Does not come with wire in the legs or arms ... :(
5 #### Santa delivered this just in time and our little elf was a happy addition to our family ... 3 years after we bought him ! The Elf on the Shelf prefers children of a less handsy age , so I recommend inviting the little guy in when kids are at least 5 years old or up
4 #### While I do not subscribe to the message it sends , I do like the interaction it inspires . We created our own message to our son of what our Elf means to our family and that seems to work for us .
5 #### Fun Fun Fun ........ great fun at Christmas time .
5 #### I 'd seen so many posting these elf 's doing different things on face book . They looked so cute I bought this boy and a girl elf . They adorable ! I just wish I 'd ordered them sooner to enjoy for more then a week before Christmas . I also ordered a outfit for each and plan on getting more
5 #### This came in a nice case and was well made . My kids love the tradition and the book is beautiful .
5 #### Mr 4 year old really got into this . Made him behave better cause " jingle " was watching !
5 #### Love the elf on the shelf ! Last Christmas was the first time " Snolf " the elf visited our home . It will now be a tradition in our home for years to come . Our 8 year old daughter loved and our one year old son will learn to love it as he gets older . I highly recommend this . A little pricy but its a one time purchase , so well worth it .
5 #### Bought this for my 4 yo it is our first year doing it . He loved looking for his elf . Wonderful hardcover book and the box is great of storage year after year .
5 #### My nephews loved it ... and so did their Momma ;)
5 #### I know they seem overpriced and annoying but I LOVE THIS THING ! Our Elves ( yes we have more than 1 ) make the Christmas season enjoyable for all 3 of my kiddos ! I am hoping that when they are older they will take the elves with them into their homes . Ours have lasted 3 years so far with no wear or tear !
4 #### My family had so much fun with this over the holiday season . It 's a great tradition to start for any family . I would have given it 5 stars if it would have been more user friendly . For example , the arms and legs should be able to be posed or bendable so you can attach him to things . Or even if there was velcro on the hands instead of them being seen . Otherwise great purchase !
5 #### My kids love this and expect " Charlie " to report home right after Thanksgiving . Its a great family tradition and will continue it each year .
5 #### My son loves elf on the shelf ! Is enjoyed every part of this for Christmas ! definitely worth the money !
5 #### Bought it but have n't been able to use it yet . Next year will be our first year . I do wish the arms and legs were posable but ca n't wait till Christmas to start a new family tradition .
5 #### I wish I would have ordered this years ago because our family had a lot of fun ! Honey and I took turns setting him up at night and the hardest part was deciding where or how to put him because social media is flooded with different ideas . I ca n't wait for him to come back out next year and start all over again !
4 #### It 's a fad item , but an easy and fun trap to fall into around the holidays . I do n't have small children , it was purely for my own fun and amusement and those of my Facebook friends . My mother ordered one too so next year should be fun . It 's a bit pricey for what it is , but still , it 's cute .
5 #### Had to replace our Elf . Lost him in our move , unfortunately . But this was great . Boys did n't know at all . Still the same effect and magic . Love this ! I 'm sure this will be a tradition every year . Once we find the other then we will have two . Do n't know what we 'll do then . Lol !
5 #### This Elf was a hit at our house . Had a lot of fun with the kids with him ! Adds a little bit of magic to little ones minds and makes Christmas and Santa Clause very exciting for them .
5 #### Most items bought are to make life easier and if that 's your thought too , this is not the product for you . This item will cause undue stress on a daily basis thoughout the Christmas season . You will spend a fair amount of time on Google and Pinterest every single day . You will then reject the majority of " ideas " for your new family member as either way too time consuming or because you do not own a craft store located within your house . On Christmas Eve , your kids will cry because Elfie leaves . You 've been warned .
5 #### Remember , we are dealing with children whom deal in the moment of self - gratification vs 3 or months of " pleasing Santa " and lying about the past months . Too bad that they wo n't make the " Elves " in the USA .
5 #### Purchased in Feb. for next xmas . Good price at $ 20 so I grabbed it now . Will make a perfect gift .
5 #### My son loved it . I recommend buying the movie too .
5 #### I always thought these elves were so silly and expensive but we broke down and joined the fun and I 'm glad we did ! A fun Christmas tradition that keeps that special magic and fantasy going in a time when kids seem to have so little imagination and creativity .
5 #### This is such a cute idea ! I have used it for 2 years now . Every year when he comes , the book comes with . My daughter loves reading the story with her elf ! It is fun for kiss and parents , she wakes wanting to find him . It is adorable how excited she gets looking for him . Then when she finds him , she is overjoyed ! This is a great tradition to start with your family . My son , who just turned 1 , was excited over it as well . I 'm not sure he really knew what was going on , but he learned from watching how excited his sister would gwt !
5 #### My sons had so much fun learning about elf on the shelf this year/ what a great family tradition ! ! !
5 #### this elf friend is so cute loving and is a great best buddy for kids at home to kids at school and also is a fun member of your family !
5 #### Love this . Product just as expected and very fun . How did people ever come up with clever ideas before pinterest ? This has been a great addition to our family christmas traditions .
5 #### Our family had so much fun with our elf this year !
5 #### What 's not to love about the Elf on the Shelf ?
4 #### Nice behavior modification tool . Wish the arms and legs were moldable
5 #### Great quality . You can never have too many Elf on the Shelfs :)
5 #### Love this guy . Added a personal touch to him . He is a member of Family now ( Snowflake )
5 #### huge hit ! ! kids loved me reading the book to them went seaching for their elf each morning ..
1 #### I was so disappointed to find that the design of this elf has changed since we got ours in 2009 . Unfortunately , ours had a mishap this year ( got too close to a lightbulb ) , and I needed to quickly replace him . I was impressed with Amazon at the speed with which he arrived . However , the new one looked NOTHING like the old one ! ! The quality of the painting was sub - par and messy , and the face shape , paint colors , eye shape , and hair were not as colorful or cute as our original one . The felt used for the body and hat on the new one is cheaper and rougher , more of a thick , scratchy felt than the soft one we had . He just seemed so dull and cheap , comparatively . Sadly , it seems they have let the quality go in favor of mass production . Luckily , only the body of ours had been damaged , so I was able to do a full head transplant , and my kids were none the wiser . When my kids noticed these new ones in the stores this year , they actually commented on how different they looked from theirs at home ! Additionally , I looked for just the elf without the book , but found that I had to repurchase the entire set , so now I have an extra book and box . I wish I could find another of the older design elf- I would pick it up now and save it , just in case I need it in the future .
5 #### My daughter really enjoyed this for Christmas this year . Comes with a book that you can read to the kids .
5 #### what can you say about elf on self ... grandkids love it and the story behind it .... thye looked foward ever day trying to find him
5 #### Yes my grandsons were so excited thru the whole holiday season .
5 #### Loved it . My granddaughter had wanted one for a long time and she was delighted .
5 #### I do n't think I need to tell you how much fun this is . Shipped promptly , and we 'll enjoy him for years to come .
5 #### Grandma has one , we got one . Loved it . Our kids already knew the story so we did n't read it or anything . We did go online and print the Santa Letter and the adoption cert . Its fun and our kids really enjoyed all of his antics this year .
5 #### This was a lovely little set for any child to be introduced to their very own Elf ! My son loved it and enjoyed watching " Michael " ( as he named him ) play tricks , hang out , and have fun in our home before Christmas !
5 #### It is what I was wanting , but could totally do with out the book . Wish you could just buy the elf . We had lots of fun with him though !
5 #### After buying the elf for my 3 year old , I could n't resist and bought one for my nephews and niece . They ard 10 , 8 , 4 and 2 . All the kids got into the morning search and their Mom said that she never had to drag them out of bed like usual . My 8 year old niece was the most enthusiastic and proud that she picked the elf 's name . Jingle also kept her on her toes and she was golden , knowing that he could be watching . She apparently had one in her school classroom and that added to the fun . Our Mom has said more than once that she wished the elves were around when we were kids . It 's a cute idea and fun off the whole family . Just be sure that the elf moves or you might have some tears the next morning ! My sister had to get creative fast and thank goodness the website had a letter from Santa she was able to customize !
2 #### Someone is laughing all the way to the bank and retiring early , and it 's not me . I hated the book . The illustrations are ugly , and worse , the words are pathetic . In a desperate attempt to rhyme , there are some really lame lines and bad choices of words in there . I find myself paraphrasing every time I read it . You do n't need the book . You can just explain to your child that there is a magical elf that helps Santa by reporting who 's been naughty and who 's been nice , every night . Every morning he comes back and hangs out in a new spot . Just one rule : " You ca n't touch this - Hammertime ! " or he might lose his magic . The elf is n't bendy or velcroed or anything , so it was difficult to pose him anywhere except a shelf . For this amount of money , could n't you at least make his hands velcro together ? Lastly , my kids were not into it ( Age 2 and 3 ) . Maybe they were too young , or too spoiled . The elf brought them occasional gifts ( advent calendar , chocolate , diecast car , pajamas ) - still , the elf got no love . I will try again next year , but will make our own elf book together with our kids .
5 #### The school introduced this to my 1st grader . I do n't know what the fascination is but he loves it .
5 #### I received what I expected . My whole family had fun with our elf .
4 #### This is a cute tradition . The book is n't a remarkable piece of children 's literature , however . And the elf would be better if his hands were velcro'd instead of sewed . It would also be nice if his legs had some kind of wire in them so they could be positioned . There are DIY ways on how to do this on Pinterest , but honestly , who has the time ? The price is high enough for this book and elf that they could make the elf a little easier to position .
4 #### these guys are cute , and the possibilities for holiday entertainment are pretty much endless . Just be prepared for it . Strongly urge parents to plan a schedule so you avoid the last minute " oh crud , we forgot to move the elf " panic . Also may be better for 5 - 7yo ? ? Our 4yo struggled with the " no touch " rule , and just did n't seem phased by the " elf tells Santa " concept .
2 #### Stupid elf . Everyone has to have one , right . And they 're all named Chippy . This elf looks like something I made in 7th grade home ec . Not worth the money . Make one yourself .
4 #### This is the first year we did this and my kids love their elf . The only thing that would make this better is having ideas with it . You have to find ideas on Pinterest or the web . To have it all in one place would be better .
5 #### My grand babies have loves every min of this as it was delivered
3 #### This elf is really cute and we decided to name him dash . He is fun but I believe he needs feet and hands to do more with him , There are so many rules that come w him and my kids question how he is able to do the things he does . Not so sure they believe he 's magical . It 's fun for really young kids though
5 #### It was a HUGE hit in my house ! Too bad I never heard of this years ago ! .It does get difficult though trying to not fall asleep before you can move it . My so had n't stopped talking about our new elf and was sad when it was his last night .
4 #### Cute concept . My son liked it but was n't obssesed like some kids . It is a lot of work to come up with new ideas , only downfall .
5 #### I adore the elf on the shelf . What a fun idea for the kids during the holiday season . My son is still to young to understand , but my nieces love it and look for it every day ! I ca n't wait to set him up in fun / funny ways for my boys !
5 #### Huge hit with the kids . I definitely recommend getting this if you have kids . It 's kind of pricey , but well worth it in memories .
5 #### A wonderful addition to our Christmas traditions ! I am not sure who had more fun ... my son or my husband and I !
3 #### Very cute but his collar came unglued . Fortunately I was able to repair with my hot glue gun but a little disapp
5 #### my granddaughters have had so much fun with this ... sure to become a christmas tradition~
5 #### What can I say , the elf is awesome ! My son talks to him to tell me what he wants for Christmas . Its a fun thing for the whole family .
5 #### I have been wanting to get an elf on the shelf for the last couple of years but have n't because I thought they were kinda expensive . Well this year I finally decided it was time . It arrived in its sealed box with a hole in the front ( so the elf can breathe ) and a beautifully written story book . My kids loved it . And of course the elf . His hands are stitched together so he is able to hang on things and he is very easy to arrange in all kinds of places . My kids adore " zippy " ! ! He will forever be a family tradition in our household . He has brought soo much joy this year to my kids ! If you have been hesitating because of the price , do n't . He is worth every penny ! ! :)
4 #### For any parent looking to put themselves through 25 days of torture , meaning you wake up in the middle of the night because you forgot to preform an elaborate scene involving a stiff , footless elf , this is for you . In all honesty , I like the elf . Waffles ( we named him as the book said to do ) is a great size to hide around the house , and comes with a book and box . The book is ok , we only read it once a year when he arrives ( from storage .... um the North Pole ) however it does not give a ton of background information on him . The website you link with is great ! I do have once concern , he has no feet , I am guessing because it would cost more to put create them .
5 #### We love our elf on a shelf . It is a little creepy at times but oh well .
5 #### Purchased for my grandson . Older grandson loves his elf .
5 #### Kids loved , arrived timely , the kids loved having the book read .
5 #### Kids love the Elf , and we have fun with it
5 #### My 7 year old granddaughter has become obsessed with this thing . First thing every morning she searches for it and wo n't quit until she finds the hiding place . My wife of course then has to hide it again so when she gets home from school , it 's search time again . For it to be worth while , you ( the adult ? ? ) has to be dedicated to hiding it as many times as possible and putting it in amusing positions . Do n't underestimate your child . Hide it where it is visible but make it challenging . I really believe these kids today are much sharper than we were and they love the exitement of the search .
4 #### creepy little guy with creepy eyes and concept . but my 2 & 3 year old love him . not too hard to move him around the house before I go to bed . seeing the kids excitement is well worth sharing my home with such a creepy elf . I 'm thinking of inserting wire in its limbs to make bendable .
5 #### My daughter wanted this last year and I waited to late to get it . I ordered it this year and her face when it came in the mail was priceless . Target even has outfits for them ! So far he has been a big hit in our house .
5 #### This is our first year using Elf on the Shelf . Our boys are almost 2.5 and 10 months old . Our toddler LOVES to look for " Jingle " every morning . It 's so fun to see how excited he gets . He loves his little elf . We read the story during bed time every night as well ( along with several others ) . I loved that the book mentions children saying their prayers . I feel like it 's a great way to merge the fun Christmas traditions with our Christian beliefs and offer the Children a special tradition they will hopefully pass on one day . The elf is adorable and the perfect size for hiding and posting . We kept his hands sewn together because it 's easier to hang him in different areas . I 'm glad we waited until our son was big enough to enjoy the Elf and am looking forward to next year when we can play with both boys . There are lots of cute ideas for Elf posing on Pinterest and I 've come up with a few on my own as well . We take our nightly picture of our son with Jingle before bed so we can keep track of all the hiding places . It will be fun to look back on as well each year . Great idea and love that this product started as a family tradition with sisters and they shared their tradition with all of us .
5 #### My kids are really enjoying waking up in the morning to look for Ross the elf lol .. They are behaving a little better since i tell them that if thwy do n't behave i will tell Ross so he can tell Santa .. the book is really nice and colorful , they love reading it over and over
5 #### Seems that the Elf on the Shelf only increases in value . My older grandchildren have had one for years . Now the next set of grandchildren need one . Thought I could buy one used for less but could n't find one for less than a brand - new one in the box . This is going to be a generational tradition . When I was a kid ( back in the late 40s to the 50s , our mom told us about the elf watching our behavior and reporting back to Santa . She would see him and point , but before we could turn our heads , he disappeared ! This may be one of the best parental tools EVER . I 'm going to surreptitious place " Elfie " in my daughter 's living room tomorrow at her 3 year old 's b'day party . I hope Maddie and her brother BELIEVE just like Grayson and Ava have for over 8 years !
2 #### Packaging and book is nice . Elf is of low quality . Made of stiff cheap rough felt . The hands are sewn together not Velcro or magnetized and the limbs do not have wire as the older knee hugger characters have thus making it impossible to keep in a pose or hang on most things that you would need to separate the hands to get his arms around . Mine also came with a rub mark on the cheek where paint had been rubbed off . My 17 month old does love to look at it and make him sit up , but it wo n't last long if I let him play with it . I was really hoping to be able to pose him more easily as that is the main reason I bought him .
1 #### DO NOT BUY ! ! ! Read the story of the elf carefully . Notice that on Christmas Eve the elf has to leave the house and go back to the North Pole to return next year . Many kids will find the elf amusing and will get attached to him and will cry and miss the elf on Christmas morning ! Poof , your Christmas will become a tragedy and not a happy event . Your child will cry because they will miss their funny elf friend . DONT START THIS TRADITION ! ! ! Do n't say I did n't warn you !
5 #### kids love Elf on the shelf ! ! ! this is a must for all familes ! !
5 #### We 're now on our second elf in four years and the newest model ( 2014 ) is made differently than the 2009 or 2010 model we had before . Why would we need a second elf when we only have one kid you ask ? Well , because the clothing these little elves ( demons ) wear is not prone to burning off when placed next to a light bulb . Yes , not a good idea for the elf to hide within a ceiling light fixture because it is a tricky place to find him ... when forgetful parents later turn the light on to mop the floor . The next time our elf moved to a new location in our house , he had a hole in his pants . So , do n't permit these elves to hide near incandescent light bulbs . As for the differences , the facial complexion is now more natural , the head is more round and less like a freaky clown with less makeup , and the elf has beanie baby type filler in his butt to help him sit up better than the older elves with less junk in their trunks .
5 #### I bought this for my children to start a new tradition in our household . Last year they were constantly coming home from school and telling me about their friends who already had taken part in this fun Christmas tradition so I am excited to try it out this year . I love the story that comes along with the elf ! !
5 #### This is fun , I remember having these as a kid , It is fun to move them all over the house and have my granddaughter hunt for it
5 #### Awesome ! ! Exactly what I ordered ! Great quality . Ca n't wait to unveil our new Christmas tradition at thanksgiving . I hope its much fun as I think it is .
5 #### this was a gift for my grandson . Heard great things about it from friends . Hope he enjoys it .
5 #### This is the second one we have purchased . Such a fun way to get the kids ready for Christmas . We have one for each of my boys and they love it !
5 #### This has become a tradition in our household that is loved by all . My children are delighted every year when their elf arrives . Now we ca n't imagine Christmas without our elf , Chip ! This is a great way to have fun with your children and make memories that they will be talking about for years to come .
5 #### Best Christmas tradition that we have . I have younger kids who love finding the elf every morning , and teenagers who get into finding a new hiding place every night !
5 #### We bought our elf last year and let me tell you ... we had so much fun ! My 7 year old son was excited to see what our elf ( Nippy Peppercorn ) was up to the night before . Nippy made snow angels in sugar , helped himself to a bag of m&ms and even decorated the Christmas tree ... with my son 's underwear - haha ! On Christmas Eve , Nippy left a note ( and some sprinkles of magical green glitter ) for my son in the fireplace saying he would be back next year . Ca n't wait to see Nippy again this year ! Awesome family tradition ... so worth the money for something so magical . On the other hand , a couple we know bought one for their son ... it absolutely freaked him out that the elf was creeping around the house at night . Lol . Understandable ...
5 #### Looking forward to hearing how the Grandchildren will have fun with this
5 #### Everything you need to get started with your elf on the shelf tradition . The book is very well made as well as the Elf , I was pleasantly surprised at the quality . We ca n't wait til December . Check out Pinterest for some really cute / clever Elf ideas .
5 #### This is such an awesome item and a great tradition to start with your family . It is amazing what you can do with your imagination to create a wonderful experience for your child .
5 #### This is such a great tradition that we 've embraced ! It 's a lot of work sometimes trying to come up with new creative things our Elf can get into and hide him so it takes time for them to find him . We 've had him write out a word using Fruit Loops . We 've had him say " Good morning " in flour . He 's zip - lined and hidden in a bowl full of candy canes . He 's even dangled from our cabinets by a candy cane . So much fun for your child when they wake up . Oh , some people compared the Elf on the Shelf with Christopher Pop - kins . Well , we bought both ! I bought another one because when one of my kids found the Elf on the Shelf the other three would be so bummed . So now every year both of them get into mischief together . The kids loved learning about Christopher Pop - kins too . I love to have fun and bring smiles during the holidays . My kids ( four of them ) have a blast trying to find both elves .
5 #### Cute . New tradition for my blended family . My older step sons had a blast hiding the elf each night for my young daughters .
5 #### I got this for my son to start a tradition with his new wife.its way to cute
5 #### Fantastic ! My 6 - year old loved this and my wife and I had just as much fun moving our elf around . Great toy for the holidays .
5 #### We love Elf on the Shelf at our house ! ! ! !
5 #### We love the Elf on the Shelf ! - This name is Umi .
5 #### This was the best purchase I made for Christmas 2013 ! The whole family enjoyed finding a new place for the elf to hide . My 5 year old had fun every morning trying to find him . We took photos of the elf and were sad to see him go away when Christmas came . Great family tradition !
5 #### Love it , love it , love it ! ! ! I received this free of charge in exchange for an unbiased review . I am pleasantly surprised . It is June now , so I have to look forward to its true use with my 6 and 8 year olds , but I can already see how wonderfully it is going to work . This will make the wait for Christmas so much more fun and whimsical than any advent calendar ever could . They have already been moving our elf ( we named him John after Daddy ;-) ) all over our house each night . I 've wanted this for years and am now wishing I had purchased it myself sooner . Ca n't wait to put him in action this Christmas and truly think this would make a great gift or purchase for us kids of all ages :-) . It has great illustrations , adorable direction and the book is long enough to cover the whole month of December . Job well done !
5 #### My kid love it ! He was so excited that I have no words to explain his excitment ; and definitely it helps my son behave more properly because of teh story behind the Elf on the Shelf . He is loking forward to have his visit this year , very anxious and always asking when he will arrived . The package and the ship time was incredible . No complaints at all !
5 #### We love this book / toy . My kids have so much fun every December morning racing around the house trying to find Elf first !
5 #### I always wanted one so when it went on sale I grabbed it . Who cares that it is summer , he is traveling with me and will be enjoying the beach and picnics in the park . Great fun for me and my son .
4 #### Came as described . Box was a little bent but it was for our family and the $ 9.99 price could n't be beat . Cute Elf on the Shelf with blue eyes and book .
5 #### Very cute ! Exceeded expectations ! Awesome price . My kids will love this little elf . Can not wait to put our little elf on the shelf .
5 #### This was a really good buy . The stores in my area had all sold out and this was the only place I could find this set
5 #### I used this for my first grade students and they loved it ! ! It was so fun to base writing assignments off of our elf Jingly .
5 #### I got this for my grandchildren . I was unable to find one locally and I was delighted to locate one on line . It was a great price and it has been used for 3 Christmas ' already .
5 #### This is exactly what you expect ! it is the vintage looking elf , it comes with a book explaining the Elf and his story . My son LOVE it . He is sad that the elf goes away on Christmas eve and only comes back at Thanksgiving ! So I think it is a great deal !
5 #### Everyone knows these are awesome , so I will add to this awareness in saying , it 's adorable and just what you expect .
5 #### This was an early Christmas present for my granddaughter . It had to be an early present because Chippy has to be there on the days leading up to Christmas for your child to be able to enjoy finding him in a different location each day , and on Christmas day he must return to the North Pole to help Santa until the next Christmas season . I found this to be a very endearing story and my granddaughter who is 6 absolutely loved it .
5 #### I had one of these when I was a kid . Although , I think the marketing campaign for them has been amped up a bit since I was young . I ca n't wait to get him out again next Christmas !
5 #### Such a fun family tradition . I did n't want to spend the $ 30 but finally bit the bullet and did and we had so much fun . I can not wait for the elf to come back for years to come at Christmas time .
5 #### My daughter loved it . I had a great time moving it around so she thinks it moves . She had a very magical Christmas . Simply adore this purchase .
5 #### What 's not to love about the Elf on the Shelf ? My 8 year old was sooooo excited to receive this on Christmas , and , when he 's acting up , all we have to do is remind him that the elf is watching , and he straightens up . Plus , how cute is it for us as parents to think of creative scenarios to put the elf in ? Very happy with this purchase !
5 #### bought for day care use the children had a greattime with him . Every morning it was a hunt for the elf . They had a great time with him .
5 #### I ca n't say enough about this book and doll . I had days of fun moving it around the house for my grand children 's benefit . They enjoyed looking for the next place he was hidden . The story was read over and over by request , and it kept them on their best behavior knowing Santa 's elf was watching their every move . I ended up buying it from Barne 's and Noble , because after ordering from Amazon backed seller and being told I 'd receive it before Christmas , I received an email telling me I would get it until January 15th . Obviously too late for the holiday season . Amazon refunded my money without any issues .
5 #### When it comes to behaving and making sure they do their chores by cleaning up rooms and toys , this little elfs does the trick . Of course it is always great to see the kids wake up from a dead sleep and ask if the elf has come back and where is he sitting now .
5 #### All I can say is for the time from Thanksgiving to Christmas this elf was very busy talking to Santa about my 4 year old grand daughter . It was magical .
5 #### My son loved finding this everyday . I did unstick his hands and then put wire in his arms in legs . You can find blogs and youtube videos on how to . I would recommend so you can make him do more fun things .
4 #### We joined the crowds and bought one this year , he was a lot of fun to move around the house and do funny tricks . I wish his limbs were more pose able and stayed put more easily . But the storage box was very sturdy and I like that .
5 #### This little Elf was the hit of the Christmas season . IT is a quality presentation , with a lovely book to go with it and ideas on using the elf to spark up Christmas . I loved it as did my kids and grandkids . It was new as indicated , and adorable .
5 #### I bought this for my daughter in law to start the tradition of the elf on the shelf . She was very happy to receive this and we both look forward to many years of fun . As each of children begin to have families I will be sure to make this a gift for them to start the tradition .
5 #### This was a Thanksgiving present for my 4 yr old grandson . We read the book , talked about the Elf 's " job " and he was all set to help ! My son said it was an adventure every day seeing where the Elf would be sitting in the morning . One of the best things I bought this year on Amazon . Want to enjoy Christmas more ? Get the Elf for the kids !
5 #### We have 5 grandkids and I could n't resist buying an elf for them . It is such a cute tradition for a family . It is fun to see where they will put him to watch over the kids . I highly recommend it for parents or grandparents !
5 #### Was the absolute best gift I bought this year , my four old grand son loved finding the elf every morning .
2 #### My Grandson got this and because of the movie , he got this one , but all my Great Grands got one cheaper and IMHO better because the arms and legs were wire and extremely posable . However , my Grandson ( 9 yrs old ) loved this elf and his Mom and Dad had fun using the concept during the Holidays .
5 #### Ordered this to start the Elf on the Shelf tradition in our home . Our son absolutely LOVED the Elf . I 'd recommend this to anybody who wants to add a little bit of fun for Christmas time .
5 #### It 's elf on the shelf . New grandson new elf on the shelf for him ... keep the tradition going . Another grandchild due May so I 'll be buying another one next year .
5 #### The book and doll are fun and my son loves waking up to find out what his elf , Dog Dog , has in store for him . The first name the kid picks is supposed to be the Elf 's name for life , in case you are wondering what kind of name that is . In any case , it 's a fun story and a tradition the whole family has enjoyed .
2 #### amazing that this sells for $ 30 . the elf is the cheapest toy I 've ever bought- it 's not positionable , and the arms do n't open . good marketing ! ! my son believes he 's real , but it did n't stop him from being bad !
5 #### If you follow the directions and read the story , register the elf with your child present and move Santa 's helper nightly , this is a wonderful toy . Cynics will argue that we are getting children accustomed to the NSA with the Elf , but it 's still fun and can help with discipline .
5 #### The book that came along with the elf was perfect to explain the elf 's story , and our boys ( ages 3 and 5 ) immediately got into it . The elf is cute , although probably a bit expensive considering what it is . However , it was worth the price to start a fun tradition that made our boys rocket out of bed every morning to see what their elf had done overnight .
4 #### I was excited to introduce elf this year with my little one and have it be a yearly tradition . I hope it becomes something that she remembers and looks forward to every year .
5 #### My oldest 5 years , has never acted better , she talked to hiim daily , and when he went away for the last time on christmas eve , she said she missed him
5 #### Bought it this past Christmas season for my 5yo daughter to enjoy . It was adorable to watch her face light up every morning as our elf , Blizzy , moved around the house . She was sad to see him go Christmas Eve , so I will definitely be looking into the birthday book and outfit for him ! Such a cute idea :)
3 #### I got this for my little one ; it is great fun to plan new things to do with it each night , but a bit expensive for the quality . I think if I install some velcro on it , it might work a bit better . Overall cute for kids .
1 #### Here 's a creepy little elf and a book . If you want the elf to cook and buy all the accessories its like buying skylanders or Disney xfinity . Every little extra thing costs at least 20.00 . This is awful quality too . I would not recommend thistle anyone . Save your money and buy a nice advent calendar instead - I suggest a LEGO advent calendar !
5 #### It shipped quick ! This has brought tons of fun and excitement for our family . My kids wake up every morning to find where the elf is .
5 #### This has to be the cutest idea ever . I have seen so many cute ideas from other people on facebook . Not only is it good for the little ones , but adults are having a ball with it too .
5 #### This has been the best gift my boys have received this year . They look forward to finding their elf every morning and it has really brought the spirit to our home . Great buy !
4 #### Great concept for those who have children 3 - 7 years old that still believe . Even gives parents excitement of being able to find unique locations on a nightly basis . Great invention ! !
3 #### I purchased this doll because so many of my friends were using it with their kids and having a blast with it . Unfortunately , as soon as my son saw it he was a little freaked ! He said it is scary looking . Maybe it is kinda creepy . He did not like the doll or got into it so I put it away . Maybe it 's not for every child ... Great idea though .
5 #### Loved it ! Too bad the Elf forgets some nights to move on a different shelf , oops ... Oh , and when the kids ask ' Mommy , why does the Elf has a tag on his back ? ' just answer with ' It says ' if found , return to the North Pole ! ''
5 #### This item was perfect . It was for my daughter for the upcoming holidays and she loves it . She loves finding him each morning . Thanks for such a great product and shipping was perfect .
5 #### We started the tradition this year with my children , ages 2 and 4 . They absolutely LOVE finding our elf , Martin , every morning . My husband and I laugh every night finding wild things for him to do . It is a great tradition that I know my children will cherish .
5 #### We do n't have any children in our home anymore , so I have been taking this to work and it has just been fun to see where the little elf is each day and what he is up to . The book that comes along with it is cute as well .
5 #### Gave this to my sister for my nephews . Hopefully it starts a Christmas tradition in her household . It 's fun watching the kids look for him in the morning !
4 #### This just seems like one of those instant classic toys . We starting using the Elf on the Shelf last year after our kids were asking about why we did not get an elf and so - and - so does . Within days it felt like we had been using the elf toy for years . Our children enjoy the hunt each morning , especially if Elf has been mischievous during the night . This always brings out big laughs . It does not take much effort to find a place for Elf to be each morning . No worries if Elf decides to stay put two days in a row ... it must be a comfortable spot . Notably , Elf 's legs have creases to bend , but the arms do not . That said , you can fold the arms , they just do not have creases built in .
5 #### Kid having a great time with it .. It came in exactly when it was supposed to . Neatly packaged , everything was perfect !
5 #### This is the most fun thing I 've purchased is a very long time and most definitely a tradition that will be going in our home for many , many years to come . My children are still young and they believe in everything . My husband also loves this and has already came up with so much ideas . I think this elf has brought the kid in my husband and I 'm just so happy to be able to share it with my children . My children named our elf , Fred , and let me tell you , Fred is naughty at times but he is a fun elf . My kids look forward to each mornings and they search for Fred and see what mischievous deeds he has done around the house . Fred definitely does not disappoint . This product is most definitely worth it and a keeper for any family .
5 #### My grandsons love their new elf ! They are being very good for " Buddy " and Santa ! ! Very cute idea ! :) highly recommend !
5 #### I highly recommend The Elf on the Shelf . We have done it for 8 days now and my daughter loves waking up every morning and finding out where and what Joey the elf has done . I ca n't wait to carry on this tradition .
5 #### Our entire family enjoys our elf ! It 's such a wonderful tradition ! I like how it comes in a case so that it can be safely stored away at the end of every season .
5 #### This was a gift for my niece and nephew ! A new Christmas tradition for them . The book is super cute and has already been read well over 30 times . They love the elf . I do not think he looks " creepy " at all . Super sweet and cute more like it . He has tight stitching and a detailed face . This is just a fun and creative was to countdown to Christmas . Makes each of the mornings exciting . The elf comes in many different eye colors , skin colors and even in girl . However makes it a little more difficult to pick just one , I had a brown eyed boy and blue eyed girl . We settled on the blue eyed boy , a little from each . Plus elves have just always been boys in my mind ;)
5 #### I am pretty sure I am not alone . This little guy is creepy but my son loves it . The way the book & elf are made reminds me of nostalgic day passed . He is fun but a lot of work . I so wish I came up with this idea ! !
4 #### This is a hardbound story book that explains how Santa relies on The Elf on the Shelf as a type of scout . Once your Elf on the Shelf is adopted and named , it is granted its magical powers and truly becomes part of your family as it travels back and forth to the North Pole , telling Santa about the day 's activities . When The Elf on the Shelf returns from the North Pole each morning , it finds a new place to sit and spend the day . Kids will love waking up each morning during the holiday season to see where The Elf on the Shelf is ! There are only two rules : The Elf on the Shelf must never be touched ; and The Elf on the Shelf will not move or speak when anyone is watching it -- its job is to watch and listen . This wonderful story and magical scout elf will quickly become a beloved Christmas tradition , one your family will look forward to each and every year . Reinforcing this tradition is a coloring book from The Elf on the Shelf 's animated special , An Elf 's Story . It 's filled with fun activities and even some Elf on the Shelf stickers that children will love . Elf on the Shelf is a craze , but it is fun for the entire family . From 2 to 102 , everyone enjoys this fun . Recommended . prisrob 11 - 19 - 13
2 #### I Love the idea of this but did n't like the story . We will do the elf with our own version of the story without the naughty or nice aspect . I am not comfortable telling my child that santa will not come if he is " naughty " . We will encourage striving for the " nice " behavior without threats . Is there really any parent out there who would actaully follow through with withholding presents in the case of undesirable behavior ? I really hope not so why make the threat . Think intrinsic motivation not extrinsic ...
3 #### it was sent on time , delivery was fine ... the people selling it are not to be held accountable for the next bit .... however ... it is made very errrmmm .... cheaply . It will likely not last for the lifetime of the child - which is kind of what I wanted . No shoes on the elf ( I had one as a child and he had at least FELT shoes ! ) the kid enjoys it - which is the most important part .
4 #### The elf is n't as cute as the slightly larger stuffed version but I like that this is a complete box set with the elf and the book -- we actually replaced the elf with the Pop ! Version of elf on a shelf
5 #### Great new holiday tradition ! ! And I love the added bonus of getting my kids to behave due to the extra set of eyes in the house !
5 #### I ca n't wait for Thanksgiving to pass so I can introduce our family to our Elf ! I have two sons aged six and two and I really hope they will enjoy this family tradition . The enclosed book is great and will get us all in the Spirit of the Season . There are some very creative people who have posted great ideas on Pinterest about what their Elves were up to , and I ca n't wait to discover what our Elf will be caught doing !
5 #### Cute as a button , great book to read to the kids .... everything all neat and tidy in a very sturdy box .... love it ! !
5 #### This is so much fun for the kids around the holidays . Our kids have named our Chippy and they look forward to finding him each and every morning . We love it !
5 #### My kids LOVE elf on the shelf ! They have been talking about it a summer and ca n't wait for Christmas to get here so Frankie can come back out ! It 's been a great reminder to make sure they are doing the right things .
5 #### I am so looking forward to doing this with my son ! Last year in school they had an elf on the Shelf for the classroom . I love the rules my son seriously explained to me after class one day . I plan on giving it to my son for his birthday , even if it is a couple months early I hope he enjoys it .
5 #### Love it ! My granddaughter has so much fun with her Elf on the Shelf at her house , that I decided to get one for my house - when she comes to visit , we are going to have so much fun . This is so cute & fun , fun , fun ! !
5 #### Not only is this the only thing that my son wanted for his June birthday it arrived early and he is calling it his best gift . Thank you for the great packaging in perfect condition and the early arrival .
5 #### My oldest loves this tradition . I do wish the elf was made a little better and had feet or some kind of shoes as I have to hide the feet as the little guy does n't really have any . My oldest noticed this at 3 years old , and had to tell her they did n't need feet when they fly most of the time ! I 'm looking forward to my youngest getting old enough to start enjoying this family tradition also ! No Worries !
5 #### We started this tradition this past Christmas . He showed up when the tree did . My husband declared it the creepiest thing he 'd ever seen but my girls , 4 and 2 LOVED looking for him every morning . It would be nice if he had some metal bendable wires to help him hold onto things . He s top heavy too . Many mornings I had to readjust him because he had fallen over .
5 #### I 'll admit , I like it , we have a 4 and 6 year old and they ate it up . It made Christmas really fun this year . Some drawbacks : 1 ) I got tired of telling them to be good because the elf would tell Santa ( do not let this replace real parenting ) . 2 ) If you are a Christian like I am , you will need to bring the real message of Christmas into this story or it will overshadow it . 3 ) Do n't forget to move the thing every night ! Sheesh , my kids thought the elf did n't move because they were so bad the day before , the elf could n't bear to tell Santa .
5 #### Doing this for my daughter was so much fun , in fact I do n't know who had more fun ? Me when moving the elf around or my daughter trying to find him in the morning .
5 #### this is a easy to read book , with good illustrations , a must for those " Elf on the Shelf " collectors . Would recommend for purchase .
5 #### This is for my grandson . He has not received it yet . He will get next year . My daughter , who is a teacher , will love reading the book to him .
5 #### What an excitement for the children to wake up and look for the elf daily . What a wonderful tradition to add to our christmas history for our little ones to bring with them throughout their childhood to adult life .
5 #### I purchased 5 of these for my family . They loved reading the story to their kids and enjoying the memories of the elf
5 #### I ordered this for our grandchildren in Kentucky and when it arrived they were so excited and it seemed to make the point got across to them that they had to be good until Christmas .
5 #### What a great idea .... we love this Elf and named him Max . Max stays at our house and we bought a female Elf ( Ella ) to stay at my graddaughter 's house . My granddaughter is 3 and all parents know the term ' terrible threes ' ! Everytime my granddaughter acts up we point to Max and she quickly makes an attitude adjustment . We change his location everytime she leaves my house and upon her return she will go looking to see where he is sitting . I just wish there was a toy like this for all holidays ! ! !
5 #### They were excited to see where the elf moved each day and what " trouble " or funny thing they did while they were sleeping . Fun tradition will do every year .
5 #### Love this tradition the whole family had lots of fun looking for our elf " Buddy " and seeing what he had gotten into the night before . THe storybook was really great at explaining to the kids what was the purpose of our elf .
5 #### I bought this for my grandchildren and they really enjoyed finding the elf each day and seeing what it was up too . My three year old granddaughter would call me and let me know . I think it is a cute idea .
5 #### It came in such a cute little set with the book and elf . My kids were excited that he came from the North Pole and it just added so much adventure to the Christmas season . They are looking forward to him " coming back again " next year !
5 #### Nice story ! The kids really look forward to the elf coming and staying with them till Christmas Eve . The kids enjoy looking for him each day and I love reminding him that he is watching . The kids are a little skeptical about Christmas , I hope I get another year of the magic .
5 #### Lots of fun and there are many videos and suggestions for places for the Elf to hide each night on Pinterest . Years past , this had been hard to find so felt fortunate to find it on Amazon . It did take quite awhile before delivery but finally made it in time to use for several days before The Elf was packed away until next year .
5 #### My husband made fun of me when I told him about this and that I purchased it . When it came , he read it and got all excited to prank the kids at night . We had fun coming up with things together .
5 #### A Christmas classic ! A wonderful story to get your child into the fantasy world of the legend of Santa Claus & the North Pole . Keeps the child 's imagination when the Elf is in a different place each morning .
5 #### We 've really enjoyed our elf " Ok " over the past two years . My girls wake up each morning for a month before Christmas wondering where Ok is . Sometimes I forget and have to create a diversion before they see me move him - hahaha . It makes the holidays all the more special . There is a tv special that tells a story about the elves , that helped them understand what was going on .
5 #### 2012 was the first year for my husband and I to introduce " Gumdrop " to our girls . My soon - to - be 4 year old keeps asking when Gumdrop is coming back to visit . This was an awesome little Christmas tradition I 'm so thrilled to be starting with my 3 girls . In the book there is a spot to write when you adopted your Elf and their name !
5 #### A VERY SPECIAL GIFT ! MY GRANDSON & THE WHOLE FAMILY ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT ! WORTH EVERY PENNY ! ! ! THIS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE A FAMILY TRADITION FOR YEARS TO COME !
4 #### I sent this to my garndchildren , ages 5 - 7 and they loved it and their mother had fun with it all ! A new FUN tradition for Christmas !
5 #### This is the first year we did this . My child loved the book that came with it and it is packaged nicely . It came as described and we look forward to next year . A new tradition in our house !
4 #### My 11 yo nephew was wide - eyed as he dramatically told me how it was " proven " that the elf moved , etc . After that , I could n't not buy it for him for Christmas . He was so excited when he opened it ! I read through the book ( which I thought was pretty goofy , but if the kids like it , then who am I to judge ? ) and it at least explained the whole concept . I know many people think that this elf idea is creepy , but I have seen so many who have had fun with it , too . It seemed to be well made , and the boxed - set made it a wonderful presentation for gift - giving .
5 #### We started this just after Thanksgiving and continued until Christmas Eve . My children are 3 and 5 and they loved searching for our elf every morning to see what silly position he would have gotten himself into . Very fun and the book is cute too .
4 #### I thought this was a little expensive for what you get , but my son loved finding the elf all over the house so much that I feel it was worth the expense .
5 #### Adorable little elf ! My children really enjoyed him , and the book that came with him . They actually wanted to go to bed at night so they could go search for " Rusty " in the morning . They were very sad to see him go back to Santa when Christmas was over . Very fun little Christmas game to play with your children , and a wonderful tradition to pass down to their children .
5 #### I received my package right away in great shape . The book is adorable and loved by my son . He is only 3 , so this was the first time we used our " elf . " He got into it right away , and I know next year will be even better . My husband even emjoyed finding new spot for our little visitor .
5 #### My kids LOVED their elf this year . It was our first yeat to have JACK in our home and he made quite an impression on the kids . For a cheap Doll , the kids did great with him . our biggest issue was remembering to move him nightly .
5 #### Loved It . My grandson would jump up each morning to see where his elf had landed after reporting to Santa .
5 #### We have enjoyed making this a tradition in our family for the past three years , I am going to be bummed out when my son gets old enough to know Santa is n't real .
5 #### We did this tradition for 2 years in a row now and it has become one of my kids most favorite things to look forward too .
5 #### We bought this as a Christmas gift for our niece and her family . Her children just loved it ! GREAT BUY !
5 #### I had never heard anything about this tradition until this year . My kids are 1.5 , 3 and 5 and they love their elf Dexter . I highly recommend purchasing the Elf on the Shelf DVD or Blu ray with this because the DVD went into depth about how the elves get shipped to the house and why they are there . For younger kids , it helps them understand the whole thing way more so it is not creppy to them . The elf doll is so cute and the box it comes in is awesome looking . The book has its own slot inside the box . It is absolutely the funnest tradition . My husband and I had a blast moving the elf to different places each night and having him do different activities . I do not however do the naughty elf things like other people do ... I do n't think it 's a good message to send your kids . We did fun things like have the elf play Connect Four with our nut cracker man ... eat a candy cane from the tree ... have him decorating the tree . The look on there faces every morning when they went to look for Dexter was just priceless . I can not wait until next year now .
3 #### The book is good quality but the elf is cheap and it is difficult to get it to stay up on the shelf
5 #### This is a great story and so much fun ! It definitely keeps the spirit of Christmas alive ! It is as much fun for the adults as the kids !
5 #### Made every day exciting for my three year old Granddaughter . She ca n't wait for the Elf to come back next year
5 #### I bought this for my son this year . It is so much fun ! The book is the perfect way to introduce the elf to the kids and the elf is so cute ! I 've had a lot of fun moving the elf each night to a new location and my son ca n't wait to see what he 's up to when he wakes up in the morning . I would recommend this to any parent looking for a fun family tradition .
5 #### I bought this because a few friends were doing it and thought it would be a cute idea . Our kids are 2 - 1/2 and 6 - 1/2 and just love our elf . Looking for " Zachie " ( named by our son ) is the first thing they did every morning when they got up . Really lovely tradition that I look forward to doing again next year . Very nice boxed set ; nice hardcover book and a cute , heart warming story . Adorable elf :)
5 #### My kids love their elf " Chippey " . Every morning from after thsnkgiving to Christmas eve they wake up and the first thing they do is run to try and find where he is hiding . I think it is a nice , fun family tradition .
1 #### I thought the doll would talk or something . But it does n't even sit up by itself . It 's a rip . my 3 year old son said " it does what ? ? " Like yeah right ...
5 #### I 've never seen one little doll work such magic , LOL ! I kept one of these in my classroom and here at my house and the behavior in both places improved ten fold ! Love it !
5 #### we bought this for our grandkids , and she showed up at their house one day , they loved her and looked forward to finding her every morning , this is a great tradition to start in every family with children ! !
5 #### We gave this to my daughter for her kids to enjoy the month of December . What " good " little grandkids I have ! This was not only fun for the kids but the parents certainly got their fun from Elf tool . Elf was certainly creative when he appeared each morning back from the North Pole after his nightly visit to Santa . I wish we would have thought of this for our kids when they were small . My son and his family have done this for a couple of years and the kids run out each morning in December to see where Elf is hiding . What a great Christmas tradition for families !
4 #### This product is only a vessel for your own creativity and ambitions as a parent . It is a cute story in a nicely made book with a $ 2 elf doll . I would have hoped that the elf would have been a higher quality , but as it is , it does hold up and looks pretty good . It can be a chore coming up with new places to put him night after night , but the kids are excited every morning to find him and have enjoyed the experience all around . It was a good buy .
4 #### My family had a lot of fun with the elf on the shelf . It was more about the fun of it than " the elf is watching you " . My son loved to wake up and find Chippie in the morning !
5 #### This was our first year with an elf . Our almost 3 year old loved it ! We had to explain a few things ( and a few times ) , but she picked up the concept and each morning when she woke up she went looking for our elf ! She liked how he was in a different spot each morning . I was a little worried about her touching the elf and wanting to play with him , so at first the elf was high and out of reach . As the days went on though and we quizzed her about the elf , she knew not to touch him and would get very upset if I went anywhere near him because she did n't want the elf to lose his magic ! So , I 'd say our elf is a success and a lot of fun to have around at Christmas . Our little girl is already thinking ahead to next year when the elf comes back !
5 #### This just made our Christmas . I have a day care center and my kids loved this elf . We had heard of it , but was unable to find it in our area , so we ordered it . It came very quickly . We used it everyday for Christmas ........ believe me ..... it works ! ! ! ! The story is kid friendly and the pictures are very bright and colorful . It also comes in a case that keeps the elf and book safe all year .
5 #### Gave this as a gift to my niece and nephew at Thanksgiving , and they have LOVED it ! My nephew cried on Christmas eve because he would n't see Foodle again for nearly a year ! Their mom had to promise that he could drop in occasionally throughout the year to see how they were behaving . :)
5 #### Got this for six year old boy , he LOVES it . The elfs name is Bluki ( we figured that out as a family , was a bit complicated but fun ) . It 's a bit of a chore moving him every night , just because sometimes we forget and have to scramble in the AM or come up with a reason why Bluki is in the same place ( he liked that spot , I guess ) . At 30 bucks it seems pretty expensive , but at least it 's going to be used for a couple more years and probably passed on to someone else by that time since it will stay in good shape . We place Bluki up high in different places around the house so our son ca n't get to him . He knows he 's not supposed to touch him so he does n't even ask or try . Bluki is now back in his box waiting till next year ... I mean , he 's back at the North Pole with Santa . There is n't much to the elf , but he 's very light and flexible which makes him easy to place in odd spots . It 's all just very cute and Christmasy and the little ones love it so I highly recommend .
3 #### The elf on a shelf idea is great but all u need is any elf and the idea . The book is nothing special nor is the elf . But the concept is brilliant and fun .
4 #### they are pretty much priced the same everywhere .. I think the manufacturer should make the elf a little better quality for the price . I have an orginal elf from the late 50's .. much better quality I was happy to get it quickly .
5 #### I bought this to have while my grandchildren were here . They arrived several days before Christmas . They chose to name him Scottie , after Poppy who 's middle name is Scott . Every morning he would show up in a new place ;-) As soon as they woke up they would begin their search for Scottie . Since he loses his magic if he 's touched , I would place him out of reach to remove the temptation to test that theory , lol . We all had so much fun with Scottie that I am looking forward to his return from the North Pole next year . Your Elf will come with a book to read to the children which explains his presence and purpose .
5 #### We love our elf , Twinkle Toes . My three year old grandson has enjoyed finding him every morning . It 's helped him understand that Santa is always watching .
5 #### We have enjoyed the adventures of our elf " jasper"however my grandson was not very happy at all about an elf watching his every move . Introducing him even with the storybook was a little upsetting to my grandson who can be a little naughty sometimes . But the search for Jasper each morning has made the nowt elf fun . Not sure how it will all end tomorrow . Night when Jasper goes back to the north Pole but reading the book may help .
5 #### Your child will enjoy the elf in the shelf if he works hard each day for Santa . Our Hershey is always watching the kids and reporting to Santa . Sometimes he gets into some mischief , while other times he may have a special surprise for them .
5 #### This has become a Christmas tradition in our house . Our kids ( age 3 and 2 ) race to find Bernie- our elf on the shelf- every morning . It 's fun for me and hubby too because we love to get creative at night hiding / positioning our elf all over the house . If you do n't celebrate Santa then it probably wo n't have the same excitement / meaning for you . YOu could try hiding something else- a baby Jesus or Menorah but really the kids love finding the elf because they think he is going to tell Santa what they want for Christmas . Of course , most kids love hide and seek so would find this fun even if they do n't believe in Santa . We love it .
5 #### I ordered this for my 3 year old son . I heard about it from coworkers . The Elf is very cute , not scarey looking at all as another reviewer stated . He is sweet and innocent looking . My Son Loves it ! We named him on the Website and he looks for him every morning as soon as he wakes up . I love the ' No Touching ' rule . I let my son give him a kiss on the cheek . With that in place , he should last us quite a while . I recommend this to anyone who has little ones and would like to start a new tradition for the kids . It is fun and a good idea .
1 #### The story is cute , well written and has great graphics . The Elf though is poorly made . I can not see this guy lasting more than a couple of years . His hat is already falling apart . The whole thing seems poorly constructed and not worth $ 30 . I would buy the book without the elf and then find an elf somewhere else . Probably save half the money !
5 #### So the Elf is a cheap doll ... That does not make it any less magical ! My children love our newest addition . They named him " Macks " and wake up early every morning to find out what kind of mischief he gets into overnight . We really do not do the " be good or he will tell Santa " . We really kind of find that pointless since we are not going to not give them Christmas presents , and good behavior is expected regardless of an elf watching . So we just kind of play along like he is just a visitor for Christmas and tells Santa what they want and all the GOOD things they do . We love it .
4 #### This is a cute little felt scout elf who is found on various shelves in your home each morning . He supposedly reports to Santa about the children 's behavior . Nice hardcover story book & an online registration .
4 #### This is a gift for our great grandson . I am sure the family will love it . They have other children and I am sure that they will it for the whole family .
5 #### My children are in love with our elf Jerry . great product lots of fun . they love waking up to find him everymorning .
5 #### I did n't want to get this because I thought the elf would creep me out , but oh this turned out to be sooo much fun for my daughter ( 6 ) and her grandma ( she has one too ) and I. The book is great and explains the purpose . So many fun ideas on printerist on what to do with him . I wish I woulda had a video camera when my daughter saw " bob " chilling on the ceiling fan ( he moves around like that when no one 's looking ! ) So much fun for all !
5 #### Arrived quickly , very well packaged . Got this for my grandson 's first Christmas . He is n't old enuff to understand just yet , but it has given joy to the rest of the family . I can see this little elf will be cherished for many years to come , lol . Thanks !
5 #### We love the Elf on the Shelf . My grandson is only two so we keep the complexity of the elfs ( Lil Santa ) antics to a minimum . Mostly it 's moving from one location to another , hiding in the tree , etc . He 's had a grand time finding his elf . As always Amazon provided great service .
3 #### Love this Christmas tradition .. great book .. w/ elf . Very expensive , but everyone has to have one ... and so did my granddaughter .
5 #### OK . Here 's the deal . We 're grandparents . We have no earthly idea where we put the elf from last year . We knew we 'd better hide him well because it would be no good at all for him to show up , say , in July . But like so many other things in our house , we do n't remember where we put him . Wish they would sell replacement elves . Or elves with a remote so we could find him . Whether we find the guy or replace him , I WILL make a note on next year 's calendar telling myself his location . And if we replace him , I need to come up with a reason why there are two elves in our house , just in case elf # 1 shows up . Aside from that , we love the whole elf thing .
5 #### I bought this for my 7 year old and he thinks its so funny . I still need to find some funny ways to put him in the house . I bought the Elf on The Shelf DVD and will act like the elf brought it to him . He loves it and so do me and my husband . My 14 year old even likes it .
5 #### Terrific book and packaging . My 4 yr old was a bit afraid of it at first and the 5 yr was pretty quick to make a guess that he 's not real and that Mommy and Daddy probably move him around . They are having fun with it and look for " Martin " ( the name they gave him ) every morning ! Nice tradition even if one of them has figured it out !
5 #### I was a little hesitant to purchase at first . I never had one of these as a child and was n't sure I really needed it for mine . I decided to purchase and try it out . So far I think i 've had more fun than my kids with this LOL . They both look for " Snowy " their elf every morning and are eager to see what he 's been up to . I 've had fun coming up with ideas on what to do next . This will now be a tradition in our family .
5 #### We are having fun with this new tradition . The elf is more fun than the book , you could probably just buy the elf alone and just tell your kids the story , but it is nice to have the book as well .
4 #### The elf on the shelf is a super cute idea but be aware it does take work ! My 8 year old and 4 year old understand the story and are very excited every morning to see where the elf ends up . My older daughter has asked those questions you would expect . The only thing I do n't like is for the kids on the fence ( believe or not believe ) I think that this could give some more doubt . Probably better for ages 3 - 6 years . I do wish I would have got it when they were younger .
5 #### I had never heard of the Elf on the Shelf before my wife mentioned it last week . We have a 3 year old son , so this is the first year he really ' gets ' the whole Santa Claus thing . At first he did n't want anything to do with it , but after a few hours , he was really into it . We read the story ( many times that first day ) , and had a blast coming up with a name for the Elf . The story goes that each night when the child goes to bed , the Elf flies to the North Pole to tell Santa if you 've been good or bad . As I said , our son is 3 , and he can be rather ' busy ' , and if he is n't making good choices , we 'll say ' What do you think Macaroni ( that s what he decided to name his Elf ) would tell Santa about that ? ' an it really works . LOL . It is a lot of fun . I really recommend this product .
5 #### We introduced our elf on Thanksgiving day . My husband and I are having a blast finding new hiding places and activities for our elf nightly . Son adores it and ca n't wait to see where he will end up each morning .
5 #### She named ours ' Nelf ' the Elf . I know , not too crazy , but hey , she 's two . But it 's so much fun to read the book to her and then move Nelf all over the house everyday and have him get into some mischief . Sometimes I forget about him when my wife hides him until my daughter comes running in to tell me she found him . It 's a lot of fun for everyone . The book is well written and it 's going to be a great tradition for years . If you love your kids , get the Elf on the Shelf . But just do n't name him Nelf . That s already taken .
5 #### This elf on a shelf has got my son doing remarkable things . He is being relly nice to his sister and he is helping out when he never would . He asks everyday if Norby ( the name of the elf ) is going to tell Santa he was good today . We always tell when he was good and Norby will probably give Santa a good report .
5 #### I purchased 3 of these for Christmas 2011 . Our family celebrates the week before Christmas so the elves began their duties for a short time that year . Well as Christmas 2012 approaches , the elves have made their way back from the North Pole , the kids were very excited when they made their first elf sighting . So now the elves have once again taken up their work of reporting to Santa ! What fun for all !
5 #### I am so excited to start a new Xmas tradition for my family ! Ca n't wait for my kids to experience the Elf 's magic .
4 #### I love this idea and my 3 - year old daughter loves it as well . My biggest complaint would be that the elf seems to be very cheaply made . It is hard to get it to sit securely without propping it on something . For $ 30 it seems there could be some weight in the elf 's bottom or some other aid to help it sit .
5 #### There are people who like the elf and those who do not , kind of like Christmas . This year the elf handlers in my family started preparing for the extra effort and the joy of the Elf on the Shelf . I found that my son does not really remember what he got for Christmas but he remembers the elf fishing for goldfish crackers and playing with toilet paper . After a few nights hiding on various shelves , Mom got bored and the crazy ideas circulating on the internet had her launching the elf into flour , setting up a marshmallow snow fort and various other shenanigans . I posted my crazy photos on Facebook and before I knew it the elf had a following . My son loved Chip the elf dearly and loved his crazy ideas but a few older adults with no kids who saw my posts said they really enjoyed waking up each morning to see a new surprise , including a friend who was going through major cancer treatments . You can make the tradition what you want and you can make your elf the creepy daunting vision you envisioned or you can have it turn the milk green , blame it for the pizza box you left in the living room and share it via e - mail with those afar to include them in your celebrations . Kids are little for just a short time , and this is a great way to extend the Christmas joy .
5 #### I ordered 3 , one for my daughters ' homes and one for our 's . So happy we can choose our own names for the Elf . Ca n't wait to begin this tradition . My oldest daughter has Charlie , and all the other cousins were jealous that her family had an elf in the house .
1 #### My 4 year old who is not easily scared was just creeped out by the concept and literally told me that the elf looked " creepy " . He would n't have anything to do with it after that so for us it was useless . I agree the doll is kinda creepy just chilling around your house and " leaving in the night to report to santa " .
3 #### I bought this last Christmas for my then 5 year old daughter . She did enjoy the story but did n't buy into the doll watching over her behavior . I do agree the story is a little odd but it 's all in fun . I have another little one otw so guess we 'll see how she 'll take it the story and doll . Every kid is different . So funny though that some are seriously afraid of the elf doll . LOL ! But yeah , I do find that this product is overpriced . If I paid a little less then I 'd be more satisfied I think .
5 #### Bought this for my newborn Grandson . His father was told a similar story when he was a young child . I should have written a children 's book 35 years ago ! Same Elf ! Back then , there was no book , I made up a legend so my kids would go to bed and behave around Christmas time ! Who knew ? Oh well , my grandson will be thrilled when he is old enough to appreciate this .
4 #### My grandchildren love this story and looked to see where the would appear every morning . It is sure to be a Christmas tradition for them .
5 #### The Elf on the Shelf worked miracles with our granddaughter who was sure that the Elf was watching over her and reporting to Santa . She is 8 and still a believer . But to our grandson who is four , he just did n't warm to the idea of a miniature elf reporting back to Santa about his behavoir ! The book is lovely and both grandchildren loved it . It was also fun for our daughter and son - in - law to find a new place to put the Elf each night ! I would recommend this elf and book to anyone who has children or grandchildren who still believe in Santa . It may not make every child a lot better behaved but it is a lot of fun for them to try to find the Elf and wonder how it got to its new location each day . This is also an item that can be handed down from generation to generation which is another reason why we wanted to purchase it . By telling the children not to handle the Elf or it will lose its powers is a good way to keep the Elf in great condition . The set arrived very quickly after ordering which was a big plus as we ordered it in December .
5 #### Great and cute story and my kids actually behaved very well . They woke up every morning and asked to look for their elf . I think this works great for kids 3 and over .
5 #### This little elf is magic ! After the children have named him their behavior improves as you remind him / her that the elf is watching . Each morning the elf mysteriously changes position and it is great fun finding him and checking what he is up to . He hangs from the Christmas tree , dangles from the chandelier , and sometimes has tea with a Teddy Bear or on occasion Barbie . He can be dressed and redressed and loves to eat chocolate kisses which he forgets to clean up and leaves wrappers around and perhaps a smudge of chocolate left on his face . The genius is that the elf ca n't be touched by human hands . The children take this quite seriously . He flies to the North Pole to report to Santa which is a great encourager of good behavior . This worked on a charm on my less than perfect granddaughter ( whom I love dearly ) . I have n't heard one parent complain about this wonderful elf .
5 #### We started Elf on a Shelf last year and are really enjoying the tradition . My son is now 2 and a half and loves to find " Simon " every morning . The book that comes along with it is a great tool to help teach children about Santa Claus and the fun traditions of Christmas . This is something that we will use for many years .
5 #### We purchased our " Elf " after everyone was talking about it at preschool . Within hours we saw a huge improvement in the kids ' behavior ( We have a 4,3 and 1 year old ) It was n't long after having our little guy that the kids will look up anytime they think they are in trouble . My 4 year old goes out of her way to make the elf happy . When the kids are fighting they tell the elf what is going on . It really works ! ! The best part is how excited they are to find him in a new spot every morning . We read the book at least once every other day and have recently started watching the movie on the days we do n't read the book . My daughter is already worried about him leaving on Christmas Eve . I think it 's a great idea and it really works with our kids .
5 #### I love the simplicity of this game system . I 'm also quite happy with the quality of the binding ( unlike some , like White Wolf who sell you expensive systems with many many books that are bound so poorly that they have been known to fall apart the very first time they are opened ... WWtA was infamous for this ) So thank you Evil Hat !
5 #### This is a supplement that can very well be considered the Dresden Files Encyclopedia ( although much has changed in the dresden verse at the time of its writing ) and it offers great templates for making your own characters and enemies by providing examples of the foes and allies Harry and Co. have encountered over his adventures in the Windy City .
5 #### The Dresden files is an enjoyable setting for me . I enjoy the dark modern day fantasy setting , Dresden is an interesting character , with weaknesses and strengths , and his allies and adversaries are both varied , interesting , and rarely two - dimensional . So creating an RPG setting is very fitting . I 've only done a few run - throughs of character creation , and one real session . This system works off of the Fate system , ( fudge dice , etc ) , and has a very interesting method in which people can interact with the storyline and surroundings , to make the GM 's life a little bit easier . Both this , and the partner book ( Vol 1 : Your story ) are worth getting . This volume is meant for the the GM , and the first volume is more meant for Players and GMs alike . If you enjoy the Dresden files , and a system that has numbers , but also allows for a good solid sense of roleplaying ( and not just roll playing ) , with a good story element , this will likely be a good system for you . I have n't played enough to notice balance issues at this time .
5 #### Dresden Files RPG : Volume 2 - Our World : Volume 2 ; put together like the old white wolf games . If you are a gamer and love Dresden this is a must for your personal library
5 #### Was recommended by many co - woker , s and this product is great . grand kids are all excited and watch for the elf each morning to see where he has moved . It is both the book and the elf included .
5 #### Purchased this around Thanksgiving last year and my son ( age 4 ) LOVED ' elf ' - as he so creatively named it LOL even now , in march , he s still talking about ' Elf ' there were several times elf forgot to move , and we decided tht sometimes he liked a spot so much he stayed there a couple of days ! LOL i loved finding different ways to hide him - he hung upside down from our kitchen chandelier ... hid in xmas tree branches ... on top of the curtain rod ... even on top of the ceiling fan ! My son loved coming out to find him each morning !
5 #### What a great idea this is to keep little kids behaving before Santa arrives , it works for my two grandkids who know that the elf reports back to santa if they are bad . They make it a game to find him in the morning in his new spot . This is an excellent purchase and am so happy with it .
5 #### A friend at work told me about ' Elf on the Shelf ' and I figured I would give it a try . Had to read the book a number of times to my three year old as he immediately could not understand why he could not touch him but he finally understood and the weeks before Christmas were fun as the Elf magically appeared in different places in the house . And when we traveled he would appear as well . Great idea and keeps your child off the naughty list .
5 #### Received this as a Christmas gift when our son was born . It is a great family tradition . The elf and the book are fun to share with our year old . He enjoys looking for the elf each day when he is placed around the house . The elf is not very sturdy , but it is not meant to be played with .
2 #### Not to be a scrooge , because the kids do have fun getting look for the Elf every morning . But as a parent , I have to warn other parents . Think of how much magic has to be conjured for this Elf to move every single night ! Poor , hard - working Elf . It 's a delicate house of cards to have Santa 's magic tied with this guy . Resist !
5 #### The Elf on the Shelf is a HUGE hit with my granddaughters ! We read the story and put the elf on the bookcase where he could watch everyone . The next morning , he had been to visit Santa and had returned - now perching on top of the draperies . I know we 'll be checking for him every morning until Christmas and we 'll all be very good , knowing he 's reporting to Santa every night . This is a delightful gift for young believers .
5 #### We use the elf a little different than the book . Our elf arrives the night of thanksgiving while our daughter is asleep . He shows up with a small toy , dollar store or something very small , and then leaves every night to visit Santa and tell him how the day went . When he comes back the next day he drops of a small toy and shows up in a different place . We find this calms down the excitement from the time between Thanksgiving and Christmas , Christmas Eve 's gift is always Christmas PJ 's and a good bye note . Yes she does get a gift every night but it something simple as a new pencil for school to even just a note of encouragement for something that may have happened that day .
5 #### I think the idea behind the Elf is wonderful . My daughter is 18 months and when she wakes up I say " Where is your elf ? " and she goes looking and points to it . The book says you ca n't touch them because they will lose their magic . My daughter has n't wanted to hold it or anything , because she never has . I think the plush version will confuse kids if you have both , being able to hold one and not the other . I do n't tell her the elf is watching her when she is bad , and I wo n't ever tell her that even when she is older . I think this is perfect as a family tradition if the parents do n't use it to control their children . The Elf itself is made from cloth and the face is plastic ( I thought it was porcelain or something and was scared of it falling ) so if a cat knocks it down overnight it 's no big deal . The book is very long , and I do n't think we 're going to include it as part our tradition . I 'm just going to tell her my own version every Christmas and hopefully that will make it a little more our own . The entire thing comes in a very nice box , and the book is hard cover and nice so I believe it is worth the money .
3 #### Bought the product(elf and book)at a Hallmark store with the same price . It 's not cheap but I thought it would be great for the kids since I 've read more positive reviews than negative . I would have rated this product 4 - 5 stars only the elf is tiny about 8 and 1/2 inch(you have to see the elf for yourself)from the tip of his hat to his feet . Could 've made him more sturdier . I think I paid for the book instead of the elf . My kids , ages 7 and 5 like the idea of finding him though . My only problem is that I have to lie everytime they ask questions . Sure it reinforces good behavior but like the one reviewer says what happens after December 26 ? I would n't recommend this as a good Christmas tradition if you ask me .
3 #### I 'm with some of the other low - star reviewers ... I do n't want an elf hanging around the house so it can go tattle to Santa every time my son misbehaves or makes a mistake . I think positive reinforcement is a much better approach to managing behavior . So I think this toy has some value IF , and only if , parents change their approach to using it . I would personally skip the book altogether and tell my son how the elf is visiting the house and ca n't wait to go tell Santa all of the good things he 's doing . And when he does those good things , tell him how happy his elf is . Leave out the negative threats . Honestly , if this elf is the only reason your child stops bad behaviors , what are you going to do when December 26th comes around ? PS - I also love one reviewer 's idea of leaving a new Christmas story with the elf each day to read together as a family . Another positive association with the elf for the kids !
5 #### Wanted a fair skin , blue eyed elf for my blonde , blue eyed grandchildren which is hard to find . This elf is perfect and very well constructed . The book that accompies it is educational and adds the sense of reality for the non - believer ! Pricing for the elf is the best I found in my 2 years of searching for it . My daughter puts it up the day after Thanksgiving and moves it every day . The children look for it first thing every morning and it adds to a positive and joyful discipline experience . They " know " they are being watched by Santa 's elf and never know where the elf will show up . It is absolutely a family tradition that maintains a child 's heart . I hope they never lose it .
5 #### My 22 month old loves looking for her elf every morning . I love that the story says they ca n't touch him ... so she never asks because she knows she 's not supposed to . It 's a cute story and idea and I look forward to doing it for years to come .
5 #### I heard a lot of my friends talking about this book and was interested . It seemed a bit high in price to me , but we used a coupon and a gift card which made it seem more reasonable . My children loved the story and got so into it . We purchased it yesterday and this morning they were so excited to come downstairs to find Elfie ( our current name , we have n't decided for sure so I am waiting to record it in the book ) . It helped a bit with some behavior and fighting issues . Although the illustrations in the book were not quite as good as I had hoped for , the fact that my children love it and are having a good time with it makes up for that . i would recommend this book to people with small children .
3 #### The idea of the elf is cute , original and lots of fun for kids . Really like the book especially the beautiful illustrations . The elf , was disappointing . Plastic face and cheaply made clothing . I opted to buy the elf stuffed animal , cuter and more appealing to children . Also disappointed at the price on Amazon . [ ... ] .
5 #### We love our Elf on the Shelf . We named our Elf , Eddie . My daughter ( she is 4 ) talks to him every time she passes him .. :-) I recommend this NEW family tradition to all parents with young children . It helps encourage good behavior because the elf is always watching to report back to Santa . My daughter even asked about Eddie this summer ( we started it last Thanksgiving ) we told her he was busy at the North Pole but checked back so she better be good never know when Eddie is hiding and watching . ( LOL ) She at times would see children out pitching fits and would say I bet their elf is going to tell Santa . WE LOVE ELF ON THE SHELF ! !
5 #### Someone told me about Elf on a Shelf earlier this year knowing how into Christmas I am ! This is a wonderful idea for parents who want to create a running dialogue with their kids about Christmas and all that goes into it . The book included with the elf tells the story of how Santa knows whether a child is naughty or nice by sending an elf to their home to report back to him each night . As a parent you can put the Elf somewhere and then your kids can play hide and seek to find him . They can also tell the Elf what they want for Christmas and how they would like Christmas to play out . It is easy to put a faith based element into your play and story as well as any other customs you may want to impart . The Elf makes the anticipation for Christmas more keen and kids enjoy playing hide and seek as well as talking to the Elf .
5 #### Elf on the shelf is fun at Christmas . I have used it for 4 yrs and my son is always careful what he does and says that may be naughty because the Elf is watching and will report back to Santa . I have given this as a gift to new moms and they love the idea of using this every Christmas .
5 #### This is a very nice tradition to start . I look forward to introducing the elf around Thanksgiving . The book is awesome and the elf is cute too .
5 #### This is the greatest ... He just appeared one day at my house . My kids noticed right away ( he was sitting high on a shelf ) . Then we found the book , and read it all . We named him " Jangels " , they were soooo into this ! Every morning they could wait to do all thier chores and then hurry to find the elf . It was great fun , and they were EXTRA GOOD becuase our Elf was watching all the time ! And on Christmas Eve before he flew back to Santa they all said goodbye to him , sooo cute ! ! We got the activity book too , this would be great for any family or classroom ! Really , really loved this , great tradition ! ! !
5 #### My husband ran across Elf on the Shelf on Amazon and decided to get it and start a new tradition for our son 's first Christmas . Although my son is only 5 months old and does n't understand the tradition yet , he still gets really excited when he sees the elf in a new location everyday . And he loves looking at the great illustrations in the book . I think this will be a wonderful tradition that we will continue for years to come .
5 #### Our book and Elf arrived in our home on Thanksgiving and my daughter eagerly read the book and watched us put Elfin on our TV . She knew from the book that each night Elfin would fly to the North Pole and report to Santa . We never scared her with that if she disobeyed he 'd cancel Christmas , but said that he was watching her . Every morning she 'd come out of her room with a huge smile on her face searching for Elfin . She is looking forward to seeing him arrive at our home this next year ! I got 2 extras for gifts for friends and family and it was a huge hit in their home too !
5 #### Our 9 nine year is a sucker for her magic elf - it has been so much fun . Very nice , sturdy box with cute posable felt elf with plastic face and beautiful book that tells the story of how the elf can become a part of your holiday fun .
5 #### The Dresden files is an enjoyable setting for me . I enjoy the dark modern day fantasy setting , Dresden is an interesting character , with weaknesses and strengths , and his allies and adversaries are both varied , interesting , and rarely two - dimensional . So creating an RPG setting is very fitting . I 've only done a few run - throughs of character creation , and one real session . This system works off of the Fate system , ( fudge dice , etc ) , and has a very interesting method in which people can interact with the storyline and surroundings , to make the GM 's life a little bit easier . Both this , and the partner book ( Vol 2 : Our World ) are worth getting . This volume is meant for the Players ( and GM ) , and the second volume is more meant for whomever is going to run your game . If you enjoy the Dresden files , and a system that has numbers , but also allows for a good solid sense of roleplaying ( and not just roll playing ) , with a good story element , this will likely be a good system for you . I have n't played enough to notice balance issues at this time .
4 #### I 've been playing RPGs for years , but this is the first time I 've gotten an RPG rulebook as an ebook . I have the physical book as well , but the ebook makes it incredibly easy to look stuff up . You lose the pretty formatting , but gain easy reference -- totally worth it as an add - on to the physical book .
5 #### Dresden Files RPG Volume One : Your Story : Volume 1 ; built like the old white wolf series ; great if you are a gamer and love the Dresden files . worthy of my personal library
5 #### I love the simplicity and the adaptability of this system . the note that were " left " in the margins are both funny and helpful too .
5 #### This book contains the rules for a FATE RPG variation based in the world of the Dresden Files novel series . I have read the books , and this rulebook in particular , and they are all an excellent and interesting read . Your Story takes things a step further by allowing you ( and your friends ) to step into the world of the Dresden Files and play your way through your own story . The book itself is well - written , with hilarious annotations and notes on almost every page . The illustrations are similarly gorgeous . In short , LOVED IT .
4 #### This expansion , amidst all the other Last Night on Earth expansions , is a bit of a gamechanger . The contents of the box may pale in comparison with the contents of Growing Hunger , but do n't be fooled . This expansion introduces new cards for both heroes and zombies as well as several new sets of rules ( including barricades and sewers ) . On top of that , it does include new scenarios , which is always a plus . All of this new stuff may complicate the game a little , but it also can help to keep things fresh . It allows both zombie and human players to try different strategies and approaches . Absolutely worth considering if you 're a fan of Last Night on Earth .
5 #### My students are beginning the play , Romeo and Juliet . I often take snippets of language and provide the kids with access to the OED , annotated versions of the complete works of Shakespeare , and various other dictionaries and references , and challenge them to figure out what the quotes mean . However , packaging is important if you want to persuade teens . The playing cards seemed to add a more fun element , and persuade the students to look at the challenge as a game . It also helped me to differentiate the instruction invisibly by distributing cards of varying complexity to different students . One note for any other teacher who might try this strategy : A little less than half of the cards are inappropriate for this purpose . Be sure you know what the students will find when they open the text .
5 #### This cards are funny and well made . They feel nice to hold and are a good size . The saying are interesting to read and there are small pictures as well .
5 #### I bought this for my sister who is an English teacher . She absolutely loves these cards !
5 #### This is a fun set of playing cards with Shakespeare 's insults written on them . The cards work well for playing but can add to the fun by reading the insults out loud . I gave them as stocking stuffers as well as keeping a set for my family . Lots of fun and a tad educational , too !
5 #### I seem to be collecting cards and this is one of my favorite sets . Some is over my head , some are over everyone 's head ; but , most are hilarious and an added bit of entertainment when playing cards w / friends . Durable too .
3 #### If I 'm being honest , I must mention that although this game specifies ' thirteen and older ' as its primary audience , the reality is that twelve and under kids are most likely going to enjoy this game . It 's a party game that families can play , but accomplishing the tasks on the cards is more like kid - oriented fun . Gathering beads in order to win is the object , but unlike the real Mardi Gras there is no " adults only " behavior involved . I rated the durability high , but again this is a game that should appeal to younger kids - who are prone to losing things like the strings of beads or the cards . The game comes in kind of a cool clear , soft vinyl case . I liked the " mind control " category the best , which entails a little more subtle strategy that getting someone to refuse to pick your trash or finding someone who likes vampires more than werewolves . This is a game I ca n't imagine bringing out very often and its kind of expensive for what it is .
3 #### I 'd say this game is best if you 're entertaining a large crowd . It really would n't work for small groups . The minimum possible would be four players . While some of the cards are really entertaining and can lead to funny situations , they do become redundant after a while . I would n't guess this one is destined to become a classic . I played it once and that was plenty . Ages 13 and up .
5 #### We loved this game . We played it at a summer gathering with lots of people who did not know each other . This game really got the party going- and provided a fun and relaxed way of getting people talking , laughing and mingling . The instructions were easy and game play simple . We played at the beginning of the party , and it helped the 25 people who attended get into the party spirit .
4 #### I really get a kick out of Mardi Gras and while this game does not come close to the experience of New Orleans , it was fun to mix it up playing this game while making some tried and true Mardi Gras drinks with friends at a party . Hurricanes and Mud Slides were tied in with this game and fun was had by all couples in attendance . This is an inexpensive way to give a jolt to your Mardi Gras celebration ! Fun !
3 #### I initially got this game out at a family get together thinking that it was some sort of board game , it 's not . But that does n't mean that it is n't fun . It just takes a little planning ahead to make sure you get it out at the right time . The next time we had a big group over I got the game out ahead of time and knew how to prepare for the get together . I would definitely recommend this game for larger groups since the reserved dynamics of small groups can really impede the fun of the game . We had a fun time stealing beads from each other for all sorts of silly reasons . We also learned a lot about each other and I would recommend this game as a fun ice breaker for parties where people do n't know each other very well . In the right situation , this can be a very fun game , just make sure you break it out at the right time !
2 #### I was super excited to open up my Party Gras game at my party . I thought it would be a lot of fun but it was a little too simple to keep people interested . The entire premise of the game is you all start off with the same amount of beads and you pick a task from a limited amount of cards to try to get other people to do . If they do the task then you get their beads . There are not a lot of cards so if you want repetitive play it wo n't last long because you will have the advantage over everyone else because you will know all of the cards . Many of the tasks are really simple and does not keep your attention so it gets boring really quickly . Also you must have 4 players to play this game so if you have a small family and just want to play it will not work . This game is fun for a little but I think it is more suited to be an icebreaker game for people who want to get to know each other .
3 #### This game is a little different ! My family was excited to see it on Christmas Day and wanted to play right away . We discovered that this is a game that is best played with a larger crowd , especially if people do n't know each other well or are meeting for the first time . Because some of the tasks in the game require that people be open to approaching strangers , and also open to doing / saying some pretty random things , it 's not a game for the shy - AT ALL . We thought that it was fun , but would be much more fun in a true party circumstance . I have to say , though , that there are definitely adults who would refuse to do some of the actions printed on some of the cards because of the silliness factor of the actions . Definitely know your crowd before using this game , or it will very possibly be a flop . Another thing that concerns me is that someone could throw the game by just refusing to do whatever they could perceive as someone else 's attempt to steal their beads - I mean , what competitive person is NOT going to be sensitive to others being competitive , suspicious that someone is just trying to steal their beads ? For that reason , this game might be an anti - ice - breaker . So , I guess the game is pretty average , overall . It 's a good idea , but will not work in some circumstances .
3 #### Intended for 4 to 12 players , Party Gras encourages interaction with family , friends , and even as an icebreaker or supplement to any party , celebration , etc . Action cards provided players with a mission to fulfill , thus the goal is to take away beads from your opponents and accumulate as many as possible to win . The idea is very good , but the layout and structure of the game could be vastly improved . The action cards were occasionally awkward and made you think " Did they just put that in the card ? " And , that 's certainly not in the good way . There were n't enough rules and motivation to keep players into the game . If you want outrageous , ridiculous , but still fun action cards , I recommend&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Quelf - Board - Game / dp / B00421AGGG / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Quelf Board Game</a > . Overall , a game that had lots of potential , but failed to reach my expectations and satisfaction .
3 #### This game has some good possibilities in a large group as a means to get people talking and mingling but as a family game it was a dud . The concept was better than the follow - thru . It was more of an annoyance than a game and most of the participants continued to play only as good sports accomodating the hostess than because they had fun doing it . The " activities " are kinda lame , not really very imaginative , and if you already know everyone ( as in a family ) them many of the challenges are just not there . I could see using this at a block party , church social or a very tame method of corporate bonding exercise , but really , the most creative part of the whole package was the name . Meh . No recommendations here .
2 #### When I broke out Party Gras for the first time , it seemed like it could be a fun addition to a party . Just as quickly , people did n't care about the game and it broke up the flow . The " game " is simple , you try to do tasks on cards and when you do , you get more Mardi Gras style beads . Sadly , the game does n't function as a game on its own and when combined with other games or a party , it simply becomes a hassle . Essentially there will be one person really into it , going around collecting beads while ruining everyone else 's attempt to enjoy the party . It is a fine idea in theory , but the reality of playing it is rather painful .
3 #### Party Gras is one of the many , many party games out there and , as such , leaves somethings to be desired . The interaction aspects are fun and it has an advantage in a big group of people whom you 'd like to see get to know each other . I 'd recommend removing some of the more problematic cards if you 're going to play with a diverse crowd . But I found that the fewer the people , the less fun and the more you know each other , the less fun as well . I think this would be great for a new staff initiation ice - breaker or similar circumstance because it forces interactions between people and , if the possibly offensive questions are removed , can be a lot of fun for nearly everyone . For a smallish gathering however , I found it not so good .
4 #### Okay , my title might be a bit confusing . I will get back to that . My neice and nephews came over on New Year 's Day and I brought this out after everyone finished eating and carrying on . They all loved it , but it would probably be better to bring out in the beginning of a party or get - together so you do n't necessarily think it 's someone trying to get you to do something solely for the game . For instance , if you are trying to get a person to say " no " to getting you a drink . You ask them without having them realize that it is the game that you are playing . Thus , if you are carrying on and talking , one might think you really do want them to get it for you . I hope I made that clear enough . So just " play " it while you are chatting and not an intense " game " . They all loved it though .
1 #### It took forever for me to write this review simply because you have to have a minimum of four people in order to play it . I intially tried to make it work with just two people that is simply not possible with this game . Fortunately the holidays rolled around and we had enough people stop by the house to make the attempt . I must emphasis the word attempt because after 5 minutes of explaining the " rules " no one was really engaged in the " play " aspect . I think this game is much more well - suited for people who do not know each other well in an " icebreaker"/conference setting . There was much rolling - of - the - eyes and are you kidding me ? responses from those who were gamely trying to make this work . It was quite frankly , not that much fun . As I mentioned previously , this would be a great game to use as an icebreaker for facillitators . I belive that would make this game much more of a " party " .
3 #### We tried to play this game New Years Eve with some folks over 50 . It really was n't very successful in that age group . I guess we are all a little too inhibited . :)) Would probably be a good game for the under 40 crowd .
3 #### Party Gras is a great party game . Players can range from teens to lively adults . The game comes packaged in a clear , durable plastic tote bag versus the typical game box . The plastic case makes it easy to transport from one party to the next . The bright , festive , eye - catching colors is what drew me to this game . I think that most groups of 4 or more will enjoy playing this game if the participants are outgoing and have a good sense of humor . This game is not for introverts or for someone seeking a high educational value from a game . Party Gras is a great ice breaker , good humorous family / friend fun , and a welcomed change from board games that keep you seated . Start the holidays and new year off with something different ... Party Gras . If you tire of this game , just find another person that likes games and do an exchange .
3 #### This game was fun for a little while but quickly grew old . The Consensus from everyone was that it would n't be as fun to play a second time as at first it was novel but quickly became old hat . The basic idea of the game is everyone gets a card with different tasks to get someone else in the group to do . Everyone starts with the same amount of bead necklaces and when you get another person to do the task you get one of their beads . This game would be good with a new group but if there is any members that have played would not be as fun and the ones that have played before would have an unfair advantage .
1 #### It is not fun . It is a game of chance . We played it once , and got bored immediately .
5 #### fun dice game for football fans of any age - 10 year old enjoyed this one . Comes with dice cup and storage bag ... the bag is oddly sized ( too small for both cup and dice and too large for just dice ) so we do n't use it .
5 #### Fun game ! ! I do n't know football real well but this game is tons of fun anyways .
5 #### Bought as a birthday present . Shipping was fast . It is exactly as pictured . The family has had lots of fun playing this together .
5 #### Grandson is 8 . He 's a big football fan and loves playing it . Very entertaining for the adults also . Definitely a good back to basics game with no electronic gadgets or batteries . Just a fun dice game . Hightly recommend .
5 #### I was not sure if my son would like this game . He is very into sports but also xbox sports games . He loves it . Once you figure out how to play its alot of fun . My son is 9 and I recommend this for anyone who has a child into football .
5 #### I was n't sure about this purchase when I made it . Turns out our family has a blast playing this football dice game . The kids love to get to roll all the dice and its fun to keep track of your progress down the field on the provided sheets . No two games are alike and anything can happen . Its fun for us to kill some time sitting in the floor playing this game while watching football on TV on cold days .
5 #### Great game for my 11 year old . I liked that he could also play this game by himself . Great for football fans !
3 #### Fun but too much to figure out for kids . My son would up making up his own game with it . I prefer the Football Guys in the bucket . My nephews still play with them when they cime home from college and visit with my son ! ! ! !
5 #### Our three grandsons , ( 9 , 8 and 7 ) have played this game all through the holiday . They did n't have any trouble understanding or playing the game .
5 #### Great game ... By 9 year old and husband love it
3 #### I had a similar version of this game as a kid , and this one is not far from it . However , one negative about this version is that it does not break things down to 5 - yard increments like the older version . You have to actually count out from every yard line and that gets frustrating as you try to figure out what a 15 yard penalty means from the 27 yard line on the very small board they give you . The game can be fun in the sense it can change on any roll - but ultimately this is a game you break out when the kids are really bored or when adults want a different party game than beer pong .
5 #### We just got this and my 7.5 yr old absolutely loves the game . Requires us both to understand the rules of football but its fast paced and pretty fun . He loves to play and I 'm happy to play with him . It is a very smartly designed dice game .
5 #### this is a great game .... got introduced to it from a friend ... so I broke down and got this set . you ca nt go wrong with a game allowing you to pick a character after a dungeon delve with other adventurers
4 #### Before I got this , I was using a card collector 's box to keep all of my Red Dragon Inn decks together . This not only holds all of the cards , but all of the coins , has new score trackers that do n't take up a lot of space , and comes with some interesting new decks . My biggest complaint is the price , but if you 're a fan with everything , it 's definitely worth it .
5 #### WE LOVE THIS BOX ! ! Great idea for them to make it so you can consolidate everything into one amazing set .
5 #### I love Red Dragon Inn and have made it my mission to own all of the expansions ! The Character Trove is a must - have to hold all of the cards in one place . I love that they can be well organized ! It fits all of the cards , coins , instructions .... EVERYTHING .
5 #### This box is a gift that keeps on giving . I already had several of the expansions , so getting everything all in one place is wonderful . It 's a little overly big ( it hangs out of the shelf all my games are on ) , but its about as long as a monopoly or clue box ( about as high as 2 monopoly or clue boxes ) and does n't stick out too much . It 's a small price to pay for all the space saved from getting rid of the other boxes - not to mention that it will also hold future expansions .
5 #### THIS THING IS HUGE ! ! ! The new characters are fun and it comes with SO MUCH stuff including dividers and play mats for every character they have made so far . The play mats are customized so characters who have extra steps have them listed in the order of play spot on the mat . If you are just starting with Red Dragon Inn this is where you want to start because the game is so fun that you 'll end up getting all the expansions and extra characters eventually .
4 #### Bigger than you would expect . Room to expand beyond what is available today . The only problem with it was there was not quite enough overall height to store all the booklets and health tracking cards on the top , but I have a lot of extra of those .
4 #### Another Great Expansion for Red Dragon Inn . However , If you are adding this to Red Dragon Inn 2 , be aware that the card sizes and tokens are all a different size .
5 #### Purchased this as a gift . The recipient loves it and says it 's a nice complement to the base game !
5 #### This ally pack is awesome ! I always played as Zot the Wizard , so it only makes sense to play as Pooky . His crazy meter is fun and can really hurt the other players if you have the right card . This is definitely one of my favorite packs !
5 #### Love the game series . Play this all the time with my friends , Pooky is a good addition to the others in the bar !
4 #### I 'm just gon na say , this is the funniest game .... like wear a depends funny . I bought it for a family game night where I invited many different families . It was hilarious . I gave only four stars because : the mouth pieces are a little rough on the mouth ; if you get a small size you can rig the game ( the younger ones figure this out but quick ) and the hilarity wears out kind of quickly . But , overall , it 's very fun and a game we will break out often . I did buy extra mouth pieces .
5 #### This is a very fun game if you have a group ( 4 - 6 ) people to play with . Everyone takes turns drawing cards . One person draws a card , while the other people write on dry erase boards . The idea is when its your turn to draw a card , you read one of the questions on the card ( there 's multiple questions to choose from on each card ) then everyone else writes their answers to the question on their dry erase boards . The one who drew the card and read the question secretly picks the answer they like best . The remainder of the players vote on which answer they think the the person who read the question will like best . You get points if you guess correctly which one will be the favorite , and you also get a point if your answer was the favorite . Some of the answers that have come up in our house have been hilarious !
5 #### My family absolutely loves this game , lots of laughs and easy to play !
3 #### It 's okay , not as much fun as we expected
5 #### What fun ! This game is really a great way to get to know one another whether its friends , family or co - workers . We use it as a bonding tool and really getting to know our own family members !
5 #### Bought this for all my grandkids for Christmas . Played it with 8 yr . olds and one 6 yr . old ( with some help ) . It was fun for the adults and the children . A HUGE hit and they have continued to play it over and over again ! I highly recommend this game for a great family time ! So much fun !
5 #### Fun game for kids of all ages . 10 - year - old son was disappointed at first as it was not the grownup version , but more appropriate for his age and he has oodles of fun .
5 #### I bought this as a white elephant gift and I think it 'll be enjoyed well !
5 #### I use these in my 15 minute warmup class advisory class with my students . Why do I give this 5 stars ? This game , along with a few other games , promotes conversation , connections , and talk between the students . I have between 10 and 12 students ( depending on absences ) so we sometimes play in groups . Works so well . And you can stop the game without having to put a game board in a safe place . Not necessary ! I totally recommend this game . Hope the company comes up with more games like this !
5 #### This is my go - to present for birthdays now . My kids love this game ! Once you take things out of the box , it 's pretty compact . I put everything in a large ziplock bag and take it on vacation with us to play in he airport , on the beach , at the park , whatever ! Fun for kids of all ages ( starting with beginning writers , like my 6 year old ) . My boys love to make up funny answers to the questions , lots of the answers have to do with poop , lasers , and candy :) . Tons of fun !
5 #### My family LOVES this game ! We have 4 boys , aged 13 down to 7 , and we all play it as a family , or the boys will play with just the 4 of them . It 's very easy to learn and lots of fun ! Be ready for Hilarity ! !
5 #### This was purchased as a family gift as several members had birthdays . It was something they could all do together . Even 6 - year old Jack enjoyed it , with a little help from a big sister . For the price it is a good way to keep youngsters ( and even oldsters ) entertained for an evening and away from electronic devices for a break .
5 #### We play this game at home during family fun night . Players range from ages 6 - 60 . I also play this game for my monthly ladies game night . Everyone enjoys it . Looking forward to taking it on our 4th of July camping trip .
5 #### This has become my favorite game to play with the family . Highly recommend this -- it 's cute , funny , easy , and guaranteed to get some giggles !
5 #### My 11 year old and 7 year old loved playing this game with us . A great way to get to know more about your family and friends
5 #### My husband , myself , and my three kids , ages 17 , 15 and 10 , have all enjoyed playing the game numerous times . We have had a good time laughing . One thing we love about the game is it is not a long drawn out game . For our family a game took about 30 minutes . Many times we would play another round . A turn off for us on many games is the length of time they take . Plus , we love that the game does not make any one feel stupid .

4 #### Played it a Christmas with the family , we had fun with it .
5 #### It 's fun ! A little different than Apples but still fun .
5 #### I had never heard of this game . We had sooo much fun playing it . So many laughs ! I have a 4 , 7 , 9 , and 11 year old . Ideal for the older ones . The 4 yr old needed help .
5 #### Great product at an excellent price ! I am very satisfied with my purchase . Thank you so much
5 #### This ended up being a lot of fun at our extended family gatherings . The kids loved it as well as the adults . It plays better when the players are around the same age / thinking process . The adults were trying to figure out what the judge would want to pick and the younger kids were just random . But if you play as a family with multiple ages , it 's a fun way to get to know each other better and see how each other views / processes the world . We play it as a family of four ( kids ages 11and 6 ) and love it .
5 #### My husband and I play for hours with our seven and six year old .
5 #### Great game ! We really enjoy this with a group of friends
5 #### Our whole family loves this game . From 46 years to 8 years old . They ask to play it again and again .
5 #### new family favorite game - replaces apples to apples
5 #### Bought as a gift . Family given to loves it .
5 #### Had a lot of fun with the family playing this game !
5 #### Our family has played this game over and over ! We love it !
5 #### We love this game - Our 8 year old granddaughters love to play it .
3 #### It was fun , but only played a couple of times while other games were chosen more on our extended family"s Christmas Vacation gathering .
4 #### Our family played this over the Christmas holiday ages 60 down to 7 and it actually worked .
5 #### I am happy with the game and enjoy it and my 13 yr old granddaughter loves it .
5 #### Fun game for the family ! We enjoyed playing it on our family vacation . It brought a lot of laughter to everyone .
5 #### very fun game and my 8yr old grandson played with us .. like I said very fun and will be laughng on some of the answers that people come up with :-)
3 #### It 's okay , just not an " i love that game " kind of game . I heard great things about this game on the radio over five years ago . Granted , this is the family version , I do n't know if the other versions are better . The more the merrier though , would n't be fun with just two people .
5 #### Talk , talk , talk ... that 's what you 'll be doing while playing this fun and revealing family game . Revealing the inner most thoughts of your guests will be very interesting and enlightening when they answer your question of the round . Great for ages 8 and up , but really fun for a group of adults as well . Simply draw one of the question cards . Each player writes down their answer and the player with the highly prized Select - o - Matic 6000 becomes the judge . The judge rules on who 's answer is correct ( well , maybe correct is n't the exact answer here - let 's say that it 's the answer that the judge loves the most ) . Each correct winning answer earns points and the most points wins . This is definitely a great party game adults would really love getting into with their wacky answers as well as younger children with their version of the answers to questions .
5 #### It can be hard to find family games that appeal to a range of ages . Two adults , 4 boys aged 9 and 11 had a blast playing this several evenings after a day on the beach . Much hilarity , especially involving the word " hooters " . One of the older great nephews asked to take it home to play with friends . Not hard to learn at all . Very highly recommended .
4 #### I purchased this game for my daughter - in - law for Christmas and we played it Christmas day . It is a fun family game and we shared plenty of laughs . Gets a bit repetitive , which is why I gave it only 4 stars , and the rules needed to be tweaked a bit to suit our taste . Overall though , a fun game the whole family can play .
5 #### " Say Anything " is a wonderful game for kids and family members to learn a few more funny and surprising things [ or even stupid things :) ] about their friends and family . Its rules are pretty simple . You need at least three people to play and six at the max . Each player takes a dry erase board and one person becomes judge every round . The judge asks a question from a card and then each player gives their best guess about the answer in the JUDGES OPINION . The judge chooses the best answer using the Selectomatic 5000 , which is a gadget the judge puts the answer by turning the arrow to the correct color . Once that is done each player puts their chips on the card that they think will be the right one . The judge can get points by the amount of chips that are in each card and the players can get points if the judge chooses the board that has their chips in it . A player can also get an extra point if the judge chooses his answer . This is very similar to Apples to Apples except that there are many questions on one card and you can have endless answers . This is a great game for the family !
5 #### The hilarious Say Anything , a party game that is equal parts of two great party games ( Wits & Wagers and Apples to Apples ) finally comes out with a family edition and it was worth the wait . This riotous game has players coming up with the best answer for a random question , with one player being the judge and the others coming up with an answer that will most appeal to the deciding player . The family edition adds questions suitable for the whole family and will leave you in stitches , like the best party games out there . It plays quickly , people will learn it in two minutes and has a huge repeat - play potential . We bring it out for every family party and it 's always a hit . You 'll want to check out Wits & Wager Family Edition , too , which is another must - have party game .
4 #### These are good . Not a game at all though . Just cards with two questions to chose from as each person draws a card . Some interesting , some super easy ( what 's your favorite color ? ) , some can provide interesting conversations . We use it at dinner time . Each of us draws a card and asks everyone else answers each question . For a family of 5 ( plus toddler ) it takes about 10 minutes to each do a card .
4 #### Good game to teach active listening skills to children .
4 #### These seem suitable for a little older children , age 7 and up . It is enjoyable to see how they think about their answers . Makes them think . Good card game activity .
2 #### I am a Speech - Language Pathologist . I personally love these cards . They are fun and well made . But I do not have one patient that likes these . I 'm not sure why . But the kids set the pace on my choices . It is unusual for not one kiddo to like something . But sadly these sit on my toy shelf . However I will say I live in rural Alaska and that maybe why they lack appeal . But I do n't usually have this problem . I would be cautious with this one .
5 #### So happy I found out about this . It was fun for the whole family . My son really enjoyed looking for him everyday . Our elf came out the day after thankgiving . Along with playing hide n seek the elf would do things . On days our son was very naughty the elf would be naughty too ... One night the elf threw my son 's clean undies in the x - mas tree and around the room ... another night the elf TP - ed his room .... we had a blast with ideas . When he was good he got something some mornings . Like a christmas book or movie . On christms eve the elf left reindeer food ( oats and cookies sprinkles ) to throw on the lawn before he went to bed . Now I have to come up with more ideas for next year !
5 #### Christopher Pop - In - Kins is the elf to get ! He is cute and not creepy like the other elves . The wires in his arms and legs make it easy for him to hang on to that shelf or light fixture . We did n't follow the story , kept it more like the creepy elf story . I wish there were clothes like the creepy elf has . I have made a little outfit for him much to my daughter 's delight . Even found a knitted winter hat that will fit over that giant stocking . If my review was helpful to you , please choose YES . Thank you !
5 #### Really love def better then elf on a shelf in my opinion .
5 #### So much better than creepy Elf on the shelf ! Great story book also . We named ours Jingle
5 #### We love Christopher pop in kins ! He 's so cute ! His arms and legs bend which makes it really easy to pose him & get him into places . My little boy loves looking for him every morning !
5 #### We had these when we were young , ca n't wait to start the tradition with the next generation ...
5 #### I could not express how much this little guy helped our kids be on their best behavior and the book was a extra added bonus we are still reading it ...
4 #### We love the elf on the shelf idea . We 've had fun with him the last 2 years . He is a bit heavier than the " real " elf on the shelf so some of the crazy configurations I tried to do with him did n't work out . He 's very top heavy . He 's cute as can be and the book is cute too .
5 #### Way cuter than Elf on a Shelf , that one is freaky . This will be our 2nd , Gibbs needed a buddy
5 #### Way cuter and cheaper than the competition . My kids are in college . I bought this as a gag gift . The little elf is super cute and the book is nicely done . When my kids have kids , I will be back for five more ( hope they last that long ) .
1 #### This book is horrific ! ! ! I wonder if it was even proof - read or edited prior to being published . Boring , lacks any type of stimulating plot that would capture a child 's interest , and has bizarre illustrations to capture the pathetic storyline . Please do yourself a favor and get an elf on the shelf . The elf is tacky looking
5 #### Such a cute little elf for the shelf . Christopher also brought some early gifts for the kids in the form of a bookset . Very happy to have him back this year to grace our home and keep a record of all the naughty and nice things for Santa .
5 #### Thanks for fast shipping , it arrived in excellent condition , great product and wonderful tradition !
5 #### My son had so much fun finding Christopher each morning . Highly recommend this set !
4 #### We love this . We decided to try this instead of Elf on Shelf . I did n't read the part about not being allowed to touch him . Cute story and my 4 year old loved it , especially Christopher . However , the problem we have now is does not want him to go back to the North Pole . She cried for 20 min in bed xmas eve night because she did n't want him to leave . I did not want her to be sad ( when she should be super happy / excited ) so we said he could stay longer and I tried to explain he is just for fun . This is why I gave it 4 stars because your child might be extremely upset when it 's time for the elf to leave :(
5 #### This elf is so much cuter than the " other guy " . Cute , friendly looking and completely posable . Great price , I am very happy with this purchase .
5 #### This is such a cute elf . I would recommend this product and would buy from this person again ! Great product !
5 #### So super cute ! We also have the original creepy elf . Christopher is by far everyone 's favorite !
5 #### Great deal ! Not as scary as the " other " elf . Get the original here .
5 #### My kids love this . I think he 's cuter than the other popular elf . I tell everyone about our " Elfie "
5 #### A great alternative to Elf on a Shelf ! My son loves Christopher ! He 's been looking for him every morning , and he already know that he ca n't touch ! !
5 #### My children love Christopher . Durable and fun for the whole family . When Christopher comes out my daughter is on her best behavior he is magic no back talk , bedroom clean , and all chores done
5 #### Original elf on shelf ... naughty elf stold this elf original story .
5 #### TOO Cute a must for toddler til they can read it themselves .A ritual at our house GPa reads it to the kids .
4 #### Looked like this was a returned item but overall I like it !
5 #### We love our Christopher Pop - In - Kins , he visits us every year ! I think this version is MUCH cuter than the other Elf option ( and quite a bit less expensive ) ! He is bendable and adorable , as is the book , which has beautiful illustrations . I highly recommend this as opposed to the Elf on the Shelf if you 're in the market for a Christmas elf .
5 #### way better than creepy peepy tom eyes this elf was the best alternative because my sons friends at school ( kindergarten ) were telling him their elf was evil and destroys the house i said HECK NO ! and we had a blast hidding mr popinkins around the house no need for a mess this book was VERY nice too will do again next year !
2 #### He 's fine . I love that his limbs are bendable . That 's important . He 's cute , but if you 're going to make your elf do silly or mischievious things , the look on his face does n't really match up . Also , I was n't impressed with the storybook it came with . Not bad , just not very compelling . We 'll keep him and use him again , however .
4 #### Love this elf . Not creepy like the other guy and super cute . The book is colorful and is a good read . Little long for my 3 yr old but the pictures kept him interested . Good elf story with not being naughty but nice !
5 #### Great , cheaper alternative to the elf on the shelf . Same concept but less creepy looking ! My kids love it very much
5 #### I bought this for my son as " his " elf on the shelf since we already have the Elf on Shelf for my other son and did n't want the same ELF . Very cute features . Love that it comes with a book and tells the store . He is bendable which is good to place in fun places , etc . I would recommend this Elf .
5 #### Bought to put up and give to my granddaughter next Thanksgiving . Sure she will enjoy it . Was cheaper than the other elf .
5 #### I thought popinkins was so much cuter than the other more popular elf that is out there . My kids are so excited to look for him everyday ! It seems to help with behavior too . I just say .. don't forget popinkins is here and poof the kids stop fighting . We just love him !
5 #### Christopher has gotten into some trouble stealing cookies and riding the kids horse toys like a cowboy , but otherwise he 's the perfect little " Helper " ! I love that his arms have wire in them , so I can place him in certain positions that would n't be possible with the other elf .
5 #### The whole idea of the story is that this little elf was sent to watch your children 's behavior until Christmas eve and then report back to Santa . This is a really cute story and in my opinion Christopher Pop - in - kins is the least creepy looking elf on the market to hide around your house . His arms and legs are positionable so he can sit , hang and lean on things . We have used this for 2 years now and it has been a hit with my boys ( 4 and 5 ) . We made the game so that he is the one who puts treats in the advent calendar each day . ( I ca n't keep it stocked or they will sneak it all :) BUT he only does this if the boys are good that day . We read the book before nap time and when they wake up from naps the first thing they do is find Christopher . If he has moved spots that means he got down from his last hiding spot and put treats in the calendar while they were sleeping . Fun for all of us . Highly recommended for a house with little ones as a Christmas game or tradition .
5 #### We chose this elf over the ' other elf ' , simply because he 's cuter . Then we found out that Christopher has WIRED arms and legs , which is super awesome when it comes to posing him in naughty places ( or sometimes nice ones - but let 's face it - it 's far more entertaining when the elf toilet papers the tree vs. just hangs off of it ) . His plastic hands and feet make it easy to attach him via tape to whatever props he needs . The book is also cute - a good way to introduce him to kiddos . Christopher is a durable elf - I can see him holding up for years and years .
5 #### We really like this set . Our girls are too young this year to keep from fighting over the elf and not touching him , as the book says , so we will just try again next year . I expect it to be great fun when they are about 4 years+ .
5 #### This is way cuter than the other little " elf " and he was 1/2 the price . ( My husband thinks the other version is creepy ) He is sturdy and flexible . He 's quite easy to pose . My daughter loves the hardcover book he came with . I 'm glad I chose him over the other guy because he 's adorable and quite mischievious .
5 #### What a great idea ! I liked this way better than the elf on the shelf , which I thought was creepy looking . Christopher is much cuter ! He also has pose able arms and legs so you can make him do more stuff . The kids are loving the idea of hunting for him every day
5 #### I love that the elf is posable . The story is cute . Although it was hard to hold my 3 year olds attention , he did sit through the story .
5 #### It was the original story from 1960 , the elf is large , dressed nicely , really cute , the book and illustrations very well done , the box stores nicely to enjoy year after year
5 #### The kids love him and this product is much cheaper than " The Elf " . I bought this because we lost the elf last year and I could not kind the Pop - in - Kins without the book . Fun for the holidays . It keeps the kids on their toes !
5 #### This little guy is so cute ! I 'm so glad I found out about him before ordering Elf on the Shelf . And who knew that Christopher Pop - in - Kinz has been around since 1985 , a mere 20 years longer . Ca n't wait to bring him out this year ! ! !
5 #### Love to find creative ways to position this guy every night . My son races through the house trying to find him each morning . We love the bendable arms and legs and the fact that he is NOT FREAKY LOOKING like the " elf on the shelf " !
5 #### I guess I did n't read closely enough . That this product was half the price of the " real " Elf on a Shelf book and doll should have been a tip - off . This elf is already named - Christopher . But the story line is the same , the elf is cute ... and like I said , the set was half the cost of the " real deal " set ! I bought this for my niece 's children , and she said it might actually help that the elf is already named ... save a campaign by the kids to name him something off - the - wall ! We 're totally happy with our Christopher elf and book !
5 #### looked awesome and worked just fine and price was great , quality was great too , would purchase from again in future
5 #### even though x mas is far away from now however , I got it on sale and ca n't wait to share this with my little girl who is going to be 3 at Christmas . I think it may be a little over her head but i deff wo n't share with my younger daughter who will be one because she wo n't understand.story is cute and so is the elf .
5 #### I loved starting this tradition this year ! ! ! My kids did also , I liked how Christopher is cute vs. the elf that visits my sisters house ( elf on elf ) . Christopher was very flexible and hide everywhere in my house . I would recommend him ( and have already ) to everyone ! ! !
5 #### I was so pleased with the looks of this elf . I honestly ca n't wait for Christmas to entertain my children .
5 #### We love our Elf Christopher and ca nt wait for him to come back for the holidays again ! We had so much fun with him . Great quality and looks way cuter than the ones in red and white only . He is dressed as a real elf , just like in the picture .
5 #### I like that this elf on the shelf has the book and the elf together . The book comes inside a resuable box / cover and an attached box for the elf to be placed in after each Christmas . This elf looks friendly and he 's bendable so he can be placed in different stances and do all sorts of fun things ! This book has colorful graphics and was a good purchase .
5 #### We loved having Christopher around this Christmas :-) He definitly did n't help my 4 year old behave any better , well maybe for about a week , but it was soooooo fun hiding him when my son was sleeping or playing or out of the house . We would be driving home from somewhere and my little guy would say out of nowhere " wonder where Christopher will be hiding when we get home ? " and he tries to beet us in the house running from room to room , precious memories . Worth it even if it is for 1 - 2 Christmas ' .
3 #### He would n't even let us take it out of the box ( he 's 4 ) . We had to call Santa and have him come pick his elf up and take him back to the north pole . My kid was freaked out that an elf would be spying on him . We got this one because I thought it was cuter than the other ones . I thought he was cute and the book was too . Maybe next year my son will let him stay .
5 #### Love Love Love this ! Not only is it very well made but the story and elf have provided a lot of fun reading it .
5 #### was a some great fun for all the younger kids 2.5 - 8 this thanksgiving thought xmas eve . christopher seemed to pop around during the day a little as well . sometimes he was standing , other times hanging on to a chandelier , curtain rod , light , etc . a ton of smiles each morning on the hunt for " christ - pher popkins " as delightfully called by the 2.5 year old . The book is a nice story , not too long either for multiple bed time readings during the holidays .
5 #### Our family has had so much fun with this little elf . " CP " as . He is often called here will send the kids letters , cookies , or other small treats in the mail . I think he is something every young family should have !
5 #### My 4 yer old son believed this elf was really keeping an eye on him . He loved waking up every morning to see where he moved to . If the elf did n't move ( which means someone was not behaving ) my son would blame my 5 month old son lol so that the elf would let Santa know that my other son was being bad . The elf is really cute and made well , also comes with a very nice book , and the book is a nice large size which is nice . Christopher will be visiting our house again around thanksgiving time .
4 #### This elf is a little cheaper than the original " Elf on the Shelf " and it 's not creepy looking . I paid $ 20 for this one , where the other is $ 30 .
5 #### Great bendable elf ! Gets into all kinds of places at our house . Highly recommended to all for your holiday fun .
1 #### As the picture shows the doll and the book you would think that both would be included in the set . I read the reviews and a few said that they received both and a few said that they did not . I received only the book and will be returning it .
5 #### So I loved the idea of the Elf on the shelf . It was kinda creepy looking so I was n't sure I was going to get one . Then I came across Christopher ! How cute is he ! His head , hands and feet are plastic . His body , legs and arms are cloth . He has wire inside him and is very bendable which helps a ton when he gets into mischief . The story that goes a long with him is just ok .... my daughter is 3 and usually sits for longer books , she was not impressed with the story but got the point . I tried to get her to rename him something fun but Christopher stuck . He gets into all sorts of things ... flour angels , hanging underwear from the tree ... pooping sprinkles ( which made my daughter laugh for 20 mins straight ) . Overall was a good choice , the only thing is there is n't any merchandise like there is for elf on the shelf . And most of her friends have the other elf so she asks why he looks different . I just told her Santa has different types of Elf 's for different things :)
5 #### Our boys go nuts every morning looking for Christopher . They want him to tell Santa what good boys they are and how excited they are for Christmans . They also say " do n't tell the elf , " when they have done something naughty ! Tons of fun for the paretns as well .
5 #### Love the Idea wanted this for my daughters ordered two so that they can start their own family traditions thanks .
5 #### If you made this choice as your " Elf on the Shelf " , then you made a good one . He 's so cute and you can mold his arms and legs to fit in a lot of places . The book is an awesome bonus as well . What a deal for years of fun . Do n't pass it up !
5 #### This is a great idea . I wish it had been around when I was a kid . My son , who is 6 , absolutely loves Christopher . He was very excited about him " coming to visit " again this Christmas . He is positively sure that Christopher is real , which is so cute . Last year , in kindergarten , he excitedly went to class and told everyone that he had an elf living with him . There are a lot of kids who at my son 's age already do n't believe . i think this is a shame . You never get back this time in your life when you believe in magic and elves and Santa Claus . I want my son ( and daughter who is almost 2 ) to have this for as long as they possibly can ! It is very exciting to my son to go and look for Christopher each morning . Daughter is not quite into it yet , naturally , but I anticipate she will be next year . The book that comes with it , while cute , is definitely not one of my favorites to read . My son asks for it to be read once when Christopher first comes and then not again . Still , very cute and I highly recommend .
5 #### My daughter has had a wonderful time looking for our elf , this year he has been well behaved thus far - last year he was a bit mischevious but there are 2 wks left till Christmas .
5 #### I 'm sorry but the other " Elf on the Shelf " just looks scary tome . This guys is perfect . Very friendly looking and has pose - able arms and legs . My kids love him and really enjoyed the story !
5 #### Okay , so we are new to the " Elf on the Shelf " tradition . My granddaughter is only two so I let her open the box . I had her hold the elf while I read the story , which , you more experienced shelfers know that is a no - no . We were able to fix it with , " Christopher will have to go back to the North Pole tonight to get his magic back " , whew ! That being said , the book is big and the illustrations are beautifully colorful . Christopher looks EXACTLY like the illustrations . On one particular page he is pictured actual size , face on , my granddaughter noticed and placed Christopher on top of his picture . I think it just helps with the fantasy . The doll is super cute and seems to be well made . I think the bendable arms will be helpful in coming up with creative ways to place him . The holidays are all about traditions and I think this is a really fun one . I 'm very happy with the purchase .
5 #### I always liked the idea of these in house elves reporting back to Santa , but I refused to purchase the other brand because they are quite creepy , and no self respecting Santa would let one in his workshop . My husband found Pop In Kins last year and we were thrilled , he is adorable . Yesterday started our second season with him , and my sons just love him . They love predicting where he will be the next day , and what he will get in to . They also have long talks with him about their year , what they have been up to , and trying to get information about which list they are on . The doll itself is quite durable , and is bendable / posable so it is easy to get him to sit , stand or hang from your chosen perch . Definitely recommend for some holiday fun .
4 #### We choose this elf over the seemingly more popular alternative in hopes that it would be more friendly - looking than its elf counterpart . Success ! The kids are enjoying looking for the elf every morning not cowering . The book is OK . Its main benefit is providing the back story for the elf , why it is around the house and some ground rules ( such as no touching or back to the North Pole I go ) . I liked how the story was written in a way that encouraged positive behaviors without a big brother is watching you vibe . If you are looking for an elf to visit during the holidays , I would go with Pop - in - Kins .
5 #### This elf is adorable and a lot better than that creepy Elf on the Shelf . It is durable and mold - able , just like the Elf everyone else seems to love . My daughter is 2.5 and absolutely loves him . She enjoys looking for him every morning . When we got it , we hid the box and brought out the book , letting her know that Santa delivered the book to us and we had no idea what was inside . We sat down and read it and asked her if she wanted Christopher to come visit her , and she said yes . So after she went to bed , we brought out the elf and she was so surprised and excited that he actually came to visit her . ; o ) I think this is a wonderful tradition and totally blows the creepy Elf on the Shelf out of the water !
5 #### After seeing many cute elf ideas on the web , I was excited to start the tradition with my sons . I was planning on purchasing the " other elf " but after reading reviews , I checked out Christopher Pop - In - Kins . I am so glad I did ! A few things led to my decision to purchase Christopher instead of the " other elf " : Reviews of the " other elf " said that the story book that comes with the elf is very harsh . I did n't want my sons to be fearful of the elf . Christopher has a very sweet story about a curious elf who wishes to see real children . Behavior of the children is mentioned only once and very briefly . Christopher is much cuter ! Christopher is already bendy so you can easily pose him without any modifications ! Overall , I am very pleased with my purchase . My sons are very young so the oldest is just starting to get into it . Today he laughed at the elf on the fan , or the elf carousel as we called it . I look forward to doing this year after year .
4 #### I am very pleased with the quality of this little guy and the book . It 's great that the elf has posable arms and legs so he can grab on to things . The more well known " Elf on the Shlef " does not and frankly I find that elf to be creppy looking anyway . My one gripe would be that the way the story is written it does n't really catch a childs attention . It is a fun storyline , but could have been told in less pages OR even better , there could have been more of a story behind it rather than just a crying sad elf that wanted to see kids . My son is young enough not to know what I am reading anyway so I just kind of made up a story as I went along . It has been realy fun coming up with ideas for this elf and my son loves looking for him when he gets up in the morning . His birthday is right after thanksgiving and when he woke up for his birthday I told him I did not have time to decorate , but I did wrap his presents . Christopher decorated for us though and was found perched on the top of a balloon that had been tacked to the wall . He also hid my sons presents for him to find . If you are trying to find away to bring some more magic into the holiday for your little one this is a great way to do it !
5 #### I was searching for a cuter alternative to the Elf on the Shelf since my husband deemed the Elf creepy ;) . When I found Christopher , I knew this would be perfect . The story is very similar to the other elf -- hides in a new place each night and reports child 's behavior back to Santa . Christopher is very durable , colorful , and the included hard back book is filled with bright illustrations and a fun story on the creation of Christopher . I would recommend this for any family with small children looking to create a new family tradition .
4 #### Received this item the day before Thanksgiving . Yeah ! I can start on time this year . I noticed that Barnes and Noble carried Christopher Pop - in - kins online , and since it was the only store I could find it at , I went into my local Barnes and Noble and was greated with the popular Elf on the Shelf instead . Seriously , there were thousands of those creepy dolls at literally every corner of my bookstore . I am not one who starts telling my kid months in advanced that Santa is watching , and I was n't going to get a doll whose primary " job " is keeping an eye on my kid 's behavior . At last , I decided to order Christopher from amazon . Christopher 's head , scarf , mittens , and shoes are all cheap plastic that has been painted and he looks cheaper than I expected . I was hoping that he would be very well made so that he could be passed down thru the generations . Although he seems durable , I am not pleased with the defects from the plastic being painted and the molds obviously being assembled quickly . I will keep an eye out for a better made cute elf that will be a beautiful addition to our holidays and that will replace this . Bottom line , he is way better than the other popular option , and I will use him until I find an elf better than this . The story is cute .
5 #### I am so happy I got this elf over the OTHER elf on a shelf . He 's adorable - much less creepy than the other one and much more appropriate for toddlers . I 'm actually very impressed with the quality . I like how he has a bendable body - it will make some of my ideas a lot easier to accomplish ! Great price too - the set includes a hardcover book that 's really nice .
5 #### What a great annual fun tradition this sweet little elf provides . The elf comes with a book to read to your children the day after Thanksgiving , when the Elf comes to stay until Christmas Eve . We had all kinds of fun discovering what types of mischief our little Elf , nicknamed " Candy Cane " got into each night . There are lots of fun ideas to be found online and our Elf was naughty and silly . Celebrating the holiday season with our elf made each morning a treasure hunt . The elf has arms and legs that can be bent and posed a variety of different ways . There is also a female version of the elf . We will enjoy our elf for years and years to come . Highly recommend !
5 #### This is a cute version of Elf on the Shelf . His name is Chistopher and he hides in different places every night . The book is very cute , and the elf is very nicely made .
4 #### The price was fair . Works fine and arrived on time . I 'm happy with it . This is extra text to meet the stupid minimum requirements from Amazon .
5 #### This is such an awesome idea to get your kids to behave and help at Christmas time . And such a good deal from Amazon . Our kids loved the book and we even found a movie as well . And so may cute ideas on pinterest on how to set the Elf up each morning for your kids to find him .
5 #### Our entire family loved Christopher ! The book is great , the elf is cute and friendly . We had fun finding new spots to move him , and our girls could n't wait to get downstairs to find him . This will be a yearly tradition for our family for sure !
5 #### Christmas . On a whim , my husband bought her an Elf on a Shelf . We loved the concept , but Richard ( our elf ) was a bit cheap looking . A friend recommended a Pop - In - Kins , and we eventually ordered one to be a companion for Richard . I have to say ... this elf is MUCH more adorable than Elf on a Shelf ( EoS ) , and it 's a better quality to boot . You can actually pose him , unlike the EoS. I wish we had seen this one first . But either way , he was money well spent . Since we ordered him right before the holiday , he was significantly less expensive . If you did n't get one this year , buy one now so you 'll have it for next year . Your kids are guaranteed to love it .
4 #### He s cute , has bendable arms and legs . Comes with a hardback book that my daughter loved to hear ( she s 7 ) . She is always looking for the elf to see what he s up to . So far he has TP'd our living room so she woke up to toilet paper all over the living room . He turned the milk blue , in the fridge . Climbed up the tree . Tried to eat cookies and milk . So much to do with him :) Cons : why is this thing so expensive ? Same with Elf on the Shelf . Made in China His head does nt really turn so its hard to get a good position .
5 #### My kids ages 10 , 8 , 5 and 3 LOVE looking for Christopher each morning . THey get so excited when they find him . Even my 10 year old wonders what he does each night when he moves . They believe in his magic . Sometimes the elf gets into a little mischief before finding his next hiding place . Great tradition to begin ! At first they were a little spooked by him , now they love him !
5 #### I picked this elf because the orginal elf on self is a bit creepy looking . Came in adorable packing to store your elf for next season . This one looks like a real elf & is so colorful . The book is great too . Again very colorful & such a cute story . My son is having such a fun time finding the elf . We are going to get creative w/ hinding him . Bonus was this one was half the price of the other elf .
5 #### I looked at several elf / book combo toys before deciding on this one . It really is one of the cuter elves out there and seems well made . The arms and legs are bendable which makes it easy to pose the elf in different scenarios . The story in the book is an easy read , my 3 year old was able to understand the premise and we will make this a fun tradition each year .
5 #### We had the other popular Christmas elf and found that , frankly , he was creepy . This elf is most certainly NOT creepy ! I love that he 's bendy , so he can get into lots of shenanigans , and he 's a lot bigger than I 'd anticipated ! My only word of caution is that if you have a child who still believes and can read , be sure to cut out the dedication page in the book , which essentially gives the secret away . I almost did n't catch it and I know my voracious reader would have seen it right away ... and honestly , as short as childhood is these days , I want her to hang on to the magic and wonder of Christmas for as long as she can . :) All in all , I love this to pieces and * highly * recommend adding this Christmas tradition to your holiday season !
5 #### This is a very cute story . Nice to start a new Christmas tradition . The book and elf come packaged very nicely . It 's a story about an elf who wants to see children . He pops in to your house to watch them . You can move him around for the children to find him . His hands and legs bend to hold onto things . Kids will really enjoy looking for the elf each year.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Christopher - Pop - In - Kins-34 - Pops - In-34 / dp/098153970X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Christopher Pop - In - Kins " Pops In"</a > Christopher Pop - in - kins is much cuter and much better made than the Elf on the Shelf .
4 #### This game is wonderful ! Yet another amazing game from this company ! Although it was a little hard for my three year old , he came up with his own way to play and loved it ! I know that he is going to be able to grow into this game . My friends ' children also love this game . I would highly recommend this game !
5 #### Item was shipped on time and as described . We still play this game often . Very pleased with this transaction . Thank You .
5 #### We love this game . They love stretching to reach all the letters . They 'll play the game at least a couple of time each time we pull it out .
5 #### This is like twister in a way -- the mat has the letters ( in alphabetical order ) around the outside , and the object is for the child to put different body parts on the right letters ( selected from the " tornado " spinner ) . There are 5 letters or free spaces each time -- feet , hands , and ear . It does n't specify which hand , which is good . The kids will be twisted up trying to get their ear on the " m " and hands on the " a " and " b " ! Mat is a thick , sturdy plastic , adults and children have played on it with no issues .
4 #### My ESL kids like this game . However , we can hardly ever win all the cards when you have to put your ear to one item . Maybe they should change that to a different body part . It is a good twist on Twister and the kids can practice their alphabet and vocabulary .
5 #### We 've had this game for a year , and my kids still love it . My 3 year old quickly learned all of the letters and their sounds by playing this game . They laugh their little heads off every time they play ( especially when they can talk their dad into playing with them ) . It 's like twister , only better and with the added bonus that they learn something .
5 #### Purchases this as a gift for my niece because my kids have one and really enjoy it . It gets them moving and it is a fun way to find their letters . My 3 year old is uses the letter disks while we play . We use the pictures for my 6 year old to help him learn the sounds of the letters .
5 #### We had tons of fun with this game ! I 'm excited it helps my 3 - year - old learn letters . My 7 - year - old loves it too . The box is quite big , make sure you have lots of room for storing it . Not a take along type of game . It 's really a lot like Twister , with some added learning thrown in . Trying to touch your ears to the letters is fun , and hilarious . The only thing I do n't like , is that if we get too many feet cards right away and not a lot of letters , the game is over too soon , and no one has the winning secret card yet . Just shuffle the cards well so you do n't have too many feet card . The mat is very sturdy and colorful , and the cards and peices are well made too . We love Dr. Seuss and ordered this for his birthday celebration week . I would recommend this game .
5 #### My three year olds love playing this game ! It 's really not difficult to follow instructions ! Educational , fun , what more could you ask for ? ?
4 #### This Dr Suess game is an excellent play on the beloved classic - Twister . The mat is small enough for little bodies , and the option to use pictures or letters is great . Currently , we are on pictures , but we do try some letters each time . My daughter is four and really enjoys this game - she likes watching me try to contort on the little mat as well .
5 #### My daughter , 5 years old , received this game as a Christmas gift . I also have a 2.5 year old . The girls love to play this game ! My 5 year old loves to help her little sister find the letters and figure out how to sstttrrreeetttccchhh to reach all the spots . At the end of the game , the " winner " is who ever had the letter found on the super secret letter card . We have quite competitive children so we have made this game one that does not have a winner , but the person with the " lucky letter . " Who ever had the " lucky letter " gets to choose if they are the caller or the stretcher on the next round . If my 5yo has a friend over , they often ask to play this game . After a round of instruction , they can play this game with parent support but not necessarily parent involvement . Sometimes it takes a little parent support to figure out how to reach all the letters but they are able to spin the " tornado , " call out the letters and help each other stretch to reach . It 's fun to watch them play !
5 #### Bought this for my 3 - year - old son who is learning his letters . Thought it would compliment what he is learning in school . It is simple enough , that he can follow the directions . He 's a little short to be able to reach everything , but the instructions state that you get points for what you can do ( you do n't have to do everything to score points ) . I even had fun playing , so I wo n't complain when he asks to play . He 's just the right age to start playing this .
5 #### My wife is a big fan of all things Jane Austen and loves to play games , so what better combination could there be than a Jane Austen deck of cards . Each of the four suits represents one novel : Pride and Prejudice , Emma , Sense and Sensibility , and Persuasion . The lower cards each has a verse from the particular novel , while the face cards carry the image of a person ( The King of Hearts is Fitzwilliam Darcy . ) There are also 2 jokers - I 'll leave their characters up to you to discover ( one male , one female ) . A great , fun set of cards . I would highly recommend these to someone who loves Jane Austen .
5 #### I love these playing cards . Each suit has quotes from a different one of Jane Austin 's books . Also , the King , Queen and Jack are the main characters from the books . The quality and feel of the cards is excellent .
5 #### Decks of these cards were the perfect gifts for the several Janeites in my family . The cards are very well made , sturdy , glossy and smooth , and a little smaller than standard poker size . The illustrations are excellent and reflect the time and characters of the novels . The four suites are based on four novels : Sense & Sensibility , Emma , Pride and Prejudice , and Persuasion . The two jokers are a surprise and there are quotes from the appropriate novels on the cards . Though I am not a Janeite , I have read the novels and enjoyed them - and I even participate in the whist games my Janeite relatives sometimes hold on Sunday evenings . The drawings and quotes on the cards do not interfere with using these cards for card games . The cards are practical .
5 #### Wonderful cards to keep as a set to play card games with or use in crafting .
5 #### Already Reviewed this . Not thrilled at having to do again . Nice to have options with Qchord and have more fun .
5 #### It goes well with the Melody Harp ! The spiral binding makes it easy to keep the music sheets together , unlike the music I purchased years ago .
5 #### Music selections were good . Book came in excellent condition .
5 #### I am very happy with this product . My six year old and I like to play these songs together and they are enough of a challenge for her that she does n't get bored .
3 #### some of the notes are not in tune so when you tune the harp to the song then another song is n't in tune again .
3 #### I like the music , but the size of the notes are smaller and the notes are spaced closer than our other lap harp sheet music . Consequentially , it 's too difficult for my 5 year old to play , and not as much fun for my 7 year old or I to play than the other sheet music . However , we deal with it and still use the music because we like the songs a lot .
5 #### I purchased this product for myself , but , my granddaughter later became interested as well . Recommend all products made by World of Harmony Music ! Great quality , pricing and quick delivery response . Thank you ! !
5 #### The cards are well made and add extra options to the game . My players love them . The standard deck only has art on the face cards though .
3 #### Eminent Domain is a fun game combining several popular game elements into one slick package . I enjoy the gameplay , and the components are fantastic , but the game starts to feel the same after several plays . The reason this is so is that the same cards are present in every game , and the same cards are accessible at the same time in every game . The cards included in the technology stack are always available , and the stacks on the tableau are the same from game to game . I do n't mean to say that every game is identical ; far from it . The planets players draw vary from game to game , and these planets determine different strategies . And because the game involves " learning " different roles -- that is , the more a player performs actions like research , survey , or colonize , the better he gets at it -- a player 's deck and strategy will necessarily change from game to game . However , even with these layers of difference , there is n't much that differentiates each game experience . My play group got bored with it after several plays .
4 #### Pleasantly surprised by the game components . Top notch illustration , card stock and the plastic space ship pieces are really nice ! Rating 4 stars from the first initial play . 4 starts for a simple , but elegant deck - builder\role selection game . Theme is like chocolate sprinkles : not too dense , but gives a nice flavor . I 'm looking forward to more plays . Thumbs up to TMG !
5 #### This card driven game has elements of hand management , asynchronous role selection , and deckbuilding on top of a space 4x theme . The 4x is pasted on since you can not attack each other and each player is building a tableau of cards . The unique follow / dissent mechanism tied to the role selection of other players means you really have to pay attention to other players turns and not tune out until your next turn . Great spin on the typical deckbuilder card game . A good amount of replayability with several paths to victory . Decent art and components . Weird mix of ship tokens that are the same as Eclipse the board game but the rest are standard wooden discs .
4 #### It 's a little complicated to learn , but a good once through and a trial game later , you 're going to want to come back to it and explore new strategies .
5 #### One of my favorite card - based ' board ' games . This is fun and combines many elements of other games , but with enough simplicity to pick up casually and yet complex in strategy . The expansion adds even more depth .
4 #### Great fun board game , checkout board game geek for more reviews and opinions as well as to learn about many more games .
5 #### Unforgiving game , but that 's what makes it fun .. + Deep character progression + Tactics/ luck needed to survive + beautiful artwork + Interesting figurines + Good sense of immersion + can solo play or group play and both work well + game within a game .. after getting through a mission you then go to town and have another unique experience . ------------------------------------------------------------------ - Expensive for a game - all expansions are $ $ $ too - Figurines are kinda cheesy and a pain in the but to --- > break from the mold --- > Sand down rough edges --- > Glue together --- > Paint matte black --- > Final painting . BUT once all that is done they look sharp -- except the characters for some reason they 're detail is meh . - You will have tokens coming out your wazzu .. which means you will need some kind of storage like a plano fishing tackle box ( the clear see thru kind ) AKA the game box storage and card storage are very meh and irritating . - The rules are somewhat convoluted .. you WILL make tons of mistakes and find out later you were playing the game wrong .. watch a youtube stream and it will cut that down a bit .
5 #### The game takes up a lot of space to play and the model are a pain to put together , but I love Shadows of Brimstone ! Anyone who says otherwise is a board game snob ! Great theme , great amount of replay , lots of add ons , and chucking dynamite in a room full of void spiders cracks me up everytime !
5 #### I love this game . Part RPG , part board game , part miniatures combat . The theme and feel to it is fantastic . Love this game .
5 #### This is a really cool game . There is no monster controller player , all of the monsters are controlled by cards . Therefore , you may play solo if desired . The game has cool miniatures ( some assembly required ) . There are many cards . Even when the heroes are in town bad things can happen - ouch . It took me a while to discover what some of the gear items did - there was a reference sheet on the last page of the rulebook that covered them all . This game looks good . It plays well . There are neat videos online that show the gameplay . The four heroes are different in each boxed edition . The hero cards allow a played to be either male or female . Personally I think City of the Ancients has the better heroes . deck cards are normal sized , however , the other cards in the game are oversized and this makes them really easy to read . There is a wealth of information on each larger card . The rules are somewhat long = 35 pages . However , the online videos are very good at showing the ease of actually playing . In between mission adventures the posse of heroes may go to town and level up and buy new stuff . This is cool . Although a little pricey , there is a lot of neat stuff in these boxes . Shadows of Brimstone is a neat dungeon exploring game .
5 #### One of my gaming groups new favorite games ! Took a few hours to learn and we are well versed complicated board games . The instructions are very clear however and does n't leave up much to debate which is really nice when you 've had arguments about game rules before . The first dungeon ( mine ) was really easy for us . We have been trying to run a campaign but leveling up toons is pretty difficult or maybe we have just had some of the most calamitous visits to town that anyone can have ! Which has made the campaign really difficult but also epic and fun ! I noticed a lot of people complained about putting the models together personally I did n't have any issues ... but it might be difficult for someone who has never done models before . My only real complaint is the biggest monster model when complete does n't really fit in the box without setting the lid askew !
5 #### This game is awesome , and almost escaped notice . I 'm glad I found this game , because as a fan of the show , I feel this game captures the feeling of running a Ludus very well . Love all the cards with images from the show . If you liked the show , or just like board games in general , then this comes highly recommended .
5 #### I 'm a fan of the Starz production of Spartacus . And now the board game . I will not open it , as it sits on the shelf with my other collectables .
5 #### My daughter loves it . It 's a great variety of well - known songs that are perfect to get involved in and be interactive .
5 #### This book is so much fun ! ! ! My daughter loves them . Its been fun to watch her learn the songs , the more she reads them . The quality of the sound is great !
5 #### My child loves these musical books , and having the little sensor button in the page rather than the clumsy ones with the buttons down the side seems to impress her . She plays this over and over
5 #### I love these books so much ! My daughter loves books and music . She has so much fun with these .
5 #### Sweet little childs voice with an Australian accent and quiet / minimal musical instrument sounds . Purchased and adored by my one year old , but my four year old also enjoys searching for the subtle silver push buttons . Perfection . Thank you . Definitely will to buy more of this brand .
5 #### Great book for toddlers with all their favorite songs . I especially like it because the songs are not too long for toddlers who have a short attention span .
5 #### My one - year - old son loves this book . He loves the music and the little buttons on each page are easy for him to push .
4 #### The book was purchased as a gift for my friend 's granddaughter . Vivian is at the age where she loves books that make sounds and she can interact with . I assume she 's been enjoying the book .
5 #### Such a cute book ! My daughter giggles every time we get to the five little monkey page . The sound on these books are clear and loud . Would definitely recommend and gift to others . Very unique
5 #### These are my daughters favorite books . She is 15 months old . She has learned how to press the sensor to get the music to play . I bought two other ditty bird books because she loved the first one so much . I know they are expensive , but they are worth it to me .
5 #### A perfect addition to your Elf on the Shelf !
5 #### We love this book and the Saint Bernard . My son actually likes this book better than the Elf on the Shelf . Highly recommend this to go with your elf . Adorable . Book is so great .
5 #### Loved it . Grandson will be so surprised when he sees it . Thank you
5 #### Our older daughter has the Reindeer so we ordered the St. Bernard for our two year old and she absolutely loved him ! Both girls ' ca n't wait for next fall for their friends to return !
4 #### Cute , soft toy that kids love to sleep with . The book was really good too .
5 #### My son fell in love with this Elf pet . It is quality made and worth spending the money !
5 #### Kids love this thing . We named her Daisy . She hides every morning and the kids have to find her . Lots of fun . But now she 's back at the N. Pole until next Christmas season . We miss you Daisy ... come back soon .
5 #### Excellent Story that goes with the Elf on the Shelf series . My 6 year old son loves the book and the dog . Very cute !
5 #### my granddaughter loved this new pet but it needs clothes she said lol
5 #### The Elf on the Shelf pets are adorable . We already have the reindeer for my daughter . Now , we purchased this for our son , so they each have a pet they can touch and cuddle with . The story books are really sweet and they are a great bedtime read during the Christmas season . I love that the books are hardbound and have wonderful illustrations . They really capture my kids ' attention , and that 's hard to do with my 2 year old . The story lines include a wonderful meaning of Christmas magic and cheer . My kids look forward to the animals " appearing " on Black Friday ( when we traditionally put up all of our Christmas decor and Christmas tree ) and miss them on Christmas morning since they " fly back to the North Pole on Christmas Eve to help Santa . "
5 #### My husband was annoyed that I bought this pet too but once you read the story , that all changed . It 's really a wonderful message and I hope he helps my kids do more good things in the world .
5 #### Great product for those families that are into the Elf on the Shelf tradition . It allows the children to have a toy to hug and cuddle and touch and sleep with , but does not change the magic of the Elf . It also comes with a storybook that the kids can enjoy the quality is wonderful and the kids love it .
4 #### My kids LOVE The Elf on the Shelf and have had them since 2008 ! We currently have 4 elves and 2 reindeer so of course when these came out we had to have them ! I 'm not sure why they are $ 25 when the reindeer were priced at $ 20 . They 're pricey but everything that is this brand is expensive . While they are adorable , they are n't very well made considering the insane price that they are . It 's almost impossible to get a discount on them at any store , this year Kohl 's made it so that their coupons do n't work on anything of this brand . Almost no point in shopping around since you 'll pay $ 25 everywhere . So back to them being not very well made ... I had ordered two of these from Amazon and noticed they had very crooked facial features . After noticing this I checked several of the local stores and found it almost impossible to find * perfect * or as close as possible dogs . I remember having this issue with the the reindeer when we bought them but this was much worse with the dogs as they have a plastic nose and fabric tongue . I know I sound like I 'm being picky and stuck up but again , $ 25 for a very small stuffed animal and book is steep when it 's not a quality made item . I have n't seen any issues with the elves , but the reindeer and dogs are hard to find with near perfect faces !
5 #### My Grand - Daughter loves this , even at ten years old !
5 #### We already have two elves , the reindeer , and the birthday kit so when we saw this at the store we had to get it . I 'm so glad I got it though , he is incredibly soft , and feels like he is of good quality , the storybook is beautifully illustrated as well . A great little addition to our Elf on the Shelf collection .
4 #### Very good product for the price . Was just as described but after I bought this one I realized the tile was n't big enough
5 #### So cute , love item , love mickey + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + A A A A A A A A A
5 #### These little things were fun . we just had a birthday party for my son ( mickey themed , of course ) and we started buying just about everything and anything with mickey 's face on it ... if the price was right , of course . These things fit the bill . Was n't sure what I would use them for , but got them anyway . I ended up giving them to the people with iphones / ipads , etc . and everyone loved them . I put one on my phone too actually ... and this was at the beginning of the month ( now the 22nd ) and it 's still holding steady !
4 #### Bought these because my daughter loves Mickey Mouse . They 're super cute and colorful . They go on easily , and stay on .
5 #### No more pieces moving all over the place . It 's a little smaller but that 's okay because it works much better .
3 #### Pieces a lot smaller than standard size pieces and can be difficult to place in the slots so it locks in place
5 #### I love Mickey Mouse and so does most of my friends . I have had this on multiple products and it has stuck on them all and has not tried to come off . Everyone I have gave one to loves it .
5 #### These came before expected and I love them . They are very cute and stick on very good . Also they were easy to place on my ipod .
3 #### Much smaller than expected . Much smaller than the original board game .
3 #### Looks and feels really cheap . Its a light plastic and has the sense of a small travel scrabble ...
5 #### Tile lock is so useful--- makes it much more difficult for your boyfriend to try to move pieces around while you 're refilling drinks in the kitchen . ;)
1 #### Small , cheap and a waste of money . This is maybe good for a dorm room or a car ride or any other place that you are very limited on space . The quality was very disappointing . The rules are light , cheap and despite the " tile lock , " the tiles still do not fall into place very easily . You get what you pay for . If you want a nice game , spend more money and do n't buy this one .
4 #### Scrabble board is very light weight . Easy to bump and mix up tiles , makes it hard to move the tiles around on the board . Still works fine and is a fun game !
3 #### Nothing against scrabble , as this was my first time ever purchasing a scrabble board . I went with this one since I 've heard stories of epic games being ruined by all the pieces sliding off the board . The lock system is a nice feature . Keep in mind that the lock keeps the pieces in place if the board gets bumped or moved . If a sore sport decides to capsize the board , the pieces will still " unlock " . My only gripe is that everything , EVERYTHING is plastic . I personally am not a fan of plastic , and for those wanting the nostalgia of the cardboard board , this will not be the board for you .
5 #### Good game for any child the tile lock keeps the tiles in place if anyone hits board by accident .
5 #### We love playing Scrabble , and this one is great . It keeps the tiles from sliding around , which is great when rotating the board and playing with kids .
5 #### Love this game and the tiles stay in place with this set .
1 #### I ca n't believe how CHEAP this thing is . So disappointed ... and it 's SO overpriced . And the tiles do n't even " lock" ... its so poorly designed ... doesnt even accomplish what I bought it for .
3 #### This tiles in this set are a bit small to manage but fortunately are easy to read . The box we received has an error near the bottom of the game board ( right side ) . It has an extra triple word score that should be a triple letter score . Not sure if this is a knockoff game and the error is intentional . We noticed that the box top shows the same error . If not corrected in later productions , buyer beware .
5 #### Love it . I still have a 15x15 rotate board from the 80 's , and it just takes up too much table space . ( 21 inch diagonal rotate arc ) This is the perfect size . The letters fit just fine ( dimpled corners on pegs ) and stay put . Sure , they will come loose if you shake the board like an etch - a - sketch , Yes , it is plastic so do n't use it as an ottoman or set the baby on it to play , or smack it cause you lost a game ;)
5 #### Our family loved this game . Not too big , not too small
5 #### I would have given this game 3 stars because I must admit to how I feel each star represent how you truly feel and I felt like one little thing I did n't like should n't be the star given just based off that . So now let me explain what I mean . The game is a lot smaller than I actually thought I must admit I did n't read the full description like I normally do when I purchase things online to avoid problems like the one I have concerning this game . Yes it is a tile lock just like the description says it is but Like I said its small , the board .... the tiles and even the stand for the tiles seem to be smaller than the original game . I had to go back to look at the box to make sure this was n't some Junior version to the game like they have for monopoly . That seem to be my only problem I have with the game board other than that it definitely is a tile lock no more of the tiles scattering when we try to make a word . Would I recommend this product yes but beware it is small .
5 #### Much better than the original game board . Having the tiles lock onto the board , makes it much better .
4 #### Not having read the details closer , I did n't realize this was a smaller version of the standard Scrabble game . I find that I actually like this one though . It takes up less space on the table , yet the tiles and board are not so small that they are hard to read . The board fits right in the box , about 12 inches square , so there is no need to fold and unfold the board . The box fits perfectly in the cubby cupboards that are popular right now . It is also small enough to take along on family vacations to help fill in the " downtime . " The tiles are of good quality plastic ; the days of wooden tiles are on their way out , I fear . The tiles are kept in place with little knobs at the corners on each square on the board . It is actually quite an effective way to keep the tiles in place if the board gets bumped . I recommend this new age scrabble board .
5 #### i love scrabble and this version with the tile lock is hard to find
5 #### I wish the tiles were still wood ( like the older versions ) but I 'd give up the wood for the easy locking tiles . They makes playing and keeping things in place way easier !
5 #### I love it ! It 's portable , light - weight , and the tiles lock in - place so it 's not a disaster when someone bumps the board or table .
5 #### the locking tile board is the reason I bought this . the tiles do n't get bumped out of their spot if the board is moved .
4 #### It 's scrabble it has all the pieces which is all I asked for . This delivered
2 #### Scrabble it is ... locking tiles it is n't . I guess I did n't catch the other review(s ) saying the same thing . Essentially it 's good if you 're playing on the couch or some unstable surface ... but I do n't know that it would qualify as a " travel " version . The description clearly states it 's ideal for playing scrabble in the car , plane , train , etc . -- if the tiles were magnetic and the board folded , yes it would be perfect travel edition . If the tiles actually locked in place , it would be an ideal travel board . As it is -- the locking tiles allow you to tilt the board at various angles ( but not far past 45 lest the tiles start falling out ) . Only other minor gripe is the drawstring bag is a little skimpy if you also plan to put the tile holders ( red long rectangles ) in with the tiles .... it 's literally 1/4 " too short to safely secure everything . I would n't trust it with my kids packing it up ... unless they put the pouch in a ziplock .
5 #### My kids loved this ! It 's a great educational tool and the tiles stay on the board easier !
5 #### Very happy with the set , nice quality for the price .
5 #### Love the tile lock feature ! My husband and I will play this game on our bed and the tiles do n't move ! It 's awesome !
4 #### This is classic scrabble with somewhat - locking tiles , so when the cat walks across the table the game is not destroyed . The concept is great , the execution is not perfect . It can be hard to put pieces in , as the " locks " are at the corners . A much better design would have been a snap - in raised center , leaving the corners open . But it works more or less as advertised , I am happy with this product .
5 #### Christmas present . was played with and it worked great !
3 #### This scrabble board is about 1/3 smaller than a standard board and the pieces are a very smooth plastic making them near impossible to pick up . they do n't " snap " in place or even " lock " they just have dents in them so they fit between the pegs . if someone bumps the table they 're rock solid , but they 're loosely held in by gravity . Nothing special . the plastic boards with little pockets for the pieces and wooden tiles are much better .
5 #### Fun game , a little cheaper made than I thought and the pieces are hard to put in the spaces . It is still fun and worth the cost I bought it for .
1 #### This is a tiny board ! It should be advertised as travel size . There are four red posts that separate each tile , and many of mine arrived on the board crooked . It 's flimsy , too . I should have looked at the dimensions . I liked that it was ' tile lock , ' but this is really nothing special . The plastic tiles are super , super cheap looking . Look elsewhere .
2 #### I purchased this thinking it would do as the box states and hold the tiles in place . It does n't . Every time you attempt to lay down a new word the existing tiles on the board " buckle " up and pop around making every move tedious and time consuming as it takes small fingers to places the tiles back perfectly . Please see pictures I have included . The tiles are plastic and the letters are n't centered which is not a big deal to me . However when playing the first word , Gone as soon as I laid down the O the G popped up . When fixing the G the O popped out . The pictures will show what I mean . I wish I had n't been cheap and would have ordered the Deluxe Scrabble with wooden tiles and the elevated plastic tile lock board . This is n't worth the money . It 's not even a step up from the flat board that does n't hold the tiles , as this is a constant game of popping tiles back in that have already been played .
5 #### It is a smaller game board but I love it because the tiles stay in place like it says
5 #### Playing Scrabble with my grandchildren is great fun but at times can be frustrating because of 6 children bumping the board and having to reset the tiles . This is no longer an issue with this game , the tiles lock into place . Accidents can still happen but not like they used to . I think its great .
4 #### Tile lock is actually really annoying unless you are playing in a car . It makes cleanup harder because the pieces stick to the board , so when you turn it upright to have them fall , they stay on and eventually can fall pretty far away from the board . I wish I had just bought the classic board so they could slide off easily at the end of a game . Like I said , good for cars , or people with Parkinson 's ...
5 #### this game and the box it came in is smaller than the typical board , as are the tiles . This means less storage space and also that when we leave a game and come back to it we need less space to put the incomplete game . the board isin one piece and does nt fold , and that combined with the locking tiles makes it perfect for long running games and thus perfect for my needs . and the price was great . i am pleased with my purchase !
5 #### Once you have used the tile lock board the old version just wo n't due . Love it
5 #### Christmas gift for one of my 5 kids ... probably one of 3 teenagers will get this one ... they need more board games so each get a different one for christmas ... love their family game days .
5 #### Love scrabble and love this board . It 's great when you and the group have a few drinks and folks are n't quite so easy on the board haha ! That was the whole reason I bought this one . It 's great ! Good for kids too , with the stationary pieces :)
5 #### Been playing scrabble for years . Love this version and wish I had one like it as a kid or in my drinking days !
4 #### It 's a little smaller than a normal scrabble board , but it works well , no more sliding tiles ! I could n't go back !
2 #### Board is tiny and made with light plastic parts and a thin board , suitable for travel I guess but not for regular play . Pieces are tiny - board measures only 10.25 " , 14 " on the diagonal . What saves this from 1 start s that the board is printed correctly , unlike another reviewers board .
5 #### I did n't read carefully enough . It 's a mini set , smaller than the original , but it works fine .
3 #### This is not a full size game , which actually made packing it for travel nice , quality of product is nice , can see it lasting for years . The KNOBS That Hold Tile Pieces To Board Are DIFFUCULT To Get Tiles ALINGED Correctly BUT SOMEONE with good eye hand coordination might do better ,
1 #### I am sorry I purchased the Tile Lock Scrabble game . The differences between the original game board and this one are : the board is a lot smaller , the letters are plastic , the letter holders are plastic and if you have medium to large fingers you will have difficulty placing the letters onto the board . Not only did I pay for the game , I also paid S & H. Shame on me . I am glad I still have my original game . I will not return the product since I would have to pay the S & H again . Janet
4 #### Keeps tiles in place so you can move the board without a problem , I just wish the letters where bigger , a little smaller than my traditional scrabble board game .
5 #### I like the game and the tile lock system is nice when we moe the board around .
2 #### Not what I expected . The pieces are flimsy and move around too easily . Instead of channels , there are dots on all the corners of the spaces to keep the tiles in place . Flimsy .
5 #### Gift for my good friends . They loved it . Sat right down & played several games ,
5 #### This was purchased by our SGA for the students to play .
2 #### Very small . I was hoping it would swivel . Guess I should have done my homework ? ?
5 #### This is a great version of scrabble - tiles do n't slide around , and they stay perfectly lined up .
3 #### I probably should of read the description a little closer but the board is n't as big as I was expecting and the tiles are plastic . It will work and nothing is wrong with it just remembering the older version must be !
5 #### Easy for all ages to play . Board is not too big , so games go fast !
3 #### This scrabble game is ok . The tiles " lock " into place by fitting in between small pegs on the board . I thought they would snap into place and stay , but they do not . If the board is moved too much or turned over , the tiles would be lost . The board is pretty small , I thought it was going to be much bigger . Next time I am going to buy a bigger board to that there is more room to play . I would probably not recommend this product , there are better options out there .
5 #### Bought it as a gift . Have tried one similar and it was great .
5 #### My grandson loves Scrabble . He will be very happy Christmas morning .
4 #### This is the perfect size for traveling . Unfortunately the tiles do n't lock as securely as I hoped so if the table is bumped , they will still move . That said , it 's great to be able to take Scrabble along when traveling and having a set that 's easy to clean if there are spills . This will provide hours of family fun when traveling . I recommend this !
4 #### The board is smaller than the regular game . The tiles smaller as well . But it works well . They are n't going to hang tight on to the board in the back seat of a minivan rolling down the interstate -- the tile lock is not tight . But it would keep letters from flying everywhere when someone jostles the board .
4 #### I think it is a good idea to have some sort of a device to lock the Scrabble tiles in place . Winning Moves did it by placing small posts on every corner / intersection on the board . It does n't lock it in a way that you can invert the board and the tiles remain attached like a gecko on the ceiling , but you can tilt in an angle or slightly nudge the board sideways but never bump it from the bottom or the tiles will fly everywhere . I think Scrabble boards should spin like Lazy Susan but that is not always possible unless you get the more expensive boards . The Tile Lock Scrabble at least spin better with the tiles staying in place when someone else 's turn . This is a budget Scrabble set , you can tell by the price ( around 15 $ at the time of this review ) that it is a basic set . Made mostly of plastics . The board is about 25 % smaller and does n't fold .
4 #### I am a Scrabble player , and have seen variations of Scrabble games for various transportable and convenient purposes . What is nice about this is the compact size , and yes , smaller than a regular size board . There are small beads that keep a tile secure as you place them for playing . This makes it easy to work with even if your board gets tipped . This is a nice portable size , great for the car , taking to someone 's home , to the office , etc . And , again , that is because of the size . The only downside to this is there is no protection for the tiles on the plastic holders . If you go through the trouble of placing beads to hold the tiles in place , what about the tile racks ? The tile racks could use some security , as for now , there is none . And , basically , this means that if you are in the car playing with a friend , your board is secure , but your racks are not . Other than that , this is nice and convenient for portability ...... Rizzo
3 #### This game was n't all I was expecting . It does seem a bit on the cheap side , and I was hoping for tiles that actually locked together somehow . But we have n't had any complaints using it . I actually like that the tiles are plastic and easy to clean , since I have lots of little ones running around . The pegs in each corner of each square do help make the tiles a little more stable , and the board has held up just fine . I was considering giving this as a gift , but I think the " not fantastic " quality would have made it a bit tacky for a gift . This set has been perfectly fine for teaching my kids , though .
5 #### Excellent upgrade for a great game . This is a Scrabble game , same as a regular one , with the addition of tabs that keep the tiles from accidentally ( or sneakily ) moving around the board . Once you put the tile down , it stays put until you pick it up . Not much you can do to a a Scrabble game to improve it from what it is , but this is a welcome improvement .
5 #### Every family needs a " Tile Lock Scrabble"--even if they already own the old version of the game . The tile lock feature is very intuitive , but , at the same time , it makes all the difference for those playing the game . The tile lock feature keeps the roles from sliding on the board . So if you accidentally bump the board or want to hold it at an angle to visualize it differently , the tiles wo n't go sliding around . This feature is worth its weight in gold if you have a youngster in the house who 's prone to bumping the board . The plastic tile racks also help hold the tiles so they do n't fall as easily . The game box advertises that this game design works well for travel , but , honestly , it 's also great for having at home . I did n't talk much about the game during this review , because everyone enjoys playing Scrabble . It 's almost a right of passage to play Scrabble as a child . And many also enjoy it well into adulthood . In fact , once one can read well enough to play Scrabble , it almost becomes more enjoyable over the years . I highly recommend this game as a gift for someone else or even yourself . You wo n't regret it !
3 #### Tile Lock Scrabble is a portable take on the classic board game . The board is shrunken to 11x11 inches ( compared to the traditional 14x14 ) and is a solid piece of plastic instead of a folding piece of cardboard . There are small rubber feet to help keep the board from sliding around . Because the board is rigid , you can support It on your knee or on an uneven surface . To help with the portability , this board features tiles that are held in place by small posts all throughout the board . This is what they refer to as the " tile lock " . Once a tile is in place , any lateral movement of the board wo n't cause it to move out of place . A major problem with this design , and the reason that I give this product three stars , is that if you bump the board up and down , the tiles still go flying . They are only held down by gravity . The board comes with four plastic tile pews . Overall , I found the small 11x11 size with the small plastic tiles difficult to get used to . The tiles are smaller than a traditional scrabble board and a bit slippery . Because of their shrunken size , my adult - sized fingers fumble with them a lot . Unless I was using this in a motorhome or somewhere without a table , I 'd probably opt for the full - sized game and not worry about the tile lock capability .
4 #### I would have gone one step further and have the tiles snap into place instead of just resting between the pegs . That would make little brother attacks less damaging :) The tiles are a bit more difficult to handle due to their reduced size but nothing terrible . The tile racks work well enough on a nice flat surface but will tilt over fairly easily on anything else .
3 #### Seems cheaply made compared to other Scrabble sets I 've owned . I will have to say it is great for putting in the camper and taking it along on our trips . Bring a small dictionary for disputes as some areas do n't have cell phone coverage to look things up when you go camping . It is small , the tiles do not slide around as much as they would on a regular board , though I would not say they actually locked . If the board it tipped they will fall off . Tiles are smaller and it makes them a bit harder to manipulate .
4 #### It 's been a while since I played Scrabble , but I do remember the frustration of trying to keep tiles in place ! I played this with my niece the other day and I was surprised at how small the tiles were . I 'm not sure how they compare to regular Scrabble pieces , but they seem TINY to me ! Other than that , the tile locks do exactly what they say and even my parents thought it was a pretty cool feature . Great to have a new spin on an old classic !
5 #### Ever bumped a Scrabble game in progress and then argued for an hour over where the tiles were originally ? That wo n't happen with this innovative product . Note : The tiles are surrounded by four pegs , not locked in so if the board gets slammed or flipped over , the game state will be lost , but the occasional accidental bump will not affect it .
4 #### We like our Tile Lock Scrabble ! This is our first adult version since purchasing the Junior Scrabble for kids . First off , we never owned the original deluxe version so I could n't compare the two , but obviously you can pay more for that type of quality . The plastic tiles are easy to use and like the compact size of the board . The whole box is lightweight for the convenience of travel . Although I would not recommend this for kids in a moving vehicle unless its an RV . Overall , we have enjoyed this Tile Lock Scrabble because its fun to play and easy to use !
3 #### Scrabble is a great classic game that never seems to get old . I have younger kids and it does make it easier for them to set tiles and not knock out other tiles with this set . It is a bit disappointing that this set is made up of so much plastic which makes it feel a bit cheap . This one is about the same price as a " standard " scrabble set that gives you wooden tiles and holders but a basic playing board . I would skip both and get the current " Deluxe " edition for about 10 bucks more that has wooden tiles and holders and a plastic board with tile holders and spins . I got one way back when it was still Milton - Bradley and we still use it .
4 #### This will be a down and dirty review . First of all the board is very small . It is for traveling and you can not really have a full size board when you are traveling around . It is about 10 or so inches by 10 inches big . This is small and the words on the board are small . Second , the tiles to not lock per say , they fit very well and unless you hit a pothole the pieces should stay in . Finally , the pieces are small , as in probably no more then 1/3 and inch by 1/3 and inch . This is scrabble and it is a fun game . Unless you are getting this for traveling then I would suggest a bigger game .
4 #### I loved the concept of this newest scrabble version . The tile game board is great and keeps your game from getting messed up if you accidentally push the board around . My only comment is that I wished the tiles actually locked in , as the name suggests , really the game board just sets the tile in place , it does n't actually " lock " in . I was hoping that the tiles would snap in place but besides that the board is more secure than previous versions .
3 #### My extended family loves Scrabble and it is played at most every get together . They are the types that take it pretty seriously and even have the Scrabble Players Dictionary to settle word play disagreements . Myself though , I play games for fun and while competition is good , I do n't take it nearly as serious as they do . This Tile Lock Scrabble is my 3rd Scrabble Game . I also own the Scrabble Deluxe Edition and the Game Folio Scrabble . The one thing that each of these versions have in common is that the tiles are meant to not slide around by way of some alteration to the board . With the Deluxe version the tile spaces are recessed , with the Folio the tiles snap in and with this version the tiles are supposed to lock and while they do click in , lock is not what I 'd call it . So if you are looking for one that can take a bit of movement and jostling , keep looking beyond this version . Overall the set is very similar in price to the Game Folio which is meant for traveling and the tiles snap in much better on that version , but for me I still find my preferred set is the Deluxe .
4 #### This is a nice Scrabble set overall , but it 's not a luxury version . The board is lightweight plastic and measures about 11 x 11 inches . Each tile has four little plastic pegs that hold the tiles in place and keep them from sliding around . The pieces are plastic and come in a little bag . I would say the main market for this product lies with people who want it for traveling or transporting . It would be great to use in an RV , where you want a board that is small and easy to store , but which also can keep the tiles from sliding around . It would also be a good version for kids owing to the low price and relatively simple design . If you are looking for a luxury set , you better keep looking . Overall , though , this product comes as advertised and is a nice addition to my collection of Scrabble boards .
5 #### I am a huge Scrabble fan and this game is something I would have loved to have ages ago . The locking tiles make it easy to play anywhere ! We even used this one on a picnic making it easy to play on the ground ( which is often uneven ) without worrying about the tiles sliding around or falling off . This would have come in handy when I used to play Scrabble in the hospital , we would frequently have to move the game board for the nurses to do assessments and tiles would come off and sometimes ruin our games . This is a great feature to have and I just wish that the board collapsed and contained the trays and letters .
2 #### I never played many board games when I was younger , but one that I always wanted to try out was Scrabble . This Tile Lock version is the first time I 've played it and if anything , it makes me want to give the basic version a shot . The board is tiny , the locking feature does n't work , and maybe it 's just me but there does n't seem to be enough letter blocks if you want to play with more than one other person . Playing the game is fun and all , it 's just weird that this is billed as a locking version when the feature barely works . If you even barely bump into the table the board rests on , pieces will move . I ca n't imagine playing this in the car unless you were on a long stretch of smooth road with zero bumps or rocks of any kind . This is one that we wo n't be playing much in the future , and I plan on getting a standard Scrabble since it ca n't be any worse than this . The game itself is fun , not the presentation .
4 #### I think the name of this product is very misleading . In no way do the tiles actually lock into place . Instead there are 4 little pegs that stand up at the edges of each spot on the ( plastic ) board that are supposed to help keep the tile in place . The pegs do achieve this if you tilt the board a little bit or if you just want to slide it do someone else can view it easier ( not read upside down ) . They do not achieve any kind of helpfulness if the board is knocked against or bumped roughly . The tiles will go spilling . All parts of this game are plastic - which with kids is kind of nice - I can wash them ! But I do kind of miss those wooden letters - but maybe I 'm just old school . The board itself is smaller than a normal board - it measures 10 " x 10 " . There are 100 letter tiles , 4 plastic tile racks , and tile bag included with game board . Overall my kids and I enjoy both using this board for education purposes ( they spell their spelling words on it ) and for an actual fun game of scrabble . I just wish the tiles actually locked into place . Seems like a simple adjustment to the design could have achieved this .
3 #### I gave this to my grand daughter who needed something for the summer months . It is kind of small and the pieces do not stay in place . Maybe some with magnets would work better next time .
5 #### The tile lock addition makes this a lot easier to use . You do n't have to worry about tiles going all over the place , it is a great buy !
5 #### This is a good version for the kids . The plastic locking pieces keep the game board from being shuffled or sliding if kids get to excited .
5 #### Ca nt tell you to much about the game as I gave it as a gift . They seemed like they were thrilled with it . It did come quickly and was well packaged there was no damaged to the box . I would buy from this dealer again as it was a good transaction
5 #### Great scrabble game - not overly large , but big enough . Tiles stay in place well . We really enjoy using it .
1 #### This game is too cheaply made to be recommended to anyone , kids or adults . But again , " you get what you pay for " .
4 #### My husband loves to play scrabble , but we both insist on turning the board to face us when playing our turn nad we kept jittering the board and screwing up the pieces . The tile lock feature works well and we are quite pleased . Our only complaint is tha the board and pieces are smaller than our traditional board . While still perfectly readable - to get 5 stars the board and pieces should be bigger . Also I was under the impression from the description that the board would be felt backed to help it slide smoothly to face the different players . There are just four rubber feet , they work , but a full felt backing would work better .
5 #### Always played scrabble when I was young and now I can play with my grand children to teach them the game and have hours of fun with them .
4 #### My kids are always bugging me to play words with friends on my computer , now we can all play , any time ! The tiles do n't so much as " Lock " into place as they are ' held ' by teeny posts . if the board is bumped the tiles will still go off the board . But it still plays great and the kids really like it . I 'll have to keep playing and beating them , I 'm sure they 'll be beating me soon enough !
4 #### It tells you so in the description , but it 's still smaller than I expected . Still works great and tons of fun though !
4 #### Wanted since long ago finally I purchased a set . Have not played with it yet but at first sight looks what I was looking for , good quality material , box and I anticipate lots of fun hours of playing with it .
3 #### For some reason I was expecting something closer to a travel version of Scrabble , with a ridge around all edges of the squares . Alas , there are only little bumps at the corners . So the tiles are still very , very easily knocked out of place . Since I bought this for my daughters ' use , it 's a big deal for me . The tiles themselves are thin plastic and feel flimsy . In fact , the whole thing is very cheaply made . For the price it 's OK , but barely .
5 #### This is absolutely perfect . It is even much nicer and better looking than what I expected . Great for travel or just sitting out at the picnic table .
5 #### Bought this for family fun night . My 8 year old is having a wonderful time working on his spelling and we are having a wonderful time playing the game . Love that the pieces do n't slide all over .
4 #### The product was exactly as discribed and pictured . Arrived quickly and has been an exellent addition to our game collection .
3 #### I love this game and am now teaching it to my young granddaughters who also love it . My oroblem with it is that the board is so much smaller and I really it when it had wooden pieces . Still a great game ... just kinda cheap now .
4 #### A fun traditional Klutz project kit . Book and cover warm somewhat which takes away from the quality feel .
5 #### This is a great little craft / journal . It comes with lots of little stickers to add flair . The stuff you put on it is like frosting that hardens and looks very neat . It holds up very well once it 's dry . The journal is a good little journal for writing . My daughter ( 6 years old ) really enjoyed creating it and was able to do it by herself . Overall , it 's a great way to have a craft and journal .
4 #### If your daughter spends all her money on tchotkes at the Scholastic Book Fair , then she will LOVE , LOVE , LOVE this journal . My 7 year old made an absolute mess of the puff paint frosting , but a more focused or mature child / teen could really make it happen . Of course , my 7 year old plopped down the stickers and then puff painted around them instead of pressing the stickers into the puff paint . Following directions would be helpful to get the look on the cover of the journal . But the beauty is that my 7 year old could have cared less because SHE made it and then SHE wrote in it . The page prompts are fun , but the highlight is definitely in the decorating at the beginning .
4 #### This is very cute ! Definitely geared towards older girls as it 's more of an activity book than a journal . There 's a lot of surveys and questionnaires and artsy activities for them to do , more of a fill in diary . The decorating is a lot of fun but it 's messy and takes a long time to dry . My daughter 's favorite part were the charms . It definitely keeps them entertained and it 's a fun keepsake for them when they get older !
5 #### My daughter enjoyed decorating this journal . It comes with a tube of puffy paste " frosting " with a decorative rosette tip . It also has very detailed instructions on how to pipe the puffy paste into rosettes or shells and how to apply the charms . I suggest practicing on a piece of cardboard to get the technique down before decorating the journal . We had a few mishaps and had to wipe the journal off and start over . Once applied , there are a multitude of stickers , jewels and charms that can be pressed into the wet frosting . The puffy paste dries firm , but just to be safe , she displays her journal on a stand so it does n't get damaged . She 's eleven , and she ended up with the paste everywhere and it 's not water soluble . A magic eraser took it right off though . In hindsight , putting down newspaper would have been a good idea . The journal is more of a guided activity book instead of a free form journal . There are quizzes and questionnaires , and lists to complete . It 's a very sweet little book and would make a great gift .
5 #### This was an odd kit . The journal is very high quality , heavy , glossy paper . The covers are thick and sturdy . The bizarre pink stuff is also very consistent and easy to design with . The charms and stickers are also lovely . This is exactly the quality I expect from Klutz . But . It 's more of an activity book than a journal proper . Most of the pages have things to do on them , which is cool , but it 's not a diary , which was what my daughter expected . The pages are also glossy , so more than half the pens in the house wo n't write properly on them . My daughter loved the stickers more than the charms and puffy paste but definitely enjoyed embellishing with the paste .
4 #### My 11 year old loved this . She is into crafts big time and she also likes to keep a diary . When she saw this , she got very excited and could n't wait to get started on it . She had a blast decorating it and loved the fake frosting .
5 #### Little girls love journals and what better than to have a journal they can decorate any way they want . This is more of an activity book , not a journal . Each page has a different activity to be performed . It comes with puffy paste , rhinestones , charms , and stickers that can be glued throughout the journal or on the outside cover . It provides hours of fun and allows the child to use their own imagination and decorate the journal anyway he / she desires . Highly recommend this product .
5 #### My daughter was so thrilled to get this cute and creative set . She gets to do crafts and write down her thoughts all in one place .
3 #### My 5 yr old loves Shopkins and she did like this item , but it was kind of annoying to have to sharpen all of the pencils .
5 #### My daughter loves loves loves this adorable book ! And as a nice added bonus , because doctor is mentioned repeatedly in the book , she no longer is afraid of the doctor ! Apparently she thinks of the silly monkeys every time we go to the doctor now , and instead of hiding , she now talks to the doctor about all the silly monkeys ! This is a fun book to read , we truly enjoy it and my husband and I take turns reading it to her . If it is still in one piece by the time our son is old enough to enjoy it , we 'll be reading it to him as well . I highly recommend this book !
5 #### My son loves this book and reads it every night . I wish the lines across the page that the trucks move along were longer
5 #### Second one I 've purchased , our older son loved it so much we bought it again for our new baby :) Made well , nice and sturdy
5 #### Bought for a 2 year old for her birthday . Fun spin on 5 little monkeys
3 #### The story is not what we expected . They are silly but some of the things they do are against the rules completely in our house ( like eating in bed ) . The conclusion also encourages kids to jump on the sofa which is also a no - no in our house . My daughter likes the book but I wish I would have had a better idea of the content prior to purchasing the book .
4 #### My son loves the book . He knows the " little monkeys song " and he got so excited when he opened the book .
5 #### Grandson loves this book . A must for little boys .
5 #### This is such a great book . I ordered one for my house and one for my grandson who lived in Hawaii . We had so much fun reading it the month we were there that I went home and copied the pages and pasted them in a recordable book that I did n't like . It covered the pages except for the holes that have to be open in order to record and it looked really great . Our grandson had a great time listening to it .
3 #### I have a 9 month old who will patiently sit through 10 books but does n't care for the repetition of this one ( no matter how many silly voices I use to read it ) . He does like to touch the monkey faces and drum on the cover . Maybe he will like it more when he is older ? I also thought the quality would be closer to " Ten Rubber Duckies " by Dawn Bentley . Not so much . Some of the monkey heads are actually misaligned with the cut - outs , so parts of their faces are covered .
3 #### I bought this for my granddaughter who was just a little over a year old , she is 2 now and does n't care to really want it read to her anymore , I bought other books that she interacts with .. for example " let 's say our colors " and noisy zoo she loves them and still plays with them but not this one The monkeys are just a hard plastic face and she just does n't care for it anymore .. she loves books and always wants to be read to but for some reason she never grabs this book for us to read
5 #### This book has always been a favorite in our household with our two daughters ( now ages 3 and 6 ) . They both grew up with this book and it made for a great introduction to numbers and counting . The book consists of little plastic monkey faces showing through holes in each page . As you turn each page , one face stays back on the previous page so that the count of monkeys goes down . The story flows with the decrease in monkey faces as they monkeys do something silly that they are n't supposed to do and fall off the bed ... until there are none left . My 3 year old still chooses this book pretty regularly for her bedtime story even though she already knows her counting . She thinks it 's a funny story and we regularly tell them to " stop messing around on the beds so they do n't fall off and bump their heads . " It is a great introduction to counting for your little ones . Highly Recommended !
5 #### My 14 month old son absolutely loves this book . My wife and I read it to him multiple times a day . He loves touching the monkey heads and the repetition . He book seeks out the book and has a motion to indicate that he wants this specific book !
5 #### Love these books- my nephew has a few of them already and I ca n't wait to give him this one for our Thanksgiving road trip this year !
5 #### Giant is an understatement . My daughters love to color and this allows them to work on pictures side by side !
3 #### This Coloring book is nice but I definitely do n't think it 'd worth the $ 10 . I was surprised it only comes wth 1 page of stickers ! ! ! I thought it would be at least more . Like I said it 's alright .... nothing special .
5 #### Purchased a bunch of items so that our daughter has some things to do while in the hospital after surgery . Came very well packaged and nothing was bent ! Love it ! !
5 #### I bought this as a present for my daughters 11th birthday . According to my daughter she really likes the book and activities . My daughter loves art , drawing , and coloring and she said she really likes everything about this particular coloring and activity pad .
1 #### This is NOT overpriced , & to another reviewer , it 's written ' $ 5 ' or ' $ 5.00 ' , NOT ' 5 $ ' ! This should have more stickers & less coloring pages .
5 #### My 5yr old granddaughter will be thrilled ! Got it on time for her birthday box and book has lots of activities ! Good deal for the price too
5 #### Great coloring book for new children beginning to color .
5 #### I enjoy playing it . Seeing the art in the cards make it fun
3 #### Its a good game but one will have to make sure they are enough people to play and they are fairly even in competive ability . Meaning a mixed group of adults and young kids would not be fun . Also for non fantasy fans it will take a bit of explaining and the game is very esoteric and is very honed on a small audience . It 's probably not going to be a big hit w a lot of people , unless perhaps at a convention . If though one can find a group it will more then likely take several sessions of bumbling around w the rules to get the full grasp of the game . A lot of it is based on subtrafuge that goes undetected , though after a round or two it becomes obvious who does what . It would be hard to pull off shifting alliances and the like for most players until a high level of understanding of the game is achieved as the game has multiple goals at once going on .
3 #### we are big gamers but there is too much reading and math compared to the other games we play . we ended up getting rid of it .
4 #### Great classic game . A little longer to play but still good .
1 #### We have never returned a game - except this one . No one wanted to go through the trouble of figuring it out . Our group regularly plays popular " new " boardgames ... with lengthy rules but this was tooo much .
5 #### I have one of the older sets , this set , and the CCG . This one is my favorite because I did n't like the CCG much at all but I loved some of the cards in it . This is an expanded updated version of the original that includes some of the CCG cards . It 's a turn based game , everyone has their base illuminati card , and each card is working towards a different goal . Whoever reaches their goal first wins . Each card has specific alignments and powers to attack other cards and a roll of dice determines how successful your attack was . It 's complicated and needs at least 3 players , preferably 4 or 5 for maximum fun . Hopefully people who are good friends with each other . Strategy , luck and alliances are all important in this game . Some people wo n't like it much , there are a lot of things to keep track of so you may have to really look for people to play the game with .
4 #### They go pretty fast -- but the kids really enjoy using these after they 've been using the pattern blocks for a while . I just wish more came in a pkg .
5 #### Lots of stickers for making pictures . Good for primary children as they work with pattern blocks .
5 #### We are actually using these for our elementary homeschool Art class when I teach about mosaics / tesselations in Islamic Art . I know the kids will enjoy using the extras for other craft projects .
5 #### Really fun for my kids . My son was learning about 2 - D shapes in school , so I got these . He placed the shapes together to make pictures . My 5 year old , who I intended it for , and his sister loved using these . It occupied them for more than an hour . I put the extras away for a rainy , inside day , when they can enjoy them again .
4 #### They did n't quite stick as well as I thought . But it did the job .
5 #### Got ta love Klutz products ! So much fun with this one !
5 #### Was a gift for granddaughter and she loved it !
5 #### Very cool book ! I bought this for my preteen and she loves it ! It shows a lot of neat ways to write and decorate letters that I had never thought of before .
5 #### This is another Klutz success . We seem to love all of their books . This one has the markers you can see attached on the outside , a few plastic stencils inside , lots of pages showing examples and ides and then blank pages to write on . The markers are n't artist quality but perfect for what is needed for the projects include . This makes a really cute gift idea for kids parties !
1 #### Totally Used Book ! There was actually someones Bic pen and some pencils in the pouch , writing all throughout , not too happy . Only thankful I had it mailed to myself first .
5 #### My granddaughter loved this . She very artistic . This has improved her writing skill and is fun . Bought this when she was 8 , she still uses it .
5 #### My 9 year old daughter has absolutely loved this book . She has spent hours re - creating the lettering . It 's great for this age group , I do n't think anyone younger would appreciate it because most of the lettering is quite intricate . Great book !
5 #### This is our second purchase of this lettering book . The results are remarkable ! Klutz clearly knows how to inspire the artist . I love seeing the results that come from this book . If you are a doodler or just want to find inspiration for lettering this may help you too .
5 #### This was a great gift for my 10 year old granddaughter . She is very creative and loves this book .
5 #### I bought this for my granddaughter for her birthday , but I want a copy myself . It is very creative .
5 #### super cute ! My neice is going to love this .
4 #### It was a Birthday gift for my grandchild and she just loved it , which makes me very happy .
5 #### This was a gift for a granddaughter . It arrived in a timely manner and she stated she has really enjoyed it . So great gift !
4 #### It was a gift for my grandaughter . She liked it
4 #### Fun , but I would say for 12 and under , seems a little childish .
5 #### COOL BOOKS . LOTS OF LETTERS TO GET MY DAUGHTER TO PRACTICE .
3 #### Cute book , but not my favorite Klutz book . Not as many cool things as I had hoped .
5 #### Came in excellent shape . Have n't opened - as is a Christmas gift .
5 #### It was perfect since she picked it out herself . She is the lettering queen . We purchased another one for her friend 's birthday .
5 #### We have a daughter who loves to draw , write letters , and just be creative ! We got this for her birthday and at first she seemed hesitant to try it out since she was excited about some of her other gifts , but one day she sat down to give it a go and she kept commenting , " This is so much fun ! " . She got more and more excited each time she turned the page and saw more ideas to try :) It was a total hit !
5 #### My 9 - year - old loves everything crafty . This book was right up her alley ! Very cute lettering ideas with good explanations and stencils to help . It 's an all in one book to just grab and go . Great buy for girls !
5 #### Christmas gift for my 13 year old daughter . She is in the phase of plastering music bands and boys to her bedroom walls . Plus drawing her own posters and doodles is necessary at her age . She was really excited to use the patterns for different types of the alphabet . She decorated four 8x10 canvases with a quote and it looks great !
5 #### This is so much fun and helps the crafter learn all kinds of hand lettering styles and stimulates creativity . My the year old granddaughter loves it , but her 7 year old sister enjoyed it too , now I want my own !
5 #### Got this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas . She loves it ! Would recommend it if you need a gift for a girl
4 #### My 7 year son loved this kit . He immediately went to work on creating few postcards for his friends . The reason for the 4 star is that some of the techniques is bit hard for him to execute , like 3D lettering . It also takes some time do few words , so its not like you can type a letter in few minutes . Overall thought he was very happy with it and I would recommend this product . Thank you ,
5 #### I gave this to my artistic niece for her birthday . She loves to draw and this gave her some new ideas on drawing letters . She now loves to make signs and address envelopes . It was nice that it came with some colored pencils as well - it 's a self contained kit she can take with her when she is traveling .
5 #### Lots of great ideas in this book and it comes with everything you need to do fun projects . Got for my 13 year old that hates crafts and she likes this to make signs for her room or notes .
5 #### I bought this for a Christmas gift for my 11 year old niece . It 's done in the typical Klutz style with easy to follow directions . Should come in handy for making posters and just fun writing .
5 #### I purchased this for my 9 yr old daughter who enjoys drawing and often copies the funky lettering she sees others do . There 's lot of advice and guidance for spiffing up your lettering such as how to shadow your letters ; suggestions like making your baseline for the letters be curved or slanted rather than boring horizontal ; or how about Word Pictures ( ie : " lemon " where the O is a slice of lemon ) . This is an excellent guide for anyone ( adults too ) that wants some inspriation in the lettering area ; 41 pages and 5 letter stencils ( along with double ended pencils 4 markers , a mechanical pencil , and an eraser in a zip pouch + 50 sheets of paper at the back . also 2 adhesive backed pages for making your own stickers ) . The only Negative I can say so far ( daughther has n't used this yet ) is that the stencils are not see thru ! You can see thru them a little bit , but if you 're going to use the stencil to lay out a word , you need to see where you are and clear plastic would have been best . That said , I did try it out with a light hand , and you can see thru the colored plastic , but you 've got to look hard . THe festive colors of the stencils are great , but not so much when you get down to acutally using them . I still recommend this , though .
5 #### This book so sweet ! So many different choices for drawing letters with the included templates . And for continuing with your own ideas and special style . Could keep a young girl busy for hours . Great to get the creative juices flowing . I bought several of these to give as gifts .. Amazon 's price if pretty good .
5 #### The Easter Bunny left this in my 8 year old daughter 's basket last April , and she continues to use it at least once a week . Everytime there is a birthday party , I ask her to make a card , which is not her favorite thing to do anymore , but now , she pulls out the stencils and makes beautiful cards that she is proud of . She has also used the stencils on poster board to liven up her school projects . I really can not say enough about this simple , yet very creative and well crafted set . I have purchased additional sets as birthday and Christmas gifts . Great job Klutz !
4 #### This book has five stencils ( two different fonts , uppercase and lowercase , plus one for cool symbols - and each stencil has a different edge you can use to make nifty lines ) and detailed explanations about how to use the stencils to make , well , awesome letters . Then , like most Klutz books , they go on to explain how you can do pretty much the same thing WITHOUT their supplies , going freehand . However , please be aware of the age range . It says 8 + , and looking through it I doubt many children younger than that age are going to get much out of it . If nothing else , this book assumes they can already read well enough to understand the instructions with little to no help .
5 #### This is an amazing little book for kids . Whenever my middle school child would have a school project to do , she would bring out my scrapbooking stuff and a lettering book of mine . I saw this and bought it for her and it comes with its own cool stencils and lots of neat ideas for making letters . When they have to make posters or fancy titles for papers , this book comes out and they get good ideas on how to make their school work look nicer . We have even bought this book as a birthday present and it was well received . Amazon has the best price , I got stuck paying retail for the ones I bought , no more though .
5 #### These books are creative , educational , high quality , and fun ! My children have several versions of Klutz books , and they are all wonderful . They provide a cure for boredom that both kids and adults can appreciate .
5 #### Have you ever been faced with the prospect of making a poster , greeting card , scrapbook -- any creative project that required lettering ? All the rest seems like a piece of cake , until you get to the daunting part of adding the words ! Fear no more , budding artists ! The answers to all your lettering problems are here in this amazing little book by Klutz . You 'll learn how to do different styles of lettering , how to color it , shade it , make it funky and fun ! I ca n't imagine any kid or adult that wouldn ' enjoy having this educational tool on hand . It 's sturdily put together with a spiral binding , making it easy to handle while creating your masterpieces . It also includes a set of colored pencils -- quite a bargain ! There are 5 pages of stencils , but I believe that you will soon progress beyond using them . You will love this book !
5 #### Product dimensions listed mid - page made me think these would be large cards , but I love the replica antique design and quality . Thank you !
2 #### Read the reviews ! The cards look fantastic . But playing with / using them is tough . Cards are not coated so you 're basically handling paper . If you want authentic - looking cards these fit the bill . If you actually want to play cards with them you 'll have your work cut out for you .
5 #### These cards are a nice mix of replica and modern . Seems to be plastic coated ( I wonder what the " ivory surface " was like with the originals ) , and indeed no numbers . If using as single head cards ( for things like fortune telling ) , on the decorative backs there is a little " USGS " printed at the bottom right ( in the rightmost flower ) ; this can help in telling which side is heads ( especially with the tens ... those are symmetrical ) . Be careful , they are a bit " pokey " when shuffling as the corners are NOT rounded ... a fun deck , and a nice change from what I am used to !
4 #### Civil war era cards , no numbers just 6 spades or whatever . Bringing them to a ghost town party along with some old time poker chips , Sasparilla , and if I can find them , fake cigars ... should be fun
5 #### Good quality . Exactly what he has been looking for !
5 #### Very interesting cards and very nice replica . The corners are 90 degree angles instead of being rounded , and they also do n't have the number / letter and suit symbol in the corners like modern cards do . Another difference is the ink ; there are some cards ( especially in the diamonds ) where the pips are smeared and have other imperfections , though this was deliberately done to match an older deck better . The pips also have a hand - drawn quality to them . The courts are full images instead of being mirrored halves and the colors are muted and faded . If you 're looking for an antique - looking deck , this is a good one , though due to it being a replica of an antique , do n't expect the perfection of modern cards .
5 #### No , there are no jokers as other reviewers have mentioned , but I do n't know if jokers would have been historically accurate . Overall , especially for the price , I like these cards . They 're just what I expected .
1 #### If in the 1800 's they printed on off - center , crooked cut paper with pixelated designs , then these cards would be perfect . I think they printed better back then , these were pretty bad
5 #### SO COOL ! SO COOL COOL COOL ! great cards . It take time to get used to it . all royal cards can be fuzzy but if carefully look on the picture , you can tell the difference . It is awesome card ... glad that I bought it !
4 #### I run a Weird West RPG with a card - based mechanic and I 'm always on the look - out for atmospheric card decks to dress - up the game and give the players a little value added enjoyment . With these I reckon I 've hit some sort of sweet spot . The pip printing looks like it was done on a low - budget press ( but was n't ) , the court cards have a one - way up , crowded artwork feel . None of the cards has an index in the corner , and those corners are square rather than rounded . The backs are also very olde - worlde in look . 10/10 . I 'm dropping a star because there are no jokers in the deck , and I need them . There are a couple of cards with a printed history of the deck on them and I 'll write " joker " on them , but it wo n't be the same .
5 #### I bought these for my girlfriend as a gift . They are really nice cards and are vintage ! I like the look of them . I think they are more for a collection then to actually play with .
5 #### Ready for Hearts to meet Spades and Whist ? Well then you are ready to play Wizard Deluxe . US Games has a true game of skill and strategy . Wizard Deluxe requires the players to make sure they only bid what they can take and no more . The game is fairly fast paced and requires at least three players . I found that have four or more really makes the game enjoyable . It is skill and thought that makes you the winner in this game . Since there is very few pieces , cleanup an d storage are no real problem . US Games has included very simple and easy to follow instructions . The rules are bi - lingual , which is a really nice addition to the game . The age of play is from 10 to adult , but I found that this game might be a little advanced for some of the younger players . Wizard Deluxe is a great gift for any occasion and is very reasonably priced . So if you are looking for a great family game or a game for those weekend get together , go out an get Wizard Deluxe Card Game .
5 #### Love this game . Learned how to play at the beach this year and had to have it .
5 #### Such a fun , strategic game . We love playing with friends and family .
4 #### Snatch , by U.S. Games Systems , is a simple word game which is compact , quick to learn and fun ! The game comes with 100 plastic tiles , and it is cleverly packaged in a simple tube ( it sort of looks like a small , plastic packing tube ) . Play is simple . Players lay all of the tiles face - down in the middle of the table . Then players take turns flipping the tiles over one at a time . When a player sees a word three letters or longer , they shout it out and snatch it from the center , setting it in front of them . Players can steal each other 's words by adding a letter to them , so beware ! What 's great about this game is that unlike many word games ( Scrabble , for example ) , it 's socially interactive the whole way through . No waiting for other players to take forever making their play .... it 's fast - paced and fun .
3 #### This game is ok . Scrable is much better I think . Nothing else to say . It was ok and barring having any other games to play , I might pull this out again .
5 #### Our daughter has had this game for a while , and when we went to buy it , they had apparently added the " -it " Very funny . Product arrived quickly and in brand new condition . Thanks .
5 #### We have loved this game for years and we wanted to buy it for a Christmas gift for family ! They were so surprised and loved it !
5 #### A great game for any family that loves playing cards
5 #### Fun card game which consists of bidding on the number of hands you think you will win in a given round . Several fun variations of this game ! This game can be a little difficult for children , so check the suggested age on the box . Fun game for adults and very competitive ! We play this at least once a week and it never gets old !
5 #### Bought this for a family game night ( with all adults ) , and it was a big hit ! We liked how you could win every time , even if you had a " bad " hand ( and conversely , can lose with a " good " hand ! ) Highly recommend it !
5 #### fun adult game .... easy to learn and fun to play
5 #### Originally I ordered the box without the counters , which are pretty helpful when playing . A friend bought that one brand new , and I ordered this one instead . Nice family game which allows people to interact .
5 #### It can be a fun game for everyone . Its a trump based game where you need to guess the number of hands ( tricks ) you will win each round . If you guess correctly you get points , if you are wrong , you lose points . Each round you increase the number of cards you get , so it becomes more difficult to guess . Overall , people of various skill levels seem to enjoy this game , and it is a nice game to travel with since it does nt take up a lot of space .
4 #### Wizard is easy to learn and lots of fun . Each hand is a different number of cards with new challenges . Great when you have an uneven number of people . This is not a toy , it 's a card game with bidding tools .
5 #### this was a christmas gift and its what my son asked santa to give ... they work well and the inkpad is well inked .
5 #### I 'm so glad I picked these up . I like that they are easy to find and use ( how many times do you get stamps that are all bunched together in box and you have to dump them all out in order to find the one you want ? You do n't have to do that with these because they 're all layered nicely in this tin . ) They stamp well on a variety of surfaces ( I used them on material , canvas , and paper ) and they clean up nicely too .
5 #### Cheaper than the box store and better quality . My wife LOVED these . She has been stampping everything . The only thing I wish it had was care instructions .
5 #### My 4.5 year old LOVES this game . It 's fun , easy to use , and has quickly become a family favorite . While I understand why they included the spinner on the board , for an overzealous spinner like most 4.5 year olds are , it makes things a little hard when spins get out of control and pieces go everywhere . But that 's our only issue with this excellent game .
5 #### Me and 3 year old grandson love this game . So fun and educational in many areas .
5 #### We love this game so much we bought it as a birthday present ! You never have to move more than 4 spaces at a time , so younger children that can count to 4 can play without much frustration . The goal is to have the most buttons by the end of the game , but there are spaces that you land on where you can switch button jars with any player you want , and spaces where you have to put some of your buttons onto the board ( and if someone lands on the special space , they get all the buttons off the board ) . Another nice feature is the spinner is built in to the board , so you ca n't lose it . Very easy , but fun game . One of the games for younger children that do n't make me cringe when the kids ask to play !
5 #### My 6 year old loves this game . We play it pretty often and he 's had it for 2 years now .
5 #### purchase for grandchildren 7 and 4 to play together , they love pete the cat
5 #### Adorable game . Both my 7 and 5 yr old love playing it . Simple but fun .
5 #### Love Pete the cat ! So excited to find a groovy buttons game , it 's our favorite Pete the cat book ! My son is 4.5 y / o and this game is perfect for him . It was a little expensive but worth it because it 's Pete the cat and is high quality . Love it !
4 #### Fun game for younger children .... My four year old is a fan .
5 #### My grandsons love Pete the Cat . I got them a game the family can play for Christmas . We have n't tried it out yet .
2 #### I bought this game because my 4 year old grandsons love the Pete the /Cat books . However , this is about the worse game for pre - school children I 've ever seen . They could have provided actual cups to hold the buttons on , as little kids had trouble stacking their buttons on the flat board cup , having kids trade " cups " of buttons is even more ridiculous ! This games should have followed the simple format used by other color coded games . When we played , I had to change the games format / goals to doable for 4 year olds .
4 #### This was a gift for a kindergarden class room . They loved it .
5 #### Super fun game . Great way to practice counting and number recognition .
5 #### My 6 year old loves it . I have 2 older kids , 9 and 10 , and they play this game with him . Simple to learn , but not so simple that it 's boring for them !
5 #### My 6 year old , loves " Pete the cat " books . We have most of them . This game is so easy for him and his 8 year old brother to play . He does n't need help playing it no reading involved and the four tokens to move around the board is Pete from different books . It 's just a really cute simple quick game .
4 #### Easy game for kids to play . My kids are always asking to play .
5 #### Gifted to my nephew , who was very excited he got a Pete the Cat game !
5 #### Bought this for my 5 year old grandson . He loves it !
5 #### Great for pre - school And kindergarten ! Such a cute game !
4 #### It 's a good game board , my 3 year old daughter loves Pete the Cat and this game will help her learning to count . My only complaint is the spinner does n't work well attached to the board ,
5 #### Cute game for little kids . Pete the Cat holds their attention .
3 #### Bought for Pre - K boy whose class mascot is Pete the Cat . The game pieces are thick cardboard and it is extremely hard to get them into the slots on the plastic holders . It took three adults almost 15 frustrating minutes and a couple of the pieces got bent and mangled at the bottom . The board has already started to come apart at the folded seam after less than 3 months of use . The concept of the game is good but the quality of the game itself is ' meh ' .
5 #### this is a very very cute and educational game for first starters . right now our grandson is having more fun counting and matching colors of buttons then the rules ... lol . but any child that loves Pete the Cat books , need this game .
5 #### Great family game ! My 4 year - old enjoys playing the game with daddy and mommy . She learned a lot about USA .
5 #### I could n't get my kids to stop playing ! We love this and will be buying more BrainBoxes soon . If your child can read they can play I would n't say 8 and up is accurate .
5 #### Nice game , we play during lunch on the weekends . It 's not all state fact based ( like it might ask how many trees are on the card ) but it 's fun and educational and a 10 minute game .
4 #### Good game , fun concept . However , too many question re : # of objects on the card and less trivia based . Who care how many ears of corn are on the IA card or cows on the WI card . Overall : a fun fast game , great for waiting when eating out or just use cards for car trivia .
5 #### These cards are amazing for teaching your kids . We have a 9 and an 11 year old . We do n't play the 10 second game but have the kids read aloud all the information and then ask them all 8 questions on the back of the card . Cards are made of a thick cardboard and should with stand anything . I highly recommend for all parents .
3 #### this was n't as cool as i thought it would be . we used it once or twice and it now sits untouched .
3 #### Adoreable , love the fact it has its own story books . Purchased for 20 - month old grandson who loves cats . Doll does nt do anything but I feel as he gets older he will understand the story and make the connection with the doll .
5 #### My daughter absolutely loves the Bad Kitty book . I 've checked it out from our local library several times over the past few months since we discovered it , and thankfully , she got the book for Christmas . My aunt , knowing how much my daughter loves Bad Kitty , saw the Bad Kitty doll at a teacher conference and bought it immediately . My daughter opened it up at Christmas and was thrilled to have her own Bad Kitty . Bad Kitty now sleeps with her and goes just about everywhere with her . As I said in my the title , perfect for the Bad Kitty fan !
5 #### My son likes playing with Otis the tractor as I read along to the book . a great little stuffed tractor !
5 #### This was for one of my grandchildren . He was thrilled with it , so , needless to say , so am I.
5 #### Awww .. this was a nice addition to my book character doll collection .
4 #### We love Bad Kitty at our house and this little plush is adorable !
5 #### My sons loves it . Bigger then I thought . Very nice
5 #### Cute as can be , goes with the book great !
5 #### A great companion to the Otis book series , beloved by my 3 - year - old grandson
5 #### This merrymakers otis the tractor he is a plush toy in his own.storybooks and videos.he.is red and white with wheels so cute thanks for great Price and delivery
5 #### Our Grandson loves the Otis books and he was thrilled to get this Plush toy for Christmas ! It is well made , durable , and great fun for little ones . Plus , it 's soft enough to sleep with . I recommend this to anyone for anyone !
5 #### Discovered the Bad Kitty series of books and related items - and granddaughter LOVES her new bad kitty playmate ! ( 9 yr old who loves stuffed animals - it is not large and not very furry - but we can laugh while reading the books together with her stuffed kitty . )
5 #### There 's nothing like Bad Kitty for a 7 year old boy who loves to collect stuffed animals . I also gave him the paperback stories of Bad Kitty to go along with this & encourage his reading !
5 #### This stuffed tractor is great for Otis fans . It is well made and adorable . My two - year - old son , who loves all the Otis books right now , received this stuffed Otis for Christmas , and he loves it . He often asks to hold Otis during reading time or sleep with Otis at night . It is perfectly sized for a two - year - old child ; my son can comfortably carry it around in one arm . However , prospective buyers should note that this Otis is all soft . That 's great if your child wants to sleep with it , but the wheels do not turn and it does not roll . When my son first got it , he wanted it to act as a normal toy tractor so he tried to push it across the floor a few times , and he was frustrated that it would n't " work . " When we explained that it was for cuddling and story time , though , he caught on and now loves Otis as a " stuffed animal " rather than as a toy automobile .
5 #### My son LOVES the Otis tractor book series . So , when we gave him this he was so excited . He ca n't sleep a night without it ! :)
4 #### So excited to have a plush Otis ! My son and I love the original story ! I am thrilled that Merry Makers is creating toys to enhance the reading experience for young children . As an English professor , book lover , and mother of three , I believe that the best way to encourage children to fully experience a story is to allow them to bring it to life . I was always frustrated that my daughter could do this through dolls and costumes , but it is so much harder for boys , since society does n't approve of those activities for them . Toys like this one open the door for them , and the quality of the fabric and stitching on Otis promises countless hours of play .
5 #### My son loves the Otis books . He has them memorized . This is one of his favorite " babies " now . Otis sleeps with him every night . If your kid loves Otis , this will be a hit !
2 #### The drawings in the book have the eyes 3x bigger than the stuffed animal . Eyes are too small . My daughter noticed it right away .
5 #### My 5 year old loves Bad Kitty ! Great Plush Toy !
4 #### it 's smaller than you expect but still really cute
5 #### My daughter literally squealed when she saw this ! She 's 8 and if you have kids reading the bad kitty books , this is the item to get . Makes reading so much more fun when they have the toy to match . She now reads along with this bad kitty . Love it . So glad I picked it up for her .
5 #### great way to tie books in with the animals -- my grandkids loved these ! !
4 #### This toy appears to be well made and is a very good likeness to the storybook character .
5 #### My son loves the bad kitty books . I saw this and thought he would really like it . I was right .
4 #### We love Bad Kitty but this thing is just okay . I think that I expected it to be softer and more cuddly , but I think it will serve its purpose of amusing my Kitty obsessed children on Christmas Day .
5 #### I teach Second Graders and they love Bad Kitty and the Bad Kitty stories . Kitty has been a welcome addition to our stories and we can also dress kitty in different hats and costumes to go with the stories .
4 #### I love the kitty , so does my son . I read the book my son plays with the kitty . He loves the book and the kitty so that makes me happy . It is small but its great for the kid .
5 #### My five - year - old granddaughter loved getting this to go along with a book . It made a great gift and added to a happy visit .
5 #### For anyone who is a Bad Kitty fan , this little guy is a must ! His frazzled expression makes you think he just has an encounter with the dog !
3 #### Cute character not very fuzzy . I thought it would be soft but it was well made and stiff . If you just want it to display with the book , I would recommend it . It arrived when I expected it .
3 #### I ordered this as a stocking stuffer for our daughter . The stuffed animal version definitely looks like the book counterpart . The animal itself is not made of very high quality materials . It is small and stuffed tightly so not really huggable at all , the materals are not soft - kind of reminds me of a more detailed version of something you 'd win at a carnival . BUT - if you have a big bad kitty fan in your household he might be worth the expense . I am not sure I 'd buy this again if I had a do - over . He sits pretty much ignored in a toy bin since Christmas - because it is n't huggable or playable - I mean what else can you do with it ?
5 #### He is adorable and the perfect size for the person who will be receiving him .
4 #### A great stocking stuffer for my Bad Kitty fan club kids !
5 #### My grand daughter just loved this . She put it on her backback and all the girls at school wanted one .
5 #### My daughter has been a fan of Bad Kitty since she learned to read and still loves him . She " collects " backpack pulls so she was thrilled to get this for a little gift .
5 #### and could n't wait to add this to his backpack ( he 's 8 and I came across this whilest searching for a dinosaur backpack pull which we did end up also finding / getting , but there was no way he was NOT going to get this too ! ) Looks so funny / cute on his backpack - he is very pleased as am I.
5 #### Love this guys is really cute . I love that my kiddo has something small to get him excited about a book series .
5 #### I got this for a 5 year old who ADORES Llama Llama . She also loves this . I like it to . It looks like like the book character and is well made . I 'd search for a sale because I think that $ 17.99 is a bit much to pay , but if you can get it at a good price , go for it . It wo n't disappoint .
4 #### There 's a Llama ranch near our house . My grand daughters love the llamas and we have to stop and watch they when we drive by . Bought the Christmas llama doll and 4 of the books that teach nice lessons about sharing , bullying , etc . The doll is made nicely . The girls keep taking off his pj 's so right now he 's a little chilly since its winter .
5 #### Bought this for the grand daughter as she already LOVES all the Llama Llama books . It is so cute - she sleeps with it every night . Next I 'll have to buy one for my grand son . Well made and suitable for age 3 + .
3 #### This is a cute puppet , and since the books / songs are so interactive , we get a lot of use out of the puppet . I wish that all the buttons came off , though - you ca n't act out the song if Pete only loses one button !
5 #### My 5 year old loves reading Pete the Cat books . I ordered this thinking maybe he was too old for this kind of thing but for the price why not try it . Well he sleeps with it every night and loves it . Very happy I took a chance and ordered it . Quality is really nice , seems well made .
5 #### This stuffed cat is great for kids . I 've given this cat and books to numerous kids for gifts . It always is loved and is a great companion to Pete The Cat books .
5 #### My son absolutely loves his Pete the Cat . Created beautifully and strong . It can withstand two toddlers constantly adoring and playing with their Pete .
5 #### Cute companion to gift with Pete books . Not a fluffy plush but skinny construction makes Pete easy to hold on to for little hands .
5 #### Popular book series for young kids . Having a plushy to go with it , makes it more fun !
5 #### Love our Pete the Cat pupped ! Entertaining , fun , well made .
5 #### My grandson had enjoyed the book Pete the Cat , so he really loved having his dad make this puppet come alive . My grandson is one and a half . Very cute puppet !
5 #### My grandchildren are in to Pete so had to buy several of these . Good quality and very cute .
5 #### Super cute ! I ordered this with the bedtime blues book for my sons birthday , I do wish it had a hat like in the book but it 's still cute .
4 #### A very cute cat , perfect size to hold it and very colorful ! And of curse those groovy buttons are so cute ! I got this for my son and his takes it without him all the time
4 #### Nice puppet . Would be better if all buttons were detachable . Only 2nd button from the top " pops " off . OCD preschoolers had issues with this , as all four buttons pop off in the story .
4 #### arrived on time and is very cute . ordered the book also so the doll could go along with it . totally was n't paying attention to it being a puppet but it 's still fine
5 #### I bought this plush Pete to go with the book , my grandkids love him .
5 #### I bought two of these for stocking stuffers . So cute ! ! Seems to be good quality .
5 #### Pete the Cat is amazing . This is a fun addition to the books ! !
5 #### I bought it for my 5 year old grandson .
5 #### Such a cute plush . His clothes do come off , but he 's so much cuter with them on . He 's soft . My daughter loves him .
5 #### Very nice . will do for what I need it for . I am going to add more buttons that are removable ... as only one is removable . But worth the purchase price .
5 #### I purchased this pete the cat for a classroom teacher who requested him so she can interact with her class students using Pete along with the book . Through this plush doll , she can help them engage in a conversation with the shy students . We love this and we rate it 5 out of 5 Stars .
5 #### We adore Pete the Cat ! This Pete the Cat soft doll is perfect for fans of the story books ! His pajamas are so cute ! Love the little red slippers and the whiskers ! ! !
1 #### returnded it . pete 's body has no filling at all .
5 #### Three year old grandson loves this Pete the Cat Bedtime Blues doll . Sleeps with him most nights .
2 #### This hand puppet was very disappointing and expensive for what it is . First off , it 's quite small- only little hands can fit comfortably inside . The puppet is supposed to follow the story , Pete the Cat and His Four Groovy Buttons , but it only confuses children . The second from top button , which is attached with velcro allows one to pull it off , which is great . However , the other buttons are stationary , so when children try to follow the story and pull the buttons , they rip at the shirt , nearly destroying the toy . I do n't recommend at all . If I had physically seen one first , I would not have purchased .
5 #### I purchased this doll as a birthday gift for a three year old girl . The Pete the Cat series is a favorite at our house and we thought including this doll with one of the books would be a great introduction to the series . To date , I have n't found a single child who does n't love Pete the Cat and his catchy tunes . As a mom , the books are equally fun to read . And they are great for children just learning to read as well . You wo n't find a more fun introduction to reading !
5 #### We love Pete and this little toy is a great complement to the series of books . He is well made and handsome :) Great gift .
5 #### Bought for my nephew who loves the Pete series . My sister says he adores it and can ise it easily . It 's very well made and he lives popping the button . A perfect accessory to go with the books .
5 #### Like other reviews have mentioned , only one of the four buttons come off which is kind of a bummer . However , the child I purchased this for LOVES Pete the Cat and that hardly bothered him .
5 #### I bought two of these and it 's a fun gift for any small child who likes Pete the Cat . I bought one for my daughter and one for her kindergarten class since they have puppets in the classroom . The little jacket opens on the puppet . Just a cute toy .
4 #### Why does my kid love this cat so much ?
4 #### Bought for Pre - K boy whose class mascot is Pete the Cat . Large enough that my husband and I can fit our hands into it . Only one button ' falls off ' but the coat opens . Our son is happy with it and the quality of the material is good .
5 #### Tad Hills in an excellant author , and my pre - k class last year loved his stories . I know my pre - k class this year will be just as excited to hear the stories , and meet Rocket , as he shares his love of learning to read and write , just like my pre - k class will be doing .
5 #### This was a birthday gift along with two Rocket books for six year old grand daughter . She loves all three and used the book for her end of school project and , of course , stuffed Rocket went to school with her that day .
4 #### Very thin material . I did not realize it was a puppet . I thought it was a stuffed animal . I guess I should have read the description a little more closely . Cute , but thin .
4 #### My son recently started preschool and became obsessed with Pete the Cat . He really loves this puppet because he is very , very soft and fun to play with . One of the buttons can be " pulled " off like in the story , and he even has an adorable belly button .
5 #### This is darling ! Much better than the plush figures you can purchase in the stores .
5 #### Soooo cute and my son is going to LOVE THIS oh my gosh I am soooooo happy :)
5 #### Who does n't love Pete the Cat ? My 21 - month - old grandson fell in love with this little puppet as soon as he saw it . The jacket is super soft and Pete immediately became one of his " loveys . "
4 #### The buttons do n't all pop off like in the story , my son keeps tugging at them .
5 #### My nephew is about to turn 2 and he loves these books . I ca n't wait until he sees this , he 's going to love it ! Very cute and the books are neat too . This kid can count to 4 already because of Pete 's buttons !
4 #### Like some of the other reviews , I was disappointed that only one button comes off the jacket . The premise of the book is about 4 buttons coming off . My grand daughter likes to do the ' take away ' or subtract the one button from the total buttons . We can do that with the book , but not with the puppet . On the plus side , she loves the size of this Pete - it fits her little hand and she can hold him up pretending to lose his buttons . I may try to devise a way for each button to come off .
5 #### This past June , one of our themes for the month in preschool was , Pete the Cat . Every student had a turn to take Pete The Cat Puppet home in a bed I made for an overnight . I also sent home a camera and a notebook for the students to document Pete 's adventures with their family . A few adventures Pete had were , going to a Baseball Game , a movie , outside play , visiting grandma , and eating with the family . After I gathered all the pictures , drawings and stories I put the info into book form . Everyone got a true story of Pete 's adventures with the families . This assignment was not only lots of fun , but a huge success as well :)
5 #### My granddaughter loves Pete the Cat books and this is for Christmas . Ca n't wait to see her face when she opens him on Christmas morning .
5 #### The puppet is very cute , and the children are having fun with it . I hope it lasts , glad I bought it .
5 #### They were so excited when Pete the Cat appeared on my hand . We sang about the buttons as " Pete " acted out the story , then sang about his white shoes ( only we stepped in much more than the book ) . Love his little jacket . The very literal children , however , did think all his buttons should pop off . I agree . I arranged my hand to show only the proper number of buttons as we sang the story and ' hid ' the Velcro button on top of on of the others .
5 #### I am in love with the Pete The Cat Series , and can not wait to use the puppet with the stories with my new class in September . I know they will be so excited to meet Pete , and will love to hold him during story time .
3 #### My granddaughters are a bit young for it now so it opened to mixed reviews . I expected tht they will grow into it .
5 #### I teach music and we 've started working with the PETE THE CAT book series ( PK / K Music ) just for fun . The children love the books and helping out with the singing / chanting parts of the story . Having Pete The Cat to demonstrate or pantomime the song(s ) helped even more ! This is an adorable stuffed animal !
3 #### Small but cute the picture looks like its stuff all the way around , it 's a hand puppet ! I think the children in childcare will love it
5 #### Great puppet . My students will love using it along with the book Pete the Cat I love my White Shoes .
4 #### Looks very similar to Llama in the books . A little goofy looking but toddler does n't care . Llama 's doll is n't sewn on very well . My toddler loves his Llama Llama !
5 #### If you love Mike Curato 's Little Elliot books , you will also love this adorable , soft , cuddly Elliot ! I gave one each to my adult daughter and to two pre - school children , and they were so cute I wanted to keep one for myself . The pre - schoolers were delighted with them , and their parents told us that they take them everywhere with them . ( Of course , they liked the books , too ! ) Elliot is VERY soft and cuddly , and he 's just 9 " tall , which is the perfect size for a little elephant . Elliot has special adventures and learns good lessons in the stories , and he can have more unique adventures in the home of a child who receives him as a gift .
5 #### I 've given this , along with Llama Llama 's Little Library , as a baby shower gift . It 's something that can be used when the child is a bit older , as opposed to all the gifts used right away , like bibs or bottles . I also bought one for my 2 year old 's second birthday , and she loves her " nah nah " , as she calls him . She grabs him , and cuddles him while we read our Llama Llama books together .
4 #### This is almost perfect . I love that it is machine washable . Llama llama does actually look like the character in the book . My only issue with this is that fuzzy llama does n't look anything like a llama . It looks like a bear . It 's not even close , by any stretch of the imagination . Still , my four year old daughter does n't seem to notice or mind . It just bothers me a bit because this would have been perfect if only fuzzy llama actually looked like a llama .
5 #### Our 3 year old granddaughter loves the Llama Llama books . Especially LLama Llama Red Pajama . So it was great to be able to find the llama for her too . Luckily , the pajamas say on very well because she is at the stage where she seems to undress everything . The llama 's little llama is firmly attached as well . Our little one just tucks this llama in her arm every night as she has her nightly reading of Llama book .
5 #### This is * so * cute ! Granddaughter likes the Llama Llama Red Pajamas book and she loves this doll .
5 #### My llama llama fanatic was thrilled with his new little buddy to read all his llama llama books .
5 #### I bought this for my granddaughter who is 12 mo . old . We read the Llama books daily . It is a great size and the quality is really nice .
5 #### My daughter received this as a gift along with the Llama Llama Red Pajama book at her 3rd birthday party . It is adorable stuffed animal that is well made and is perfect size for a small child to hold while you read the book .
5 #### We got our first Llama book for my sons first birthday . We did n't know about the series before that , but my whole family has fallen in love with it even since ( even the grandparents ! ) . When we found this plush toy we knew we had to have it . My son sleeps with it every night and always points to it when we start reading him one of the books . I was afraid that the Fuzzy doll llama would get ripped off because it seems to be held on by a thread , but it has held up well and we 've had it since January ' 15 . This is the perfect gift for any little Llama fan .
5 #### Great lama stuffed animal . My daughter loves the books and now she hold lama lama every time we read the stories together ! ! !
5 #### Bought to give as a gift with Llama Llama books . Perfect ! Great quality toy . So soft and cute .
5 #### Purchased this to go along with all of the Llama Llama stories we own . My toddler loves to hold onto Llama Llama while we read the different stories . The quality of this Llama Llama is great . It has been washed multiple time and has held up nicely , no stiches have loosened and Llama Llama 's little attached toy is still attached ! Great purchase and great quality !
5 #### Great size for a toddler , soft and cute . One of my grandson 's favorite characters .
5 #### so cute and well made . My grandson loves it .
3 #### The small Llama does not stay attached if you have a LO that will pull on it . I 've had to sew it on a few times . Also the pajama bottoms are constantly coming down and exposing Llama 's bottom .
3 #### The illustrations from the book are so sweet that it would be impossible to duplicate .
5 #### I bought this for a granddaughter to go along with a Llama Llama book ..... she loved it . I would recommend .
5 #### Smaller than I thought ( did n't pay attention to specs ) but very cute . My 3 yo loves it !
5 #### My one year old loves llama llama books . So when she got the stuffed animal she was so excited . Great stuffed animal
5 #### My 2 year old daughter loves the Llama Llama book series . We bought her this " little llama " for Christmas and she has brought it to bed with her every night since . It 's high quality , durable and features removable red pajamas . Note though , that the pajamas are sewed to the doll on the back so while they can be unbuttoned and removed , they 'll never get lost . For me , that 's a good feature as I expect otherwise the pajamas would have been lost the first day !
5 #### Adorable and perfect for little hands . I think my 2 and 1/2 year old grandson will love it . We will see on Valentines day .
5 #### I saw this doll at a local store , but did n't buy it at the time . My 2 year old likes the Llama Llama book series , so I decided to look for it on Amazon and found it at a better price . I was pleasantly surprised to receive the doll bigger than expected . At approx . 11 " tall , the doll is a good size to be hugged and carried by a small child . The tiny teddy bear is sewn to Llama Llama 's hand , but can be detached by simply cutting the thread . The red pajamas can also be removed . This doll is wonderful and appreciated by children who enjoy of the Llama Llama books .
5 #### My daughter loves the Llama Llama books so I was thrilled when I saw we could get the stuffed llama here ! He 's so cute and he 's the perfect size for my 2 year old to carry around and take to bed .
5 #### Bought this for my 3 year old son , who loves to read Llama Llama books . This is such a cute plush toy . My son loves it !
5 #### The grandchildren love this toy ! I have twin 20 month old grandchildren and we read " Llama Llama Nighty Night " . I also bought " Llama Llama Mad at Mama " because I thought the front cover drawing was a hoot . I gifted this and our little boy claimed it immediately as his own . This toy is very easy for a child to carry and is a fun one to have while reading the books . I may need to purchase a 2nd one at some point because our little boy has decided not to share with sister ! An update - Two months down the road , this toy continues to be a favorite . My grandson hauls around two toys all the time , this one and a stuffed Mickey . Both are favorites . This toy is very easy for him to carry and grab and he certainly knows where he 's left it every time we read one of the Llama stories . He likes to hold the toy while I read the Llama stories , which are also really fun books to compliment the toy . Holds up well too . Looks just as good as the day it came out of the package . We 're very happy with the purchase .
5 #### It was live at firsts sight for my one year old grandson . Llama Llama Red Pajama is his favorite story . The Llama is very soft and already well cuddled !
5 #### GREAT . BOUGHT TO GO WITH THE JINGLE BELLS LLAMA BOOK .
4 #### I will never understand the books , but my daughter wanted the stuffed llama to go with it . He 's a cute little guy , I have to say I like him more than his simple little books .
5 #### Finally a Llama Llama to go with the stories , genius and precious ! These are a hit at my therapy center a d
5 #### a good gift to give with the llama llama books
5 #### We got the book , and this cute Llama character from the book , for our Granddaughter , for the Holidays . It came wrapped in plastic , so it is perfectly clean , unlike the ones at stores that children and parents have already handled a lot ! It is very cute for girl or boy .
5 #### I bought this for my grandson who loves the Llama Llama book series . He is totally thrilled with this little stuffed Llama in red pajamas ! He takes it everywhere he goes and sleeps with it every night too . So glad I got it for him !
5 #### my grandson loved it I wish it was a little bigger
5 #### I love llama llama and so does my 2 year old daughter . She has had llama llama for about a year and he is still in great condition . My only complaint is that my daughter took off llama llama 's pajamas and the stuffed bear became unattached . The bear is small so I am afraid we are going to lose it . I wish there was velcro or something to keep it attached .
5 #### Our son loves to snuggle with his mini Llama Llama stuffed animal . It 's the perfect size . I thought it might be too small after reading other reviews , but for a 2 - year old , I think the size is perfect . If your child likes the Llama Llama series , they 'll love this .
5 #### I bought this for my granddaughter along with the books Lama Lama Red Pajamas and Lama Lama Mad at Mama , and found the stuffed animal to be the perfect size and match for a toddler to snuggle with and carry around . It 's very well made ( he 's a little skinny ) but do n't regret the purchase . Our 2 - year - old granddaughter loved him ( as well as the books ) .
5 #### I bought the Llama along with the book for a family member . She was thrilled when she opened it Christmas day .
5 #### This was a Christmas gift for my four year old granddaughter . She loves the Llama Llama books and she loved the doll too . It was a great hit !
5 #### My daughter has lots of the Llama Llama books and loves them all . I got her a new book for Christmas and this to go along with it , she loves it
5 #### This is so cute ! My daughter 's loves the books so of course loves the llama ! She sleeps with it every night .
4 #### I have to praise amazon for having this product at a great price . We actually picked one up at Barnes and Noble and I could n't bring myself to pay $ 20 + dollars for a simple stuffed animal that feels painfully like a claw - machine reject . That said my five - year - old daughter has put her llama to bed every night since Christmas while reading it llama llama stories . I hope it holds up better than it feels like it should ...
5 #### Our class just loves the Llama Llama series . It is nice to have the actual llama stuffed doll . Good value for the price .
5 #### Great stuffie for my son to take to bed when we read all the Llama Llama Books . Holds up well .
5 #### I wanted this for my great - granddaughter who has Llama Llama books . This is a smaller size than others I have seen but was pleased with the product .
5 #### My friends daughter loves the Llama Llama books and that was her 1st birthday theme . Her daughter now uses this Llama as her lovey ! great quality too !
5 #### We have so much fun with Llama Llama ... we read the books with the plush and change the clothes , pretend to brush teeth ... etc . There are great messages in the books and easy to read / follow for the kiddos .
5 #### Just the ticket for my 16 - month - old granddaughter . Easy to carry , and bright colors are favorite . She lives close to a wonderful zoo and so has likely seen llamas .
5 #### This is the cutest addition to all of the Llama Llama books . My grandchildren always want to hold him while they listen to the stories . Glad I purchased !
5 #### Well made and a fun Manipulative for the kids to use during a Llama reading . My student love this plush .
5 #### As we awaited the birth of our son , we found this adorable llama and thought it would be fun to have the llama , some red pajamas , and the " Llama Llama Red Pajama " book all ready for him . This item arrived much faster than I expected and is even cuter than it looks in the listing photograph ! It makes a phenomenal baby gift .
4 #### This came today and my son instantly recognized it from the book . He is two so I 'm a bit worried about the little bear attached , as in what if he rips it off in the middle of the night and chokes on it kind of fear . So for now , we will watch him , but otherwise seems great .
3 #### My 2 year old loves his Llama Llama and the books ! The only downsides are that its kind of small and the clothes come off . Who wants a naked Llama Llama in their house ?
5 #### Was the perfect size for my grand child to hold while we read her the Llama books . She love it .
5 #### What child does n't relate to precious little Llama ? He gets cranky shopping , forgets to share , misses his mama , but he 's so sweet when Mama gently reminds his how much she loves him and gets him back on track ! So fun to share these rhyming stories with my granddaughters ! The doll is a great tool to remind us of details as we retell the story !
3 #### Cute , but my grandson does n't play with it very much even though he adores the Llama books ; not so cuddly as it could be .
5 #### Kids seem to love the sing - song prose of the Llama Llama books , and of course they all carry a little moral type message for kids without being too obvious .
3 #### These were fine to include with the Llama Llama books , but for just play time they 're rather cheaply made . I would n't have bought them just for the doll itself . I would n't recommend it for children under three because of the small teddy bear that can become detached and the pajamas are n't very sturdy for little ones trying to undress them .
5 #### I bought this adoable Llama for my newphew as a Christmas gift along with the Llama Llama Red Pajamas and I am so excited about it ! It is well made , but my favorite part is the fact I will be able to give him a new book for holidays and special events to complete the series . He is only 6 months , but by the time I get him all the books he should be old enough to read them on his own and until then I love the fact his parents can read him stories with a message . Cute series and super cute stuffed animal !
5 #### My son loves when we read any / all of the Llama Llama books , so when I saw this , I knew he 'd be thrilled . And thrilled he was ! It 's adorable !
5 #### Super Cute ! My daughter loves all of the Llama Llama books so this is the perfect doll her her . It 's now her favorite because it has the little " baby " . FYI ... The clothes on llama llama are actually removable .
5 #### If your child likes the llama llama books , then you HAVE TO BUY this plush llama llama doll ! It is absolutely adorable . My daughter loves hers !
5 #### My son has been read the book ' llama llama red pajama ' every single night since he was born . He 's 11 months old now . We have the book memorized ! He ca n't go to sleep now unless the book has been read to him . It was only natural that he get the plush toy to go along with the book . It 's a huge hit ! My 6 year old niece has learned to read and loves reading my son the book . She too wanted the plush toy and really enjoys her own . I was a little concerned that llama llama 's toy might come off his hand , but we 've had it for several months now and it 's still completely in tact . We love it .
3 #### Cute . I was expecting a little more , I do n't know . It just does n't seem as big as described . It does look like the character , tho , so my granddaughter should be happy .
4 #### Smaller than I thought , but I was n't paying attention to the size given . But it is perfect adorable size for a little 2yr old 's arms , I love it !
5 #### Very Cute ! My daughter loves all of the Llama Llama books so this is perfect . It 's now her favorite " baby " .
5 #### Sweet , well made plush toy to keep your new reader company while reading the latest Dog Man book !
5 #### Perfect reading companion . Bean bag material for a bum helps him to sit up on the bookshelf .
1 #### Most of these reviews do not pertain to this lighted toy !
1 #### Did nt work out of the box after several attempts . Was a birthday gift , double sldisappointment . And , of course , I tossed the packaging so could n't return . Ugh .
4 #### This has been our lifesaver ! Our 1 year old boy is VERY handful in the bath . He stands , walks and crawls in the tub , licks the bottom of the tub , tries to drink the water coming out of the faucet - he just never stops moving . But now , he is so into this toy that he sits in the tub and just stares at it , bites and licks it for a good amount of time .
5 #### I bouht 2 of these for grandchildren who ar 4 & 5 in Jan. I needed 2 of them so each child will have their own when there mommy reads them the book The Night you were born .
5 #### This bear is just the right size for hugging and cuddling with the babes . Sweet dreams are made from such as this .
5 #### it goes great with the book , and my son has it in his bed with him every night ! love it
5 #### I first bought the book and then found this animal that went along it . It is soooo cute and soft
4 #### Cute , but much bigger than I expected for finger puppets . Also , your fingers go up the back of their shirts and it 's a tight fit for a Daddy 's hands . Good luck trying to get all five of them on a hand at once .
5 #### My son was almost 4 when a relative gave him this book and set of five Monkeys . We were at a restaurant and he did not stop playing with them or the book . Right there it was it hit . But No , two years later he STILL loves these monkeys and the book ! ! One or more have gone to every major event , trip , restaurant in the land with us and bought us time and good behavior to boot ! ! I 'm on today buying another set and sending the link to a friend who 's grandchildren fell in love with them at our house ! If you are getting one set , I would recommend getting 2 and squirreling the second set away as a gift or " secret replacement " should one of the monkeys " go missing " as they are not easy to find / replace . Just tried and true advice from this parent ! ( I know several reviewers have commented on the velcro not holding up but given the number of times they are used before it gives up the ghost , not a deal breaker . Also a very simple fix is pick up the " Mega Strength " sticky backed velcro at a hardware store and peel & stick a small piece on each side right over the original pieces and Bam ! you are back in business in 10 seconds ! )
3 #### These are not bad , but the velcro on the palms of monkeys ' hands that is supposed to hold them together does not . If you are not going to use them in that manner then these finger puppets are fine otherwise . They are nicely made , good quality , but the velcro is my main issue with them .
5 #### These adorable 5 little monkeys are a hit in my toddler classroom . The children love all the books and we often sing the rhymes in the bed and in the trees . They love being the children chosen to hold a monkey ! Great supplement !
5 #### How can you beat five adorable , high qulaity finger puppets for just over $ 16.00 ? ? ? These puppets are very detailed and wear the outfits that are depicted in the book by Eileen Christelow . Our daughter LOVES puppets and dramtic play brings tremendous educational value to our reading / story time . Or you can just sing the song with the puppets to act it out ! Any way you use these finger puppets they are sure to be a hit !
5 #### These were Christmas presents and the kids loved these puppets to go along with the books .
1 #### Absolutely is n't waterproof . It now does nt always turn on . I literally just got it . Perhaps I got a defective one , but just an FYI .
5 #### So much fun to go with the book ! No beads , so seems safe for toddler .
4 #### my children love the " 5 little monkeys " story and song so these were a big hit !
1 #### We received this as a gift , however , it allowed water in on the very first use . With a battery , that is not safe at all . I would n't recommend buying this for bath time .
5 #### I did pay a lot of money but it was worth it .. it is brand new like I wanted , just the one I remember as a kid . Love it , very pleased !
5 #### Absolute cutest . I love these monkeys and they are great for teaching math . Purchased for toddler who can now count monkeys !
5 #### Our youngest grandson just turned two and is a HUGE " five little monkeys " fan . He 's been watching different versions of the song on YouTube for the past 6 months and is pretty much addicted to them - ha . His latest trick is to quickly glance around whatever room he happens to be in , find something to climb up on , and then start singing the song and jumping off whatever he climbed up on at the appropriate moment . Of course he climbs right back up because he has to play the part of all FIVE monkeys , naturally ! The moment I saw this little set I knew it would be perfect for him and I knew he 'd pretty much go nuts over it - which he has . Although he 's a bit young to do the finger - puppet thing himself , he has 3 older siblings , 2 parents , and 4 grandparents who are more than happy to do it for him . Such fun ! And honestly , the set is truly and absolutely ADORABLE . I 'm a pretty accomplished seamstress myself and I was very impressed with how well made these little guys are . And they 're a fairly good size , too - 5 inches . Great attention to detail has been given to their design and creation , and I expect them to last a good long time . In my opinion the price is more than fair for what you get . Top quality and just as cute as they can be . Two thumbs up all the way !
5 #### Bought for Pam Poovey Cosplay at Dragon Con , it was perfect ! Thank you !
5 #### This is such a handy way to store your double pointed needles , and keep them from poking your work or stabbing you when stored in a bag .
5 #### My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES the five little monkeys ... so much that he will sing the song over and over for 30 minutes straight ! I bought the finger puppets for him for Christmas and he could n't have been happier . He took a play bed and immediately started holding the monkeys together to jump on the bed . There are even velcro on each of their hands so you can interlock them all together ( which he figured out quickly and began to play ' ring around a rosie ' ) . I 'd say this was a big hit !
5 #### These are so adorable ! Nicely made and they each look different . My granddaughter ( 2 years old ) loved them . Perfect size for her . About 6 - 7 inches .
5 #### Great activity toy , you have to have the book also .
5 #### Used to use regular needle - nosed pliers and made two 90 degree bends and then just rotated the second one . This tool makes it much more precise , as find a location , put the wire in , and clamp down , leaving you with a perfect and much more precise Z bend . Great tool for any one needing to make a few Z bends in servo rods .
5 #### This is the cutest set ever ! The monkeys are in the most adorable pajamas ! ! We use the puppets and sing the " no more monkeys jumping on the bed song " with them , and when one falls off just fling it off the finger and bed . It is really fun and brings the song to life !
5 #### I purchased this for a friend and she seemed very pleased with it .
4 #### Wish holes were a little bigger . But the kids love them
4 #### What 's not to like other than the price . It 's a little too high for these mini finger puppets .
5 #### If your kid is as big a fan of the book as mine is , or even just the song , these are well worth it ! My one - year - old holds one in each hand and bounces them along when we sing or chant about the monkeys on the bed . I 'm sure an older child would enjoy the fact that they 're actually finger puppets , but they 're perfect handheld dolls for a baby .
5 #### In love ! Such a great wristlet ... I use this to put My diapers and wipes and hand sanitizer and diaper cream ... fits all that stuff so well ! I have this in my jujube bff diaper bag and for diaper changes I grab this and go ! So useful and handy . I have n't washed it yet so not sure how it holds up . Highly recommend !
5 #### Beautiful and perfect for holding all of mommies things in the diaper bag ! I love jujube . I have two of their diaper bags along with multiple other products . Great quality !
5 #### Beautiful paper . Made a wonderful recipe book . Quality paper .
5 #### This little tweezer grabs the smallest hairs and has a secure grip .
5 #### We have played with these every day ! My grandson loved them . Toddlers love this song so it was lots of fun . It does not show , but the hands can Velcro together and we played ring - around - the - rosey with them . Great quality . We love , love , love them . My only stress was I ordered on March 8th and they arrived on March 23rd . So if you need them quickly , I would try to order from another source . Almost missed getting here before my Easter trip to be taken as gift . Stressed me as I thought I was ordering early enough !
5 #### These are awesome ! They are high quality , I do n't expect them to fall apart anytime soon . I do n't know why some people ca n't fit their fingers in the puppets . I do n't exactly have petite hands --- ring size 8 - - and I do n't have any problems fitting my fingers in them . My 3 year old also , does n't have any problems using them . They are made well and made to fit all finger sizes .
5 #### A darling gift for my Granddaughter . She loves it .
5 #### My 23 month old granddaughter is a huge fan of the Five Little Monkeys Book , so the Five Little Monkeys Puppets are great to play with while reading the book . Note - they are n't actually finger puppets , but regardless they 're lots of fun . Their hands have Velcro so they can ' hold ' hands and be strung together in a group of 5 . Then when one falls off the bed , the remaining four hold hands . Lots of fun for little ones ! !
5 #### These little monkeys are beautifully made with incredible detail . The children in my preschool class love them . They are well worth the money . I highly recommend them .
5 #### These monkeys are adorable ! They are very detailed and well made . My 15 month old granddaughter loves them . They have little velcro pads on their hands which makes them versatile . Highly recommend !
5 #### What a fun way to enjoy this delightful story .
5 #### Super cute and very detailed . My 3 years old daughter plays with them singing the song " 5 little monkeys jumping on the bed " and has lots of fun . She is still too young to use them as " finger puppets " on her own but mom can help with it ! They are really well made .
5 #### Well made with high quality materials . Super cute . The perfect ring holder !
5 #### Super useful , can hold a lot of stuff , and the Blooming Romance pattern is very pretty .
4 #### my daughter has an obsession with the 5 lil monkeys so we bought her these for christmas and she loves them ! however the velcro does get warn easily so i had to replace the velcro on them
5 #### My almost 2 year old grandson has loved playing with the five little monkeys . They have cute pjs on to match the Five Little Monkeys book .
5 #### Perfect for organizing the kids school year . I love that it starts with August .
5 #### These are adorable and go perfectly with the book . My son insists on using them as I read . They are very well made and fit snuggly on his fingers .
5 #### Bought these as a gift and loved it ! Wished we had a set for us too ! SO CUTE !
5 #### Cutest little monkeys and accompany the storybook very well ! I have purchased multiple sets as gifts and they are always a hit ! Great quality too !
5 #### Great monkey toys . Very cute design and clothes . My daughter enjoys playing with these
5 #### I bought these for my dogs because the like small toys and tend to not tear them up . These are pretty sturdy and my dogs love , just do n't give them to dogs without supervision .
5 #### My fiance said that after getting this object , I could leave since she was now complete . She now had a place to put her ring when she was working out or showering .
5 #### I accidentally got some paint on a switch cover getting ready for company in a few days . I had zero free time to go purchase another so I ordered this with my free two day shipping . It arrived exactly as described and saved the day !
5 #### * * * I paid full price for this product . * * * I have to say that I wish I had this pair of Z - Bend two years ago . I have wasted so much piano wire trying to perfect the z - bend and of course the " modified z - bend " . This tool by Hobbico is 100 % A W E S O M E ! You simply put a piece of piano wire in the mouth of the tool , and press the handle closed in your hand and Voila , a perfect z - bend . This tool is a quality all the way . It feels very solid and has weight to it . I plan on using this 5 Star too for a long long time .
5 #### This little bag is so convenient . I have a quick bag to grab when baby wearing . I can fit 4 diapers , a thin changing pad , wipes , a onesie and socks . It is cute too !
3 #### These puppets are super cute and I would say well made . The kids love when I pull them out to play with them . I have an in home daycare and let them take turns taking one of the puppets off my fingers as we sing the song . I find that the puppets are hard to put on your finger and when they pull one off the Velcro catches and pulls more than one monkey off your fingers .
5 #### These are beyond adorable and very high quality . They match the monkeys from the books , which makes it extra fun to play with them !
5 #### We bought these for our nine month old and she 's been playing with them multiple times a day for the past five months . We keep them in their bag and it 's always an event to get them out in the morning . We hide them ( in plain sight ) around the living room and ask her where the monkeys are and she goes and finds them . She likes tossing them and holding them during walks ( have n't lost one yet ) . She 's very into multiples of the same thing right now , so these are great . We also have the ikea finger puppets , but they 're smaller and less substantial and she hardly ever touched them . We do n't use the monkeys as puppets or with the book / song yet . But we have n't had trouble fitting fingers into the puppets either . Though , I have smallish fingers .
5 #### Just as cute as they can be . Very well made . We having a blast reading the book and tossing the monkeys on the floor with our 21/2 yr old grandson .
5 #### I got this for my daughters shower . I love them . I hope she does too .
5 #### Beautiful colors ! Graphic 45 never disappoints ! I do wish there were more fairies , but I like the diversity this collection offers .
5 #### These are so cute ! Bought them to use at next month 's story time , but my granddaughter loves them , too . I showed them to her via Facetime and she started singing the Five Little Monkeys song lol . I love that their outfits match the Cristelow books . I love that your finger goes inside the back of their shirt instead of into their little bodies so they are more like a little stuffed animal . Looking forward to doing " Five Little Monkeys , Swinging in a Tree " next month for story time !
5 #### Grandkids play with the monkeys all the time . Also bought the book . Love love .
5 #### Perfect addition to my Jujube BFF bag ! I keep in it my bigger bag ( serial over packer ) with wipes , a few diapers , my wallet , cellphone and a few other essentials . It is the perfect size ( not too big or too small ) to just grab and go especially for quick trips when I do n't want to haul around my bigger diaper bag . In addition , this product is beautiful and the quality ca n't be beat !
5 #### My daughter is obsessed with the five little monkeys jumping on the bed songs . So this toy is perfect for her ! THe added part of being able to attach their hands together makes it even cooler . The monkeys are nicely made and cute .
5 #### I bought these to go along with the " Five Little Monkeys " book ( Five Little Monkeys Storybook Treasury ) for story / circle time with a group of 5 year old autistic boys . They love them . It 's a nice change from pictures attached with Velcro . We make up our own versions of the story where the monkeys jump on a truck , on our heads , on a chair . Not all stuffed toys have been a success . For some reason some stuffed dogs with puppies in their mouths were a fail and a few kids let me know by saying " no " " no dog " . I think it is the clear and recognizable match with the book that makes these little guys fun .
5 #### These finger puppets catch the attention of the younger ones ( 2 - 4 years ) but sometimes it takes some convincing for a child to want to put their fingers into the sockets , go figure !
5 #### The best thing about this roomy bag is that it 's washable ! !
5 #### I love the vibrant colors of all these pocket folders and they are so helpful for organizing important papers to keep at my fingertips . The price is the best part , too !
5 #### Came with all of the pieces to replace a boring seat , including soft rubber washer - like plugs so that it does n't tighten too much against the fragile porcelain toilet surface . The metal was as shiny as pictured . The ' scallop ' design was more of a ' rope ' design , as it 's more twisted than scalloped , but works well with the decor . It is heavier than the prior seat , and can sound loud when closing , but I have n't noticed any damage from the handful of times that it was dropped shut . I will definitely look for something similar when replacing other bathroom seats . Much nicer than the ones found in big box stores nearby .
4 #### Goes great with the " Five Little Monkeys jumping on the Bed " Book . Ca n't you see those little monkeys tossing on your bed as you read ? About 5 inches tall . , dressed cute for bed in their pajamas .
5 #### My son Alexander loves his 5 monkeys ! It 's pricey but worth it . If you love the book then it 's a must have .
3 #### They are really cute but much smaller than I thought ! My fifteen month old grandson loved them but also lost them easily .
5 #### These are so adorable . I ordered them to go with the book . My grandson loves playing with these when I read him the book .
5 #### These are the best tweezers ever ! I ca n't believe I ever used anything else . They make plucking my eyebrows so easy .
5 #### I love it ! I use them to keep track of my work schedule in and it fits just fine in my back jeans pocket and holds up well throughout the year . I would not hesitate to order from this seller again .
5 #### I bought a set of these for each of our grandsons . They are absolutely adorable . We bought them every five little monkey books . They were so happy to get these . What a great addition to the books .
5 #### My girls have all the 5 Little monkey books , these are a great addition to our collection . Fit on your fingers nice and snug , and are very good quality !
5 #### These are Great ! I bought these to entertain my kids on the plane ride and they were perfect . Little fingers fit well larger fingers ( female ) fit ok and really large finger ( Male ) Not well at all .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for my cousin for his birthday . I let him pick it out . He is very pleased with this and I am more than pleased with the quality of this lanyard .
5 #### This was given as a gift to a couple who were honeymooning at Disney . They came back to me after opening it with the comment , " You always find the best gifts ! It is so cute . We love it ! " As I did not open the box , I am giving their review as my own .
5 #### Loved this ! They are really cute . I do singing time for a group of toddlers and 3 - year olds and they were so excited when I brought these out . They are a little tight on the fingers like somebody else mentioned . I have tiny hands and they were a little difficult to put on the first time since you have to put your fingers under the back of their shirts . However , it 's totally worth it when you do . :) I 'm hoping it 'll stretch out a bit and become easier over time . Overall a great product and I 'm glad I made the purchase !
4 #### My son loves to recite the No More Monkeys Jumping on the Bed story . When I bought him the book with all 5 stories I saw these to go along with it . They 're cute , and he does enjoy them but they 're a tad be awkward . They 're too big to really be finger puppets on an adult 's hand , let alone a 3 year old 's hand . They do velcro together so they can hold hands and you can make them jump . He was excited about them , but they are n't really a favorite of his . I probably would n't pay that much money for them again .
5 #### These finger puppets were as I expected . 5 monkeys that look like the ones in Christelow 's stories . they measure 5 " each and fit my adult finger as well as a child 's fingers . I am very happy with them .
5 #### Great quality leather cover , worth the price difference . I bought the leather version of this pocket diary after reading that the glue on the non - leather version was weak and the pages broke out . I 'm glad I did . The glue in this version is very nice and no pages have gotten loose or even seem loose at this stage . From the tightness of the bind and past experience , I 'm guessing that wo n't change as the year goes on , but I 'll amend this review if it does . I 've bought At - a - Glance pocket diaries for my dad for years and really have n't had any complaints . However , after buying the version with the leather cover this year , I 'm very pleased with the jump in quality . It 's definitely worth the ~$10 difference in price that I paid . Much nicer in looks and feel ... Dad also noted the quality and was very happy with the diary . The quality and compactness off this pocket diary is a given . For those who do n't like using the calendar in their phone , the hand - held diary is must . The one negative about this diary is that I wish it had a design that let one slip the address book out of one diary and into the next year 's diary . Many year 's ago , Dad received free leather pocket diaries that he shared with all the family members that had that feature and it was incredibly handy .
4 #### Fun for Archer fans . Hard to keep on for a long time because of the material they used to keep the mouth stiff .
5 #### This bear is very soft and cute but not sturdy . It 's probably good for a baby . I returned it because I did n't think it would hold up well to my 3 year old .
5 #### This teardrop crystal is so lovely . I have it hanging on my patio and when the sun catches the crystal it reflects color everywhere around it . I am looking for another one in a different style . It was a great price !
5 #### I love Sizzix Bigz ! I really hate buying other dies because you can use lightweight chipboard with the Bigz . I do have trouble using a medium weight ( 57/58pt ) . But the lightweight ( 24pt ) works really well .
5 #### good value , shipped to me so I know , and given as a gift .
5 #### Bought as a birthday gift it was well received . Not know anything about this subject it was nice to be able to order it online .
5 #### Fun game but takes a while to get instructions ...
5 #### Item arrived promptly . A fun addition to the birthday party !
4 #### We buy a new one every year to keep track of all appointment . It is just the right size to fit comfortably in a purse or your pocket . The space is write on each date is entirely sufficient . It is nice looking and durable . Highly recommended .
5 #### Excellent yarn . The blanket I made turned out perfect ! !
5 #### I bought these for my dogs because the like small toys and tend to not tear them up . These are pretty sturdy and my dogs love , just do n't give them to dogs without supervision .
5 #### These work great to save on dishes , very sturdy wo n't get soggy and limp like other plates .
5 #### My budgies love this stuff . It 's perfect for them during any stressful time . Whether unexpected , or ongoing . Add this to your bird 's food , or give it as sole food , to help your bird ' stress level stay down . I definitely recommend keeping a bag handy just in case you ever need it .
5 #### Arrived on time . These are extra large plates and very sturdy .
5 #### Absolutely amazing ! It looks brand new ( better than described ! ) Shipping was fast . I 'm so happy with this purchase . Thank you .
5 #### Bought this as a gift , so I 'm not sure how they will wash and dry . But the pattern is beautiful . I was actually thinking of keeping one for myself . I do wish that it had made more clear that there were 3 towels in the packet which might have saved me some money on other gifts .
5 #### Very cute , detailed and safe dinosaurs and adorable caveman . My favorite is the tree .
5 #### Nice color . Just the size for single portion of soup or pasta . Great color .
5 #### This printer paper is very good quality ! It comes in many colors and prints are smudge free ! Thanks for a wonderful paper !
5 #### Super cute and soft ! It 's even cuter in person and a great addition to the book .
5 #### So cute ! Love dies that come with stamps ! Used with my cuttlebug
5 #### Super big hit for my 5 year old girl that is obsessed with unicorns . They have issues standing on carpet , but she just puts them on a book to stand .
5 #### My good friend is a big fan of red foxes . So she got this as one of her Christmas presents . I love the sweet face and super shiny finish . It sits very flat and looks great even if you just have it on a shelf . It looks even better near the sink to drop rings on while washing dishes or doing food prep .
5 #### This was very cute and appeared to be high quality . I was sending it to my husband 's granddaughter , though , so I did n't get to spend a lot of time with it . I chose this plushie because it did n't have button eyes and was for a one year old child . It had nice soft " fur " , so I think she will like to cuddle with it .
5 #### I love doing them and for the price I love it . If you go to walmart you will price lot more for it .
5 #### My 4 year old daughter bought this " with her own money " that she earned from dog sitting and she is thrilled with her purchase . She loves this toy and it seems to be holding up very well .
5 #### My daughter had been asking for a purple pony for the LONGEST time . I could not find anything except Minimum , Sofia 's horse until I found this . Some sellers had this one for nearly $ 50 which is ridiculous ... this price was much better . The horse is very good quality ... typical of Barbie things and my daughter is smitten . Cute glitter accents , lovely purple hair .
5 #### Hours of fun . Can catch a variety , from bugs to lizards .
5 #### This paper is beautiful . We will have a hard time choosing between the front and the back for our project , as both sides are exquisite . All of the color work together , eve when you would n't expect it . Put in the right order , they help tell the story . We bought some of the matching accessories , and are really happy with how they go without being too matchy - matchy .
5 #### Great seller excellent item . Will be buying another one for grandsons 9th birthday in March . Exceeded my expectations .
5 #### BEAUTIFUL unicorn ! ! ! Very nice and very happy with it .
5 #### These are great for anyone that might be bedridden or unable to get into a bathtub . Heat in the microwave and you have a warm soothing bath that will get clean and you will feel refreshed .
5 #### Great price . my daughter loves this purple unicorn , plays with it all the time .
5 #### My twins adore this playmat . We " play in the ocean " every day . The whale makes a fun bubbling sound that captured both of their attention early on . Soon , one was particularly interested in making the turtle rattle , while the other loved looking at the " pentapus " ( only 5 legs , so not technically an octopus , but beloved nonetheless ) . They figured out how to kick the arches to make all the toys move -- one of their first experiences with cause - and - effect ! Now that they 're a little bigger , they love grabbing onto the toys ' various parts . They have been known to play on here for more than an hour , quite content . The pillow is great for propping up little heads or helping slightly bigger babies with tummy time . The mat washes easily in the washing machine and air dries quickly . An observation and recommendation : the arches are a little high , making the toys hard for very little ones to reach . That was fine when they were happy just watching them move , but once they were interested in interacting more we added a link or two from a separate set so the toys hang lower . It 's been working really well .
5 #### My granddaughter is all about unicorns so I know she 'll love it .
5 #### Got for sister whose dogs kick her out of bed ! Lol .
5 #### Used this for book hardware for Halloween props . Very happy ! Looks great !
5 #### Someone call HR , this dolphin is out of control .
5 #### what can one say about lunch napkins ? they came just as they look . They work like a napkin should .
5 #### I get the same Lang pocket calendar " every " year . This is a well made product and it comes with an outer sleeve that keeps it from getting tore up in my purse . The paper quality is good and smooth to write on . Very wet markers or pend ( or white - out ) needs to dry a few seconds or it will transfer to the other page when closed . And for me personally , I like very much that it 's few holiday pictures are not over - the - top , over - cute , or distracting from what I 'm using the calendar for .
5 #### I love her ! She was the last one I needed ! Thanks !
5 #### Absolutely darling ! And perfect for my Granddaughters doll house :)
5 #### Just as described . With cost wish it would have had more accessories with it . Either way my daughter loves it .
5 #### All other brands of tweezers I have tried have been very frustrating to use . Those from Tweezerman are the only ones that hold onto fine hairs well enough to pull them out .
5 #### I use this card for photos and for video . It is a great option for large storage if going on a long trip .
5 #### I lover the K&K Company double sided specialty paper pad , I do a lot of scrapbooking and love to use patterned paper . I also do a lot of paper cutting with my Cricut machine and the double sided paper is perfect for most of my projects . I highly recommend this paper pad for all crafters .
5 #### It was a lot bigger than I thought it was . Which is a great thing . I love it ! Went perfect with the rest of the set .
5 #### If you have to run a legacy DOS program , it 's getting progressively harder to find these things . There 's also the issue of a maximum length for a functional parallel cable before things start malfunctioning . This one works just fine , and is inexpensive , as well . ( So how much more can one rave about a rather intentionally mundane object ? )
5 #### I sourced and purchased this Belkin cable at Amazon because of its remarkably low price there for the features I was seeking . It 's a great deal for a 25 ' length printer cable of this type and it works perfectly . Now , I can connect and remotely operate my existing computer printer that I 've manged to keep working way beyond it 's anticipated lifespan . This ' one small victory despite the computer printer industry 's diabolical world of cross subsidy business models that totally dominates our printer markets .
5 #### My little girl loves unicorns and her favorite color is purple . She loves it and it has held up to little kid abuse very well .
5 #### I love my mask ! soft , complete black out , wonderful ! I will probably order another one for travel . Really great mask !
5 #### the description says heavy weight polyester .... they are n't lying ... this is the best material ever .... it is surely army strong .... i love it ... and i m almost sure it will last for a very long time , even in the florida sun .
5 #### It was a gift for my wife al was excellent , this brand is her favorite and use it every day .
5 #### My 4 year old went crazy when she opened this on Christmas morning . She just adores it . Good quality toy . Just as I expected .
5 #### My grandson loves animals , insects , anything that moves . Living in Florida , he loves to catch little lizards in his back yard and study them close up , before releasing them . He also catches every insect he finds and researches it . He also uses it for cathcing tadpoles in the local stream .
5 #### We did n't even know they had a unicorn for Barbie . Thank goodness , because this was what our daughter asked for from Santa .
5 #### This and another Wedgwood ornament were my wife 's favorite Christmas presents . I thought this angel one in particular was rather unique . If you like to buy nice ornaments for your tree , this will please you or the person you buy it for .
3 #### Got as part of a explorer dress up set with hats net tools vest great gift ideas for my little explorers
5 #### My 5 year old asked Santa for a unicorn . She got this one and was thrilled . It is a beautiful purple and blue and perfect for playing with dolls or by itself .
5 #### this is very cute . my 4 year old daughter loves it . the people come out of the sleigh & she just wishes she could change out the horses but other than that , its nice .
5 #### Very pretty little toy , my daughter loves it ! There is another one that is a tad more expensive with the same color scheme . I 'd suggest pinching the penny 's and getting this one . The kids ca n't tell the difference and will love it !
5 #### very sturdy and easy for my four year old to remove / put on bridle and saddle . And its much larger than other Barbie horse dolls
5 #### Oh my gosh , I know this is silly , but using this peeler is actually fun . It works incredibly well , and I peel A LOT of potatoes at my house . We 've owned it for almost 4 months now and it is still as awesome as it was when we first got it .
5 #### I bought this for my son 's pirate - themed nursery and the product is great ! It is very soft and well - made . I would definitely recommend to others !
5 #### Small engine mechanic so sometimes you need a smaller more versatile tool . this is great for that . fist good in my hand ratcheting bearings feel robust . I really do enjoy this tool .
5 #### My daughter takes this hippo everywhere and sleeps with him at night . Very soft , snuggly and cute ! It 's such a great product because you can order the " mommy " hippo , the baby and the matching lovey . We bought them all !
5 #### These framelits with stamps set are great ... They are so easy to use . Makes my card making so much easier and fast to work with .
5 #### My daughter has the same hippo but in the small size . She was just so happy to have a second and much bigger flatopotamus . The hippo is very soft and perfect for snuggling .
5 #### My 4 month old loves these little guys . The red T - Rex squeaks and the baby in the egg makes a crinkle noise . The little cave man has fuzzy hair that we rub our sons hands over introducing him to textures . The cave itself is not really played with at all right now , but I 'm sure it will be played with in the future . We are really happy with this purchase .
5 #### The Tim Holtz hardware findings die by Sizzix is the kind of die that you 'll keep on thinking of multiple ways to use it . You can use it to cut prints from a variety of materials , or use it to cut grungeboard to finish in any way you want . The 3 elements in the die are spaced just right , so that you can isolate the piece(s ) you want to cut . In addition , Sizzix dies are very well constructed , and they last for a long time . I highly recommend this die .
5 #### Received merchandise in a timely fashion , have n't had too much time to use them yet , but am planning on doing paper cuttings very soon . , A new fun hobby !
5 #### Soo cute They dangle so nice . they are longer than I thought they would be . they sway nicely lambs are so cute ! !
5 #### I LOVE the titanium scissors and these are nice and sharp and the tip is sharp . They cut tape ( even Duck ( yes Duck ) ) tape well with no sticky aftermath . And , best part , they are fun with very colorful handles . I use mine mainly for paper and tape but occasionally cut fabric and they work great .
5 #### BOUGHT FOR MY SON FOR CHRISTMAS HE IS 3Y OLD NOW AND HAS BEEN WANTING A NET FOR QUITE A WHILE AND THIS NET IS PERFECT AND EXACTLY WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR . SEEMS PRETTY STURDY TO FOR THE AMOUNT OF USE THAT IT GETS !
5 #### This set is smaller than mine . Bought as a gift for my son 's girl friends Birthday . Not given to her as yet . Checked the set out and it is very nice , I hope she will like them .
5 #### loving this little hippo he is so cute and soft perfect for a lil crib buddy for my baby to come
5 #### This little play set is so cute ! Love the red - headed cave man . I bought them for a baby but even the now grown toddler still likes to carry these around .
5 #### Very good product . I actually like these " besteva " pillows better than the " too poofy " Pillow Pets . My son got his first one before the Pillow Pets even came out and he has had it 4 + years and still loves it . I bought this one for my nephew and another one for my younger son . Good purchase !
5 #### I have purchased just about every imaginable Summit Backyard Safari product for my oldest son ( just turned 4 years old ) . He loves all of them . This one came with one of the patches , which my son LOVES for his safari vest , and he and his 2.5 year old brother had oodles of fun using it to " catch " each other . The netting seems heavy duty enough to withstand whatever my kids will throw it at , and the green rope that it is stretched around is nice and thick , but also gentle enough that it does n't hurt them or any of my house when they are tossing it around . I really love all of this company 's products . The kids have left them in the backyard in the rain / sprinklers , and although they are dirty , they are still perfectly usable . I recommend this product , and all of the Backyard Safari products for any family with inquisitive , creepy - crawly loving little ones . It encourages their interests in an age appropriate , and fun way .
5 #### This is just the right size for women and stubby - sized jobs -- or men . I can never find my ratchets , but have sockets all over the basement ; garage ; shop ; and barn . You can COUNT on the fact that wherever my SOCKETS are , the ratchets are somewhere else . THIS ratchet -- all by itself -- saves me from looking for a couple ratchets ! Thank God ... and MAXCRAFT ! " Big Mac " GERMANY
5 #### Tho this was not on that child 's list , it was my choice to present it ... he was delighted , and happened to be wearing a Monkey shirt at the time . Before long , his head was on Monkey as a pillow , near the Christmas tree . I am glad I ordered it . The service was fine .
5 #### The little monkey is so soft . He is so easy to hold and snuggle with . He was a gift for my gradson for his birthday . He named the monkey " Ceasar " like the movie . He loves his monkey .
5 #### This is a simple and basic design , available from many companies . But , I really like this one . It seems well made and is attractive . But , most of all it is comfortable for my cats . They really love using it ! From one to four cats is on it at any given time , as they pile onto it together . I am not sure why it is so special for them , but I already bought a " back up " for when they ruin this one ! There have been a couple of vomiting issues from the lazy ones already , and it spot cleaned real well . So , I would highly recommend this bed .
5 #### The Sizzix dies by Tim Holtz are my favorite cutting dies for my Big Shot cutting - and - embossing machine . They 're thick , sturdy , and sharp enough to cut through thin metal and wood in addition to the usual paper and cardstock . With this " Hardware Findings " die , I 've used both metal and heavy cardstock . With the metal cut - outs , I used different rusting techniques which looked great . I used a random " bumpy " patterned embossing folder on the cardstock cut - outs and then used some painting techniques to age the " hardware . " A bit of crackle - finish jazzed them up even more . Compared to the regular retail price , this is a good price for the Bigz dies , especially with Amazon Prime 's 2 - day free shipping . For many of my Sizzix purchases , I use the weekly 40 - 50 % discount coupons that my local craft stores offer . But since many of the various dies or embossing folders are not available in the stores near me , these listings on Amazon are a great option .
5 #### These Mighty World sets are great fun , and worth every penny of the price paid . We have since purchased several more " worlds " for our grandchildren . They have enough components and fascinating little details to keep kids interested and imagining for a very long time .
4 #### Our little guy is too young to use it to catch butterflies yet but we have been floating things for him to pick up with it in his pool . He 's still so young , it 's mainly used to get things out from under couches and to whack people ! I think it will be used more at the lake and such as he gets a little older !
5 #### I have never enjoyed a kitchen product more ! I have been patiently waiting to be able to buy them through Amazon . They were given as gift for our wedding four years ago . We received many different kinds of food storage options - glass Pyrex bowls with plastic lids , clear Rubbermaid containers with black lids , and these . They are the easiest to use , the easiest to store when not in use , and the BEST at keeping food fresh . I will be completely replacing any Pyrex or Rubbermaid food storage with more of these . So excited to have only these . THEY ARE THE BEST ! !
5 #### I bought this to top a Diaper Cake I made for a baby shower . The theme of the bedding was monkeys and I could n't find one anywhere that really spoke to me . This is a beautiful stuffed animal , worth what I paid and am happy with not only the purchase , but how quickly I received the package !
5 #### The outlets are a little tight by todays standards but I purchased some extenders to handle the larger AC adapters .
5 #### This is a nice companion for my daughter . She enjoys playing with it and it keeps her company at night . It is very soft and can handle her playing rough with it . I also found it soft and very hugglable .
5 #### i had totally forgotten i purchased this on amazon like 7 years ago ! ! ! omg , maybe longer . this has always been a highlight in my kitchen from over 4 apartments and a cross country move ! lol i love it . it 's simple and holds a significant amount of fruit . looks great and is always a brightening piece for a bar . the little hammock things do bend and all the fruit falls out occasionally , that just means you need to tighten the screws underneath the base . have a blast with it , it 's totally worth the money .
5 #### I purchased the Lambs and Ivy Hamper and was very nice . My daughter saw it on the website . Glad I bought it .
5 #### I love this stuff . Easy to use , makes my skin feel great . If I skip the after shower moisturizer , it 's no big deal if I 've used this stuff in the shower . Just have trouble finding it around here , so I 'm glad to be able to get it through Amazon . It makes the shower very slippery for the next person , so be sure to squirt the shower floor with a cleanser of some sort when you 're done .
5 #### i Got it for our golden ... it 's easy to do her hair also my 4 year old daugther could help by this comb too ... i like it
5 #### Three mouse for the price I paid , I 'm really satisfied . it has been a year and still works very well . I love Optical mouse because it does n't need battery and save some environmental hazzard .
5 #### This battery kit comes with the charging adapter for GN 9300 series headset and the battery . I use it on 9350 and it is nice because it keeps the spare battery charged and I can swap it out during phone call when the battery gets low after about 6 hours of use . The battery starts to hold less charge after about a year of regular use , so I buy this regularly . Note that this battery kit is often cheaper than just buying the battery alone .
5 #### These scissors are very sharp and work great for a variety of crafts . They cut through paper like butter and are tough enough to make it through fabrics . They are small ( 5 inches ) , but are great for small jobs . They 're also very pretty and have a cover for the blades .
5 #### Our son has been sleeping with this for the past year . His " froggy " has traveled with us all over , and he enjoys touching the silky side as well as the fluffy side as he falls asleep . It 's great that the " lovey " has a face , but is also more of a blanket as well . A perfect choice for a baby shower gift for either gender . The froggy washes up great in the washing machine which is a must for a toddler !
5 #### My order was here in 3 days after i ordered it ! i was very pleased with it and i bought it as a gift and think she will love it ! !
5 #### My whole family has to deal with constant dry skin . This product has been fantastic for us ! It has especially made a difference for my children . Highly recommended !
5 #### Really annoyed that this product was discontinued but happy I found it here . Came fast and packaged against leaks . Love this line , smells like shampoo , not flowers and fruit . Hope it comes back some day . Doubt it .
5 #### This knife is worth every penny . I bought it for my husband to complete a set of the Shun Onion knives and I have to say it was a case of saving the best for last . All of these knives are wonderfully balanced and fit very nicely into the hand . The serated knife is perfect for delicate cuts on soft foods and slices tomato into paper thin pieces with ease .
5 #### Both our Kids one and three years old LOVE these buckets . They play with them just about every day . They are sturdy , fun , educational and affordable . A great purchase , highly recommended .
5 #### Not only do the Mighty World series toys make imaginative play options limitless , but the fact that they incorporate women into many leadership positions makes them awesome for young girls . Megan the Marine Biologist and some of the other camp / research figures that are female are great for showing girls that they too can be a part of what was once considered male - dominated jobs or roles . The creators of this series thought of EVERYTHING when it came to accessories as well . Great job ! The boats even float in the bathtub !
5 #### I gave this doll to my grandaughter for Christmas even tho she 's still too young to do anything more than chew on it . ( which she loves to do - glad it 's washable ) It is adorable . I 'm sure it will be a favorite .
5 #### This toy is so great . We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and we are so pleased that we did . She loves it and it has become a part of her magical fairytale adventure ! This is a great toy for kids to explore their imagination . The horse does not come out of its harness and is attached to the sleigh . The " prince " is removable and so is the princess . It is truly a beautiful toy , well - made yet so intricate !
5 #### LOVE this .. littlesmaller than pillow pet but that makes it more cute and easier to travel ..... soft and cuddley
5 #### I purchased this for my daughter for a 14 + hour international flight - thinking it would be a toy & work for her to use while sleeping on the plane too . She fell in love with it immediately ! It is bigger than I expected - but I did n't look at the dimensions - so I was surprised but my daughter loves that it is so big ! She had a wonderful time opening it into a pillow and then closing it again with the velcro strip . It is well made , very soft , comfortable for even an adult to use as a smaller than normal size pillow . He has been dragged , rolled over by her doll carriage , sat upon , slept on , pulled on ( ears , tail , etc . ) and he seems to be withstanding the abuse very well ! We are very happy with him , and he now holds a permanent place of honor on her bed ( when he is not being played with , that is ! )
5 #### I just needed some simple basic mouses for a couple PCs that I use and these fit the bill . No extra functionality , just high quality basic mouses .
5 #### I knew once I started going to the tanning bed that I should invest in some products to keep my skin moisturized and healthy . One of the products I purchased was this Hempz Sunburn Relief & it REALLY works great ! I usually use it on my really dry areas first , and then after it completely dries I go over the area again with a good moisturizing lotion . I signed up to the subscribe & save so I could get it mailed to me on a regular basis , because it really does work great ! I have had my kids use it on there skin too ! Its nice to put on after a day in the sun , or just on every day dry skin . I would totally recomend this product .
5 #### I received this window sticker awhile back . It 's very cute . I have n't used it yet , but I plan on putting it on the back window of my car .
5 #### I have had my set of these pans for 5 years now and they are nowhere near ready to replace . I have gotten my moneys worth like no other pans I have owned . The lid on this one is not glass like some other models of Caphalon One . The anodized aluminum transfers heat fast and evenly , the non - stick surface is very hard and effective , but do not use metal utensils should not scratch . If you have a big mess , just let some hot water sit in it for a few minutes and they just wipe clean . Be careful what scrubbers you use so you do not scratch it , I use a nylon brush to wipe the goop out in the sink . If you do get something to stick , do not use scouring powder , only Bark Keepers Friend powder can scrub without scratching . The ergonomic handle that does not get hot , depending on how you use it . It is not dishwasher safe . Like the big dutch ovens and casseroles from Caphalon One , this pan is oven safe to 500 degrees .
5 #### These buckets are fantastic for children who are stable on their feet - I would not give these to babies not able to walk and stand comfortably or just learning to walk / cruise , because they can fall on them and though wo n't get seriously injured most likely , it would hurt ( and might crack the plastic ) . They are rated for 18 months+ for this reason no doubt . Excellent toy , my older ( 4 yo ) daughter also likes to use the buckets individually for carrying / organizing things as if she 's shopping , etc .
5 #### I have been using these for over a year and they really do keep the food fresher and I am not throwing away my leftovers anymore ! Great product !
5 #### This has such pretty detail & is wonderful for my daughters make believe princess games . I highly recommend this set .
5 #### Here 's what I like about this toothpaste : 1 ) my dentist says it 's the best toothpaste from an overall oral care perspective because it contains more than just fluoride , but also an antibacterial ingredient for overall gum health and to reduce tartar buildup ; 2 ) a small amount does the job , so you 're not wasting product and money ; 3 ) the packaging is just perfect , no annoying tube that takes up a ton of space in the medicine cabinet , with the flat lid on this little squeeze bottle you can also store it upside down so you can serve up the amount you need with no waiting , then flip the lid closed , all with one hand . Unfortunately , it 's been impossible to find Colgate TOTAL in liquid gel form in stores these days , so I 'm very grateful to have found it here on Amazon .
5 #### To put it bluntly ..... this lamp is a real wife pleaser . I do n't think it would be unfair or uncomplimentary of me to say that more women than men are usually more concerned with the esthetics , artistry , appearance , decor , etc . of a floor lamp . Having said that , after doing some research ..... I decided to take a chance by purchasing this lamp for my wife who has worked in the fashion industry and also as an artist . I regard her as being asute and particular when it comes to picking out a lamp she likes . After showing here scores of pictures of lamps which she rejected , I ordered this lamp which turned out to be a real wife pleaser . This lamp was good enough to not only please my wife but for her to comment that it was much nicer than she thought it would be .
5 #### I ordered these for chardonney because this size is about 4 oz smaller than the actual chardonney glasses ... these are still quite huge . All 4 glasses made it here without any damage eventhough they were delivered by usps and not packaged that great . Very different look , elegant , delicate ... definitely will get attention . The stem is incredibly thin but not fragile . I have n't even used the glasses yet , rating is based on appearance and feel only . Great value ! Update on 10/17/9 : These are now the ONLY glasses that we use . Even my husband had to admit that our usual wine tastes better / softer / different from these great glasses . I have washed them in dishwasher many times ( at an angle ) with no problems ... I am one happy wine lover . Update 1/6/2011 . I just ordered my second set of these gorgeous wine glasses . These are my favorite ones ! Amazon packs the set much better now than when I ordered my 1st set almost 1.5 years ago .
5 #### I use this for so many things that I have lost count . This whisk is not for whipping egg whites into clouds , this is for the other 500 things that a balloon whisk is n't best suited for because you can really get the bottom of the bowl or cup you mix in since the head is flat . For example : - Mixing vinaigrette - Loosely whipping an egg before you put it in a recipe - Tempering eggs before adding to hot liquid - Mixing cream into melted chocolate for truffles - Mixing up cornstarch or flour in hot liquid for thickening - Mixing sugar with warm water before adding to lemonade - Creating a slurry of spices and warm oil to brush on meats - Reconstituting powdered milk without lumps - Etc . The only thing I would not recommend is mixing warm water and powdered egg whites together with this whisk , the tight coil quickly gets clogged . Aside from that , I use it for everything . Highly recommend !
5 #### Love this product ! Not only does it protect your face with a high SPF ( 70 + ) , it does not sting , feel excessively sticky or greasy , and it 's good for your skin . I have n't used it long enough to see if it improves the sun damage , but I use this daily and love it . One caution- it does hold out to sweating and swimming , but hurts if sweat drips into your eyes . Use caution .
5 #### Great soap , nice and frothy even with hard water , rinses clean . Deodorant bars can be very perfume - y , but I 'm sensitive to scent and was worried even about the sage & lemongrass in this bar ... but it really is pretty much unscented . There is a faint soap scent but not even close to being noticeable . I have been looking for awhile for a good natural unscented soap ... many of the bars I found were either hard bricks that did n't lather up well or else melted away fast in the shower . This soap lathers beautifully and lasts , so now I buy it in bulk and save .
5 #### I purchased this thinking it had separate drawers inside as the one I purchased for my daughter 6 years ago had . It does n't . The cover does not have a frame but a cute picture of Pooh . It also is n't very large . It is a good box if you want something plain to hold photos or maybe baby 's first outfit or such but do n't expect much . I was impressed that Amazon refunded my $ $ even though I removed the plastic , since it did n't fit the description . If you purchase be aware that it is only a decorative cardboard box .
5 #### My 17 month old loves to stack the buckets up then knock them down , over and over again . We have n't talked much about the pictures on the sides of the buckets , showing opposites ( short vs. tall , none vs. many , etc . ) . He also loves to carry the biggest bucket like a purse and put stuff in it . These are very durable ( he is tough on things ) and I would highly recommend them . I think he will be playing with them for months to come .
5 #### I love this whisk and use it constantly . It is compact , sturdy , easy to clea , and attractive . If you have children that like to " help " you in the kitchen , I would recommend getting one just for them .
5 #### This is an outstanding pan . I 've used it a lot . Cooks great , cleans up great . Pans like this can also be used for a very sanitary litter box . The handles come in handles for all uses .
5 #### Hi ! It 's early Christmas morning and all of our kids and grandkids have long since left for home . The very favorite toy that the kids were able to play with tonight was the stacking set I purchased for our grandson who is 16 months old . His Daddy was showing him how to stack the buckets when the three 2 year old grandchildren and the four year old caught the act and started to play with them , too . It quickly became apparent that I should have bought four more sets for the other grandkids as well - and maybe even one to have a grandma 's house . The kids loved stacking the buckets , and then fitting them inside of themselves and figuring out the size differences and what fits and does n't fit , etc . Very educational for all of them . I 'm glad I got at least one set .
5 #### The Alora diffuser is a no fuss solution to room fragrance . I 've tried other diffusers , but this brand is definitely the best . It lasts for months , offers a good variety of sophisticated scents and requires no care whatsoever . The Festa scent is wonderfully warm and spicy . It 's only available around the holidays , however .
5 #### I was a little hesitant to get this at first since the model # 's did not match that of the battery for the HD1010 , but it has been working just fine !
5 #### nice griddle - perfect pancakes even browning . great for french toast - perfect browning . size is perfect . Well made .
5 #### Was trying to make the commitment to purchase the All Clad LTD saucier . Kept reading the reviews to the Kitchen Aid and decided I did not want to spend twice the price on the All Clad . Thhis saucier does not disappoint in any way . Shaped well , easy to clean , beautiful and cooks like a dream ! Love it !
5 #### It 's the little groove that does the trick by immediately releasing the aroma , bouquet -- the essence of the wine -- which results in a deeper enjoyment of even a mid - priced wine . Highly recommended
5 #### I purchased three sets of these bricks for my daughter when she was 2 . She is now 5 , and still plays with them . They are great for fostering imagination . She likes to lay them out and create the boundaries for a " house " or a " store " . Sometimes , they are the fence around a farm and all her animals go inside . Sometimes we just stack them as high as we can and have fun knocking them down . The bricks are surprisingly durable considering they are made of cardboard . My daughter weighs 42 lbs now and they are still supporting her weight ( though I do n't think they were meant to do so ) .
5 #### I ordered this mini F - Pin cable for my bedroom TV . I was using a ' generic ' standard F - pin cable to my bedroom TV and the signal was very bad - I had interference , moir&eacute ; patterns , and ghosting . Replacing my generic cable with this Monster Video mini made all the difference . My picture is clear and interference free now , and the cable is so think that it sort of disappears from view , unlike the unsightly black cable that I used to have . I like the 90 degree turn on one end and small profile , which allows me to let my furniture hug the wall against my cable jack . At first I was worried about whether such a thin ( i.e. not well insulated ) cable would pick up transient noise , but this cable performs much better than the standard cable . I highly recommend this cable . However , please note that if you run this across your floor , the thinness and lightweight nature of the cable might cause it to get tangled up in your vacuum cleaner .
5 #### My wife uses this every day and she really enjoys it . It gives her a very nice complexion .
5 #### I own a set and some extra pieces of KitchenAid 5 - Ply SS Clad cookware , and this is my favorite piece . Read the reviews , then go and splurge on it -- it will last you a lifetime ! ! !
5 #### The v4 , the newest american tamagotchi , is much like its previous japanese counterparts , the entama and uratama . This tamagotchi goes to school , interviews for jobs , and then has a career . Each career has its own game , so there are many more games on this tama than the v3 . There is also a mail icon that flashes when your tama gets mail . [ ... ]
5 #### I purchased these blocks for my one year - old grandchild , whom I watch everyday during the week . He LOVED them ! Actually , all of my grandkids from ages 1 through 8 had a blast playing with these blocks when they came over for Christmas . I ordered the 12 - piece set of jumbo blocks to supplement the 40 piece basic set . I highly recommend getting both sets so that your kids have enough pieces in all sizes .
5 #### These cardboard blocks are made of a good quality cardboard . They are sturdy and hold up well . Children can enjoy creating their own life - size houses , castles , towers etc . An excellent toy for the young builder .
5 #### My 13 month old and my 3 year old love playing with these buckets . We had some before that had a small lip on them making it somewhat difficult to stack . But stacking these are easy and it makes a huge tower that is fun to knock over .
5 #### The Mrs. Meyer 's Clean Day Kits are not only effective , they are wonderfully scented . Lemon Verbena cleaners have been a favorite all summer , but now as winter approaches you might want to try the " Gingerbread " Scent as it is simply delicious ! The kit includes an All Purpose Cleaner with interesting ingredients like Birch Bark and it goes to work on floors to produce a lustrous shimmer . The plant derived surfactants in the Countertop Spray deep clean everything from counters to baseboards and more . I washed down doors , walls and anything else I could find to clean . The scent in the cleaners makes cleaning much more fun than normal . While using the dish soap , the fragrance permeates the air . The Liquid Hand Soap also contains Aloe and Olive Oil , making it soothing and healing . The kit is a fun place to start , but there is an entire line of Mrs. Meyers cleaning products , including amazing powdered scrubs , laundry care items and home fragrance candles . I 've loved everything I 've tried so far and love trying new fragrances . I think the new Gingerbread scent is a real winner for the holiday season . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### I ca n't add much to the other reviews , other than they are 100 % right on . We really do n't like to run the AC in our apartment at night ( and do n't like paying for it ) but with our Vornado running on the lowest setting and pointed just over our heads , we are as comfortable as possible . Be sure and get one with the continuously variable speed settings , so you can run it really slowly ( and quietly ) . No fan is completely silent , but you can hardly hear the motor at all , just the woosh of the air around the blades and through the vent . This is an excellent product .
5 #### I have to admit I was skeptical of the claims that I 've read about the Vornado but it works wonders ! It is very quiet on low - a little noisy on high but that 's to be expected . Point it at the ceiling and it still cools the whole room off . I hate having fans blowing directly on me so this is wonderful ! My husband heats up much faster than I do and this cools him off without freezing me out . I have a feeling our AC bill will be much lower this summer :) Thanks Vornado !
5 #### I have been wanting to get these cast iron wings for my saw since the first day I bought it but there have been other priorities so I waited . Now that I got them , I am sorry that I did not do so much earlier . The wings are perfectly flat and fit the main saw top very nicely and perfectly level . They add quite a bit of weight to the saw which is good even for an already great and smooth running saw . One word of warning to anyone who wants to upgrade to the 52 " fence is that the 52 " fence kit comes with an extension table that mounts to the saw table itself so you have to remove the wing on the right side . I bought two wings at the same time as the 52 " fence kit and now I have an extra wing hanging around .
5 #### I bought this for my Grandkids , they like to make pancakes and grill cheese sandwiches ect . with this . I only payed $ 14.99 , so it was a great buy . For that price I had to buy two ... I usually buy Calphalon Commercial , but I can see the way my Grandkids use this , it 's holding up very good , and they love it . You really do not have to use any type of oil or butter , nothing sticks .. and they say it washes up very easy .
5 #### I compared the Calphalon and All - Clad products to this one . The main differences are sturdier handles and slightly thicker metal on the high - end brands . I have used this product for some time and it works great . I actually bought the All - Clad but returned it when I found this one . It has a larger cooking surface area than the others . Greater surface area was my main reason for purchasing a double burner griddle . It heats evenly and is great for cooking pancakes , french toast , sausage , bacon , eggs .... and more . It has a lifetime warranty and can go in the oven up to 450 F. Highly recommended !
5 #### This is a good set , great for a new cook or as a house - warming gift , or just to fill out a cook 's colletion of pans . The two sizes -- * LARGE * and large -- allow for a number of possibilities . The largest pan is definitely big enough for a 20 + -pound turkey . It 's really huge ! The smaller of the two pans is 10.5"x15 " ( larger than the standard 9x13 baking pan ) , and could easily handle two chickens or a large pan of lasagne . The non - stick coating is on the inside as well as the outside -- a nice touch . Both pans have handles , which are attached to the sides of the pans via rivets ( they 're not just spot - welded ) , which are * NOT * coated with the nonstick coating . This means that some food can stick to these rivets on the inside of the pan . It 's a small inconvenience , though , when you consider the quality of these pans . They 're heavy enough to stand up to high temperatures without warping . It 's recommended that you wash these by hand -- I concur ( and I LOATHE washing dishes by hand ) , but these are really easy to clean up , due to the quality of the coating . Highly recommended !
4 #### I would recommend the game to anyone . The game is a lot of fun . The " Princess Bride " theme added a fun party atmosphere . My only complaint is that the movement tokens could have been designed better . I should explain that I have played with Aaron the game mechanic 's designer . He originally designed the game with a different theme . He still hopes to get it re - released with his original theme . I had him explain the game to me and the differences the two themes have . Also he said , there was some problem with the written instructions and the translation from his original theme , to the " Princess Bride " theme . No offense to Aaron , however I like the " Princess Bride " theme better than his other theme . In addition I found no problem with the rulebook . It was very easy to follow .
3 #### This is an ok game . There is a fair amount of strategy . but hey its based on my favorite movie .
4 #### So - so . Not as good as I thought it would be .
4 #### This game is really cool ... if you 're as big of a Princess Bride fan as I am . I love the innovative use of the situations of the film in a card game . Essentially , you place tiles to mark the obstacles on the way to , well , storming the castle . These tiles include the pit of despair , the cliffs of insanity , and other locations from the film . You use cards from your hand to help you get through the obstacles , make more obstacles for the other player , or get more / different cards . The first one to get past all their tiles to the castle is the winner ! I really enjoyed the game , but the rest of my family ( who enjoy the film , but have n't seen it the bazillion and a half times I have ; nor have they read the book ) was only humoring me by playing . The game is pretty complicated to get started , especially if you do n't have a solid grasp on all the aspects of the film . I would only recommend this if you are a HUGE fan , and if you know other big fans who would enjoy this type of game .
4 #### I"d like if these were smaller to make photocopies and be able to put 4 on a page or something . Otherwise , very cute and my PT kids love them
5 #### I purchased this Yogarilla card deck because when I observed my son in school with his occupational therapist , she was using these cars with him . I could n't believe my eyes that my ten year old was doing yoga and actually loving it ! I ordered the cards right away and even went ahead and purchased yoga mats for both my children at home . One thing about my daughter is , if she sees my son doing something , she wants to join in on the fun as well . They absolutely love Yogarilla and they both come home from school asking if they can do yoga with me . This is a beautiful card deck , very easy to use , thorough instructions on the back and Otis the gorilla on the front with each individual pose . They are color coded for certain positions , which is great . Super easy to use , and I highly recommend them , not just for school use , for parents as well !
5 #### Now we can play Gloom with an ever larger circle of friends .
4 #### I 've played them all and IMO this the only expansion that makes the game better . It adds a new family into the mix and a new type of card , locations . Locations come with their own unique cards that can only be played on locations . It 's a fun new twist to the game .
5 #### Great expansion . Makes Gloom even more immersive and competitive .
5 #### This is probably my favorite card game that I own , and I own a lot of games . It is completely original . I did n't think I 'd be very good at making up a story line that goes along with the actions played , but its easier than you 'd think and the end result is usually hilarious . I have already bought three of the expansions and I 'm working on getting the fourth as soon as the price goes back down . I 'd definitely recommend this game !
5 #### My friends and I love Gloom and this is our favorite expansion . This expansion contains another family set , so it increases total players to 5 . The new Homes cards add fun / an extra element to the game for more ways to help yourself or hinder your opponents . It also comes with more gloomy mishaps for modifier and event cards . If you are looking for an expansion to Gloom , I recommend this one .
5 #### In happy homes is a good improvement to a fun game , I perfer the unwelcome guests as far as a new mechanic added to the game but the houses are fun I enjoy the new family and the additional cards as variety .
5 #### need to be able to weave a story on the fly
5 #### If you like Gloom and are looking at the expansions , this is one of the better , if not best choices . The cards where just as high quality as the main game , and matched the main games cards nicely . The eerie and dark theme has been continued in this expansion , and it is added on to the base game naturally . 5/5 because : It 's one of if not the best expansion choice The cards look super great as usual !
4 #### After receiving this expansion for the wonderful Arkham Horror base game we decided to go all out and throw every expansion we has onto the playing field . With the maximum investigators so we could have people covering all points , we gave it a shot . Many a player were devoured , and many and old gods broke the seal and destroyed our world , but it was so much fun . The new Kingsport field was aimed at giving the players a bit more survivability , but the damage that could be done from a Rift opening was immense . Thoroughly enjoyable and well worth it . If you want your players to survive better , you can just include the playing field additions . Personally , we saw moving portals because of the Rifts opening , and it was a lot of fun having to deal with a portal opening , moving and then another one opening behind it . ( Apparently some of the smaller expansion have moving portals as well and we 're excited to combine these and attempt to survive . )
5 #### Arkham Horror is my all - time favorite game , and this expansion continues Fantasy Flight 's mission to provide quality games . This is one of three " town " expansions , letting Investigators leave Arkham and visit Kingsport . The rules are well - balanced and the pieces are on good stock and sport nice art .
4 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Kingsport - Horror / dp/1589943708 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Kingsport Horror</a > , the second " big box " expansion for&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Arkham - Horror / dp/1589942108 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Arkham Horror</a > , is a must purchase for fans of the board game . It adds new elements to pretty much every aspect of the base set : new investigators , new gates , new items , new encounters , new monsters , and ( last but not least ) the Epic Battle variation which adds a significant and challenging twist to your last stand against the Ancient One . But this expansion is more than just markers and mechanics : it also introduces characters and locations from a wide variety of Lovecraft 's writings into the game , making his world larger - and more frightening - whether you play with all of Kingsport or just mix a few extra cards into the standard game . 4 1/2 stars , rounded down because I find the rift progress mechanic unwieldy ( but still fun ) .
5 #### Everything in Kingsport is about power . The most powerful investigators . The toughest Ancient Ones . The best items . And much more difficult encounter cards . Kingsport is a must have expansion along with Dunwich Horror to get the most out of Arkham Horror after you 've learned the basics . We do n't always use the board though .
4 #### In terms of playability , Kingsport is much better than Innsmouth as it actually gives you some bonuses and things to do that help the investigators out . It also does n't have an endgame trigger the way that the Innsmouth track does . My Arkham friends and I play with this and Dunwich and not a lot else .
5 #### Dare to dream ? The mist shrouded Town of Kingsport awaits ! This expansion is really neat , adds the guardians ! Just some help when all else seems lost . Adds some really helpful characters to the mix . Worth the money , trust me .
4 #### My husband and I have only played a couple times , but it is definitely harder than Pandemic or House on the Hill(sic ) . This edition contains slightly different rules than the original release . It is helpful to have both . The other rules can be found at Boardgamegeek .
1 #### Found this game at a Value Village for $ 2 , seems like a good deal right ? Wrong , this game is not really a game , so much as it is interactively telling the story of Lord of the Rings . No decisions feel important and the game forces you down the path to tell the story the way it was in the books . If you fail at something you have to keep trying until the story works its way out , otherwise you lose . Dumb game , ripped it apart and used the pieces for other stuff .
5 #### I bought this because my husband and I are always looking for solid two player board games . This is awesome ! The art is wonderful and the rules are easy to pick up . It take some time to play and I would not describe it as a quick game to play .
4 #### Like the novels , this game can come across as quite the endeavour if you plan to finish it . Do not start this game with people who are not ready to play a long game that can be sometimes tedious but also at times very exciting ! When Sauron starts to move , you 'll see why this game is such a challenge to beat . If you 've got time , patience and determination to see it through , you 'll have fun .
5 #### This game takes a bit to understand and play but once your get the hang of it it 's a lot of fun , even my wife played with me ( though she was really hesitant and somewhat forced to at first ) and she loved it . The game is pretty hard but you can always change the rules a bit to make it easier . I would definitely recommend it , though is not really a casual game , it takes some commitment .
5 #### I bought this for my hubby and I since we do n't have a lot of two player games . Lots of fun ! Beautiful artwork too . Love it !
5 #### A Game of Throne : The Board Game First Edition has been my favorite game for a couple of years . This game has the best war strategy mechanics out of all the games I have played . The Second Edition just improved upon an already loved game . I wo n't go into depth of how it is played , but I would definitely recommend playing with someone that knows how to play your first time if possible . The rules can be a lot to take in at once , but is definitely worth the learning curve . A highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys long strategy games . Along with the additions of ports and siege engines , there are a couple minor rule changes with the second edition . So if you are going from first edition to second edition I recommend you do a thorough read through of the rules before playing . Having knowledge of the book is n't needed but definitely adds to gaming experience . I actually decided to read the books after enjoying first edition game so much . The only problem I had was my copy has a warped board , but after contacting Fantasy Flight I found out there was a cutting issues with some of the first prints . They were quick and responsive and are sending me out a new board .
5 #### Finally , your Arkham Horror play can tackle the horrors of Innsmouth ! It was well worth the wait . Firstly , naturally the board , pieces , and card art are well - done and evocative . The investigators draw from the usual Lovecraftian tropes , and the Ancient Ones added ( Ghatanathoa , and Cthugha , among others ) are suitably scary to tackle in - game . One interesting new mechanic is that now all Investigators ( from AH and all the expansions ) can have personal story cards that affect the game experience . I ca n't wait to try this out ! Note that his is a ' city ' expansion and so includes a board you set up next to the AH board ( like Dunwich and Kingsport ) , and so can make for a more drawn out game . A new rule is included that actually takes into account this extra board space , and changes the limits the game places on the game for the number of players . Overall this is another worthy addition to Arkham Horror , and is well worth the investment !
3 #### Christmas present for son , wrapped , so I do n't know if he 'll like it or not
2 #### The new investigators and ancients ones are nice , but we never use the board because it really is n't very interesting . If you use this board you have to dedicate 1 investigator to running around on that board all game and never closing portals or collecting clues . It 's pretty pointless . We do use the 2 new " other worlds " and their corresponding portals . We just put Dunwich over top of this board to show the other worlds only . I 'd only recommend this to someone that plays the game a lot and is willing to shell out the money for basically just the investigators and ancient ones .
5 #### Bought this to play along with their game at a friends game night . It 's great , and I 'm considering buying the game itself to play with my family 's game night .
5 #### I LOVE Arkham Horror with a burning passion , and when I found out that FF made an expansion based on my favorite H.P. Lovecraft story , I almost had a seizure of happiness . This big box expansion comes with more mythos and other world cards , as well as a set of Innsmouth Look cards which have killed me and my friends more than once . It also comes with aquatic movement monsters , more investigators and the the town of Innsmouth add on board . It can be challenging at times but then again , it is Arkham Horror . I recommend this to any fan of Lovecraft and the Arkham Horror series .
5 #### First off I am a huge fan of Lovecraft . I waited a short while to buy this expansion and I will say it is great . Adds so much challenge to the game and It 's a small town to be feared for sure . They did a really good job to give this town a gruesome feel and I recommend to anyone who likes Arkham Horror .
5 #### Awesome awesome game ! We had played it before and we loved it , that 's why we decided to buy it ! GOT fans YOU'LL LOVE IT !
3 #### Interesting approach to a strategic game for Game of Thrones . No Targeryns and only has the Westeros map . There could be potential of an expansion if they think about the Night King or dragons .
5 #### it is great what a difference there is so much more to do with the expansion pack we just love it takes hours to play but what a great game . We love it .
5 #### " Shadow Over Innsmouth " is one of my favorite H.P. Lovecraft stories , and this expansion was a must - have for me . Extra monsters are always nice to add . The extra characters are also great , 16 this expansion ! . The 96 personal story cards adds to the base game a lot of characterisation for the investigators . More Ancient Ones - 8 with this expansion ! - are also very cool . The board also neat ; I imagine the smell of rotting wood beside the sea every time I look at it . This is a neat expansion , I prefer it over Kingsport . I like this Arkham expansion .
4 #### The Innsmouth expansion is an excellent addition to the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Arkham - Horror / dp/1589942108 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Arkham Horror</a>&nbsp;base game , based on one of my favorite elements of the Lovecraft mythos , the Deep Ones who live under the sea ( except when breeding with humans ) ! Hardcore Arkham Horror fans are going to buy every expansion anyway , so they may safely stop reading here . Let me now address owners of the base game wondering if this is the first ( or next ) expansion they should buy . The answer is yes , if you routinely play with 4 or more people and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Shadow - Over - Innsmouth / dp / B0010PBI4Q / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Shadow Over Innsmouth</a>&nbsp;is one of your favorite stories . Groups of 3 players or less will need to play with multiple investigators each to have any conceivable chance of beating the game ( or even making an attempt worth setting up the board for ) due to multiple elements designed to delay investigators and RAPIDLY awaken the Ancient One . When my wife and I play by ourselves , most of this expansion stays in the box . We have incorporated the encounters and monsters into the base set to good effect ( adding greater variety without skewing things significantly ) and have enjoyed spicing things up with new investigators and personal stories , but - all things considered - we should have bought&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Dunwich / dp/1589942841 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Dunwich</a>&nbsp;first .
5 #### If you 're not careful , this game will turn you and your friends into the cast of Game of Thrones . It 's incredibly fun playing the Risk - style war games , but it 's even better vying for the Throne , the Raven and the Sword . These tools can tip the game for or against you at pivotal moments , and if the wildlings attack that just makes the game more interesting as it briefly turns from competitive to cooperative . Just do n't trust your friend who says she 'll help you defeat the army invading you . She really just wants your land for herself ! Great fun !
5 #### I got this as a gift . He really likes this game . He said it takes a long time to play but is fun
5 #### Very fun game ! Shipping was fast and item arrived in perfect order .
5 #### Beautiful game pieces , beautiful images / cards . Have n't had the opportunity to play the game so rating is based off of looks alone . I will update rating and review after actually pleasing the game . It 's gorgeous tho !
5 #### I 'm a fan of many strategy games and this is now one of my favorites if not right there at the top . I 've played risk , and diplomacy and this game seems like a happy compromise of a number of great games with some minor flaws , which have been resolved in the assembly of this game . It can be a bit much to learn the first time through , but if you like strategy games its worth it .
5 #### I would look at the Fantasy Flight Web Page and look at some reviews by different board game websites before you invested the money in this game . I think it 's one of the best products to come along in quite some time , but I love complex and dark games such as Arkham Horror . There are a lot of differing views of this game . While this is a Murder mystery set in a dystopian future , that does n't touch the surface of this game . I am writing this review because I care about the gaming hobby . Do n't look at my high rating and think you will love this game , do n't buy this until you know what you are getting .
5 #### this one looks really nice in actual and i enjoy playing it a lot with my friends .
5 #### Long match but entertain to play and make alliances
5 #### my fiance and I have played this 2 or 3 times with a lot of fun . This is enjoyable for any board game fan ,
5 #### Great game . Lots of fun , lots of rules . With six people this could be a long drawn out battle for supremacy ! Too much for my ten years old , but teens loved it .
5 #### My favourite board game ! It takes sometime to learn the many rules of the game , so expect the first couple of games to go kinda slow , but once you get a group of gamers who know how to play then the game gets insanely fun and competitive ! The theme is amazing if you love GOT , the game itself is deep and challenging , with lots of nice mechanisms ( e.g. wars , wildling attacks , bidding for power items , etc .. ) . Make sure you leave enough time for the game though , say couple of hours ; it might be frustrating if you end the game early before the 10 rounds just because someone has to leave !
2 #### I bought this for my wife because we love GoT. I was disappointed at how complicated the game is when the winner is really chosen when the families are taken at the start . There is no balance and nothing can happen that will change the fact that some characters and families can just easily wipe out others every time you play . Add this to the high price and I feel foolish even giving it 2 stars .
4 #### Very good game , it is very complex and unfortunately the rules are not always crystal clear , but after a few games we found a rhythm and enjoyed the game
5 #### this one looks really nice in actual and i enjoy playing it a lot with my friends .
4 #### One of my favorite games now . Takes FOREVER to play . We have tried 4 5 and 6 player . For whatever reason , 5 seemed the shortest . 6 player game took about 6 hours . High learning curve- longer than Catan , maybe about Battlestar Galactica length . Has a cool YouTube instructional video to get you started and 2 big cheat sheets for the table , but still leaves about 100 unanswered questions when we play . We constantly found ourselves on our phones looking up Fantasy Flight forums or BoardGameGeek forums .
4 #### I personally loved this game . it was a bit unfair when playing with anything but the 6 people . because it was to easy for people who where positioned around the empty spaced to conquer the board . I would like to play again with more people . Great concept !
5 #### Takes a little practice to figure it out but do n't give up and you wo n't be disappointed .
4 #### At our first time playing the game we spent over two hours reading the rules . And I really wish that was an exaggeration . We did n't even have enough time to finish an actual game . But I am looking forward to playing again some time so that must mean something .
5 #### If you are looking for a challenging , fun game , I would highly recommend Civilization . I bought this game as a present for my boyfriend and have found this game to be a lot of fun . It is a strategy based game for 2 - 4 people and I love that it 's never the same game . I also love that there are multiple ways to win . Some things to note about this game : - There are a LOT of rules so be prepared to spend some time learning the game ( refer to the web if you 're confused ) - This game can take a long time to play depending on who you are playing with and how they are playing . - Highly recommend getting some plastic bags or something to store the pieces as there are a lot of them Overall , if you are looking for a new game to play and/or are a big fan of Settlers ( or other strategy based games ) , I would highly recommend this game for you .
5 #### Lots of rules to learn but once you learn them all it 's a really fun game ! Beat my wife for the first time tonight . Now she has to come up with a new strategy to counter my lastest strategy . Virtually no luck involved you make your plans and follow through . The one who has the best strategy wins .
5 #### As good as boardgames get ... With 6 players this game does a fabulous job of making the old mainstay ' Diplomacy ' accessible to everyone . Negotiation , army placement , bidding , hidden house cards , etc ... GOT has it all . You 'll laugh , you 'll cry and even when your former ally turns on you one instant before you were going to turn on him you 'll think " I would have done the same . " :) Well worth your time and money if you can find 5 folks who enjoy excellent gaming and want to shape the fate of Westeros .
4 #### Great game , especially if you are into the show or the books . Objectively , as euro style game , it is a lot of fun ... beautiful components , and great characters .... downside , is despite many play throughs and depending on the amount of people you are playing with , the game is n't as balanced as I would like it . It feels authentic to the show and books .... and if that is what you want , you wo n't be disappointed- but if you are objectively looking for the next best thing to add to your collection , there are better choices .
5 #### I really like this game due to the look , feel and different ways to win the game . The components are awesome and It is very similar to civ . rev .
4 #### Great game ! Just wish more of my kids will play it with me !
5 #### Such a fun game . Takes a while to get used to it . But so much fun :)
5 #### Love this game . Literally hours of fun for my wife and me and our friends .
5 #### If you are willing to learn lots of rules that lead to game with depth then this game is for you . The game seems to mimic actual PC game to as much detail as is possible for a board game . PROs : - good quality pieces - each game is fairly unique because the land is composed of pieces that are randomly placed at the beginning - variety of races , options , buildings , resources and goals makes the game open to various strategies and endless combinations - smaller kids can join as long as you explain and enforce the rules CONs : - if you do n't like complex games then this game is not for you I had to write down the game rules ( cheat sheet ) so that I can easier understand and lookup the rules . It will take some time to get them know all .
5 #### Pros -board modules mix up the kind of map you 'll be playing with -excelent combat system -diffrent civilizations mix things up even more ( in a two player game there are 64,864,800 diffrent permutations(inluding map tiles ) ) -Resource Idea gives the game more depth -Wonders and Great people make it easier to acheive any type of victory -four diffrent ways to win -Has similarities to the Computer game(just less nuances ) Cons -Really complex(for me this is a pro but most most people would n't agree with me ) -Hard to teach ( all the nuances lead to alot of " oh and I should mention " 's during play ) -The two above lead to the last problem . Hard to find someone to play with Conclusion This game was definitly worth the $ 37.30 that I paid , and is icredibly fun . Just wish I could find someone who wants to play ...
5 #### Been playing CIV since the DOS version came out . Always wanted the board game from Avalon Hill but for years could not find it ... I have all versions on the computer to play . This is very addictive and fun , educational and requires loads of time to play and dedicated players - but the game is worth every second you put into it ..... try it you will see .
3 #### I did not like the deterministic combat but the rest of the game is good .
5 #### Fantastic game , my family enjoys it . It 's basically an RPG board game with random encounters via the adventure card deck . What a shame Fantasy Flight will soon be cutting this from their lineup . High quality board and components , including the miniatures . Pick this up while you still can !
5 #### This game takes a while to learn . I mean it . There is a 15 minute instructional video on YouTube . Watch it . Play the game through once , then go back and figure out everything you did wrong or forgot to do , and then play again . Repeat . SO FUN though . What a great board game . And no , you do n't need to be an expert in GoT to play , you just have to enjoy strategy board games . The round limit ensures that you do n't have to play for 10 hours to find a winner . Gameplay is varied and fun , and all strategy based . Very little luck at play .
5 #### Absolutely love this game . It can make real enemies in real life , but you still had fun .
1 #### A GAME OF THRONES is all about appearance , and no substance at all . One of the most boring , tedious , superficial , unbalanced board games I 've ever seen . As a stroke of genius , Fantasy Flight quickly released a game based on the famous books . The game has six factions , quick method of resolving combats , cards to try to add flavor of the book to the game . But nothing works . Heck , this game is much worse than the classic BRITANNIA . The map board is beautiful , but It could be about any fictitious land ever written about . This is a very common war game ( a simple one ) , extremely unbalanced when played with less than six players , with an annoying " sudden death " mechanism to end the game . The components are awful ( both " boats " - what are that ? ? ? - and armies ) . Why spend time playing this when you have DOMINANT SPECIES , TERRA MYSTICA , BRITANNIA , ECLIPSE , well , a whole lot of things better ? I understand there is a public for everything , but this is just a terrible game , that does not work at any level .
5 #### We were introduced to Colossal Arena through my wife 's sister and loved it so much we decided to order it as soon as we got home and so we did and it arrived and is great . Fairly easy game to explain and a good measure of luck vs strategy but just a really fun occasion with none of the tenseness that can be associated with some competitive games . Quite a quick game as well so maybe 30 to 45 minutes for a game . Really a worthwhile addition as a fill in between some longer games of Settlers and Stone Age ...
5 #### I got this as a birthday gift for my husband who loves the series and is also a fan of rpg 's . It 's a very involved game that requires a lot of time and participation . But it is fun and my husband absolutely LOVES it .
3 #### I wish this game was either a lot shorter or had more strategy . This is a very long game for something so largely determined by randomly acquired dice and cards , though the deck building and spells make it almost two dimensional . It 's hard to imagine choosing this long experience over Cave Evil or Mage Knight .
4 #### This is fun , especially if you are familiar with the series . Certain gameplay aspects are very creative , and really emulate the backstabbing diplomacy of the series . But it is complicated , and does n't work well with fewer players . Gameplay gets slow and repetitive after a few games .
5 #### I ca n't say enough good things about this board game . It is the best " war and strategy " board game I have played up to this point . It really feels like the game that Risk should have been , but the Game of Thrones theme tops the cake on this board game . I love how great all the artwork is and how easy it is to make allies and back stab each other in the game . The hidden action mechanic is the best and I have n't seen anything like it before I played this game . Very very very fun and I hope to get in more game time with this one .
5 #### If your thinking about getting into more challenging games , that are more in depth than your standard monopolies and scrabbles , but your not quite ready for the deep end , this is a great game to start with . It takes a lot of the RPG elements and puts it in an easy format for all to enjoy . Simple stats and dice rolls , this game will probably be kinda boring to players used to more in depth stuff but its a great game to get in front of newer players to get them used to this kind of game . My wife and I have found that when you play this game , eventually you get to the point were you are so strong there is nothing that can challenge you , and the end game is a cake walk . However the build up to that point is very fun and rewarding . Its a great game and it has been to our table a lot , kids really enjoy this game as well .
5 #### Fun game . Takes a bit of time to figure out how to play but once we got the hang of it our 12 year old nephew was joining us .
5 #### Best game ever Hours of party fun for fantasy lovers
5 #### Purchased for my son . He takes it to school for board game night . Everyone including the teachers play it .
5 #### Great Game for people who like strategy . Simple rules that leave alot of room for in depth game play .
5 #### The facts ... This OBJECT arrived quickly ... it was manufactured well ... The Price was OUTSTANDING! ... the color or lack thereof was swell ... now that I ve pasted this in to meet my review quota the specific info will follow ... daughter likes it dunno if she actually played it tho ... kids go figure
5 #### Purchased this game to play with a group of friends that I have been playing other strategy games with ( such as Risk 2210 ) . We had been looking for a new game that was a little more on the complex strategy side . And this fit the bill ! We have enjoyed playing it and are now looking at the expansions to change it up a little . Watching the online video from the maker of the game ( Fantasy Flight Games ) on their site before playing for the first time was a huge help as the game is pretty complex the first time you play . But once you have run through the game once or twice , you have it down and its a lot of fun .
5 #### I 've yet to play the board game with a full group but regardless the board , pieces and cards are all beautiful . It does seem quite daunting if I showed newbies but I 'm hoping to bring some GoT fans to the wonderful world of boardgames~
5 #### Bought these for the " Jamaica " Board Game treasure cards .
5 #### Quite simply , this is the board game I 've been looking for my entire life . It has an amazing fantasy setting , beautiful art , complex and fun mechanics , replayability , and expansive capabilities . You can even play it with as few as 2 players , which seems to be a rarity among fun strategy board games . Some complain about the random movement factor , but I think fun is where just the right amount of strategy and chance meet , and Talisman does it really well . It 's just an amazing fantasy adventure in board game form . I ca n't recommend it enough . My only complaint is that it takes a really long time , but there are easy house rules to implement that can make it faster , some of which are even included in the game 's manual .
5 #### Takes a while to play , but was really fun .
5 #### I have had many hours of fun and backstabbing with this game . It 's like risk , but with no dice to ruin your strategy . Setting up truces , ( and breaking them ) is really half the game . Even if you 're not a fan of the series , this is a great game . One downside , it is very complex with a steep learning curve . Once you figure out the rules , the learning is well worth it .
3 #### While I found many of the mechanisms very intriguing , the game is definitely too heavily weighted toward certain houses . For example , House Baratheon and Greyjoy are incredibly strong and House Lannister is very weak . Because of this , it makes the game less enjoyable for a group of players who are equally experienced with the game . A group of experienced players can only hope that their opponents with the stronger houses slip up and make a few ill - conceived moves . In any case , you 're really only going to be playing for up to three hours without any possibility of winning . But do n't get me wrong , the game is n't completely terrible . I love the ASOIAF universe so of course I loved the theme . And like I said before , I found many of the game 's mechanics very enjoyable . The placement of the order tokens during each round is a lot of fun and not knowing what your opponents are playing makes this very tense . All in all , gameplay is a blast and if it all the houses were equal in strength I think it would see the table a lot more . It 's just not fun playing for 3 + hours and knowing you have absolutely no chance of winning .
5 #### My husband 's only problem with this item is he ca n't find anyone to play with him ! Great shape . And a fabulous game for any fan of the books or show .
4 #### Good for the price . The game is a right choise for fans . This second edition update the history with season 2 especial moments .
5 #### Great build and game play . Starting out you 'll find yourself reading every space for the options and cards thoroughly but after a couple times it goes easier .
5 #### A great update to a great game . Some people complain about the strategy , which is very rudimentary , but I like it because it levels the playing field . The plastic miniatures are a nice touch ( we 're painting them to match the cards ) , although there were a couple of small casting errors on ours . The game takes a while to play , but you can always agree to end it after a given amount of time . We think it 's a great option for family game night .
5 #### Good mix of diplomacy and risk . It 's a long game . Players should definitely allow extra time to play their first game as the game is super complex , but really good says my 20 - something son for whom I bought the game . Very solid build quality - all of the pieces and components are high quality . For serious gamers - there are no spoilers though if you have n't watched Seasons 2 + , or read the second book , you will meet some new characters .
1 #### This game falls into the " Extremely Lengthy + Almost Completely Random " category . Highly recommend for those who like monopoly play - style and want a fantasy theme . I find games like this a waste of time for me though . If I 'm going to invest countless hours into a single play , I want my decisions to have a large impact on the outcome . This game does not provide that .
5 #### Husband plays many board games . Enjoys this with his gaming friends , son - in - law and even teen children . Enjoy ! The End ! *
5 #### Awesome game , very simple to learn , but it can take a while to play if you have 4 people . 2 people can burn through again in about 90 min .
5 #### My hubby and I play this on game night and we 're addicted . It 's a great game of twists and I 'm looking forward to buying the expansions . I 'm new to this type of board game and I 've never played this type of game before and I really enjoyed it . We played pandemic , which is great and Lords of waterdeep and muchkin , but this game is starting to grow on me . It 's all about strategy and when you think you can take a chance on making it past the doors to get to the core to start draining your opponents life that 's where the fun begins .
5 #### Fun , fun , fun ! Best to play with friends who appreciate board games ! Love the miniatures !
5 #### Quality game that 's fun for the family , although more based on luck and dice rolling than skill or strategy .
3 #### There is a learning curve with the game and it will take at least 2 - 4 games in order to get use to it all . It 's very similar to Risk where you have to capture areas , each have a point value , and once you reach the amount of points need you win . I think what ruins the game though , and why I rank it so low , is the fact that it 's so easy to win . Unless you play with 5 - 6 people , It 's a breeze to get through a game . There 's just too many open spaces and too few peoples ( when playing with 3 - 4 people ) to make it even a slight challenge . It would be nice to see a two board set , One for 3 - 4 players and on the other side is another map designed for 5 - 6 . Also simplifying it a bit would be nice because the rule book is too confusing and I often had to go online to find answers .
5 #### This is an excellent adventure game for groups . It 's very easy to pick up and to teach . Talisman is a perfect introductory game for people newer to board games . The game does have a fairly long runtime , and can get a bit repetitive as you grind along to build up your character , but every game is a very rewarding and fun experience .
3 #### This is just a prettied - up roll - and - move game . You roll a die , move around a board and collect items to fight monsters in pursuit of fulfilling a quest , or quests . If I were going to play a roll - and - move game it 'd be this one . The adventure components make it a little more entertaining than your average Milton Bradley affair . It will get annoying though when you find yourself in need of landing on a space just to finish the game and just ca n't roll the right number .
5 #### Greatest fantasy game out there ! We played our daughters game and my nine year old son LOVES it and caught on very quickly ! Great game for the family .
5 #### We love this game , it is like a little mini D&D session and you play it with almost anyone . It does take a very long time to play though .
4 #### Old geek from the 80s , loved it then , love it now . So far I purchased the City , Dungeon , and Reaper expansions and will buy more . Make sure you have friends that will play a game like this as it takes some time to play ... sometimes 3 + hours etc .
5 #### I got this for my husband for Christmas . He 's big into board games and literally has a huge book shelf filled with them in his " man cave " ( i.e. the garage to keep them away from our small kids ) . I'm ... not . Although it was surprisingly easy to learn and fun to play .
5 #### I really love this game . The rules are simple to learn , but the game play is dynamic and complex . You will be able to get this game , open the box and be well on your way to playing in a very short time . The rules and the cards have very little ambiguity . Basically , I love this game because it is complex enough to be interesting , but simple enough that you are not spending hours decoding the rules . You get more game time with this board game than other intense board games .
5 #### Definitely my favorite board game . And the second edition merges in all the good stuff from the original expansion while adding a couple new improvements that only benefit an already ideal game !
4 #### I absolutely love this game . It 's a great co - op game that leaves you struggling to the very end . While the small board and box add to it thematically , I think the second printing came in a bigger box , and would likely be better .
4 #### I received this game as a Christmas gift , and somehow did not play it for a whole nine months . I 'm glad I did , though ; it 's a riot ! The theme is quirky and fun ( drunk gnomes on a submarine ! ) , and the gameplay is pretty quick , once you get the hang of how to use the time counters . There is a significant amount of randomness in the events ( Eurogamers , beware ! ) , but this is fitting with the theme . The fact that it is a cooperative game that scales up to eight players is great . So , the story is that you are a bunch of Gnomes on a doomed submarine , the Red November . You are being pursued by the Kraken and everything is failing . The crew will be rescued when 60 minutes passes , but you have to work together to survive that long . Each player tries to avert disasters by attempting repairs or other actions , which take time . Gameplay passes , not in a typical clockwise fashion , but to the player whose gnome 's time counter is furthest back on the time track . The designers really do an excellent job of making you feel you are working against the clock . In short , the game is great . I highly recommend this if you are in the mood for a light , fast and chaotic good time .
4 #### A crisis management game with a fantasy / russian theme . Red November ( RN ) is a cooperative survival board game , where players must work together to survive / win . The rules are simple , and the quality of the pieces , cards , and board being top notch as one would expect from Fantasy Flight . As the game unfolds , players are confronted with mounting challenges and deadlines that need to be overcome or risk losing the game . Some aspects of this game can be frustrating as the difficulty can change from game to game depending on the player count and the randomness of the event cards drawn . Play time of up to 2 hours with 6 to 8 players is common . A few points of criticism ... 1 . As crisis management games go , there are better products out there . ex - Pandemic 2 . The game starts without any problems , leading players to wonder what to do initially . This might work to create some faux tension , but it ultimately stalls the game from the start . 3 . The event cards generate all sorts of chaos , but they feel too repetitive . ex - despite a good shuffle , 7 barricaded doors in just 2 player turns is a bit boring . Despite all that , its a good game , and worth the price tag . Just make sure your expectations are in line with what this game is .
5 #### I love this game , and am excited that it got reprinted .
5 #### This game is awesome ! This is one of my favorite co - op games . The rules are fairly easy to understand and teach , there is a good balance of luck and control , and it 's just fun to play . To give you a small introduction to Red November - You have two problems : 1 ) you are a gnome & 2 ) you are on a gnomish submarine . ( And we all know gnomes are n't submarine specialists ) Over the course of the game you and your friends will be frantically running around your little submarine pumping out flooded rooms , disarming nuclear bombs , putting out fires ( and possibly getting drunk in the process - because alcohol makes a gnome brave ) , etc . - just to watch as additional rooms burst into flames , fill with water , have the engine break down , or be attacked by a kraken .
4 #### A great board game - creates a sense of frantic panic . Really wonderful as it promotes strong teamwork and communication . Takes a bit to learn , but suprisingly simple to play once you learn the rules . Game box was shipped slightly torn , but all the parts are in prefect condition . Shipped very fast .
5 #### This is a fun board game , that can handle up to eight people . It is not hard to pick up , and a quick explanation can allow new players to understand the basics enough to play in a few minutes . It would be best if at least one person had a detailed understanding of the rules , as there are a few things that come up that do n't happen often . It has a unique way of handling turns , which ends up rotating who goes next in a fashion that is unlike most games -- it is based off of how many " turns " ( or minutes ) an individual takes at any given time -- the more they take , the longer they wait for their next turn -- based off of how many turns other players take as well . It is amusing , and challenging . But with a lot of new players , can drag on a bit , if people do n't fully understand the strategy . A full game can take two hours if you have 8 people , many of whom have never played it before . This can cause the game to get a little ... tiresome , and is best if enough people know what to do and can plan ahead of time ( This is true for all board games of this type ) .
3 #### I am all for zany , wacky board games as a filler , which is what I imagined this game to be . But in my opinion it seems to drag on for quite a bit , which is hard for me to say as I can play multi hour marathon games and not be bored with my group , but there 's so much to keep track of during each turn that things seem to take forever . Another factor is that at the end of each player 's turn , they are forced to pick up event cards , which are usually bad things like ' This compartment of the ship is now on fire ! ' , or ' This compartment of the ship is full of water!' .. but it gets old and feels like you are getting pummeled over and over . With a 7 player game we played , it took almost 2 hours to finish , not for lack of trying either . With every player causing events over and over and over I was internally begging for this game to end , which is not something I normally do . I 'll play it again in time now and then , but , it is definitely not the filler game I expected
5 #### When my 17 y / o asked for this game , I was taken aback by the price and hesitant to place the order . However , he is a huge fan of the Game of Thrones , having read the books and watched the show . So I placed the order and he is THRILLED . This is the highest quality board game I have EVER purchased . That being said , know what you 're getting into before you buy it . This game is not for those with a limited attention span . It comes with a 32 - page instruction manual . Several pages are dedicated to identifying the pieces as well as the initial set - up . It is easily the most complicated game our family has ever played . It took nearly 45 minutes to set up the first go round , and takes 3 - 4 hours to play . If you are an avid fan and have a solid knowledge of the series , you will love it . For the rest of us , it can be quite confusing . But , my son is happy . My husband enjoys it , and my two younger children ( ages 10 1/2 and 12 ) are able to play along with a little help . Do n't let the price tag sway you . If you 're a fan of the series , it 's well worth the price . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### This is a fun game , that is better with 4 or more players . There is a good amount of strategy , and there is a lot of alliances and potential for betrayals . This is best played with a group that enjoys the diplomatic negotiations that often crop up . There is alot more info @ [ ... ]
2 #### I had great expectations from all the position 4 and 5 star reviews of this game . I have a few board based fantasy games like Descent and Heroscape , both great games giving hours of replayability , and obviously high quality of design and materials . This one disappoints . All of the pieces give the word MINIATURE and new definition . The pieces are so small they are in the description realm of RIDICULOUS . FFS is obviously saving dollars in name of sacrificing quality and quantity . Some of the pieces , like the plastic gold coins and the pyramind cones are literally 1/4 " in height and diameter . The handful of plastic molded characters are at most about 1 inch high as well . The spell and casting cards are all so small they would be small for a 5 year old 's hand . The board is quite large , about 3 foot by 2 made of cardboard . Not much here folks , especially for the cost of the game . This is a 12 dollar game at a 50 dollar price .
4 #### Great components with interesting gameplay . This is really just a 6 player game though , playing with less makes for some feel - bad situations .
4 #### " Twilight Imperium : Rex " by Fantasy Flight Games is a wonderful science - fiction themed game set in the Twilight Imperium Universe . Up to six players vie for control of Mecatol Rex , the capital city of the declining Lazax Empire . What 's cool here is that each of the races competing for control has unique advantages . The Xxcha can make predictions about the game , the Federation of Sol knows where the bombarding human fleet will travel to next , the Hacan get money every time anyone deploys troops , etc ... The battle engine is a lot fun , where each side has to commit a set number of troops while adding an officer with an additional combat rating . Each side is able to pick a traitor , which they can use against one enemy in battle . This traitor mechanic adds a fun level of paranoia to the game that delivers a unique degree of tension . The only real complaint is the Hacan advantage seems a little strong , and might lead to some balancing issues with repeated play . Based on the original " Dune " mechanic , this game is a fun game that will provide hours of entertainment .
5 #### I used to play this game in the 80 's and 90 's as a kid / teen , and I have to say it definitely brings me back . My buddies and I used to play the second edition ( I think ) , and some of them had the dungeon , the city , and the timescape expansions . Overall , the fourth edition is great . The whole idea of Fate counters in my opinion is awesome . For example , now any character can have an extra die roll in battle , similar to the Warrior 's awesome ability . Slight difference , tho , as the second roll MUST be used with fate , whereas the Warrior can choose between the two . " Nerfing " the prophetess was a much needed thing as well . Her card drawing ability was way too good , as we used to " ban " her sometimes from being played . Making life variable was a great idea as well , to help balance out the characters . My only quip is with some of the artwork . Seriously folks : what 's with the Warrior ? He looks more like a drunk , feeble , middle - aged woman who 's not sure if he should be wielding swords or brooms . He also looks like he 's about to pass out ! Rofl . I think of the Warrior from our older edition , who looks like he 's about to lay the smack down on some huge dragon with his giant lance , fitted with awesome armor / helmet and battle gear . Anyways , still the great game it 's always been , with some new and ( mostly ) better additions ! Two thumbs way up .
5 #### This is a very fun adventure game , unfortunately it suffers from the standard flaw that while you are trying to get strong enough to defeat bosses the game is annoying " farming " .
5 #### This is the 4th edition of a board game classic . Fantasy Flight games bought the rights to publish this game and have done a great job taking a great game and supporting it even further . In this game you take on the persona of one of the characters provided and attempt to rise in power until you obtain the Crown of Command and rule the land . In between there are battles with monsters and freak incidents that can change the way the game plays out . You never know how you or the game will be affected when you pick a card . This is the base version of the game and you should be prepared to spend several hours playing it ( I 've had games run all night but as short at 3 - 4 hours ) . Once you get used to the way the game plays you can utilize some of the alternate rules that change the ultimate quest in the game or you can purchase expansions for the game . These expansions are what keep the game fresh and exciting to play . The expansions are not part of the base set but are available for separate purchase . Overall this is one of my favorite games ever . It is simple to learn and no two games are ever quite the same due to the variety of the cards as well as the availability of expansions . This is one of the best , highest quality games on the market !
5 #### I freely admit that I 'm a " board game geek . " I love unconventional , complicated games with boards the size of the table and hundreds of tokens and cards spread about . Most of my friends , however , are not . Talisman has proven to be fun for everyone and satisfyingly complex enough for the more serious boardgamers . It is very easy to play despite having so many choices and twists . As a Fantasy Flight Game , this version is up to the standards I have come to expect from the company- heavy cardstock , sturdy boxes , great artwork , and tons of tokens and other accessories . When you add in a few of the expansions you have enough material to never have the game play out the same way twice . This is a must - have if you 're looking to broaden your boardgame horizons beyond Monopoly and Clue .
5 #### kingsburg is a good game and i rated it 4 stars ... but this expansion makes it a 5 star game ... adds a lot of variety with not much complexity rules wise ... 5 modules in total and we play with every single one of them ... if you have kingsburg , this expansion is a must buy .
5 #### This expansion is well worth the money . It adds dimensions to the regular game , and multiplies the game 's replay value several times . If one were to only play Kingsburg , and no other games , it would be impossible to play every possible combination , and you would still not get tired of the game , not counting normal " gaming " fatigue ! !
5 #### The main game , Kingsburg was somewhat underwhelming . This expansion actually makes the game much more deep and interesting . The fact that it adds modules that you can choose to add or not greatly improves the re playability . Highly recommended , and indispensable if you own the main game .
5 #### The expansion is a nice addition to the game .
5 #### If you enjoyed this dice - infused worker placement game , this expansion adds five new " modules " to mix in to your base game . Larger building boards , alternate building rows , unique roles , yearly condition cards , and non - random winter army chips make this game customizable and ensures a varied game each time . The new buildings and cards especially help keep the game fresh once you find all the different strategies in the base game . Notably there is no board extension , no more dice , and no more monster cards but that does n't hurt the expansion at all .
5 #### Bought for friends , as we play on game night . Love the expansion - it gives a bit a spin to the game . I recommend to all Kingsburg fans .
5 #### In a game already full of decisions this expansion just adds more , but I love it ! There is a Dice Tower review on YouTube about Kingsburg and and this expansion that helped me to make the decision to buy the game and later the expansion . I agree with most of the reviews I have seen . All of the added components are great except the military tokens . I guess if everyone playing agrees to use them then it 's ok , but you are trading 1 - 6 every year to 0 - 4 and you can only have each number once . This means that if you happen to chose the one 4 you have on the first year then you are probably going to loose the battle in the 4th and 5th year . How is that fun ? I also disagree with the people that say that this expansion is essential . I like it , but I licked the game just fine without it . Also I think it would have been cool if they had added some monsters , but they did n't . Get this after you have played the base game at least 5 or 6 times .
4 #### So Fantasy Flight continues with its by now well stablished reputation of always releasing games with future expansions in mind . Sometimes it works , sometimes not . In the case of Battlestar Galctica board game , thing are working , but beware : the combinations available to play the game , when you have the three sets at your table , are becoming out of hand . Initial loyalty set - up card is definitely a situation , you must read the rules carefully . The situation is so bad , that the rule book added a " Frequented overlooked rules " section . As for " feeling " the TV show , the situation is gettin better . More characters are included , allies , new crisis , the Mark VII fighters , new skill cards with zero points , more options to role playing it a little bit ... With EXODUS , the weird thing is that you can play it without New Caprica . The rules for playing with the NEw Carpica expansion ( Pegasus ) are not so good . Also , the cylons are stronger now . The humans will indeed suffer more to win a game of BSG . Overall this continues to be a very good game and a sure entertainment night .
5 #### The Exodus Expansion of Battlestar Galactica adds some very nice elements to the overall game . In addition to getting additional character cards , this expansion also brings some nice ways to subtly change your gaming experience . There are additional cards for the destiny deck , the skill decks , and there is a new role card for a special position ( the chief pilot or CAG ) . There are 3 different expansion scenarios to spice up the type of game that you are going to play . While you would n't want to throw them all together they really help to ramp up a game that you may be getting bored with . There are elements from this expansion that you can add into almost any game of Battlestar that you want to play . I highly recommend it but I would say to get the Pegasus Expansion first .
5 #### The first expansion , ca n't wait to torment my friends with it .
4 #### Aside from me not liking the Dark Pharaoh Herald much at all , I really have to say that I adore the exhibition mechanic . I pretty much use it in every single game . The expansion works better with more players as it gives everyone a bit of time to check out the exhibit and possibly get some cool ( and helpful ) cards . I recommend it for any Arkham enthusiast .
5 #### Arkham Horror ! Say no more its a wonderful game ! This expansion is really neat it has artifacts for you to chase down and acquire . I am in love with how its Egyptian theme ! Cool spells and the Dark Pharaoh is the herald . A good expansion and worth the money .
5 #### I originally purchased the Encyclopedia of Immaturity V1 for my nephew but it was such a hit with both adults and kids that it ended up making the rounds instead . When Volume 2 came up for sale I knew I had to get it but was n't sure if it would " make the cut " . So often it seems the first volume is the best and the rest is just added on to ride on the fame of the original . No so with this one ! First , the thin page problem mentioned by many reviewers in the first volume is fixed in this one . Pages are substantially thicker - although that leads to fewer total tips . However the quality of the tips is as good - if not better - than the original . Same silly jokes , fun but young " tricks " and an abundance of totally meaningless activiites sure to delight everyone . Cover is the same material as the first , very nice and thick . Pages are thicker with glossy sheen made to last longer and wording is in keeping with all the Klutz products ( of which we have purchased several including the airplanes , art - rageous projects , museum in a book , Do Not Open this Book , Maze , Bubbles and many others ! Each and every one is a huge hit with everyone ! ) . My younger brother ( nearly 40 ) loved this as did our nephew , 11 year old neighbor and everyone in between . Fun stuff ! Perfect gift for younger siblings of any age or kids over for a visit .
5 #### A little lightheartedness on the often challenging pathways of life .
5 #### My pre - teen and teenage grandkids and their parents really enjoyed this !
5 #### My 11 year old had volume one of this and adored it . When I came across volume 2 , I knew I had to get it for him . These books will occupy him for hours , reading and rereading , then trying out some of the things he reads in there . TOTALLY worth it and a great gift for boys in the 9 - 13 age range .
5 #### Purchased for my 10 year old son , he loves it as well as plenty amusement for the adults . In a world of hi - tech everything it 's nice to see him sit down with an actual book :) highly recommended ! !
4 #### Excellent book to give as gift to kids , just like part I. Funny tricks with interesting pitures . Kids need thier own copy as some things need to be cut from pages .
5 #### My 10 year old son already had&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Encyclopedia - of - Immaturity - Klutz - Volume-1 / dp/159174427X / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Encyclopedia of Immaturity ( Klutz)Volume 1</a>&nbsp;and loved it . We purchased that one at a Scholastic sale so unfortunately it did not have the spiral binding . This is important because there are pages that need to be photocopied or scanned and printed and the book binding does not lend itself to this . When he found out that a new version was available , he was thrilled . This version comes with a wrap around hard cover and wire binding . There is enough stuff in each of these books to keep kids entertained for hours . Some are practical jokes , others are strange facts . It consists of primarily one page tidbits like " How to Make and Throw a Sloshie " ( with water and toilet paper ) , the Physics of a Cannonball in the Water , How to Play Tabletop Hockey , and one of my son 's favorites , How to Hypnotize a Chicken . A few things are mischievous , others are old fashioned and fun . They are all harmless and a real draw for young boys and girls .
5 #### Loved it so much that she finished it in 3 days !
5 #### I bought this for a 9 year old and will probably get another one for my 7 year old niece . It has a good range of prompts and types activities , lots of space for doodling , and feels pretty sturdy .
5 #### Got this for my 8 year old for Christmas ... she loves to doodle and draw all the time . this is so good because of the ideas it gives you and the inspiration . I will definitely get another one ... i have seen a couple of different other ones . You wo n't be disappointed !
5 #### I bought this product for my son 's 5th birthday party . I 've never painted faces before , but by the end of the day I felt like a pro ! The directions are easy to follow and the paints are excellent quality . I was worried that there would n't be enough paint for everyone , but I painted at least 20 full faces easily with plenty of paint left over . This is truly a great product and I would recommend it to anyone .
5 #### Excellent , easy ideas for face painting at a party . The book includes great tips and step by step instructions . It even includes 12 punch out cards , each with its own instruction , that you can allow kids to choose a design from - and the book has an envelope to store the cards ! The paint is by Wolfe Brothers - a professional quality face paint manufacturer . Probably not the right book for a professional face painter , but it is full of kid pleasing manageable designs for us non - artist parents or even school aged kids ! As usual with Klutz books , I could n't be happier ! ! ( This review is for the 2007 edition )
5 #### Love this face painting brand . Nice smooth paint and the idea book is great ! ! !
5 #### washes off easily and great colors . great for learning to face paint
3 #### It 's ok , not the greatest . Kind of expensive for what it is .
5 #### I have n't had a chance to use the paints yet , as I purchased this as a Christmas gift , but I have flipped through and the book is full of great photos and ideas . My family just loves the Klutz books !
5 #### I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon , and once again , I was not disappointed ! The paints last , but yet wash off easily . Everyone can feel like an artist with the step - by - step instructions , and there is a great choice of full - face and cheek art .
5 #### great family fun and easy on the wallet . comes with instructions for basic designs but most kids have their own imagination of what they want . worked well . we used q - tips for multiple face painting at once plus with neighborhood kids it seemed more clean than rinsing in dirty water and applying to next kids face . family reunion we just used brushes and work great
5 #### This is a great kit ! The face paint is excellent quality . Colors are vibrant , go on easily with good coverage , and do n't irritate the skin at all ( at least in our experience ) . The paint did not smudge once it was dry and it was easy to work with . It removed fairly easily with a make up removal cloth followed by a warm wet washcloth . I like the ideas in the book , and especially the party cards . I 'm excited to use those for a little carnival I 'm helping with . They look cute , but not overly complicated . The instructions look easy to follow . All of the designs look great , however I have found that some better options can be found in various places online . For example , for a tiger I have found much better designs elsewhere . As a quick resource to do a nice job while under time constraints I think it is awesome though . I recommend getting some make up sponge wedges to help apply larger amounts of make up at a time .
5 #### I owned this kit for myself and think the product and instructions are very clear and concise and easy to follow . However I ordered another two for my girls for Christmas and I had to file a claim.against the seller for never shipping the item . Overall the product is great when purchased from a reputable seller . Highly recommend !
5 #### We got this paint kit for my daughter 's birthday party , as many of the other kits have lead . This seems to be one of the better ones out there and the face painter ( my sister ) was able to use it with ease . The kids loved the colors and it 's great to have a book for them to choose what they wanted .
5 #### nice quality paints that really stay on the skin . vivid color with lasting power .
5 #### GREAT . anyone can face paint with this set . the book gives some great ideas that your kids can pick from , and then you can copy the drawings . all you need is a cup of water and a paper towel and this set and you are good to go .
3 #### Kustom body art paint lasted a lot longer and better colors But the instruction book was great for ideas .
5 #### Great kit . Have used it a lot . Easy to use & follow pictures . Kids love it
5 #### Perfect for my sons birthday party love that it has easy how to face paint . Paint went on smooth and wiped off easilly with a baby wipe .
5 #### My daughter loved this face paint and ideas on what to do . This is definitely worth the money .
5 #### Excellent paintings , they wear well and are easy to clean at the end of the day
5 #### good price on amazon . My 7 year old daughter wants to test it this weekend before halloween and choose which one she likes to have it on .
5 #### This is one of best face painting book ever . An instruction is very simple and everyone can follow their step by step instructions . Especially their face painting color pallet is just great and quality is so perfect . Color stay on children skin well and easily to wash away . You just mix up the color and paint a beautiful pattern on face and hands and so on . I love it ! My color are almost gone ... I will buy this book again .
5 #### Great book to start learning how to face paint . I have since added more colors to the collection for fancier designs .
5 #### I ordered this to give face painting a try as we have many grandkids and more coming ! We 'll be attending plenty of birthday parties in the future and I think this might be a good skill to have . The kit is great . Covers all the basics with a couple more complex designs . The paints are of high quality and even our grandgirl with sensitive skin did n't have any reaction . The explanations and drawings are easy to replicate . A great purchase .
5 #### This is a really good face painting book that I wanted to add to my library . This is the first step of learning more about face paintinbg and I 'm glad I found this book on line .
5 #### I had looked to purchase this book locally and the least expensive price I could find was $ 24.99 . My daughter is In love with this book as it gives step by step instructions on face painting .
5 #### Got ta love everything Klutz . They do such a good job with their products . My family already owns this book and this one is for my 14 yr old niece 's birthday because she always wants to borrow ours . She will be so excited to have her own .
5 #### This is my absolute favorite thing I 've bought for my kid on Amazon ( and I buy a lot for my kid on Amazon ) . I first tried this at a friend 's house . The book showed how to face paint like a pro in no time ( very good book on it 's own ) . The paints ! ! ! It goes on so smooth and the pigments are so very rich . I was really impressed at that friend 's house ( it was a kid 's party ) . I recently bought this for my kid who likes to be a cat or a dog often- she 'd ask me to paint her nose black with my makeup . I should have bought this long time ago ! It 's just an amazing quality product and it 's so easy and not a bit messy ( dries super quick ) . I could do this daily . I would buy this again when I run out- though it seems it would last a long time . Would be great for a party , for halloween , or for any day . Tip- eye make up remover on cotton balls / pads works very well to remove the paint . Soap and water takes a while .
5 #### Hard to decided who is more excited about these , my kids or me ! The step - by - step instructions are great and make it easy to do some really cool designs . Definitely something for everyone in there . The paints work great . Bright colors and a little goes a long way--- and they wash off easily , too . I 'm totally inspired and will be facepainting at my niece 's birthday party this weekend !
4 #### I am not gifted in the least bit artistically . I think I can manage stick figures pretty well , and that 's about it . However , by following the illustrations in this book , I was able to come up with some credible designs . Enough that my free face - painting session at a bookfair was well received . I have to admit I gained some confidence in myself , too . The paints are adequate for up to 100 faces ... depending on what you choose to do . I kept my designs simple and small . I did n't attempt the fairy face , though it does n't look too hard when you have step by step illustrations . The paints wash right off with warm water and soap leaving only the faintest of lines if you do n't wash it off well enough . None of the children I practiced on had any allergic reactions to the paints , so I 'd say they are mild . However , I did read on the instructions that you are n't suppose to use certain colors near the eyes . It would be interesting to find out why that is . I also had to buy additional brushes , sponges , etc . because one brush / sponge was n't adequate .
5 #### I just wanted paints , but I ended up buying this based on its reviews ... glad I did . Lovely paints , and plenty of them . The book , has some interesting ideas , also . I recommend a baby wipe for paint removal !
5 #### Very good detailed book and the great part is that it comes with the paint , brush and sponge for starters it 's a very good kit
5 #### my kids got into face painting after their grandmother gave them a book that details how to dress up as different characters . grandma gave us some face paint crayons that were very difficult to work with . I ordered this kit and have been so impressed with it . I am not an artist , but when I follow the instructions in this book it looks like I am ! I 've been able to create beautiful face paint and " tattoos " on my children and the children I babysit . This would be great as a DYI for a birthday party ! No need to hire anyone , just practice a few times before the party , or even if you do n't practice the kids will love it and think it 's really cool ! * * * Update * * * my son just had his 4th birthday and at the party I did face painting on all the kids . It was a big hit and all the adults were raving about how good I am . I AM NOT AN ARTIST ! Anyone could have success with this kit - I highly recommend !
5 #### I decided on this set because of all the great reviews it had , versus the cheaper paint sets that I looked at . The great pictures and quality paints are a nice . Paints wash off great , even the red , so I am happy about that . Once it was dry , it did n't seem to rub off , but little kids have wet fingers and it will reconstitute if they touch their faces , so be aware . Several full face ideas , plus lots of little cheek art - shark , ladybug , spider , sports , etc . , and some body art . With just home use , the paints will last me quite a while and were easy to use , just a dab of water and a swirl of the brush .
5 #### Great product for a small kids party ! It was for my yr old party & my niece did the face painting ! The colors are vivid . I did buy some other brand from W - mart & those colors we 're very light ! This is a great product . Instructions & kit included !
5 #### I bought this on a whim thinking they might like this or get a few goes with it before they got bored . NOPE ! All three of my girls went nuts over this and to my surprise my oldest one is really good at it ! The directions are pretty straight forward , the paint goes on and off pretty easy , and the supplies are exactly what you need . This is really one of those gifts that surprised me in terms of how much the kids love it and also how well it was priced and put together . Also , the paint cleans up really easy from your face and any towels or shirts that get on it . White shirts are doomed but other items like towels or clothes , the paint will come right off or out in the wash . If your kids get way into it , if you have a few other brushes laying around it really helps with the more detail stuff they want to try out . All in all , buy this , the worst that will happen is you get a fun and goofy picture with face paint .
5 #### For a couple of years now , my daughter and I have been struggling through some bottles of cheap face paint . I had told her we 'd get a better one when we used the paint up , but finally I realized how much she loves face paint , and how much more enjoyable it would be if we had a quality product to work with . I was planning to just get a set of face paints , but then I saw the Klutz Kit , and thought I 'd try it . I 'm so glad I did . The book is full of techniques and ideas for designs . I feel like it 's really stepped up our face painting ability from day one . My husband , six - year old , and I have all used the book and face paint to create images that -- while not at the professional level -- are still much better than I thought would have been possible . I love how easily the paints blend to create new colors , how well the sponge works to create dramatic effects , how well the paint brushes on , and how it dries quickly without feeling heavy or oily , and stays on for hours without cracking . This is quality stuff . We 've already had a blast with it , and are looking forward to many more happy hours of facepainting . Buy it , you wo n't regret it .
5 #### Nice set with a good book . This is good , quality paint and shows up really well on the skin . Happy with this !
5 #### So easy to use and great designs that anyone can do . We bought to do this at a bday party and they stayed on great . W also used the white for our vampire faces at Halloween and it . Was not irritating on kids sensitive faces
5 #### I have used this book several times now at my children 's parties . They love to choose their own colors and have me make them into a butterfly or fairy . I feel the instructions are clear and easy to follow , even for a complete novice ( me ) at face painting . I think there 's a lot of really fun ideas for boys and girls . And there are good tips on how to make your work look more professional . There 's not a lot of paint included , but for a start kit , I think it 's great . You can always buy more paint , but this will always be a reference you can go back to again and again .
5 #### I hate paying for face painting when we go to carnivals and fairs . I decided that instead of paying for some stranger to paint my kids ' faces , for the same cost I could purchase a book and some paint and do it myself . I decided on this book and was not sorry . It came with some high quality paints and a book that walks you through some simple designs . I did purchase some additional paint brushes that are helpful in doing the more intricate designs.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Snazaroo - Face - Paint - Brush-3 - Pack / dp / B002OE2V1G / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Snazaroo Face Paint Brush 3 - Pack</a > I'm not sure they are any different than brushes you might purchase down the street at the local art supply store , but I do recommend having multiple sized brushes when doing face painting . The paints that come with this book are of a very high quality . Only one stroke was needed to obtain a bright , deep color . When these paints run out I will look for the same brand .
5 #### My daughter received this as birthday gift(7 ) Though I had always noticed it in our local toystore , the price tag deterred me a bit . I mean face paint for $ 20 + ? BOY am I glad we have it and that I can write a glowing review . The paints are nothing like the goopy " halloween type " face paints usually seen in stores . They are dry until you add water , they can be mixed in the tray without damaging the integrity of the colors , and there are beautiful pictures with step by step directions to achieve professional looking results . The paints do not stain the face but did leave a hint of color on my daughters inner arm area(where she painted " bracelets " ) I had a lot of fun with this kit , it was easy to use , and cleanup is simple . I might add that it is compact enough to travel with . Definitely recommend ! !
5 #### This is the first time I do face painting .... and it turned out so awesome ! ! Kids were so happy and I got lots of complements from people .. they said that it looked like a professional work . Very smooth paint , i love the paint brush so nice to work with and the book is amazing!!Shows you step by step on every picture ... THUMBS UP ! !
5 #### I have been using face paint on my children 's faces for about 4 years now . I think I 'm pretty good . This kit made my daughter 's face look great and it was so easy to use !
4 #### I 'm so glad that I got this kit for my son 's 1st birthday party . The one kit lastest the entire party with alot left over for one or two more parties . The book also gave alot of fun face painting tips , which will be well used again and again . The paint did n't smear at all , unless you wanted to take it off and then it came off with a damp cloth . The painted designs actually had such a smooth glossy look to it . No complaints here !
5 #### Klutz puts out a great product for all beginners as well as Kidz . The how - to 's are instructional and simple enough to get all ages started and interested in Painting Faces . If you have a little talent for drawing , and like to see your friends faces light up , this is a great ice breaker for friendly gatherings . It does n't stop there . This is also a stepping stone to much more . Painting on Skin is different that anything else you may ever do . From years of drawing and painting , there are two things you must do . 1 . Keep your lines clean and simple . 2 . Practice , Practice , Practice ! Happy Face Painting ! Miki
5 #### Your girls ( and boys ) will love this product . It 's fun and easy to do and the end product is fun to wear .
5 #### My daughter and I just got done using her glossy band kit ... These are so fun ! She ca n't wait until she goes back from vacation to give them to her best friends .
5 #### Bought this for our grandson . He loved it ! My wife and I , and his parents are so pleased to see him so happy !
5 #### I bought this for my son when he was about 11 months old because he really enjoyed the Twinkle Twinkle Elmo soft book that his grandma had bought for him . He loves " finding " Elmo in the various scenes . I just wish I had bought it for him when he was a little bit younger so we could have gotten more use out of it . At 15 months now , he seems to be losing interest a bit .
4 #### We wanted to get another book like the Big Birds Friends softplay book , and we only found the two Elmo books . This one is fun , but the Big Bird book has more variety and is more creative .
5 #### My baby absolutely loves Elmo and so this book seemed perfect for her . I 'm happy to say I was right : this book is nice and soft and beautifully illustrated so my little one takes it everywhere and " reads " it all of the time . While Elmo is the main character of because he hides on each page , other Sesame Street characters are also featured which is fun , too . Another great , interactive , Elmo centric book that I would recommend for the Sesame Street / Elmo lovers is " Twinkle , Twinkle Elmo " ( which is also available on Amazon for a great price ) .
5 #### I bought this for my litle one and it 's a hit ! I love that it gives her the opportunity to interact with the story and I can see her fully invested in Elmo 's getting ready for bed ( her favorite parts are helping him to brush his teeth , squeaking his toy in the bath , and helping to find David in the toy chest ) . For any Sesame Street loving kid , this book hits the spot .
5 #### I 'm so happy with this soft book , the colors , size , everything in it ! ! ! and the most important thing : safety ! ! ! This book its everything I was looking for for my baby girl ! ! ! She looooved it since day one , she is 6months and puts everything in her mouth , but pays a lot of attention to the sounds of the fabric and everything this book contains ! ! I 'm planning on buying more for her ! !
5 #### Fantastic Gift This cloth book comes in a carrying case which a one year old enjoys carrying around . It is a good size book for a little one to hold .
2 #### I returned this , did n't like it at all . Not well put together , kind of cheapie . I bought 2 as gifts for my nephews and would have been embarrassed to give them as a gift .
5 #### My 10 month granddaughter loves this ... Nice and colorful ... light ... and interactive .
3 #### I thought it 'd be a bit larger and more impressive . We 're keeping it as my baby loves Elmo but just had a different thought as to what it would be .
5 #### A great combo for early " bookworms " Elmo and the cloth book format . This also has an interactive element on each page . The pages are bright and engaging . Purchased for my new grand child , and I will need to get one for my soon to be 2yr old grandson who adores all things Elmo !
4 #### This books is n't a multiple page thing but my little one enjoys gnawing on it in her car seat . It does n't keep her attention a very long time though .
3 #### Although I loved the story itself and the recording instructions were clear and easy to follow , I was disappointed that the story can only be read in bright light . Apparently , strong light is needed to activate the recorded message . So , if you are purchasing this as a bedtime story to be read in muted light , it absolutely will not work . I ended up taking out the batteries and just reading it to my grandson as a regular story book .
1 #### I bought this book for my husband to record for my son - he travels for work . It would not record . It was a waste of money and the book is pretty wordy anyway .
1 #### This review is about the description , which is false . This deck does not include the 5 headed dragon card and it does not include the power of the dualist booster pack . This item ONLY includes the Dinosaur rage deck of 40 cards .
5 #### Great product ! This was a gift for my son , and he absolutely loved it !
5 #### This product is the best in the world I love to have it , I will buy it again if I have more money .
5 #### I sell cards . I bought this to sell it . It 's ok . No much to say aboud it . If you like Yu - Gi - Oh and you think this may help you . They are great quality
5 #### I personally did n't use this item , but the person that got it was very excited and seemed to be very happy with it .
5 #### This is a very strong deck . I have purchased 2 of Dino decks and have created a very powerful deck that is tough to beat . I purchased 2 so that I can keep the other foil card as part of my collection and to add to my curreent deck . Over all , a great purchase .
5 #### If you run a Pathfinder game , you NEED this ! ! ! Hardcover ... solid , thick . most impressive ! And it is organized , easy to find what you are looking for . Has all the necessary stats . I use it for my 3.5 game as well as my new Pathfinder game . Excellent gift idea for the budding Game Master or as a present to yourself for all your hard work ! ! ! I totally recommend this screen .
5 #### The DM 's screen allows the Dungeon Master to keep his notes and dice rolls hidden from the players and provides easy access to key charts when running the game . This screen is one of the best I have ever had . It is made from the same heavy card stock that hardcover gaming books use . It is a four - fold screen , providing more cover than many of the three - fold versions and also has the art from Wayne Reynolds ' Iconic Player characters , as introduced in the Pathfinder RPG .
5 #### Very sturdy and well made . Invaluable tool for making the game move smoothly .
5 #### I needed a good screen and this one is solid in construction and information .
4 #### Has a lot of random , useless information , such as the HP / AC of physical items but then does n't have the " Dazed " condition , which is really , really common condition . Otherwise , it 's excellent .
5 #### Filled with charts so you do n't have to crack a book so often .
5 #### I really did n't expect this to be THIS sturdy , despite the reviews . I figured this to be a thick cardboard screen ... but it really is like a good hardcover book cover . The only way it would have been sturdier is if it was wood or plastic ! Four panels - for the win ! Now you can have the info you need and run with two sheets behind the stand : map and campaign notes for example . I agree that the character progression chart is redundant . It 's useful only if you are actively creating battle scenarios while playing your own adventure : though most savvy GMs will actually have a pre - made list of potential random encounters and an average xp and gp range to allocate . Attacks of opportunity would have been more welcome ... or there are several other things that are in the additional rules which would have made sense . Otherwise it 's awesome . Though I would like a second option for a GM screen art style - perhaps a landscape of mountains , rivers , lakes , forests , ruined castles , and the like just to give a nice ' fantasy world ' backdrop . The characters are really cool ... except the Chris Angel ' I 'm gon na get all MINDFREAK on your PCs ! ' wizard guy . He 's pretty silly .
5 #### I 've seen these DM / GM screens a few times before and they 're very well made and are necessary if you plan to run a game . Not just for blocking the players ' view of your stuff , but to have ready access to certain info . I tried to make my own DM Screens and invested $ 15 into two different attempts - both wasted . I finally gave in and bought this one - happy that I finally have something worth owning in my hand .
4 #### I love this screen but it is missing a few nice charts . I would like an Attack of Opportunity chart . That would make things easier . Some of the other combat action info would have been nice too . It also seems a little tall . Probably better to use on a side table if possible . Otherwise it blocks the action .
5 #### This GM 's Screen is fantastic . It 's of remarkably high quality in both design and function . I would highly recommend this for anyone even remotely interested being a Pathfinder game master , both for novices and experts alike .
5 #### I use this gaming screen in my Pathfinder gaming sessions to help look up quick skill checks and help calculate experience like bonuses for story and trap encounters . I put pawns and my notes behind the screen to get ready for planned events and shield my notes from the players . To help with initiative , I take two post - it notes and attach them sticky side up to form an upside down V. I had each player draw a doodle for their character on one side of the V , whether it was a portrait , sigil , or just their name . I put their initial on the other side for my reference . I made some additional note Vs for the enemy initiative . During play , I have everyone roll initiative , then I can sort the Vs in order along the top of the screen . The glossy surface of the screen lets the notes slide . It keeps the players engaged and helps to speed up combats since people know turn order .
5 #### Just started playing Pathfinders and I was looking for something like this . I thought of this when still reading through the Beginner 's Box and was watching an episode of the Big Bang Theory and saw the guys playing D&D. I saw them using a GM Screen for their game and so I started to look for something for Pathfinder . I found this and was BLOWN away to see that it 's so much more than a screen to do my dice rolls behind . It also had stat listings on it and refers back to the Core Rulebook .
5 #### First off the quality of construction surprised me . I was expecting very thin paper but this is made from a very thick stock that feels more like a book cover . A lot of important information is readily available at a quick glance and saves looking up rules in some situations . Overall I am very impressed with this screen and will use it for other games just for the quality of construction even if the information is not relevant .
4 #### It 's very well organized , and I 'm looking forward to the time when I might get to use it . Pathfinder appears to be very intriguing .
5 #### GMs best friend . Hide your dice rolls , short list for all those skill checks we 're never sure about , and looks awesome !
5 #### Great artwork , and offers perfect concealment for the screwing I plan to visit upon my players . This screen 's opaqueness ensures they are unable to see the host of monsters , traps , and railroading plot twists I am holding in store for them . The only complaint I have is that if it were soundproof , it would also hide my girlish giggles at the thought of imminent TPKs I 'm about to unleash . Also , the backside is covered with charts and tables perfect for setting the die rolls they have to make JUST out of their reach .
5 #### This such a good game . Luckily it did not bought by WOTC . The screen has all the info you need to run a game without having to turn to the books .
5 #### Very strong and sturdy , and super useful . Makes checking several books for charts almost unnecessary . I have used old D&D screens in the past and they are 1/5th as thick as this one . Its so strong it will support several books balancing on the edge while opened . Get it you will not be disappointed !
4 #### Good for starting out and making sure pc 's do n't see your preplanned adventures and dice rolls . Also has short cut facts and stats stuff so you do n't have to constantly flip threw the core rules to find frequently used info . Like a giant cheat sheet for pathfinder .
5 #### I run Savage Worlds , Call of Cthulhu and a variety of D20 games , and have commercially made GM screens for 'em all . None of them come up to this level of completeness . So , whaddaya get for your money ? A sturdily made four panel landscape screen . On the player side , evocative artwork as depicted in the picture . On the GM side , just about every situational rule you 'll need to apply clearly laid out with no unnecessary stuff crowding out useful information . Why ca n't every D20 screen be this well thought out ? Forget that . Why ca n't * any * game system 's screen be this well thought out ? Even if you do n't use a screen you should have this as a reference card . If you have made your own screen ( as have I on many occasions ) - switch it out for this one .
5 #### This is a great game screen / cheat sheet . Has very useful commonly needed stats and is a very hard glossy colorful cardboard material .
5 #### " GM Screen " by Paizo , published and distributed by Paizo Publishing . This four panel Gamemasters screen for the Pathfinder role playing game features extra durable hardcover stock pages , a great piece of art on the player 's side , and four pages of quick reference charts on the GM 's side . Page One , " Skills " , includes charts for acrobatic maneuvers , bluffing , wind effects on flight , Climbing , Diplomacy , Disabling Devices , and flying . Page Two , " Skills " , has references for healing , knowledge , perception , riding , spellcraft , survival , and swimming . Page Three , " Combat " , contains attack roll modifiers , armor class modifiers , combat maneuvers , two - weapon fighting , concentration checks , and a great list of conditions that affect combat . Page Four , " Miscellaneous " , shows armor and weapon hardness , other item hardness , and common item hardness as well as charts for XP awards , and for treasure values per encounter . Having these charts at your fingertips saves a lot of time leafing through the various books for a quick ruling . The four panel construction gives GM 's room for both a notepad and their maps . The heavy card stock covers means its very durable and suitable for frequent use . If you 're a GM for a Pathfinder game , and you do n't have this screen , my suggestion is that it be the next item on your " To Purchase " list . Highly recommended .
5 #### Item is more durable than any GM screen I have ever seen . Made from the same stock as D&D book covers . Contains all info you could ever want on Hardness of items , Character conditions , Skill check dc 's and MORE !
5 #### In my opinion the best book for D&D thus far . It keeps the best parts of basic through 3.x , while simplifying the magic item creations . It is in no way like 4.0 ( a paper based video game ) . I love how they brought back the stone tell for the dwarfs , the passage detection for elves , and other amusing racial abilitys that the races had in 2nd edition . Fantastic art work to boot .
5 #### This is such a well - reviewed game , I do not think I have much to add other than my 12 year old son , a huge RPG fan , LOVES it and enjoys playing it on his own . By chance , I happened into his bedroom to look at the game and noticed it came with character layout sheets . I was thankful I was able to snag a clean copy of the sheet for the manufacturer - authorized photocopying before he had used them all to develop his characters ( I think there are only 5 sheets in the box . ) I now have one set aside in my office for the future .
5 #### I bought a beginner box from a store a few months back for a few friends of mine who wanted to try out the world of pen and paper games ! We absolutely loved it ! It 's becoming an obsession ! I just bought this one to start another game with other people and after playing it just once , everybody is on board and ready for more ! The pawns are great , the map is great with the dry erase back , giving us endless terrain and adventure ! The only problem was insufficient dice ! And since I am currently living in Egypt , I could n't find it anywhere here , so I had to have a family member , visiting the states , pick it up for me !
5 #### great beginner series and awesome and clear instructions highly recommended for intro into pathfinder
5 #### Being relatively new to the board gaming community , I have been dabbling here and there trying to find a good game that scales from solo play all the way up to multiple players . Upon receiving my copy of Pathfinder ACG , I immediately dug into the first scenarios and found that this is a very clever card game that I have since developed a bit of an addiction to . This game plays great solo ! Plays even better with 2 or more players ! The thing that I like best about the game is that there is player progression between multiple scenarios which comprise several adventures . There is nothing like getting that new weapon in your hand that allows you to roll more just one more die to fight or acquire goodies . I highly recommend this game and I think if you are on the fence , you should definitely give it a shot as it 's well worth your time .
5 #### This box contains everything you need to learn the basics of the Pathfinder RPG system . Granted , it 's not everything , if you intend on getting into the full RPG and adventures that go with it , but it is a great way to introduce yourself or others into the system . It was a bit overwhelming in the beginning as there is a lot to read and take in , but Paizo created an adventure that is included that walks you through the entire adventure . Creating a character is super easy as well . Paizo created a walkthrough for creating the character that makes it very easy to fill out each box with the appropriate info and explains what each thing does and why . The box comes with everything you 'd need to play the beginner adventure as well as things you 'd need to move on to the full RPG . You get a map that is blank on one side for your own adventures and printed for the included adventure . A set of dice and a whole bunch of cardboard characters and monsters . If you have had no exposure to the Pathfinder universe / RPG , this is a great way to learn about it and introduce others to it . If you already have friends that play Pathfinder , I 'd recommend creating a character with them and jump right into the main RPG with help from your friends .
5 #### I 've been a roleplayer for the past 35 years , and this is hands - down the best boxed set for instructional roleplay use I 've ever seen . And it 's good for extended play , as well , I gave this set to a friend 's son and he 's been able to round up three friends and they 've played using only this set and the free dowloads from Paizo.com for four months , and they 're still going strong . Recently purchased another for myself and have plans to give it to another kid of about the right age . The materials are all top - notch . The box itself is of the hardiest construction I 've ever seen from a boxed product in the RPG field , it 'll take a lot of rough use from a teenager . The materials are great , well written , and you get A LOT for what you pay . If you 're shopping for a beginner 's or instructional set , congratulations , you 've found the one to buy .
5 #### I got this for myself to begin to learn the game . I 'll continue to use it every single time I introduce someone to the game as well . I already got more than my moneys worth , and it 'll only go on with continued use . The map , cardboard cutouts and dice will continue to be used even when I 'm not playing the beginners box specifically . It 's great that the map is two sided and the back is blank to create my own . The rules are easy enough to setup and play with quickly and the adventure in the book is easy to follow and customize . My only complaint is that some of the rules that are left out will have to be " re - learned " , but that 's not really a big deal . The point is to try to get people involved in the game with as little hassle as possible and it does a good job of that . There is no way you could go wrong for this price .
5 #### There was a box with stuff . In this box you find 1 sheet of character pieces , 2 sheets of beast pieces , 1 guid to being a dm , 1 guide to being a player , both of which contain the basics for learning the game and basic rules , 1 bag of piece placers about 15 , 1 map , 1 set of dice , and an infinite amount of pending adventures . Came unscratched and non- dented .
5 #### Like some others , I bought the D&D 4th ed red box as well , and my main disappointment with that was the lack of character creation instructions . You build a character as you go through the intro adventure but a LOT is left unexplained or completely omitted , and who wants to go through an adventure every time they build a character ! ? Pathfinder 's intro books are much clearer and they even give you a cheat sheet inside the book covers for how to do it . While the D&D art in later volumes is definitely more professional and painterly looking than the comic book - style Pathfinder uses , that 's not the case in the two beginner sets . There 's no contest , because the D&D ones look like art students made them while Pathfinder 's are the ones that look professionally done . I know a lot of experienced people were turned off by D&D 's 4th edition rules and gravitated to Pathfinder ( which is often called D&D v3.75 ) but I have n't gotten deep enough into either to say I like one over the other . They 're both similar and I think most beginners wo n't notice differences or care when they do . Pathfinder 's box however includes more and is higher quality than the D&D one and it has made me want to go further with their system .
5 #### we got this for our 10 year old son who is totally into role - playing games . This particular version came highly recommended by a euro - gamer enthusiast we are friends with . We have played several times with him and it 's great ! ! Only thing : I wish the laminated board was a bit less ... curly . maybe a " real " euro board laminated but rigid so it would stay flat ?
5 #### This box is a easy to learn way to get into tabletop rpg gaming . It contains everything you need for a quick game . Plus you can go to the paizo website and download additional things that expand the playability of the original . I 've bought this product for 2 of my friends and their kids and they love it .
3 #### Overall I really like it , it just misses the mark for me , see I find the full PF game system just too damn big and crunchy for my tastes , I was really hoping for a set of rules like the old D&D Basic & Expert ( old Red / Blue ) box sets , allowing you to play up to at least 10 or 15th level , something to use as a main set of rules , for us who do n't have time for these huge mega books with a million and one rules crammed in them and a thousand splat books but capping it at 5 levels kinda sucks , I hope they bring out maybe another box set and expand it a few more levels , maybe to 14th level like the old Expert set , that would be nice .
5 #### I tried the recent D&D Redbox and I hated it . I tried this Pathfinder box and I felt it gave me a real understanding of the game . Both books are very solid , I love the small cardboard figures it comes with , and it explains things in ways that even someone brand new to table - top gaming can understand . I ca n't recommend this enough . And even if you 've played before it comes with some great card - board figure holders , it comes with a map that is dry - erase friendly , and it comes with a set of dice ! One thing to note - Paizo 's website has further support for this pack if you finish the included adventure and you get bored with the 4 included classes . They add the class Berserker to the beginner box on there and they have yet another pre - constructed adventure to run though . I absolutely love the company who made this and will be purchasing more from them in the future .
2 #### not easy to use . you have to hunt through the cards to get word matches .
4 #### My beginning reader daughter and my tutoring clients love this ! I do wish it were slightly better organized , as I have to do a lot of pre - planning before teaching with it , but it is a winner with the kids that are using it !
4 #### This is a great idea but I think is a little simple for third graders . I am actually using some of its with my 5 year old granddaughter . My grandson who is entering third grade in the fall feels like it is a little young for him . It depends on the level of reading the child has achieved .
4 #### I guess I was hoping this was a game , but it will be helpful either way for my preschool / Kindergarten kids to understand how to build words .
5 #### We went with an owl theme for my daughters first birthday party ; these stickers were the perfect addition for the favor bags . The price was very reasonable and there were enough stickers so that each child was able to have two sheets .
5 #### Excellent value for what you get ! My toddler is going through her love of stickers right now so we use them a lot ! These are about 1 1/2 inches by 1 1/2 inches per sticker in size . There are 9 stickers per sheet and you get 24 sheets . I have used these for crafts , cards , and halloween ( as an alternative to candy ) . I also purchased these other stickers by the same company and recommend them as well:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Pirates - Stickers / dp / B0032ILW5O / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Pirates Stickers</a>&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Christmas - Stickers / dp / B0032INNQU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Christmas Stickers</a >
5 #### I ordered these for my 13 year - old baby sitter , who loves owls . She loved them . They are very cute ! And the price was excellent .
5 #### I love the stickers I use them to seal the envelopes to the thank you cards I sent out to everybody that came to my daughters first birthday party
5 #### These stickers are cute and the colors are very bold . I love that the quantity of stickers is so high , but the price is very affordable . The stickers are smaller than I expected based on looking at the picture online ( admittedly I did n't look for the dimensions ahead of time ) , but they are perfect for preschoolers . Very happy with this purchase !
5 #### These have been a favorite and a life saver during church . I love that there are so many of them in the pack . I take a sheet or two with us , along with some free coloring pages from the internet and my toddlers are quite content to decorate with them . They are also cute enough that I want to make a matching game with them .
5 #### Perfect for little kids . My son gets stickers as a reward and he was very excited about these colorful owls . They are colorful and exactly what I expected . Definitely worth the price .
5 #### Do you have a kid who likes owls and squares / rectangles ? They will love these stickers . If America was ruled by our toddler , these would probably be our national currency .
5 #### Great product , Fast delivery & good packaging . Will order again ! ! Granddaughter loved it !
5 #### There are 24 sheets of these . They 're very cute !
5 #### These are so cute , and there are a ton of them . My son is putting them on everything lol They 're good quality , bright colors , easy to peel , stick well . GREAT stickers ! <3
5 #### Bought these to pass out at an OWL themed birthday party . They were a big hit .
5 #### Very pretty stickers and very good quality . They are made of thick paper and do not rip as you peal them off as some other stickers tend to do .
5 #### used these to decorated name plates for food items . they worked great they were cute too
3 #### The photo looks as if they are bigger than when you actually see them .. However they are very cute they did n't fit the reason I bought them ...
4 #### Adorable stickers , beautiful , vibrant colors - but very small .
5 #### Always a favourite for little fingers that do n't have the skill to peel off shapely stickers . My kids love them !
4 #### Great price for my preschooler 's classroom pinata . We made small baggies with each of the children 's names on them , then filled with non - candy treats . This was the perfect size for each of them and a great price .
5 #### These stickers are a bit smaller than the usual sticker sheets , but the pages are easy to separate ( for putting in goody bags ) and the colors are very bright . And the price ca n't be beat -- even with a witches broom !
5 #### Great price and arrived just in time for Halloween !
5 #### The stickers are cute and not expensive , the preschoolers loved them as award incentives . I have purchased other packs and love them all .
5 #### I bought these to put in Halloween goodie bags for my son 's 1st grade class . In addition to some other fun kid 's stationary supplies ... my son had a lot of fun helping me make the bags and he was really excited with all of the items . He said " I know they 'll love this stuff ! " So , that 's always great . They are very cute and good quality too .
5 #### My granddaughter loves these stickers . I purchased several sets and they were a great price . She is 15 mos and loves putting them on construction paper and my clothes ( :
5 #### I purchased these to include in the goody bags for a class of preschool students . I was trying to avoid candy treats , and these brightly colored jack - o - lantern faces fit the bill .
5 #### These cute pumpkin stickers are great to add to letters since they do no increase the postage or they make a great addition to any goody bag .
5 #### These were really cute , I got for a friend who loves owls . There were so many little sheets I decided to use these on the kids chore board . If they had a really good day , instead of the normal star stickers they got an owl instead . When the line was filled up with stickers , each sticker would represent something ( little starts were worth 25 cents and the owls were worth a $ 1 ) , they loved to see an owl on their line .
5 #### I did n't realize there were so many in the package ! I am not sure how I will use all of these , but so far we 've had a lot of fun with them . Like another reviewer , I also hoped the stickers were diecut around the owl , but they are squares . That was kind of disappointing but not a huge deal .
5 #### Cute stickers for toddlers . These are very small but a nice size to put inside birthday cards . Great price and value .
5 #### I paid about a dollar and a half for these adorable owl stickers . They are great for goody bags and for my toddler who has a voracious desire to stick endless amounts of stickers on paper . This is a great deal .
5 #### We got these for our teal pumpkin treat last Halloween . The trick or treaters loved them ! I was really surprised how many kids took them -- they definitely did n't all have allergies or food sensitivities , so they picked them over the all the candy we offered . Plus , I think the stickers are just cute and were a good price for how many we got .
5 #### Used these to decorate sacks for Halloween gifts to family children . They loved them and even had some left over to put inside as a treat for the kids to use .
5 #### My grand daughter is in the first grade and her teacher puts stickers on everything ! Knowing the limited resources of our teachers , I 'm always on the lookout for small things that she can use . These stickers were perfect as Halloween treats for the class . There are 24 individual sheets that are exactly as shown . The colors are clear and crisp . The students loved them .
4 #### I purchased these for goody bags for the kids in my daughter 's Pre - K class . They are small , but perfect for giving away to kids !
5 #### My Grand Daughter loves anything Owl and she will love these stickers ! I liked the price and its worth the money .
5 #### These are so adorable I plan to buy more to use as stocking stuffers . Will be great for anyone who loves stickers . Those little owls bring a smile .
5 #### Excellent and fun stickers for preschoolers for fall and Halloween ! The children loved them !
5 #### Very cute , colorful stickers . Perfect for the back of cards and envelopes . Very quick arrival . I recommend ordering these stickers .
4 #### Very cute & good price ! A little small but fine for favors . Seem to be good quality , nice colors . M
4 #### My daughter loves owls . Her room is full of them , her clothes are covered in them , and her favorite books feature them . These stickers are owls , so she loves them . I was not surprised based on prior reviews to see how small they are , but they 'll work well on a bookmark or to personalize something she owns . Would recommend .
5 #### Adorable little owls ... and so many sheets of stickers for this price ! These are perfect for decorating things with , for scrapbooks or just for rewarding a good little child !
3 #### I was expecting the stickers to be bigger , but they are very cute . I have a new love for owls and my son has always loved them . I give him an owl for " jobs well done "
5 #### These are bright and big , and there are 9 stickers to a page . They even arrived quickly . I am gld I ordered several packs !
4 #### For the price , I think the stickers are adorable and they stick well . We have used them for craft projects for my young toddler . I would buy them again . I also thought the quantity was good for the price .
5 #### I put these on students ' quizzes when they do well ( I teach high school , but who does n't love stickers ) , and they love them . I love them , too , because they 're colorful and cute , yet high quality . They do n't tear easily at all ; in fact , several of my students peel them off quizzes and put them on their notebooks ! And they hold up .
5 #### I love owls and owl stickers are super fun and cute . You get a lot . Great for gift basket filler too .
5 #### Great value for the money ! My two year old has no problems peeling them off and they 're such fun stickers .
4 #### The colors and the quality are great . The graphics are cute and keep my granddaughter happy and busy . She puts them in her journal .
4 #### Great stickers but not quite what I was expected probably my fault for not reading more carefully I though this was an actual book
5 #### Pack of stickers ; basically is what I wanted . Cute colorful owl stickers ! I m very pleased w this lil owl find !
5 #### You do n't have to be an owl lover to fall in love with these cute big eyed little creatures . I am so excited to receive these in the mail so i can share them with the little ones at work and friends via the mail . an excelent product at a great price !
5 #### These are so colorful and cute . I used them for my daughters first birthday as party favors for an owl theme . They were perfect !
3 #### check out the dimensions because these stickers were pretty small , but the price is so low that they are well worth it . I bought them for a fairy party and glad I bought not just 1 style , but 3 styles - Mermaids , Fairies and pirates for a boy - girl neverland themed party .
1 #### These are n't cut out around shapes ; all squares . Also too small .
5 #### These are really cute and I will buy again for a gift . It 's a great addiction to a mermaid toy for a birthday gift .
5 #### Super cute , perfect for goodie bags . Smaller than I realized , but not a big deal .
3 #### Priced accordingly . Pic on computer is slightly brighter . And the actual sticker sheet is 3 x 3.5 inches . It 's just tinier than appears on the screen . Description states 3"x5 " but includes the packaging . It 's also an add on item , but came in a huge box by itself . Still alright for Mermaid Party Favors . It think because it came in the big box , is what compelled me to write a review on a pack of $ 2 stickers : )
4 #### These are very cute but as other reviewers commented very Small . They are slightly bigger than the size of a credit card ( 3"x3.5 " ) . These are perfect for Mermaid / Pirate goodie bag . Not sure why this mermaid design is so much more than the other designs , but all of them are super cute .
3 #### I though these were going to be on a sheet about 4 X 5 but they are very small and in squares . The mermaids do not come off individually .
4 #### Great party favor but I guess I mis read the size because they are really tiny . Still , kids loved them and would buy again for the price !
5 #### These mermaid stickers are a big hit in preschool . They are small but not to small . They would make perfect birthday favors .
5 #### Very cute , perfect size for what I needed . The kids loved them !
5 #### These are very cute stickers- perfect for using to decorate holiday cards or presents . The colors were vivid , the paper quality is good , and they look nice .
5 #### So cute . You get a lot for your money . Plus they actually stick ... whereas so many stickers seem to just fall off ! We used them to make , " Thank You Snow Very Much " cards for friends and family this Christmas ! Will purchase again .
5 #### So cute ! Used them for putting stickers on some presents that were Penguin - themed . They stayed on well , and look great in person !
5 #### I received in on time just before 2 days to birthday which was penguin themed . There were several sheets in one pack , plenty more than needed . I ordered 3 .
5 #### I Love the stickers . They are so cute and a good size . They will be great for packages and scrapbooking .
5 #### Great value in stickers . Very nice size and coloring . Good for rewards or to decorate presents or cards . Would buy again .
2 #### Box is heavily damaged . Not great for a collectible action figure . Good if u plan on ripping the box open an using it ....
5 #### i told myself that i will going to collect action figures of my favorite cartoons when i get older and have the money to afford it . And that is why i bought this one . I am so grateful that i am now fulfilling the promise i made to my 7yrold self .
5 #### 6 year old loves Deadpool , this worked out . Very happy . Good product for the price .
5 #### so happy we found it ! My son loves dead pool and even though he is too young for the movie dead pool has appeared in some of his regular spiderman cartoons . He loves dead pool and I have been searching for a while for a toy . This one is really large and well made . Comes with some accessories I took away just because they were a little violent but over all so happy with it !
5 #### This is a great deadpool figure . Fits great with marvel select . Bulky but not anything that could take it down . Comes with many accessories . Kattanas break fairly easily so be careful but for the most part great figure ! !
5 #### This one looks really cute in actual . My husband loves it . Great buy .
5 #### Nice little Piggy Bank . Walking Dead fans will love . Does n't hold much money . Detail and color is cool .
3 #### I just received this bank today . I immediately noticed several things . 1 . It is small . Like really small . I popped out my tape measure thinking , surely this is not 8 inches . That s what she said right ? 2 . It is so light ! It definitely does n't seem to be made of very high quality material , and that chain is so flimsy , that it looks like it could break quite easily . 3 . Just looking at the picture , and comparing it to the bank I am holding in my hands .... my bank does not look as nice as this picture . There is blue from the pants in small areas of the abdomen , and the black looks like it was applied with a trowel on mine . Over all , it was a nice idea , but I definitely think I over paid for the quality of product I received . 3 stars for it not being a total failure . If they used better materials I would have gone with a 4 or even 5 star review , even with the poor paint job .
5 #### bought this item for my nephew , we took him to senoia Georgia where season 3 of the walking dead , went to a small shop there and they had some souveniers
5 #### As a Walking Dead fan , this is a great item to have . Will be getting a second one .
5 #### I gave this to my son as a Christmas present and he LOVED it !
5 #### Fate Core ( which is absolutely necessary for this product , introduced a refined RPG system that focuses on story above all else . Your characters are tough and are nearly - unkillable but the can be maimed to the point of uselessness and it might be time to make a new character while your old one retires to a background character or a source of quests for revenge due to their injuries . Fate allowed players and the GM to create worlds and scenarios together leading to a great overall understanding of the universe everyone was playing in and the broad and simple rules made it a snap to learn . The big rub was that SOME things NEEDED depth , how magic works , how cybernetic enhancements would change characters , and the negative aspect of using too much of these things with one character . While Fate Core touched on how to balance stuff like this , the Fate System Toolkit refines it and offers much easier source material to fine craft the universe you and your players game in . Not only a good GM tool , the System Toolkit is best shared with players to get a good idea on how to handle the game more fluidly .
5 #### Lots of easy to implement options for Fate . I would say that it is a must - buy for Fate Core .
5 #### Nice " cheat sheet " to help with building a world with the Fate roleplaying system .
5 #### If you collect this series of figures , you can not pass this one over . Again fantastic detail and a nice size in comparison with the human figures . The paint job on this guy is perhaps his best feature because blue on blue could have been just plain boring but he looks really good . Again I like the pose which is important for non - articulated figures . This time he holds his spear and it is not separate in the box like in the case of the swords . However mine is not bend probably because the spear is more robust than the swords . Again highly recommended .
5 #### Love this White walker so much I bought the Bust of him as well . The bust was like $ 150.00 or something like that and I got it for only $ 55.00 so I was happy about that .
5 #### I have n't actually got this figure yet but going from the others i have from this series they were highly detailed so if you are a collector this is a must have i have a group on facebook that has figures from movies and games www.facebook.com/groups/Smalltoys
5 #### The figure is amazing . The detail in and quality of Dark Horse 's GOT collection is incredible . I own the whole series and ca n't wait for the next one to be released ! You will not be disappointed .
5 #### The figure is amazing . The detail in and quality of Dark Horse 's GOT collection is incredible . I own the whole series and ca n't wait for the next one to be released ! You will not be disappointed .
5 #### The Game of thrones figures are fantastic . They are more like statues & not action figures . They are extremely well made & very lifelike & look great as part of a collection
5 #### A must have for any Dark Horse Deluxe GoT collector ! The detail on this figure is amazing .
5 #### The quality is not perfect but much more worth this price .
4 #### Bought this for my oldest daughter , because she had started playing DND as well . I also bought her some dice to go with it . It is the same size as the one I got her brother . And I like the fact that I was able to find a different design , so we can tell their bags apart .
4 #### It 's certainly a bag , for holding dice . It does in face do what it says . My only issue is that it did n't come in different colors : the person I purchased it for is colorblind , so he sees the blue as more of a gray . Other than that it 's fine .
5 #### This is a pretty good dice bag . I recommend it to anyone who loves dice . it 's a great dice bag !
5 #### I did n't know if I would like this bag as first but earn the box came in and we opened it we were shocked . This bag was big enough to fit an orange into . So we put all of our dice and miniatures in it . It does have a velvet texture and is thin cloth but it works well .
5 #### Awesome dice bag . Well made and it fits A LOT of dice . Unfortunately me and my husband tend to collect dice for our D&D games and my collection has outgrown my bag ... lol
5 #### This is a pretty good dice bag . I recommend it to anyone who loves dice . it 's a great dice bag !
5 #### I love board games . We played this one three times through the very first time . You 'll love the quality of the pieces and art . The press your luck feel really adds to the drama . Lots of fun .
5 #### my son is a gamer and this is a great game for him to add to his collection . Will make a great gift .
5 #### I just finished playing my first ever game of Adventurers : Pyramid of Horus , with my two six year old twin boys , my nine year old boy , my thirty year old brother and his thirty one year old friend . Why do the ages matter ? Because every single one of us had an absolute blast from six years old all the way up to the thirties . When the game first started off it went at a medium pace but as each round came to a close and another block dropped into the pyramid , blocking the path out , things really began to heat up ! The frantic balance between going further into the pyramid for one more treasure versus playing it safe and staying close to the exit for small treasure is perfect . My six year old boys understood the rules and with minimal help were able to manage their own turns . I just ca n't say enough about how fun and exciting this game was . The quality of the board , miniatures , cards and accessories was top notch but I expect nothing less from Fantasy Flight games . By the time the dust settled the entire family had laughed , yelled , jumped out of our seats , shouted with joy and had the greatest fun with a board game we 've had in a long time . I highly recommend this game to all ages , if you can handle a little excitement and adventure that is !
5 #### Awesome depiction of the original Normandy , essential for any Mass Effect diehard . Only thing is how it 's out of scale with the SR-2 replicas , but then we 'd have received a pretty tiny SR-1 , so easily excused . Might be the right scale next to the larger SR-2 replica coming soon though ( if you 're willing to pay for it ) ! All the paint is perfect , and the stand is a nice touch compared to the ones that came with the SR-2s . Short of it : Dark Horse knocked this one out of the park IMO . Very satisfied with it .
5 #### I 'm horrible with sizes . I read them and nod , thinking I know what I 'm getting them I 'm always surprised . This time in a good way . I have a friend who is new to tabletop gaming so I bought him this and a set of dice as a gift . The good surprise comes in now - this bag is large enough to grow his collection of dice in . He 's since been happily carrying his bag to game night , talking about new dice he found . That 's a super win in my book . Final note : bag is is sturdy and of a nice quality , it cheap at all .
5 #### Bought this as a gift . The recipient was very pleased .
4 #### BOTTOM LINE I like this bag and use it weekly in my gaming . It 's not perfect , but I do like it . DETAILS I bought this bag to keep plastic miniatures in , and can put a lot of them in there ( several dozen ) . While the fabric does n't feel especially luxurious , it has held up OK to weekly use for many months without any signs of wear . The sword emblem is also holding up well , with no signs of wear . The only wear item , if you want to call it that , is that one of the draw string knots untied and the string slipped out . I 'm sure when I have some time , I can feed it back in and re - knot it . A minor annoyance . When the bag is full , the draw strings do have a tendency to gradually lose their grip ( top of the bag slowly works its way open ) . Not a biggie , but if you need a bag that will absolutely stay closed during transit , this probably is n't the bag you need . What would make this bag better in my personal opinion ? a ) a more luxurious feeling fabric ( softer ) b ) an un - truncated sword image c ) beefier string that is less inclined to relax its grip when pulled closed .
4 #### High quality dice bag that sets me apart from the rest . No need for a crown royal dice bag anymore . The symbol is painted on , although it appears embroidered in the photo . An inexpensive dice bag to show off your uniqueness !
5 #### Got this for my dad for Father 's Day . It 's super cool , nice and detailed , and has a good solid weight to it . I kind of want one for myself now too lol
5 #### this is a item that will enhance your ( Dark Horse ) Game of thrones Collection , It is not a kids toy it is a collectible , for such a small item it is big on detail , do n't hesitate just get it
4 #### Bought this as a birthday gift for a friend- and they loved it . It 's a really good model , but it 's quite small . Perfect for a small display ( my friend has his on top of his game consoles ) and durable if you 've got nosy kitties , but not quite what I was expecting .
5 #### I gave this as a gift and it was very well received by the GoT fan that got it . The overall quality is evident as is the detail in the figure and painting . A really nice piece although it is fairly small .
5 #### The picture is slightly misleading , as other reviewers have already noted . But the bag is huge and the sword still looks cool . Seems like durable material and was delivered swiftly and safely .
1 #### This dice bag was actually very disappointing . It looks very nice , but it does n't hold up under wear and tear . The felt started falling off within weeks , the silver press on sword peeled off and within two months , I had to find a new dice bag solution .
4 #### My son , had gotten some dungeons and dragon dice for Christmas . He had been borrowing his dad 's dice and the dice bag . Well , shortly after getting the dice , I decided to try and find a dice bag of his own . I thought the sword on the bag fit perfectly with the color of his dice and it 's a good size and can hold more than one set of dice ( so if he gets anymore of his own ) . The dimensions are 6.25"x 9 " ( 15.9 cm x 22.9 cm ) . It 's 50/50 polyester and nylon .
5 #### I love this bag . It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be , I can fit a lot of my dice sets inside of it . Its super soft and a very nice addition for anyone looking for a new bag or more bag sets .
5 #### One of the larger Dice Bags available . The embroidered emblem is a nice touch of personalization and comes in a few different options . Well constructed .
3 #### My issue is that when I bought this I did n't see a description of the size . I thought the dragon would be the size of the other Deluxe Figures but its way smaller than them . Basically its the size of the Dragons in Astapor when compared to the Khaleesi .
4 #### Looks good and made a prefect present for a GOT fan
5 #### The quality is not perfect but much more worth this price . It is delicate and exquisite .
4 #### This is a nice little figurine and I do mean little . It 's heavy though , made out of metal , and is a nice pose for the dragon . The paint job is n't the greatest , thus the 4 stars .
5 #### Not as fragile as I was expecting it to be . Fairly solid and slightly hefty , it is metal , not plastic . I love the Mass Effect series and this is a great addition to my mancave displays . Highly recommended .
5 #### Need the SR-1 to go with my SR-2 Cerberus & alliance Normandy 's . Only grip I can have is that the SR-1 is a little bigger than the SR-2 's .
5 #### 60 cards 1 new hero , what s not to like ? ? This expansion fleshes out an already awesome core game . I highly recommend all expansions in the mirkwood cycle .
4 #### If your a Mass Effect fan , get it if you could afford it . They wo n't be availabe soon and I do n't think you will ever get a physical model of the Normandy again anytime soon .
5 #### Bought this as a gift for my brother who is also a diehard ME fan . This ship is sturdy and looks great !
5 #### I was expecting a plastic or resian model and this was medal . Super awesome . Will be buying the other ships to go along with this .
5 #### I LOVE THESE ! I wish they had more ships !
5 #### It was a little difficult to get it to sit firmly on its stand , but it 's good quality ! Nice and sturdy and looks great !
5 #### Besides some peoples coloring problems mines great and nicely made .
3 #### It is cool . Think a larger model would be much better someday . This particular one fell short , and seemed a bit pricy .
5 #### Gorgeous replica of the SR-1 . The metal of the ship and the Alliance insignia base gives it an excellent weight and balance so I 'm not worried about it getting knocked off the shelf and smashing . Beautifully detailed and painted , looks just like the ship in the game from every angle . Impressive enough on its own but when looking at the ship and then seeing the price tag , a quality model like this for $ 30 - 40 is a great buy .
3 #### If you plan to play the base game with more than 5 people then this is a must , Other than that it just adds a few more races . i feel the core game adds plenty and does n't really need this or any of the other expansions .
5 #### Ordered this for my son - in - law who already had the base game . He had it listed on his Wish List . He liked it .
2 #### These should be the same price as stickers ... They are basically removable stickers not impressed not really worth any stars free magnet on my phone book is stronger than these
5 #### Great for any GOT fan needing more of GOT ! ! !
2 #### Disappointed with these magnets . They are thin and difficult to crack out of their magnet shell . If I had known , I would have passed on this one .
4 #### I love Game of Thrones , but I was nervous when I these arrived , since they came in a punch out sheet and felt very flimsy . They definitely wo n't hold up anything heavier than a small thin notice or coupon , but they are pretty cool . Not sure if they are going to last very long , they look and feel like they could be taken out of commission if they would fall down or get something spilled on them . Even the Game of Thrones title on the top is a magnet , but it 's the lightest weight of them all .
5 #### Even though these come in a sheet and punch out with fingers , it looks great in person . The colors are vibrant and the sigils for each house are spot on . I 'm not worried about if they can actually hold paper up because I am using them as a collectable decoration for my mini fridge .
5 #### Totally what i expected . It fits perfectly with an armor that i had .
5 #### I love the original game but worried about the expansions having a different card stock . This is NOT a problem . The marine cards and actions are never shuffled or random so it does n't matter . The two teams it comes with are well balanced and offer interesting play options . Well worth a couple bucks .
4 #### These are glossy paper - printed cutout magnets ( in case you were expecting something more substantial ) but they are still attractive and look good on my fridge ! If I saw them in person before buying , I would n't want to pay more than $ 5 - 7 for the set but at that price I would say they are worth it . The printing is high - resolution , glossy with nice colors .
5 #### This game is so much fun , we have played different missions and have yet to get bored .
5 #### I 've played all of the Gears of Wars video games and this board game is a great adaptation to a board game . It seems on its front like a cash grab , but it 's actually a full fledged game that works very well . All parts of the game are scaled for 1 - 4 players , and supported well . The figurines are of great quality , and paintable if you 'd like to do that . The game feels very much like the video games , with needing to grenade emergence holes shut , and horde mode variants and more . The amount of enemies feels a bit worrysome at times , but your COGs are usually able to handle them with smart play .
2 #### I was n't expecting much , but I certainly was n't expecting to be just decals over the magnets . While they look nice , on closer inspection you realize this is something anyone could have done with some adhesive paper , a nice printer and some magnets you can cut .
5 #### i have these on my frig and everytime i have people over and they bring friends , it becomes a whole conversation about the show . Guys!!!!!! ......... the ladies love this show . its was a good ice breaker at a party . ! ! ! ! !
4 #### I was initially very impressed by the magnets , as they are thicker than most flexible magnets are , and I do feel that the quality of the artwork is good . That being said , none of the blue is printed in that color ; my House Arryn and House Tully magnets are definitely purple , and the lighter shade on House Arryn would n't pass for blue even at a glance . So I like them , and they 're of good quality , but the coloring is definitely off for the blue , though all other coloring is dead - on .
4 #### After viewing the picture I assumed that this product would be much bigger than they actually were . They look quite nice but I would have loved it if they were a tad bigger . I was n't as concerned in the packaging they arrived in , as others here seem to be . Anyway , these will serve their purpose but I think it 's a little over - priced considering what they are .
5 #### Being a fan of the Gears series for the xbox I was excited to check out the board game version . I am really glad I purchased this . There are many different missions that are all balanced for 1 - 4 players and scale based on the number of players you have . Solo or with friends this game is awesome ! It always is action packed and there is n't hardly any down time at all . Just a few cons for people who are n't into rules . There is a 30 page rule set that you will need to soak up before playing the game . In the end once you play it a couple of times the game is quite easy to play . I would recommend going on youtube and checking out play throughs people have posted to learn easier . There also is cool trailer from fantasy flight that shows you the game mechanics . Set up and tear down do to the many pieces can take a while . It is recommended to buy cases for the tokens and miniatures such as a plano mini tackle box . It will save a ton of time having to bag all of the tokens after every game . Enjoy ! ! !
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with this Cosmic encounter expansion ! It adds even more replayability to a game that is already almost endless in its ' possibilities . If you play with this expansion , I would recommend replacing the aliens in the original game for the first few playthroughs so you get the most out of this experience , and then later on eventually mixing everything together . The chaotic nature of this game is actually what makes it so exciting ; you never know who is going to win , even up to the last turn .
5 #### All these expansions are great - so well made . If you customize the box , you can fit all of them in to the original box . Great game . Expensive , but yeah - great game and well made .
5 #### Solid . Bought them for King of Tokyo with expansions- worked great- nice quality
5 #### I ordered these for use with King of Tokyo Power Up Expansion , specifically the Evolution cards . So far they are holding up to play well and they fit very well .
5 #### most popular expansion of the core game , horrible monsters
5 #### A different take on the mansions of madness game more open ended sacrificing a bit of the narrative options for the keeper but it ends up being open ended and fun
5 #### Cersei Lannister finally gets the Dark Horse treatment , and again they did a fantastic job . While the face sculpt on her is not the best in the line so far , her dress is just beautiful and very detailed . These figures excels at the costumes and this is no exception . Well done again . She looks brilliant on the shelf next to her brothers . I can not wait for next year and the next releases .
5 #### It arrived today 3 weeks finally . It and Jamie Lannister both completed my Dark Horse wave 2 Thrones figures . Ca n't wait till spring when wave 3 starts being released .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2TRHL6L66YO8N " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / D1fK28P0daS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71J%2B2sMZ%2BhS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;This figure / statue is worthy of Queen Cersei 's name ! Great job Dark Horse !
5 #### great addition to my just starting GoT collection , detail looks good to me , but I am not a season collector .
5 #### Looks really awesome in actual . So happy to have it .
5 #### These figures are amazing . I 'm a budget collector , and I 've never seen such high detail figures for the price . They 're made of rubber and hard plastic , and they 're not as detailed as something you might buy for $ 125-$500 dollars , but considering I 've purchased these all for $ 10-$15 on sale , I could n't recommend them more if you do n't have thousands of dollars to have a fun and attractive collection . I love waking up and seeing these on my shelves .
5 #### The figure is amazing . The detail in and quality of Dark Horse 's GOT collection is incredible . I own the whole series and ca n't wait for the next one to be released ! You will not be disappointed .
5 #### Incredibly detailed and accurate to the show . A nice addition to any GoT Dark Horse Deluxe collector !
5 #### My favorite game of thrones figure so far , this does not have moving parts . The details are really good , if you collect figures this is a must have .
5 #### This is just fantastic they are so true to the characters & incredibly well constructed & very solid . They stand very well with the attached base & looks great displayed in a set
3 #### The box is crap . It looks like they kicked it around for a bit before shipment . The figure is nice , but I really would have preferred a box that did n't look like it was in a fight with the mountain .
4 #### The container box is much more attractive than the figure itself . well , u should not expect too much from this price .
5 #### I love this figure . She is a really good size and the detail is great
5 #### The funko toys are great , but these Dark Horse statutes are beautiful ! Real works of art ! The detail is incredible and the colors so vibrant and well - expressed . These look just like the show 's charachters ! Only down side is they are n't poseable ; but they really are beautiful , and well posed to begin with , so it 's not that big of a deal ! A nice way to pay homage to your favorite charachter(s ) ! Secrets out : I think Cersei Lannister is awesome ! One of the strongest leading ladies in contemporary fantasy . Smart , decisive , and powerful - Cersei is great ! And this statue is a great representation of a great member of George RR Martin 's fantastic universe .
5 #### Wonderful game . Much like stratego but we like it better .
5 #### This board game is one of the best I 've laid eyes on . Besides using the Lord of the Rings license fantastically , this game contains so much replay value ! That 's spectacular considering how fun the actual gameplay is . The gameplay is very similar to Stratego , but shorter and more exciting , since almost every move can be deadly . Also , the game can go by very quickly which means you can play more games . The replay content comes into play here through figuring how to utilize the different characters ' abilities and their power cards and also through the extra variant characters and special cards included in the game . The better you and your opponent become at the board game , the more satisfying the game becomes . This is a game that is simple to play , but may take awhile to master . Each game , there are several strategies one can use . You must adapt your strategy to the opponent your playing . I highly recommend this game ! ! Very fun ! !
4 #### Super fun with both sides being completely different , just wish I could play it more
5 #### Netrunner is a great , great game . Lots of strategic depth , endless replayability , and plenty of expansion content to help keep your decks fresh . However , it 's important to note that Netrunner is a CARD game ( Living Card Game to be specific ) , not a boardgame ( the contents of this box are basically some decks and some tokens ) , and is incredibly complex in its play pattern -- much more so than Magic . If you 're considering this game for a fun game night with friends , it 's not going to be a great choice . It takes a few hours to learn the basic rules , then a few play - throughs to understand the mechanics , and then hundreds of hours to fully grasp the potential of deckbuilding within the universe . However , if you have one hardcore friend who loves strategy games and deckbuilding , putting in the time to learn Netrunner together will probably be worth it . Just understand that Netrunner is a lot more like Magic than like Pandemic or other highly - reviewed board games , and determine whether that 's your cup of tea before proceeding .
1 #### One needs THREE core sets to be competitive . I bought all three . It cost me around $ 100 . I 'll be selling them all now , because I feel disgusted with the business model . There should of been a completion deck made available for $ 14.99 .
5 #### This is a very fun card game that I 've played numerous times with my brother . We 've worked out a good system to be able to play over Skype .
5 #### Great game ! Though set aside some time to learn it
4 #### The game itself is great . The living card game element makes for regular updates which avoids the game becoming stagnant , and the asymetrical conflict is brilliant . The only drawback I find is the amount of cards printed . The rules state that any deck can have only 3 copies of any given card , but some cards in the core set have only one or two copies . Thus , if you plan on taking this game seriously , you need to buy 3 copies of the core set to make sure you have 3 copies of all cards ... and be left with a pile of other cards that wo n't be needed , but still good to have .
5 #### What a fun game ! Will you be the mighty corporation planning domination of the crafty runner with your own agenda ? Fast and fun .
5 #### Favorite . Game . Ever . The rules are hard to learn from the rulebook ( for someone who had not played similar games anyway ) . But , it is well worth figuring out . There is a lot of replayability here .
5 #### Simply put this is my favorite game . I own hundreds of Eurogames , I play thousands of games a year . Netrunner is the best of the lot . Extraordinary replayability ( I 've logged 600 plays as of typing this , having been " into " the game now for about six months ) . Just using the core set , which is what you are looking at now , my sons and I got a hundred plays out of it before we went looking to the expansion data packs . What a value .
5 #### I love how asymmetrical it is , really a different feel than with other games .
5 #### I bought this as a birthday present for my husband . We are avid tabletop and RPG players . We put together a group of friends to play the game and are having a blast . The box is well - constructed and pieces nice . The map is a bit simplistic , but it is totally fine . The pre - gen characters and stories are nice for busy adults who do n't always have time to write stories and roll up characters . The rules are easy enough to follow that our 8 year old can play with us ( he loves it ! ) . All in all a really good starter purchase . We are already looking at adding to it . I highly suggest buying extra dice as one set is difficult if you have more than 3 players .
5 #### Bought this for my husband and he uses it all the time
1 #### The only useful thing this set has are the dice , everything else is just meh . Save your money from this and get the main rulebook ( which you still need anyway ) and a set of dice then make up your own adventure , you will enjoy it so much better
5 #### I used to play magic but I no longer have the money to pursue that hobby as a college student . This game is awesome . Super fun , lots of exciting gameplay , and is VERY cheap in comparison to Magic and some other card games . I love that I do n't have to waste money on randomized boosters . I also really love the theme/ setting of this card game as I 'm really into cyberpunk scifi stuff . For $ 25 to $ 30 , this game is definitely worth picking up a coreset and checking it out .
5 #### We struggled at first to learn the rules and basic concepts but now my wife and I have been playing nonstop and are loving this game . I think everyone else 's experience with this game has been similar and I highly recommend it . To give you an idea of the challenge to get started , its literally two large decks of cards and some tokens in the box which could have been made much smaller but for the enormous instruction manual ! Be ready to take plenty of time to look up what to do at every turn when beginning but once you get the hang of it you will be thinking about it even when you are n't playing .
5 #### Great game for two people . There 's a healthy tournament scene , but it 's still lots of fun to just play casually with friends or family . As with any game published by Fantasy Flight Games , my only complaints are with the box insert ( which is of little to know use for storage pieces safely or neatly ) and the instructions , which leave many unanswered questions I 'd recommend looking online for answers to .
5 #### Expensive for what you get but love the system
2 #### This one is a Star Wars Role Playing Game from Fantasy Flight Games , great company by the way . This is the incarnation of the Star Wars RPG , when you read it , you will love it , but the experience change a lot when you actually play the game . Young gamer will like the game , because its easy to learn . Some experience Role players may like it . I did not . The Product itself is high quality , have lots of full color tokes , nice dices , and large poster maps , also some pre made characters , but can make or download more at their web page . Before you expend money on the Core Books - 3 of them ... I recommend to try this one or the other beginner box games first . 2 stars for quality ...
5 #### For the price you get a map , some tokens , an adventure ( that works as an introduction to the mechanics ) and the dice . I 'd say that instead of dishing the money for the dice alone ( which are around the same price that this one ) go for the Beginner Game . You will , most likely , end up using the tokens and the map .... and the dice obviously . I started playing this with my two younger sisters ( whom never played an RPG before or like Star Wars , to put things into perspective ) . And they are having a blast . For two weekends in a row I managed their adventure ... with music , improv , the tokens and some special effects thanks to some apps on my phone . The dice are super flexible to the narrative of the adventure and every throw is an exercise of brainstorming . Its a great way to get together with friends and family . Highly recommended even if you got the Core Rule - book , as I said before , even if its just for the dice you should get this .
5 #### The best game I ever bought for me and my wife to play together . This game is not as difficult to learn as I had imagined thanks to the online tutorial , but it was n't easy either . I should state that I was a moderate boardgames before buying this , so for newbies try few other card games before trying this one . This game has lots of compatible " expansion " packs as well . those packs can really change the game on some hands .
5 #### Awesomely expandable bluffing card game without the headache of trying to acquire rare cards . The base set can be played without expanding the game but fans who want a level playing field have to pay attention to what cards their opponent has access to . The game is a complete experience with just this base set but buying additional base sets or packs allows for better deckbuilding options and new card effects . Goals to win are the same but both sides accomplish them asymmetrically . Corporation player bluffs the runner while the runner attacks the corporation in an effort to steal agenda cards that both sides must use to win the game . Typical great art quality and good card quality from FFG . Cool cyberpunk theme .
4 #### Amazing game , one of the all time best , but it is frustrating that there are only single copies of some cards when decks can have 3 copies of cards . That means that if you enjoy the game and want to play competitively in tournaments , you 'll have to buy 3 copies of the game . Most players wo n't play competitively , obviously , but it is a small but significant oversight in an otherwise flaweless game . Oh yeah , also the manual is among the worst that I 've seen . I know how to play the game and when I have a question I spend 5 minutes searching through the seemingly randomly organized rulebook . It 's not good at teaching the game or as a reference . Pretty poor overall . Learn from a friend or from an online source .
5 #### Well designed for new players . The character sheets walk the new player through the process of game play and upgrading your character . The adventure module walks the game master through the process and gives great tips on how to make the game more fun for the players . The only problem I have with this beginner game is that it is n't up to par with the full version . I played with friends who had created characters from the full rule book and they were way too powerful for this module .
5 #### OK , I love Star Wars . So I 'm coming into this game already loving the theme and FFG does not disappoint with production which draw you in the theme so much easier . This starter set is good . The characters that come in the set are good and have a nice backstory to go along with each of them . Since this game comes with dice you do n't necessarily have to have to go buy a seperate pack , but it would be nice . The story takes you through learning the major mechanics of the game and dice . The story is also pretty engaging so that helps . I have GM'ed a couple of times before but had never GM'ed Star Wars , so the included walkthrough story really helps . We go through most of it before calling it a night with minimal stoping for rules reading . If you like RPGs and like Star War , but you are still on the fence about Star Wars EofE RPG get this starter box . You will not be disappointed .
5 #### I played Magic the Gathering for 10 years , until I got burned out . They main reason I stopped was due to the collectable market of the game . I got tired of people not trying to make quality decks & instead just paying $ 200 + to build a tournament / " net deck " . This game was created by Richard Garfield , the creator of Magic the Gathering , so it got my attention . However , it is NOT collectable . When each player buys the set they get the same cards . This is even true for the " boosters " , called data packs . It is up to the player to use the pool of available cards to creatively make the best deck . This is the game I always wanted . The theme is a dystopian future run by Mega Corporations and inhabited by hackers called Netrunners . It is a two player game . One player takes on the role of the Corporation and the other plays as the Runner . The object of the game is to be the person to score 7 points . The Corporation is in control of the point cards and has to play them at the right time to score . The Runner has to attack the Corporation & find the point cards in order to steal them and score . That is a very brief summary & I 'm not sure it does the game justice . Suffice it to say , this is my absolute favorite game . I can play it for hours on end .
5 #### This game is not for everyone . The rules take awhile to learn , but once learned the game plays pretty quickly . Having said that , if you are really into games and love strategy , there is simply no better game to play . I get together with a good friend about once a month to play board games for 12 - 18 hours and we used to play a variety of games . For the past year we have almost exclusively played NetRunner . Nothing else really compares . Winning is a combination of great deck building , understanding your opponent , and a bit of the luck of the draw ( but you make your own luck when building a good deck ) . If you love strategy games and are looking for a 2 player game to add to your collection buy this ! I even purchased an extra copy of the base set for when my kids get older just in case it ever goes out of print ... it is that good !
5 #### I was dubious about this game at first . It took some getting used to the dice pool mechanic , but after about 5 minutes I was hooked . I 'm looking forward to other iterations of this game that Fantasy Flight games might come up with . Super fun . Well designed . Gorgeous artwork . I love it .
5 #### Okay , let 's just focus on the fact that this is n't the full Core Rulebook and it does n't have all the ins & outs and intricacies of the full system . It 's not meant to have them ... it 's meant to be a game that gets you going . You learn enough to play a pre - generated adventure with pre - generated characters ... but that 's the point : you 're learning to play the game . The rules tell you what you need to know when you need to know it . Plus , you get the full set of new SW dice . These are important . And , hey , if you 're interested in this game , well , having the dice is a good thing ( since the dice themselves run about $ 12.00 for the set ) . There are lots of reviews of this game . I bought the game based upon the reviews . I was n't disappointed .
3 #### Bought this after playing with a friend . It 's a fun game , but extremely complicated . Having read through the instruction manual ( novel ? ! ) I still do n't quite feel comfortable trying to explain how to play this to someone who has never played it before . The real challenge is getting to play this . Since it is only a 2 player game , you have to have only 1 other person who can play . But since I see gaming as a social experience , I 'm usually in larger groups . It 's an amazing game , I just done think I 'm going to get to play it much . I 'm already thinking about selling it .
4 #### The only reason I gave this a 4 , because there are no playmats included . Playing this game without a playmat is chaos .
5 #### My husband and his friends play this at work and they have man play dates outside of work ... apparently it 's pretty riveting as more and more people at work have been buying it and the expansions so they can take time during break to play . He usually loves board games , but this one seems to have some particular draw because he consistently plays vs with our other games we play here and there .
2 #### Well I know that it is a new system and that it 's trying to be faster and more story driven but it really did n't work for my style of play . I was very disappointed in the way the system flowed and the random die just do n't do a good job . If you just want your party to pass all the time , then you might like it , but it was totally not for me .
5 #### It 's good stuff very pleased with the product and i got exactly what i expected and did n't get something that i did n't expect
5 #### This game is a load of fun to play with friends and it 's pretty easy to pick up . Also the product shipped quickly
5 #### Having purchased Android : Netrunner a few months ago , I now find myself hopelessly addicted to this outstanding game . The rules take a bit to get through and understand , so I would recommend watching Fantasy Flight Game 's video introduction to A : NR on YouTube . Once you have a few games under your belt , things progress much more smoothly and the enjoyment level increases .
1 #### Too confusing . I love Magic but i hated this game a lot . Amazed at all the positive reviews ... It takes forever to set up . We never play it .
5 #### A true delight ! Gameplay is quick ( 45 - 60 ) , rules are simple / intuitive and the strategy is deep ! I consider it a must have for those looking for a good two player game . Basically , you use Rubium that you 've uncovered to purchase different troops . Eventually , your exploration of the small , randomly generated hex spaces will bring you close to your enemies and to get more Rubium ( or take control of the vital Monolith ) you 'll need to pick a fight . Throughout all this you 'll earn victory points through secret mission cards ( " occupy more liguifungus hexes then your opponents " ) and/or battle victories and the first to 12 VPs wins . Hint : taking ( and maintaining ) control of the monolith ( in true king - of - the - hill fashion ) is a great winning strategy . Controlling the monolith earns you special cards that can DEVISTATE your opponent / s. If this is your first time playing - RUN TO THE CENTER AND HOLD IT ! . This really is one of my favorite games and it gets played a lot . I 'm not a fan of " area control games " but I love this one . It 's reminiscent of Smallworld to me .
5 #### Explore , expand , control , and annihilate , all in under two hours . The minis are great , I enjoy the box and card art , the player aids are really nice and the rules are well - written . You get a lot of game and plastic for a low price .
4 #### Great game , love the miniatures it plays quickly and is just good with 2 players as it is with 4 . It has quickly become my wife 's favorite game
5 #### Great light combat game . If you are familiar with " Modern Boardgames " this would be a great light game that is set in a science fiction based theme . If you have not played any " Modern Boardgames " and have played games like Risk this is a deeper game with more rules but by no means is it hard to understand . I 'm glad it 's part of my collection and I will be keeping this one for a long time .
5 #### I really like the theme and abilities in this card game . Both sides play in a completely different way and each comes with its own strategy , which is very fun . This game is already popular so there is n't much else I can say except that if you like 2 player card games where you can customize a deck to your choosing , you will like this game . Great artwork and quality components too .
5 #### This game is a blast . We bought it to play on our weekly game nights with friends and we have really enjoyed learning how to play and creating our characters . There is even added content floating around the Internet that has extra species to use in the game to make it feel more like the diverse Star Wars universe we all know and love . I 'd say this is a game to at least try out if you are a D&D fan ! Although this game has a lot more rules to how it 's played , it can always be played with a more laid - back approach to make it more interesting . We love it and ca n't wait to teach our daughters how to play it too .
5 #### After hearing a few recommendations from friends , and doing a bit of research I purchased this game and the first small expansion ( " What Lies Ahead " Data Pack ) . After watching for its arrival like a hawk , my wife and I were very excited to sit down and play with what promised to be a complex and fun challenge . We are both big fans of Richard Garfield 's Magic the Gathering , and we really enjoyed that you can dive into Android : Netrunner without making large investment ( those dolla dolla bills ) as you might with MTG . As far as core mechanics go , it 's only for 2 players with each player selecting one corporation or runner from a group of factions , but one player must play as a Runner ( the hacker ) and the other player must play as a Corporation . The Corp attempts to build up assets and security while seeking to thwart the hacker from stealing the goodies . It 's a lovely mix of play - styles and strongly fits into Cyberpunk themes and dynamics . It 's a complex card game and offers a lot of versatility and replay value - especially if you add 1 or 2 of the data packs in ( ( for around $ 10 each here on Amazon ) ) . Fantasy Flight has put a VERY HELPFUL tutorial on YouTube and with the detailed rulebook the rules become very clear after an initial play - test . We both had a lot of fun and are excited about having another dystopian romp ASAP !
5 #### My son - in - law is building his game collection and requested this . He was excited to play it during the Christmas holidays
4 #### The concept for the game is really inventive , even years later . But there are some dominant strategies and you 'll find yourself banning them once you discover them , or else the game loses some of its fun . Ban deck searching cards from the start , just because they slow the game down .
5 #### Wife and I have been playing the hell out of Netrunner this past week . Great game . Great value ( IMO ) . KInd of wish there was a bigger secondary market for additional copies of cards for deckbuilding , but that 's not a huge issue . Either way . Excellent game . Be cautioned , though ... It has a pretty steep learning curve . We would 've saved a lot of headache had we watched an on - line tutorial before jumping in . Just a lot going on . Very highly recommended .
5 #### Everything is fine . I am happy with the purchase . I think that more and buy more than once . Thank you .
5 #### The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong , but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves . Turns out the game was 100 % better with the correct rules ! :) We love the different rules for each player , and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention . My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation . Honestly , I usually loose , but still it 's a lot of fun . The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it 's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed .
5 #### and I was n't disappointed with this game . I was hesitant at first because its a LCG and did n't want to spend a ton of money on expansions but found out there is quite a bit of content with this core game . It comes with 4 corporation factions and 3 runner factions so there s a lot of replay avail and both sides are different so my wife and I switch it up to keep it fresh . The theme is awesome and we both enjoy it . I think eventually we 'll get into the expansions but there is plenty here to play for a while .
5 #### Great game , similar to Magic but a different experience of course . I played three times and look forward to the next time .
5 #### I loved playing Netrunner when it was first released in the ' 90s and this edition re - captured my love of the game perfectly . It fleshed out the corporations and runners nicely with factions that had some small variants in playstyle ( focusing on different elements of the game ) . It also made for much clearer and simpler rules ( without dumbing it down ) , enough so that my gamer - light wife was able to pick it up and enjoy it on her first try .
5 #### it 'll change your life ! i love it , but it puts my wife to sleep . there is a lot going on in each turn . VERY IN DEPTH . i love this kind of heavy game . but beware if you are just looking for a light game , it 's not for you .
5 #### I bought this card game recently and just had a chance to play it with a friend . Be prepared to struggle through the rules a little bit the first couple of games . However , I must say that the game is a lot of fun to play . It has plenty of strategy to it once you understand the mechanics . Trying to bate the opposing player into playing the wrong thing is highly rewarding . For those that do n't know the Light Side and Dark Side experience is different . Light side players win the game by attacking and destroying dark side objectives . However , they are in a race against time ! The Dark side wins the game primarily with the Death Star dial reaching 12 . It brings a really fun and exciting element to the game . I highly recommend this for Star Wars fans and fans of card games in general .
5 #### While intimidating at first , this is the first LCG that really captures the spirit of star wars . Iconic characters , locations , missions , and the Force all combine to make an intricate and strategic game with rather basic win conditions . If you are a star wars fan and enjoy games , this is definitely worth your time .
5 #### He must like it because he 's been in the living room with his friend for days now . He has n't eaten . He has n't slept . We have n't made love . I think he is nourished now only by strategy and fun .
3 #### I 've never played a game where I had so much trouble understanding the game mechanics . The game looks like it has a pretty good following but DON'T expect to be able to read the cards if you are over 50 ... the print is TINY , TINY , TINY ! ! ... and for no reason . BAD Design choice on that one .
4 #### For those who loved Magic , but want more bang for their buck and do n't mind a hacker sci - fi theme , this could be a good product . If your still interested , and wanted Magic to be a bit more complicated , a little bit longer , and allow for a bit of bluffing , this is a GREAT game ! You will only be able to create one varied hacker & one varied corp deck at a time with this set though , so you will likely want at least a couple $ 12 expansions after a few games .
5 #### The learning curve for this one may turn some people off but the payoff is a very deep , well thought out experience . While the theme with a lot of games feels a bit " thrown in , " it permeates this one and you really start believing you 're in this futuristic world of hacker vs. corporation . You 're probably going to keep the rulebook nearby for your first bunch of games , and thank goodness for being able to search cards / rules online quickly during a match , but it always feels fun and the more you get used to gameplay the more fun it becomes . While there 's obviously some luck involved because it is a card game , your decisions are what will get you those tasty Agenda cards and ultimately victory . It 's surprising how many actions you can perform on a turn , and while it feels like very few actions are ever wasted , it never feels so tense that it stops being anything short of a great time . I 've never played an asymmetric card game or had an experience like this and I absolutely love it . I look forward to many more games and exploring some of the expansions .
5 #### I had to have this figure immediately and was not disappointed . I love how her hair and sleeves are made from a flexible plastic that feels soft . Good one , guys !
5 #### I love this game . I 've been playing it whenever possible . The depth this game goes into is very unique , especially given the fact that you have a runner and a corporation , each with different styles of gameplay , different tactics , with only one common goal , getting agenda points . I 'm really looking forward to getting some of the expansions to see hour each faction grows . The only recommendation I 'd have is if you are going to play this with a buddy , each needs to get their own box . If you are going to play both runner and corporation against each other it will save time not needing to break down and rebuild your deck between games .
5 #### I loved the original Netrunner , and this version is actually a big improvement . A few of the rules are simplified or redone , and the artwork is much better . Plus its now a Living Card Game , which means its a lot less expensive than the old Trading Card Game . Also , its MUCH better than Magic : The Gathering in my opinion . The main reason for this is Netrunner has a limited number of actions per player per turn . This eliminates the overpowered combos of MtG , and 10 minute turns . Its much more balanced as well , with very few ( if any ) truly broken combos . Also , you do n't have to draw into your resources ( mana in MtG ) , you can gain resources at any time . This means getting a bad draw in Netrunner happens far less than MtG. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Netrunner is the asymmetrical gameplay . This means both players use different rules and goals . While it may not sound like it , this actually leads to a more balanced gameplay than I would have thought . The games are full of aggression , tension , trickery , and surprises . Highly recommended for anyone who 's a fan of competitive card games .
5 #### Only 2 player and kind of a steep learning curve . Once you get it and have someone good to play against though it really starts to shine !
5 #### I was not sure if this game would be any good . Well it is fantastic , I have started to play this more than netrunner as it offers at lot more in a two player card game . I feel the thematic is great , I feel immersed in the universe while being able to enjoy the many layers of strategy this game offers . This game will be a long term favorite in my collection for years to come .
5 #### If you enjoy two player card games like Magic : The Gathering , Lord of the Rings , etc . then you need this game . If you have played the ones I 've listed then you 've likely already heard about Netrunner . BUY IT . This game is what is known as asymmetrical , meaning that each player has completely different mechanics and card interactions . Unlike games like MtG , where the turn order and card setup is essentially the same between players , this game has two different roles : the hacker and the corporation . The hacker tries to gain access to the corporation 's files in order to expose wrongdoing , while the corporation builds defenses and tries to burn out the hacker and destroy his / her mind . The cards in the set feature great art , are durable , and decks are highly customizable thanks to a few expansions that have been released . So far I have only played with the core set but there is tons of gaming available without expansions . You have choice of three hackers and four corporations so there 's plenty to try out . Again , this game is pretty amazing . There 's a decent learning curve but do n't get discouraged . After the first game it will all make sense . I ca n't recommend this game enough .
3 #### OK so my wife and I love game of thrones and we had to have this collectible . I am SUPER disapointed . It always seems with collectibles that the face is what is always messed up . Everything from the dragon eggs , the chest , her hands and clothing , even her hair is perfect . Her face however looks absolutely nothing like Denaerys , not even close to what the box or amazon shows . If a character figure ca n't match the face at all then what 's the point ? I 'm a huge collector of figures and statue replicas of movie , tv , and comic book characters and this has been the biggest let down because by looking at the face , I have no clue who she is .
4 #### It 's a giftbforbsomeonebso I can only say it looks pretty good . Not a great likeness .
5 #### Great detail and lovely addition to my growing collection
5 #### This is the hot game right now . This is the first game in a long time where I have gotten into a semi - competitive scene . If you want to play a CCG , but do n't want to have to wastemoney collecting cards from random boosters , LCGs are the way to go . This is definitely the # 1 LCG around , so play it while it 's still popular .
4 #### Very enjoyable two player , but it takes a bit to figure out . Read read read ... and then read more online . Its more fun if the player can hold a bluff and are able to match wits persistently . :)
5 #### The details are well made . I am so happy to have it . Great find indeed .
5 #### the design looks really awesome and the color as well . great find !
5 #### I gave this to my daughter for a present . It is so realistic ! It really is a beautiful figure . My daughter loved it and so I would recommend it .
5 #### it looks really nice in actual . the details are very finely done .
5 #### this game is awesome . it is actually quite easy to pick up and start playing out of the box , with a steep learning curve and lots of strategy . very interesting asymmetrical gameplay - one person plays defense , while the other offense . very slick , unbelievably balanced . i 'm still learning , but i find i like it more and more ...
5 #### These figures are amazing . I 'm a budget collector , and I 've never seen such high detail figures for the price . They 're made of rubber and hard plastic , and they 're not as detailed as something you might buy for $ 125-$500 dollars , but considering I 've purchased these all for $ 10-$15 on sale , I could n't recommend them more if you do n't have thousands of dollars to have a fun and attractive collection . I love waking up and seeing these on my shelves .
4 #### Nice little figure . Does n't move , though the eggs / chest can be moved around . I 've kept mine in the box , so I ca n't speak to the durability of the figure and such , but she 's quite pretty for a small plastic figure and looks nice with the rest of my collection . For the price , a decent buy .
5 #### Love , love , love this . The first one I was sent was not perfect , but was quickly replaced . I had not planned to take it out of the box , but I could not help but proudly display it on my fireplace . Great piece for a great price ! ! !
5 #### The figure is amazing . The detail in and quality of Dark Horse 's GOT collection is incredible . I own the whole series and ca n't wait for the next one to be released ! You will not be disappointed .
5 #### Beautifully done , i really like it . Was going to set it up at work , but i think i will leave this one on my shelf at home .
5 #### This item arrived as expected and was in good condition . No problems .
4 #### Bought for a friend , he seems to enjoy the game a lot .
5 #### Always high quality , fast delivery , and consistent . We 've bought many , many expansions and will continue to buy from FFG . They 're a solid company .
3 #### From a crunch standpoint , if you were looking to buy it you 've already researched it 's pilots and cards so I wo n't waste your time with a review that tells you what you already know . It 's good enough there even with the rest it gets a 3 not a 1 or 2 . From a fluff / model standpoint , this is easily the poorest of all FFG 's production runs I 've seen and I own 85+% of all the X Wing game line . Minor but noticeable errors in the model are common , asymmetry where their should n't be , etc . Also I 've yet to buy one from any source that did n't have more issues with it 's base / attachment point than any other X - Wing ship . Not a horrible product as a whole , some good cards , interesting rules , neat named pilots , definitely a decent ATF for the Rebels , but the model itself ... I almost returned the one Amazon sent me ( always double check the models Amazon sends , you ca n't inspect them like you could at a store ) , on a 1 - 10 quality of model scale where 10 is I love and 1 is I loathe , it 's a 5 even ( and most X - Wing products are 7 + ) .
5 #### These models a great but the plastic stand is too delicate . I 've broken them off in about half of our models .
4 #### This one is well made however the figure leans foreword slightly & did put me of somewhat . Out of all the figures this one i thought was the one that needed some more work but she does fit & looks good in the collection
5 #### The quality is not perfect but much more worth this price . PS : Daenerys is the worst one among these figures ... Maybe it is because my too much expectation ...
5 #### My boyfriend is a fan of her and loves the show . I got this for him as a Christmas present and he loves it .
5 #### The blurb on the e - wing says it was designed to be better and eventually replace the x - wing but of course it never did because of the cost . I agree with this completely . The maneuvering dial is pretty amazing besting even the imperial tie defender in some ways but the cost on surprisingly low stats ca nt justify the astronomical price . The e - wing cost between 27 - 35 squad points while x - wings can come in at 21 - 29 points a big difference . And yet when you compare the stats x - wings have 3 primary weapon , 2 agility , 3 hull , and 2 shields while e - wings have 3 primary weapons , 3 agility , 2 hull , and 3 shields . So essentially they upped the agility and moved a hull to shields , not really impressed . Personally I find myself reaching for x - wings over e - wings every time , the model is beautiful and the game mechanics are actually pretty good , but I find that the x - wings are more cost affective .
5 #### A must buy I think for a lot of rebel builds . Corran Horn is just too dangerous with his double tap ability .
5 #### Another one for the collection . Got ta get them all .
5 #### Love these miniatures , I hate the packaging but that is because it is classic packaging that leaves you struggling to get the item out without damaging the included materials ( cards in this case ) .
5 #### The recipient is a fan of Daenerys and Game of Thrones , and enjoys this figure prominently in their collection of favorite things . The face is not as represented but as the recipient has not quibbled , how can I be any less satisfied than that .
5 #### Love the games and the E - wings are decent ships .
3 #### As another review said , The face is a bit thinner than in the photos and that does take away from the figure quite a bit in my opinion . Remember that to be a good figure means you have to have a flawless design . I do like how the dragon eggs and the chest are their own separate objects and that you can have the figure hold whatever egg you want while the other eggs fit well in the chest , which can be set next to her . That was a plus in my opinion . Overall , The thinner face takes away from the figure a bit but as a whole , It 's certainly worth checking out but mind you that you 'd want to see a few real photos of other figures before making a final decision on buying . If I would have gotten for a bit cheaper price , I would n't mind picking it up .
5 #### This is one Game of Thrones character I have watched with much admiration over the last 4 seasons . When I saw that the Action Figure was available I jumped on it . This is from her beginnings , before she became the Mother of Dragons . She holds her Wedding Gifts of 3 supposedly inert Dragon Eggs ( which later proved to be not inert at all ) . Daenerys is just now really coming into her own as a Queen in this 4th season , and I look forward to see where George R.R. Martin 's story will take her .
5 #### I love this . The quality is great , she 's absolutely stunning , I love that you can change the dragon egg in her hand to whatever color . She does n't take up much room and is an all around great conversation piece . I love it !
4 #### For what you 're getting here this is a very good price if you compare to other figures for just a few more dollars you get a finely sculpted detailed figure though technically it 's more of a statue but most people that buy game of thrones figures are probably getting them to display and not to actually play with anyway but this statue is nicely detailed is about 9 inches and comes with removable dragon eggs and chest my biggest gripe is that the face sculpt does not resemble the actress Emilia Clark at all really that goes the same for the game of thrones legacy line of action figures for some reason these figure companies can not get her likeness right other than that a great collectible and comes with my recommendation if you 're a game of thrones fan
5 #### Super high quality , & beautiful ! The eggs in the box can be switched around so she can hold whatever color you want her to . I love GOT so I had to have this . So happy with her . Although some people might not like that it does n't look exactly like the actress that plays Daenerys ( in the face ) . However , the show is based on the book so it does n't matter .
4 #### Cool ship , just a little too expensive for any of the flights I use .
4 #### The model is good quality , as are ALL X - Wing Miniatures . The pilot and droid cards that come with this ship are really fantastic , and this is a fun ship to fly in the game . Rebel players will definitely want this . Do n't buy more than one , though , it 's an expensive ship to fly !
5 #### Another addition to the star wars x - wing game that did not come from the movie but the video game . Put this one ship with almost any combination of rebel ships and the empire will probably have a " BAD " day dealing with it ! ! !
5 #### I got these ships just for the RPG , but they looks so nice , I kinda want to play the X - Wing game now !
5 #### Product shipped fast and a great price ! The E - wing is a must for a Rebel Sqd , a very agile , hard - hitting ship with the ability to soak up some damage .
4 #### Good but expensive to field in game . I would recommend no more than two .
5 #### Compared to other " large " ships from Star Wars : X - Wing , I was a bit disappointed . Included escorting X - wing does give good scale representation . Underside of transport shows well how pods , cargo carriers were transported .
3 #### Pro ... Also comes with an X wing , some great t65 X wing pilots ( Hobbie , Wes ! , and Tarn esp . ) , what looks like a unique paint scheme on the X Wing , and a slew of astromechs ( many used in popular builds ) , the transport was well painted even at factory . [ tips ... Try pairing Tarn with a certain astromech from the Ewing expansion , try Hobbie with the astromech that gives he and his target stress [ his power lets him clear immediately if he uses it ] , and Wes ... holy Force push his power helps buddies who fire later [ and veteran instinct or adaptability can help him fire before other elites like , say , Wedge ... ] Cons ... One of the worst models , referring to the transport , in terms of quality of the base junction holes ( mine was just barely playable , my friend had to return a few months ago as well so it may be a factory issue ) , the X wing , while uniquely painted , had bad paint fading in places . Overall ... By itself , the Transport model was a bit upsetting but the set as a whole ? Almost ( absolutely ) a must if you want to get the most out of original trilogy X Wings . Despite the Cons , it 's still a solid buy for its cost for those pilots and astromechs that come from no other source . I do n't know anyone who 's paid 40 or less for it that did n't feel it was worth it in the end .
5 #### Strictly a support ship , no offensive capabilities ! But field some good ships along side and it can bring some hurt to the opposition .
4 #### The model looks absolutely stunning , but I must admit I am not exactly wowed by the game play . My biggest problem with this craft is how difficult it is to use offensively . By far the most effective means I have found is simply to use it as a battering ram , but because of the annoyingly low shields it ca nt keep that up for long . The other way is to use the jam action to stress enemy ships and then use the slicer tools to deal damage to stressed ships , but this is annoyingly complicated . Probably the best option for comparison is the imperial assault carrier , witch has a hard point and the nifty effect of actually being able to carry fighters . I suppose the trade off is it is considerably cheaper but if you equip the combat retrofit it cost the same as the imperial carrier . It looks really cool but for me its just been a glorified battering ram .
5 #### X - Wing is a fast and addicting game . Of course its a money pit since you have to buy all the ships , but , its a Star Wars game and we all love Star Wars . Take my money and let me play ! ! !
4 #### This is one of the most impressive ships in the fleet . The detail is excellent with varied coloring to add emphases . Small molded details and openings on the underside hull make this look built not molded . The addition of an X - wing Fighter is welcome . Players tend to not have the number of X - wing and Tie fighters that we see in the movies . This is a Huge Ship with new rules for initial placement , damage location and movement , this expansion come with a special maneuver template . The transport is slow , hard to turn but capable of absorbing plenty of hits making it an interesting ship to play . The ship has two set of damage cards , fore and aft . Each set is ten cards following the standard damage card rules . A three - part Evacuation of Hoth Campaign is our major chance to play this ship . The rules state it can not be fielded in 100 - point squads of standard play . Mission 8 : Rendezvous requires three Rebel Transports to play and is not something I expect to see happen . The rulebook would be improved by illustrating the special counters and placing them in a section . I m still digging out what is what ; most of the counters are part of the missions . There is a good set of upgrade cards and new X - wing pilots in the box . This is a good expansion but is best a late addition to your game because of the limited playability .
5 #### From a collectors point of view , this is a must have . The amount of detail that went into making this model can not be ignored .
5 #### I got these ships just for the RPG , but they looks so nice , I kinda want to play the X - Wing game now !
5 #### Looks great ! Wonderfully detailed . I keep it on my desk at the moment . I have n't played a game with it yet but will soon . The rules are really interesting ! I was expecting it did nothing and just plodded along as a big target . Oh hell no . This thing is really quite interesting . It adds about 5 more pages to the rules , plus there are rules for campaigns , and bunch of new card upgrades . It comes with an additional X - Wing and 8 pilots for that !
5 #### This deluxe expansion introduces new 55 new cards ( 3 copies of each card [ 165 cards total ] ) that bring out fresh new angles for the Shaper and Haas - Bioroid factions in Netrunner . Shapers get from this expansion new identities and various cards that promote tutoring ( getting key programs from your stack or heap ) and heavy program usage along with cards to increase the cost of advancing agendas . HB gets new identities and various cards that emphasizes brain damage , increases efficiency of credit and click economy , and stronger ICE . It 's a great set of cards . if you understand everything I said , you 're ready to get this expansion and give it a go . A must buy .
5 #### Focuses on one Corp and one Runner , but gives a TON of variety for them . The back of the instruction manual ( although does n't really give much instruction ) gives a deck building suggestion , but you can do a lot more mixing and matching even just within the set itself . Pretty cool that you can mix it in with the core set or separate this into two alternate decks , only needing the tokens from the main game .
5 #### This set focuses entirely on Haas - Biroid and the Shapers . A whopping 165 cards dedicated to 2 factions , very nice ! 3 new identities for each faction = 6 total new , as well , many new options , agendas , assets , ice and ice - breakers ! Creation and Control is a great buy for you money , so many options to really flesh out 2 groups .
4 #### very cool expansion ... 2 new heroes ... some new monsters ... a new lieutenant ( have to buy the miniature separately which I think is bogus ) ... overall it 's a cool add - on to one my favorite table top games .
5 #### The price point seems fair considering what you get . 10 new minis , multiple new tiles , a new condition effect , 2 new classes and more . I 'm looking forward to running through these as the 1 - shot games with a few friends since we are still going through the main campaign at this time . If you want to see the components here is a link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKM2R5EOJZs
5 #### This data pack is absolutely essential if you 're a Netrunner fan like me . Like all data packs you wo n't use all the cards , but the cards you do use will determine whether you win a game or lose it . Game on !
5 #### Bought this pack for his birthday and he was pretty excited to get it . He knew it was coming , and would . Not . Stop . Asking . It took a while to ship , but that 's because it 'd just come out . I do not have much else to say .
5 #### I am simply amazed by these game pieces . If your just buying these as a fan or to play the game the detail is better than most SW ships/ vehicle items out there . I would compare the detail to that of the Hallmark orniments and so far what looks to be to scale compaired to the other ships in the series . An X - wing compaired to Slave one or the Millennium Falcon looks scale accurate to how they would look in the movie side by side .
5 #### This is a great addtion to the game ! I highly recommend this expansion to any xwing players . It is a must have
5 #### FFGs XWing game is one of the best new games of the last year and this addition really pushes the bar . The models details are excellent , all the other components are also top knotch . Up your game and get one of these .
4 #### My 11 year old son loves this game . He asks everyone to play it with him all the time . Fortunately for me I have sons and a husband that liek these sort of games . It is fairly easy to play and understand .
5 #### An awesome casual game , takes a bit to explain all of the rules .
5 #### Great game , the addition of the schools of magic make the even better than the orginal .
4 #### Wiz - War is fast - paced , chaotic , and ultimately a lot of fun . Playing with four people is great , since it just adds to the chaos factor ( something I quite enjoy ) . The biggest criticism I have for this game ( and really any game with this feature ) is that once you are killed there 's nothing left for you to do but watch the game finish out . It 's not as bad in Wiz - War because the games are reasonably short , even with 4 players , but I still think it 's a crappy mechanic .
5 #### Great addition to a great game . Takes a little bit of playing to figure out how to get the most use out of it , but definitely worth it . The auxiliary firing arc comes in handy and there 's tons of upgrades ...
5 #### Great beer & pretzels kinda game which is tons of screwage to other players and great competition to win the game . So many spells and items to use and the game has great strategy too . Not too long , around an hour or so . Have fun !
5 #### My son was thrilled with this gift . I was pleased with the price and quick shipping .
5 #### My new favorite game ! This was a great price for this product & adds even another layer of creativity to the game !
5 #### I own every non epic ship released for this game . They are all fantastic , well detailed models with solid rules . I have received two ships that were damaged and customer service has replaced those quickly with little trouble .
5 #### Classic ship ! I do n't really care for the Imperial version , I like the Scum & Villainy ability better . Then you can team him with other bounty hunters and put some hurt on the rebel scum .
5 #### Slave I has always been a favorite of ours . We have the X - wing game and got this as an expansion . It 's so detailed ; really striking !
5 #### The amount of detail that goes into these ships is astounding . Whether you 're a player or simply a collector . Having a piece of Xizor 's lore in your hands .. worth every penny . Definitely feels the lightest of all the Miniatures for its size .
5 #### The Firespray is a beast of a ship , and in conjunction with the " Most Wanted " Scum and Villainy set , you can use this ship with the Empire or Scum !
4 #### I 'd rate it 5 star , but I like the Millennium Falcon better .
4 #### A little wobbly on its base , but in play , it is valuable and includes some great cards .
5 #### Great little ship that adds a bunch of new rules and strategies to xwing
3 #### This is not a ship you will fly in game unless there is a special format . It 's over costed and fragile . The upgrade cards are excellent . Autothrusters are fantastic and 2 of them on ebay currently cost about as much as this ship new in box . So if you 're a serious X Wing player just think of the ship as coming free with your 2 copies of autothrusters .
5 #### I own every non epic ship released for this game . They are all fantastic , well detailed models with solid rules . I have received two ships that were damaged and customer service has replaced those quickly with little trouble .
5 #### Boba Fett made a big impression and became part of the Star Wars saga as an implacable foe dedicated to money . Including him and his ship in our games is a no brainer but getting such a valuable expansion makes it even better . The Slave 1 appeals to the eyes with good detail . It appeals to the gamer with a set of upgrades for weapons and people . Three named and one generic pilot , missiles , mines , cannons and defensive upgrades make this a valuable addition to the game . Additionally , the Most Wanted Expansion works with this expansion allowing Boba Fett to fight with that faction too .
5 #### A great expansion to the base game ! It works well combined with the Millennium Falcon expansion .
5 #### I never liked Prince Xizor in the story line , but I like his ship . Definitely good support ship .
3 #### Okay design with a great back story . This model is a strange addition to the X - WING game . The detail is fine and the paint job is only so - so .
5 #### The major buzz on Fantasy Flight Games forums is that " every TIE intercepter needs to run autothrusters . " While it is true that this is a key upgrade for ships with boost , I actually really like flying the Starviper . So far , I have only played Xizor and Guri but they are very good at arc dodging and they fill a role that is similar to an intercepter . I like to put the Virago title , Sensor Jammer , Inertial Dampeners , and Autothrusters on either Guri or Xizor , which is a little " pricey " at 38 or 39 squad points .
5 #### Favorite ship in the game . I really enjoy flying Guri / Virago / Predator / Autothrusters / Sensor Jammer . Points - sink , but opponents find her frustrating to shoot at so they pick other targets , and come to regret it .
3 #### Gimmicky ship . It 's pretty neat , but not a staple .
5 #### Love these miniatures , I hate the packaging but that is because it is classic packaging that leaves you struggling to get the item out without damaging the included materials ( cards in this case ) .
5 #### Very detailed sculpture of the Slave 1 . I got this to use with my Star Wars RPG , but these ships make me want to play the X - Wing game too !
3 #### This ship is a pretty decent counter to the rebel 's Millenium Falcon due to its offensive potential and durability . The inclusion of a forward and backwards firing arc allows this ship to perform some interesting maneuvers . However , it requires an investment in upgrades to be truly worthwhile . I was also under - impressed with its bomb mechanics . They are difficult to use reliably , and you only get one of them .
5 #### I have yet to play with my sons but as a display piece this is done so well . Even if you just want a nice ship for your diplay case you ca n't go wrong .
4 #### This is a good ship for U empire players . Many nice up grade that you can have to make this a fight ship . T
4 #### I really like playing star wars X wing . This is a good support ship . Hit and run keep moving with this ship .
5 #### Ok , so it 's a bad Pun , but it 's TRUE . The firespray is amazing . Play as Fett , a Regular Bounty hunter and much more . I have won many a battle with it and so will you .
5 #### this miniature is a beautiful sculpt . it comes with additional cards and pieces that also serve as a nice expansion to the core X - wing set . this ship is bigger than the others and has a rear firing arc , so it really mixes things up .
5 #### These dice are really great . The system is easy to pick up and you 'll have a blast . I 'd definitely recommend two sets .
5 #### Dice are great . You kinda need them to play the game . The website has decals for current dice ( d6,d8 , etc ) but how ghetto is that ?
4 #### These dice are made specifically for FFG 's new Star Wars Edge of the Empire Game . They are well made and nicely packaged as well as easy to read . Someone playing or running the game might need more dice than you will get in this set , so I would say buy two sets .
5 #### The new Star Wars role - playing system uses a dice pool system . the various colors and types of dice are not interchangeable . You have to have the specialty dice to easily play the system . If you bought the beginner box , you already have these , but if you 're joining the FFG Star Wars fray with the Gamemaster and Players books then you will need these dice . For the quality of the dice , the price is reasonable . In service , Rich
4 #### Others have covered how excellent the narrative dice system is in this game , so I will focus on the physical dice themselves . A good selection of dice come in a pack , color coded by type . On most of them , the symbols are very clear , but on a few the dice were not completely inked . The colors do n't pop as much as they do in pictures , and some of the dice have small divots where the plastic was poured into the mold . They havn't chipped or cracked , so I remain hopeful that these are just minor quibbles , but I am a little wary of how long they will last with heavy use .
5 #### The dice arrived on time , packaged nicely . We liked that the destiny points came with them . We got them because in our current game ( 4 players and the GM ) one set turned out to not be enough . Our rolls always needed one more yellow or one more green than we had . I would definitely recommend having two sets on hand . As a bonus , with two sets multiple players can roll for the same check at the same time which speeds up the gameplay considerably .
5 #### A full set of dice for star wars RPG
5 #### This was a gift and was on my son 's wish list so he was very happy to receive it .
2 #### The dice themselves are fine , the qualm I have with this product is the price . It is absurd to pay almost $ 30 for plain plastic dice . I only had to buy them because the game that uses these dice is awesome , and I 'm looking to play it with more people . Generally speaking , the stater game is a better buy , it 's only $ 10 more expensive than this product , and comes with some literature and adventures as well , but since I already had that , and I just needed dice , I was forced to get these .
3 #### I hate that you have to buy these dice to play the game . Amazon has the best price I have found . Gaming shops are always out of these dice . It 's a ridiculous thing to create separate dice for your system , and then not produce enough of them to meet the demand . So the dice are good , the price is good , but Fantasy Flight Games is profit hungry .
5 #### For those of you that enjoyed the main game , this expansion is highly recommended ! It adds a great deal of depth and variety to a game that is already extremely engaging in the story that it tells .
5 #### Was happy to get this . Great game . Adds variety and great content . Two great old ones , I like Ithaqua the best . If you like Eldritch Horror , you wo n't be sad . I would get this .
5 #### Mountains of Madness is a great addition to my Eldritch Horror board game . You get more cards for every deck and the added game board has added more adventures for my board game group to play and enjoy . This is a top notch expansion . Well done .
5 #### I love this expansion , it gives much more to the base game . Highly recommended .
5 #### A must have ! The way they have done expansions for Eldritch Horror just blows Arkham Horror away ! Now the game tells you when you want to use a sideboard or not ( or you can choose the adventure or opponent that uses it ) so you are not overwhelmed with expansions . Each expansion shows up to give your games a unique flavor . We just love the new preludes , and while it seems that they give you an added advantage , in our games at least , that is only an illusion - our win loss ratio has not changed . In fact , we beleive the extra " boost " that sometimes the prelude cards give is more of a " false hope " as the doom we are prearing to face is even worse then we orignally believed .
5 #### Very good expansion ! For the ones who loved the base game it is mandatory !
5 #### Terrific expansion for this game . Really does actually EXPAND the game .
5 #### High quality and fun expansion of EH , I never thought EH could have big expansion like this
5 #### This is the second expansion of Eldritch Horror and is a ' big box ' expansion . It adds a bunch of new cards , new investigators , new tokens , and a new side board . If you 're an Eldritch Horror fan this is worth the forty bucks as it not only brings new content but also adds more cards to the existing decks . That said , however , I 'd argue that getting the first expansion ' Forsaken Lore ' before getting this is a better investment as Forsaken Lore adds even more cards to the existing decks which really adds to re - playability . Mountains of Madness is still a great expansion , though , just not the first one I 'd buy ( but I did buy it ) .
5 #### My husband absolutely LOVES this game and it 's expansions . He 's looking forward to the next expansion .
5 #### The base game is really fun to play and a big problem we always had is the dice , but now with these I can support a 6 player game easily .
5 #### These dice have good contrast and weighting . These dice are necessary to play Edge of Empire .
4 #### Unfortunately you 'll probably need two sets of these to play the game effectively .
4 #### I ended up buying two sets to have for a five player game . This helps the drama when doing competitive rolls .
5 #### People complain that you need to buy extra dice for this roleplay system . However , $ 12 for this many custom dice is actually relatively affordable - certainly less of a cash grab than other Fantasy Flight Games efforts . The dice are affordable , beautiful , and the way they work really adds a lot to the system they coincide with . Do n't try and use the chart that translates normal dice .
5 #### My second set of EoE dice . So I knew what to expect no complaints here .
3 #### Nice dice and good quality from FFG of course . We found ourselves rerolling some of these to get the dice pools we needed . We have just started playing so of course at some point we will probably have to buy two sets . Some people take issue with ' special dice ' needed for certain roleplaying games . I 'm not one of those people .. however it is unfortunate that to build dice pools and get everything in one roll you will need two sets of these .
2 #### I thought I 'd get more into the game but nope
5 #### Great dice system that is unique and allows for great Star Wars fun .
5 #### These dice are very high quality , the symbols are clear and easy to read .
5 #### If you have played XCOM , either from 1980s or just the 2000s editions , this is a nice twist that requires many people to play . There is a solo option but I would n't put the fate of the world in my ability to play this game . I would recommend this game for group or family play as each person will have a job to do and the turn starts crazy fast when the aliens attack , but you can respond on the second half to the conflict . I personally would like to deploy more interceptors and have more soldiers for those research benefits . You can download the Alien AI to your phone , tablet and computer ( MAC and WINDOWZ ) . I suggest you burn the AI to disc , so that you will always have it . hint hint . I hope there is an expansion for this .
5 #### If you like pandemic , this is the next step
5 #### The only downside I see to this product is that it should come with another red die . Other than that I love the dice , and the dice system for Edge of the Empire ! I 've actually bought two of these and that 's enough for everything my group needs to do .
5 #### Game dice you need them for the SWEoTE table top game . Nicely packed and good quality dice . Would recommend them to a friend .
5 #### Cool game , all is going like in game , but in life , with your friends . Thanks so much for such board game !
4 #### I like this game , but ( and there 's always a but ) I wished there was cards to draw instead of an app . It 's an okay app , but there 's the deal of either having a laptop or tablet ( of which neither I own ) or tying up your smartphone . Other than that It 's a fairly easy game to learn and quite fun to play alone or with others . The components seem to be great quality , board is heavy weight standard cardboard with vibrant colors , the cards and pieces are really great too . all in all It 's a great game !
5 #### Lol . They 're dice that you can only use for the FF Star Wars RPG . What else is there to say ?
5 #### It 's good stuff very pleased with the product and i got exactly what i expected and did n't get something that i did n't expect
5 #### When I first saw the dice I said to myself " UGH . More dice ? " but then I laughed , because I 'm a gamer and dice are like crack and I had to have them . I played my first game of SW : EotE over the weekend and the dice did great . Did not take me long at all to begin to piece together how the dice work . Since these are a MUST for the SW game , you can feel better with the purchase by knowing that you 'll pick up how they work pretty quickly .
5 #### Bought these bc we were going to have a lot of people playing with us . It arrived quickly and we have no complaints about the purchase .
4 #### Initially I was disappointed . These dice feel lighter ( cheaper ? ) than normal Chessex polyhedral gaming dice , and the destiny tokens are a heavy stock paper ( not plastic ) . After thinking about it - a 7 piece set of Chessex typically runs between $ 5 and $ 15 . This set has 14 dice . I have to imagine if the dice were heavier and if the tokens were also plastic the set would run about $ 25 , which would really invite complaints . So I 've decided on 4 stars . The system is innovative and these dice make it run . You need two sets to really play EotE , however .
1 #### The rules are all online & cumbersome to use . There is no clear explanation on how to win the game while plenty of clear ways to lose . The app is adequate but the game seems to go on forever with no sense of progression . My family tried the game twice and got frustrated both times . Finally gave up and lost interest in playing . My recommendation is to look at some of the video reviews before you purchase to see if the style of play is to your liking .
4 #### This one expands the previous expansions of Arkham . If you have n't already purchased a number of the expansions ( at least 4 ) it 's probably not worth the money , but if you have almost all the other expansions and are looking for a way for them to all integrate together better ... this is a great way to do it .
4 #### my husband likes this game , the phone app is neat
5 #### Very fun , but you need several people to maximize the experience .
5 #### Great board game , intense just like the video game . The timed element really sets it apart from other games .
3 #### An enjoyable game , but could be better . The rules could have used better wording . I looked on line for a faq , but the game designers seem to be mum on some of the confusing parts . We 've made up some " house rules " where they were unclear and enjoy it nonetheless .
4 #### The game is really tense and fun all the way through . It does a great job of capturing some of the feel of the video game . The difficulty may seem a bit steep at the start but it 's actually quite fair .
5 #### I LOVE this game . Fast paced action , constant full team participation , great replay - ability due to the use of the tablet / pc app .
3 #### I bought this as my first GM accessories . It seems of impressive quality , I 'm happy about that . I feel some of the space on the screen is wasted . Particularly , an entirely large chart for 0 - 150 rolls for critical injuries on persons , and another for vehicles . Those seem largely unnecessary to me . What I was really hoping for was a quicker way to look up what skills someone is trying to use , and what counters them . For example , if a character is trying to charm a PC , what skill does the NPC use to defend it ? That is way more needed for me , and instead I 'll have to print that out and have it with me or tape it to the screen . For just that reason I really felt it was n't worth the money , as hard as that seems . The rest of the info found on it is nice , but it 's relatively easy to remember ( more purple dice means the check is harder ) or look up .
5 #### I do n't know why my expectations were so low on this product . Frankly , I 've been playing RPGs since I was 14 which would be the summer of 1979 . Back then RPGs products were crap . I recently decided it would be fun to play some of these games again so I picked up this because I really liked the theme of it and the videos FFG did really won me over . Overall this screen is well made ( boardgame quality construction for the screen ) and the content of information on it is perfect for anyone not familiar with the conventions of this game which will be about 90 % of their customers since so much of it appears to be new . If you have an android device or iOS get the FFG dice roller as well . Its MUCH cheaper than the physical dice!&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Star - WarsTM - Dice / dp / B00AWUQDQS / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Star WarsTM Dice</a >
4 #### Game Master 's Kit might be a stretch . The produce consists of a game master four board screen and a thirty page , starter adventure . Both are high quality . I was hoping for a resource that would aid in generating adventures , but the four pages of tables are the ones that you will likely use most often as a game master . Also , after playing the Beginner 's Game , I was hoping for some counters , but again , no love . Perhaps future publications will include these things .
5 #### Bought this for my husband and he enjoys the book
5 #### I got this because I think the art in this game is gorgeous , and the screen does not disappoint . But the real value to me is having a full adventure . While I love writing adventures and being creative as a GM , it takes hours to do that , so if I can , I like to keep a few ready - made adventures on standby . For those who do n't think the screen itself is quite worth the money , do n't forget the opportunity cost of having to find the time to put together that full adventure for that one game session you just are n't going to have time to fully prepare for . If you prep 3 hours writing up the outline of your adventure , suddenly this looks like a really awesome deal -- and a lot more time went into preparing for this particular adventure than 3 hours .
5 #### As all other RPG screens is filled with all kind of information to help you keep the adventure going .. the adventure included is very good and gives a good starting point for a campaign ..
4 #### The screen has almost all of the needed information to play on it . I wish it had the definition of weapon qualities on it as I have to look those up in the core rule book regularly .
5 #### In SW : EoTE there are not a lot of things to keep track of or to hide from the players ( well , that depends on how you run your campaigns ) . But this have all the things you need to know . Dice information , how to manage difficulties . So instead of shuffling the core rule book just take a quick look to your beautifully designed and printed screen and keep the flow of the game uninterrupted . It also feels sturdy , this may last for a few good years if treated with care . It also brings an extra adventure , I have n't played it yet but its always good to have pre - made stories that you and your players can jump into without a single idea of what s to come . If you , as a GM , want to keep it cool , classy and bad@$$ get this screen . Boba Fett people , you ca n't go wrong with this one .
5 #### High quality with great reference on the GM side . The adventure is good and I completed it in about 5 hours with my players . It could extend to two sessions or 7 + hours depending on the players and how the GM wants to run it . The player side of the GM screen is attractive and my players said they loved how it looks without being asked .
2 #### I thought I 'd get more into the game but no .
5 #### This DM screen has everything a DM need to see or check that s in the book . It saves time and the design on the back is so cool looking . A must have if you have a big group or one book .
3 #### The Star Wars Edge of the Empire Game Master 's Kit is a fine addition to any GM 's toy box , but is a bit mislabeled - what you are purchasing is actually a heavy cardboard GM 's Screen and a 30 page magazine - style booklet . The booklet itself is 25 pages of adventure and 5 pages of information on how to better run a Nemesis . The adventure was an interesting but not truly dazzling work involving Hutts and droids ; the Nemesis section I 've so far found useless . The GM screen is extremely sturdy , and displays basic tables from the core rulebook on the four different partition sections . That pretty much sums up the product . So , for a recommended retail price of $ 19.99 + tax , you get a sturdy GM screen , a short adventure , and a few pages of explanations for GMs only . To me , this was n't worth the price - I 'd rather buy a cheaper partition ( maybe from an office supply story ; maybe just use a GM screen from a different game ) and spend the rest of my money on another Edge of The Empire product ( perhaps a full adventure book like _ The Jewel of Yavin _ ; something with adventure hooks and source material like _ Suns of Fortune _ ; or maybe one of the career " splatbooks " like _ Dangerous Covenants _ ) . Rating : 3 out of 5 Stars . The GM screen is extremely sturdy , but it and the included adventure are probably not worth the recommended retail price .
4 #### The gamer this was given to at Christmas really loves this kit . It 's hard to buy for a gamer when you 're not a gamer , but this turned out to be a good choice . I was really pleased that it worked out .
5 #### Best quality screen I 've seen . Has tons of ' at your fingertips ' information that you need during game play . Helps to keep the narrative moving as you do n't have to page through the book for information .
5 #### The only thing that is n't on the chart is the Range Bands . That would have been great , but EVERYTHING else is there . A must - have for any GM .
5 #### This expansion is super fun and while I do not use the Y wings a lot , the Hunters are great ships and would save you time if you are trying to build a Scum swarm squad ( I hate swarms but I do love to play against them ) . Get it , you will have fun .
5 #### Created a few Bombing run campaigns against some opponents and it was nice to see this combo put together . A few good support ships to keep your Y - wing alive . THe paint schemes were very nice and refreshing . The black sun logo on them was a nice touch .
5 #### Probably one of the best expansions in providing the most bang - for - the - buck . Three ships are included , which can technically be used for either rebels or scum ; pilot cards for scum expansion - not just for the Y - wings and Z-95s , but for the Firespray , HWK ; upgrades , etc etc . It 's no small wonder why this is very often in short supply . For new people , I always tell them to try and grab this one . Additionally , the way FFG works , ships WILL be flyable . For ages Y - wings collected dust . . . until twin laser turrets . Scum always played second fiddle . . . until U - boats . So this is definitely a handy set to add to the collection .
5 #### I own every non epic ship released for this game . They are all fantastic , well detailed models with solid rules . I have received two ships that were damaged and customer service has replaced those quickly with little trouble .
5 #### If you want to get a Scum and Villainy squadron started , this is a must have . The models are fantastically detailed , and the quality ensures that they are durable as well . A real favorite .
4 #### A much needed third faction for an already incredible game . Repaints of old ships plus tons of faction specific cards . This will really get you started .
5 #### kept the ships for extras for my rebel faction ... traded the scum and villainy stuff for spar parts . These items are TOO small for me to repaint this set saved me the trouble and added variety to my alliance faction . same excellent quality from FFG ! ! !
5 #### The Scum Villainy faction is an interesting development for this game giving us a third player in the civil war . We use this faction as a stand - alone group or fight for and against both sides depending on our mood . This allows Scum Villainy to raid and fight as a truly independent force . This expansion is a major addition to the game and to this faction . In addition to the two Z-95 Headhunters and one Y - Wing , the box houses some really useful cards . The major item is including Boba Fett as a Scum Villainy pilot . You will need the must have Slave 1 expansion to use these cards but it is a great idea . The upgrades included in the box work with all factions adding real value to this set . This is a serious extension for the Scum Villainy faction , adding important ships , people and upgrades .
5 #### Love this set as it gives the Y - Wings even more purpose and utility . Long live the warthog !
4 #### Just getting into the game , but they paint jobs on the models are some of the best I 've seen on pre - painted miniatures .
5 #### If you 're buying this , you probably know the product line . There is nothing to complain about on any FFG X - Wing product .
5 #### Awesome detail and includes one of the best pilots ! Really like this pack .
5 #### Very good expansion for the Rebel Alliance . Has the venerable Wedge Antilles with a skill of 9 and the ability to reduce target agility by one ! Garven Dreis allows you to place your focus token on another friendly ship at range 1 - 2 after he uses it . Astromech units are also handy and one allows you to place one face up damage card to a face down if you roll an evade at the end of the game phase ! Has the expert handling elite talent and marksmanship as well as proton torpedoes upgrade ! All in all .... a solid expansion !
5 #### Love these miniatures , I hate the packaging but that is because it is classic packaging that leaves you struggling to get the item out without damaging the included materials ( cards in this case ) .
5 #### Awesome detail . Really enjoy playing this game with my son . Great addition .
4 #### A nice looking model , but the laser cannons feel a bit fragile .
5 #### X - wing is the miniature game of the 21st century . And you have to have your X - wing !
5 #### Gorgeous model , quality seems ok , paint job is fantastic . A good addition to any Imperial player of X - Wing .
5 #### Although not as popular these days , I still love that this ship is relevant in todays meta . It does n't have great maneuverability , but it has good offense and is durable . I 'm hoping that the promised upgrades by FF will appear sometime next year to give this great ship a well deserved boost .
5 #### Amazing quality and detail has been put into these pieces . I 'm still waiting for a star destroyer and death star though !
5 #### great detail and look great on my shelf when not playing the game . love this
5 #### This is a great Star Wars ships of all time . I love it .
4 #### Awesome expansion . I enjoy this game quite a lot . I am going to keep purchasing these to get into a very big battle eventually !
5 #### Love this ship and it is very detailed ! Ca n't wait for more ships to come out ! I will buy more to grow my fleet ,
5 #### This was a Christmas gift for a friend if mine who had been looking for expansion pieces to the tie fighter game , which he likes to play as often as he can
4 #### I 'm collector and I also play with this items . I did not like the packing that was used because the box was too small for the height of the item . The item was bent when it arrived do to the tight box . I like the item just poor packaging
4 #### You will like this game if you are a fan of Star Wars and/or Silent Death . Make sure to buy the starter set first ( has 1 x X - Wing and 2 x TIEs ) .
5 #### I wo n't go into great detail because it 's really not needed , other 's have covered what 's in the box . Even though you can get X - Wings in the starter set , you still need 1 X - Wing and one Tie Fighter expansion for the unique pilot cards included . Wedge is only available in this expansion or as promo - cards for playing tourneys and is one fo the better pilots . Garven is also useful , so it 's worth the $ 15 for the expanison , especially since they have been released after a shortage of them for a while . The mini is of very good quality and the paint jobs on them are surprisingly good for being mass produced , I recemend them and the game .
5 #### Hard to find item . at good price . same FFG quality . needed addition to core game . was hoping the item would be slightly differant than the one in the core game .
5 #### This is a great expansion . Only works with the core set . Great for adding depth to the gameplay by providing more options for constructing a fleet / squad .
5 #### A great addition to the base game . Like everything else in this line , all the components are high quality . This is easily one of the better lines of miniatures .
5 #### Very nice miniature with a good paint job and no flaws that I have noticed . I field a number of these in my X wing list and have yet to be disappointed . comes with everything you need to assemble and have on the table in mere minutes . A great buy !
5 #### What I did n't realize when I got into the X - Wing Miniatures game is that it was n't like most Fantasy Flight games - this was a collectible miniatures game versus a living card game , or board game . As such , to play in tournaments , you need the extra expansions , and the additional X - Wing is a must for Rebel players . Giving you an extra ship , extra pilots , extra droids , have fun playing as your favorite Rebels like Wedge Antilles . This is the same model as the one that comes in the starter set , but for larger battles , this is needed for the Rebels .
5 #### Just what my husband wanted . Great price ! Better than the in store price . And it did n't take long to get here .
5 #### This one is a tricky one ! Do you want one ? Definitely ! Is it too expensive ? Most likely . Will it make my gaming experience better ? Quite a lot This mat is made of a rubbery bottom with a glued piece of fabric with a starfield pattern , the star wars logo on a corner . Think of it as a thinner gigantic mousepad . Being 36"x36 " it is not very portable , unless you want to spend more money on a poster tube . I have use it for about one month and a half , about 10 games and so far it holds fine . My earliest concerns were that the fabric would unglue with time , specially in the corners , as it would be expected of a mousepad with time . So far this has not happened . It has affected my gaming experience positively . I usually took a lot of time to set the play area in the right dimensions and even used a felt cloth as mat sometimes but it would move a lot . This stays in place , so it makes the game easier , reduces the time to setup and is tournament regulation so it helps when running scenarios . It also looks cool to play on it . I would recommend it to anyone who is committed to this game or even to Armada . It works for both games .
5 #### nice game area , rolls up for storage and rolls out nice and flat -- not curled
5 #### Very nice ! Big , beautiful and the perfect service for X Wing ! A little overpriced , but do n't regret the purchase . And far better than buying fabric and trying to make your own !
5 #### This is exactly what I was looking for . Perfect .
5 #### Looks great . Gives a nice space to play on . Would buy again .
5 #### Arrived very quickly . I ordered four mats for campaign style games for , " Star Wars X Wing Miniatures " . All the mats look great and the material is very sturdy .
5 #### This mat works great for Star Wars Armada as well . The bottom is non - slip which makes it easy to keep ships in place vs a plain table . It also looks really cool
4 #### Does what it says it does . This is like a big giant mouse pad . The mat wo n't slide on your table . However , the top of the mat is a bit slippery , so models can slide on it a bit easier than I would like , but still a nice playable game mat .
5 #### Immagine your a hero of terrinoth , and you need some upgraded stats to be played in an upgraded version of a game . Seems ridiculous right ? NO IT ISN'T ! You need to defeat more monsters and do more quests and kill more enemies , and you want to do it in a smaller time frame . In descent 1 your just roaming around ... killing stuff mercilessly for about , say what ? 6 - 10 hours if your a serious hero like me ? But all your friends are like , hey , I have a life and do n't have time to kill stuff for that long and I want more real goals that are n't , say : " Hey we need to kill some big monster . " Well ... If you want to have a better quest for everybody all around , and finish said quest in less than an hour and a half and are still a hero of descent 1 , this little power - up is for you . Take forth from the local tavern and quest once more ! After three quests , I am convinced that the rewards are worth the investment .
4 #### a must have for converting ... I have all of the 1st edition goodies , so it saved me some money when I converted to playing 2nd edition ... now if they offered a bx set of all the other heroes and monsters with 2nd edition cards ( dungeon quest , and rune * * * * then you could box up one big expansion pack and have them all ) .
5 #### This converts the old base Set of Descent over to the 2.0 version . The 2.0 version is the way to go ! ! ! I will never go back to the old version . I can not recommend it enough it allows you to use at least all the monsters and heroes from the older games .
4 #### Pretty fun game . Bought three different decks and found that the cards do n't really allow you to mix and match all that much . The rules are n't in enough detail . We had a lot of questions while playing .... and still do lol
5 #### My siblings and I are big Adventure Time fans , and we were all very happy with this game . The cards fit in standard trading card protectors , which I recommend buying . They 're cheap , and will let you enjoy this game for years without harming the mathematical artwork .
2 #### I do a lot of puzzles and could n't wait to do this one . It 's the greatest picture ! However , I went a little crazy ! It 's been a few months , but I 'm almost sure this is the one where the pieces fit but it 's still not the correct piece . It looks right , but it 's not the intended piece . I just do n't have tolerance for those kids of puzzles ! I gave it away asap because I knew I 'd never do it again . I wanted to love it and wish it was made differently .
5 #### This puzzle takes concentration but that is why I do jigsaw puzzles . It has become a tradition in my house that we put together as many jigsaw puzzles as we can during the Christmas break . Usually we can do at least one a day for the week between Christmas and New Years sometimes two . This one did n't get finished in the time we were off so I had to pack it away for summer . Beautiful puzzle though .
4 #### Being a lover of all things Boston Terrier I did enjoy working it . The puzzle quality was n't as good as others I 've worked namely Ravensburger , Cobble Hill and Schmidt , but this particular subject matter is near and dear to me . I would n't necessarily buy a puzzle from them again based on the puzzle 's merits alone ... but you got ta love a Boston Terrier with a ball !
5 #### Good quality puzzle . Challenging with a lot of dark pieces !
4 #### I got these for my daughter 's 2nd birthday party , which was an owl theme , and these are cute , inexpensive , and were a nice addition to her party bag .
4 #### So , nothing really special here , just more dice for your Star Wars : Imperial Assault adventures . While these extra dice are not necessary for the game , it is really nice to have them , especially when playing the campaign game when there is up to five players . Instead of scrambling and searching for the dice each time you activate and attack , you 'll be much more likely to have some nearby . It 's not a huge deal , but it is really nice . Short story , this dice pack makes a great game even better .
5 #### Makes Imperial Assault run so much smoother having a second set of dice
5 #### Perfect addition so that each side of the table can have their own set of dice . Makes it a little more convenient .
5 #### More of everything for Eldritch Horror , including some aspects ( focus tokens ) that first appeared in Mountain of Madness . Eldritch Horror is already an incredible game ... the extension makes it event better .
5 #### This is the second ' small box ' expansion for Eldritch Horror - I would compare this to the ' Forsaken Lore ' expansion , which is the first ' small box ' expansion . Strange Remnants adds one new Ancient One along with the supporting card decks . It also adds more cards to all the location decks , making all of those decks taller and increasing the variety of cards pulled during any given game . Many would argue that getting ' big box ' expansions like ' Mountains of Madness ' ( which I also own ) is a better investment but it depends on your approach . I do enjoy getting new side boards and so on but I actually prefer beefing up the base game mechanics with new cards to add variety . For me personally I prefer ' small box ' expansions as they add more to the base game without adding any clutter like new side boards . Also , ' small box ' expansions have a lower buy - in cost than ' big box ' expansions . To sum up , if you 're an EH fan you probably already have this and if you 're on the fence I 'd say get it just to beef up the base game card variety .
4 #### Good . Adds more cards . The bad thing is that has only one ancient one .
5 #### This is another must - have expansion for Eldritch Horror . The new characters alone are worth the price of admission , with a couple of them now being regulars in our games . The new mythos is tough , and so far we 've been close but unable to defeat . The added encounters are all a nice surprise and add to the variety - as do the new items , spells , unique items , etc . Also , a nice touch is the addition of all the palces of power , such as stonehenge , which really adds a new twist to the concept of expeditions . If you have n't gotten Mountains of Madness , then you want to get this set to pick up the new Focus action and tokens which adds another options for your characters .
5 #### The 2 year old went bonkers over this . The 8 and 12 year old snuck in and did a few pages too . Perfect for small kids who ca n't be trusted with markers but really want to use them . Especially great for car rides .
5 #### My son found an old Imagine Ink Hello Kitty tablet the other day and colored the WHOLE thing in a day . He kept talking about how much he liked it and I felt bad because I have n't seen these in stores for years ... or maybe I just have n't looked . He was n't wild about the crayola markers that you use on special paper so it never occurred to me he would enjoy these . I was thrilled to see they were all over Amazon and in some of his favorite characters . I got him a few for gifts . He LOVES minions and paw patrol and thomas so I 'll be back often to get these . I wish they were a little less spendy but if they are mess free and keep a toddler busy for a few minutes they are worth it .
5 #### i love these books . brings me back to my childhood . just wish they had somewhere sturdy to store the pen when not in use . they always seem to go missing .
5 #### Great activity book- with magic ink pen to keep kids busy .
5 #### This was a gift for another grandson ... just because ... & he did like it as well !
5 #### We have n't used it yet but we love Despicable Me .
5 #### Perfect for times that need to be mess free , like out to dinner in a nicer restaurant , on a plane , or in a car . The magic ink was really fascinating to an almost 5 year old , and it was great for travel and dining . It has activities that address a wide range of age and ability ( doing a number scramble where the kid only colors in certain squares to just coloring in an outline ) , so minion fans will find this a lot of fun . It 's also an upgrade from the parental generation , where the purplish color was revealed - these pictures are in color ! ( ooh ! ) The only disappointment he stated : no purple minions . Would definitely buy again .
5 #### A very well designed game that will make Magic players feel right at home due to many similar mechanics . Turns basically consist of choosing a plot ( from a deck of 7 ) that determines gold for resources , turn order , and hand size for the turn ; next , drawing cards , then purchasing characters , locations , and attachments ; and finally , attacking the opponent in three ways : military . intrigue , and power - each with unique benefits . Who ever scores 15 power first wins . If playing with 3 to 6 players , titles from the series are also included , such as Hand of the King , that also mix things up a bit . And for the Game of Throne fans , it is just too much fun building decks around your favorite characters and seeing them in action ( thanks also to the great artwork throughout ) . All are very welled themed , with rules that make sense giving their actions in the series . I love to play trading card games , but the time and expense are just too much for me these s days . FFG 's Living Card Games are nice cause I can get my fix at a much lower cost , and if I do feel the need to expand , I can buy add - ons that I know exactly what I 'm getting . If it sounds like you are in a similar boat , I encourage you to try out this or the futuristic Netrunner ; both great games in my opinion .
4 #### I can not compare to original release , but this is a really nice set . Game is made from good materials . Game is rather complex in a good way , but you may have a challenge finding opponents that are willing to play or at same skill level . I recommend it , but be sure you have people to play with and would recommend you are also a fan of series as the game may be easier to learn .
5 #### Over all this thing works great ! We just plug it in when we hop in the car and pair a phone with it . We personally use spotify for the music just because it is easy ! Hubby has his own playlist and I have my own so we can pick and chose what we want to hear . Cons : if you are traveling in a small town or out in the country , or even simply drive under some tall trees , it may make it act a little funny at times . The songs will seem to skip , like a CD or record would if scratched . And on occasion it will slow songs down a bit , just enough to where they sound a little different and it 's hard to sing along .
5 #### Please be aware that this game is not meant for casual GOT fans : this card game is much closer to competitive cards games like Magic the Gathering than more casual games like Cards Against Humanity . Fantasy Flight makes another game aimed more towards fans of the show that is MUCH simpler than this game . ( EDIT : found here:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Game - of - Thrones - Card - Game - HBO - Edition / dp/1616615885 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Game of Thrones Card Game ( HBO Edition)</a > With that said , if you 're into card games like Magic or Netrunner , then this game will definitely be worth a try . Fantasy Flight Games , the creators of Netrunner and Stars Wars LCG / Miniatures game , rebooted their AGOT card game ( hence " 2nd edition ) to take advantage of the huge popularity of the TV show . With that said , I stumbled upon this game and loved it . If you 're interested in diving into a new competitive card game , then AGOT : LCG 2nd Edition is definitely worth a try . However , if you 're looking for a casual party game for fans of the TV Series , then this game will be too complex and complicated for a casual fun experience .
4 #### As a fan of games like Arkham Horror and Magic : The Gathering as well as HBO 's popular series , I was delighted to receive this game for review . The portrayal of characters and themes is true to&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/A - Song - of - Ice - and - Fire / dp/0553381687 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>&nbsp;with all original artwork ( no scenes from the show ) ; gameplay is typical Fantasy Flight , meaning you 'll need three or four play sessions and a few friendly arguments to settle on the rules . All in all , a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours ... and you do n't even have to kick the kids out of the room first .
5 #### This is a lovely second edition for a fun game . The art remains gorgeous ; it 's a wonderful addition to any collection for that reason alone . Much like Game of Thrones , the rules are complicated . This means it 's a bit more " meaty " than your average CCG , however , it also means there 's a learning curve . If you are looking for a first - time card game , I 'd suggest Legendary or the LOTR for that purpose . If you 're looking for something to satiate you and you 're tired of Dominion , give her a whirl !
4 #### Complex working to get a handle on it . Quality materials tho .
4 #### There 's a lot of different cards / play - styles in the box . It 's a bit difficult to learn if you 're unfamiliar with similar games . But , if you like games with plenty of complexity and choices , it may be for you . In the few games of 2 - player " joust " I 've played , it seems like once one player gets an advantage , it 's very difficult for the other player to recover . This might just be because I have n't enough experience to learn how to recover , not sure . Either way , it 's fun . And new cards to be released may fix this if it 's indeed an issue .
4 #### This game feels somewhat interchangeable with other recent games and somewhat superfluous as a result , however the gameplay will be familiar to those fans of fantasy card / strategy games and will be especially fun for big time GOT fans . As fans of RPG / fantasy / strategy card games and GOT ourselves , we are happy to add it to our collection , despite the fact that I do n't think it will win any awards .
3 #### When I started trying to get into this game I just kept going back to Dungeons and Dragons many . . .many years ago . I never got that game . . . and I really do n't get this one either . Perhaps if I was more familiar with the TV show , it would make more sense . I think if you 're into fantasy games . . . then this one might appeal to you . Otherwise , you might be as lost as I am . Also , I do n't see that there are enough pieces for six players . I think you 're better off with two . . . and no more than four .
5 #### This is a fun game for fans of the popular Game of Thrones television show . It 's a pretty involved card game that lets you get involved in the action . It is fun and comes with several directions for two player and multiplayer options . There is a lot to it , but if you spend the time , it is a lot of fun . It is nice to play at a Game of Thrones watching party .
5 #### This is a great game . We love Game of Thrones . So for us to actually play this game was fun . we plated four players . Every turn there is a new twist , This is a good strategic game . This is the second edition . Its more fun then the first one . Great for friends to play on the weekend .
4 #### With the holidays coming I 've been trying to find a great gift for a couple that the hubs and I are friends with . As it happens we are all MTG players and GoT fans so I was hoping having the opp to review this would help me decide if I wanted to purchase this for them . The gameplay seems to be in the same realm as MTG but I love that this game does n't become a money pit in the same manner . The cards are gorgeous , making this lovely from the collector side . All in all , I like it a lot and I think it 's exactly the thing I was looking to purchase for my friends .
4 #### I picked this game to play because my husband and I are fans of the television show . I have not read the books yet . So I wanted to see how this game was . I read others thoughts on this game . I do have to agree that if you have never played a living card game before than it will take a lot of patience to learn all of the rules . You will probably have to refer to them many times through out the play of the game to remember what step is next . Or you could go watch this video by the makers of this game on Youtube titled " A Game of Thrones : The Card Game Second Edition Tutorial " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1s54Wlgfyo This video as mentioned by another reviewer is very helpful in understanding the rules of the game . You may even be able to just watch the video and not have to read the rule book . Again , if you have never played a living card game than I would suggest you play the tutorial game that is suggested in the rule book . It is a shorter version but it will really help you get the concept of the game down . Suggested for 2 players . Which is the best as once you have mastered the tutorial game than you can bring in more players to see who can conquer for world dominion .
4 #### An intense and engrossing game that requires a bit of dedication to absorb . Like GOT , this game is all about conquest and treachery . If you 're a veteran of dynamic card games , this game will prove a challenge . All of the materials are very well deigned with original artwork . It does n't use anything from the show and is more based on the books by George R R Martin , as it should be . All materials are high quality . It can be easy to damage playing cards like these . They have rounded edges and are coated to help make them a little resistant to moisture . There 's a 16 page " Learn to Play " booklet and a 32 page " Rules Reference " booklet . It will take time and effort to get accustomed to the rules and the intended game flow . Best suited for those who like and excel at complicated games .
5 #### A Game of Thrones The Card Game Second Edition is the 2015 update to the 2002 Origins Award - winning game by Fantasy Flight Games . It is classified as a Living Card Game ( LCG ) , meaning that there are planned expansion boxes containing boxed card sets . Organized play is available for those interested . Will you like Game of Thrones Second Edition ? There are two questions you should ask yourself : " Do you like Customizable Card Games ? " & " Do you like George R. R. Martin 's _ A Song of Fire and Ice _ setting ? " If you answered yes to both of these questions , chances are you will like this game - if you hate one or the other , the chances are considerably less that you will like it ( but not impossible ) . So , what else should you know about the game at this time ? You need at least two players to play . You only need one core set to start ( this box ) , but I 've seen intense players purchase two or three for various reasons . There will be future expansions to the game , but the core set usually remains permanently legal in play until a new edition ( considering the second edition took over a decade to come out , that is a long time ) . It is a Fantasy Flight Living Card Game , so there are tournaments at many Friendly Local Gaming Stores and gaming conventions ( GenCon , etc ... ) .
4 #### Ok , I 'm not a Game of Thrones fan . Tried the show a couple times , but just could not get into it . However , I feel that you do n't have to be a fan to enjoy this game . I found the game to be interesting and fun , but I will have to say that it seems to be a bit more complex than I care for in my games . The cards are beautiful and easy to understand . Fantasy Flight always does a fine job with a game 's presentation . I did read the rules and had quite a number of questions once I had read them . Thankfully , I have a friend that had played the first edition of this game and with his help , we were able to get in a few games of it with his help . Btw , I had never played the first edition . After our third game ( we only played 2 player ) I felt I was finally getting the hang of the game . We did have to keep referring to the rules and those are fairly clear and does n't take long to look things up . If you 're into meaty card games or Game of Thrones , then this game is simply an no brainer .
5 #### My husband is a big fan of Game of Thrones , so I thought he would enjoy this card game . I was right ! He enjoyed learning the rules and playing it with my brothers . It took them a while to figure out the rules , but they had the patience to continue ( whereas I would not ) . It 's a nice thing to have around the house that they can play on family get - together days . I like it - it 's not my thing , but it would make a great gift for someone in your life who enjoys Game of Thrones and strategy / role - playing type games .
5 #### I have not had a chance to play the first edition of this game but I had a great time with this one . This is a " living card game " , a game type that involves deckbuilding but provides all of the cards for a given set with any expansions rather than just a few , like most collectible card games . What particularly stands out is how the different factions in the game have cards that match the flavor of the faction . Gameplay is based on two decks , a plot deck and a draw deck . The plot deck provides a framework and objective for each players turns . As to be expected from GoT , this is a game of conflict and intrigue . It does take a while to pick up the flow , expect the first few games to run long . The mechanics are not that complex but there is a lot to learn initially and it takes actually playing to get a good sense of the card interactions . Spending some extra time with the rulebook is well worth it . As the second edition has just launched , there is not as much variety in the cards as older games with more expansions . Obviously , this will change but it does limit the deckbuilding side some at this point . Overall , this is a fun , highly competitive card game that takes some patience starting out but holds plenty of entertainment value and does justice to the GoT theme .
4 #### We really like this - first let it be known it is not a simple and quick game . Made that much harder if your not familiar with these type of card games . By the way you will most likely need more cards That being said with some time and patience you will / could love and enjoy this game . Game play is fun , hardcore GOT fans will thoroughly enjoy this !
4 #### This is a pretty complex game and not something you can just pick up and start playing . Expect to read the rules thoroughly and then still have a bit of confusion about how things are . This is definitely a game for the hardcore gamer , not the casual one . If you are a GoT fan you has never really been into gaming , this game may be a little overwhelming for you . However , for the dedicated gamers who are GoT fans , this is definitely a fun experience as you build power to take the throne . The cards are really nice looking . I 've always found Fantasy Flight Games to make nice games , and this one is no exception . This games is suitable for teenagers and adults so it is not a family game to play with younger children . Play time takes a while , especially in the earlier games where you are pausing to clarify rules , so make sure to set aside a couple of hours . Overall , this is a really nice game for gamers , especially those who are GoT fans . I would not recommend this for casual gamers however .
4 #### I am a big Game of Thrones Fan , so I was excited to receive this card game . This is not a simple card game , in fact it 's quite challenging to learn . If you 're not used to these types of games expect to play a few times through just to learn the rules . Better yet , get with someone who understands card games well or who has played this . It is a beautiful game , and knowledge of GoT is really helpful . It seems very well constructed . My only complaint is that it could use more cards . Not something I 'll play with the wife and kids , but with my hardcore gamer friends .
1 #### This is a 2 - 3 player games . I was so confused with this card game that I gave up playing . Four people had a difficult time trying to play . Idea sounds good , and you may be more intrigued if you 're a bigger fan of Game of Thrones , but there was much appeal for us .
5 #### This is a significantly updated version of the 2003 original , containing clarified rules , more content from later books in the GoT series , and some slightly improved components . A very fun game which emphasizes negotiation and backstabbing between players . If you are n't an experienced gamer or you 're planning to introduce this to casual gamers or nongamers who are interested in the GoT franchise , be aware that this is n't a true " gateway " game like Catan or Ticket to Ride , etc . The rules are not overly complex , but they do take some focus to learn .
4 #### To start , I 've not played the first edition of this game , so will not be using it as a frame of reference for this review and can not speak to the specific changes . The artwork on the cards , done by various artists , is beautiful and vibrant . The print quality is excellent as art the materials . Getting to the gameplay -- it 's complicated . I 'd recommend watching the YouTube tutorial provided by the makers , then reading the instruction manual once through ( there is even a separate booklet with the rules ) . There are a lot of moving parts , so to speak , and it 's easy to make a mistake or three in the beginning . The first game -- a two player joust following the walk - through set up provided in the first book -- took nearly three hours since neither of us felt entirely comfortable with the game mechanics . After the first few games , the game play became a lot easier to breeze through ( and by breeze through , I mean play in roughly two hours instead of three ) . That said , once you get the hang of it , this game is rather addictive especially if you enjoy strategy games . Overall , this is a great game to kill a few hours . You need n't have read the books or watched the series to play either . It only asks that you use some critical thinking and pre - planning , and it 's a fun way to pass a few hours .
5 #### This is a really fun card game that I think can be enjoyed by a variety of people , even if they 're not Game of Thrones die - hard devotees . HOWEVER , the game is also fairly complicated , and learning how to play for the first couple of times , before you get the hang of it , is definitely a challenge . This game is not for the faint of heart or for those without a little bit of patience ! This more so of a role - playing game ( not a trivia game at all ) .
5 #### I picked this model up to use with the Star Wars d6 role - playing game . It is almost exactly the same size as the Star Wars miniatures from Wizards of the Coast . I have not yet played Imperial Assault but I 'm hoping Santa brings it to me this year . Great figure .
5 #### A nice addition to my collection at a great price .
5 #### With the new " extra munnitions " card . I can literally bring 4 proton bombs , and a ton of missiles for just 2 points !
5 #### Love these miniatures , I hate the packaging but that is because it is classic packaging that leaves you struggling to get the item out without damaging the included materials ( cards in this case ) .
2 #### I would n't have bought this except that I wanted at least 1 of ever ship . This thing is massive !
5 #### item arrived early ! ! ! as described ... FFG 's great quality ... welcome addition to my empire forces ! ! !
5 #### I own every non epic ship released for this game . They are all fantastic , well detailed models with solid rules . I have received two ships that were damaged and customer service has replaced those quickly with little trouble .
5 #### got it for my cousin as he is a star wars collector .
5 #### Massive Tie Bomber on steroids ! Model itself is one of the biggest seen so far . Pilots are Redline(allows you to maintain 2 target locks at once ) , Deathrain(allows you to deploy bombs in front of you rather than behind ) and two generic pilots . Upgrades are cluster mines , ion bombs , Advanced homing missiles , and Plasma torpedoes , extra munitions , and Advanced sensors ad well ad Tie engine Mk2 that treats all banks as green manoeuvres . This is a great expansion for all lovers of ordnance .
5 #### I am a big fan of the FFG Star wars games both X - wing and Armada . The games are a lot of fun and are quite easy to learn . But the best thing for me is the quality and detail of the ships used by the game . I have yet to be disappointed with any of the models . All have been nicely painted and to be honest I have purchased some more for display than for actual game play . Even if you do not want to play the game the models are beautiful as display pieces . You will not be disappointed with any of these pieces .
5 #### Great addition to your imperial fleet , this came fast and exactly as I would expect , may pick up a second one at some point just because of the sheer awesomeness
5 #### Lets all be honest here the TIE Punisher is just a really oversized TIE bomber . I do n't have much experience with the original TIE bomber but the punisher is massive and really has some cool upgrades . Like the y - wing the punisher is rather slow and hard to maneuver but the trade off is some decent shielding and epic weapons . I have personally found that the bombs are a little hard to use but if you manage to chuck one in the right place it can be very devastating . The model is , as always very detailed and beautifully crafted to scale . I would nt build an army full of punishers but I think I will be able to manage some pretty good destruction with the one .
4 #### This is a very detailed die cast & plastic model of the starship seen in the movie , Star Trek Journey Into Darkness . Comes with a mag . giving all the info about the ships creation & details . Have heard of this ship being referred to as Aztecan in design . And wondered what the hell people were talking about , once you see the actual model it will indeed make sense . My one BIG complaint is the saucer of the model is so heavy compared to the body , it does not set in the holding stand well . If its touched or the stand is moved its pretty much a given the model is going to fall off of the stand . Major fail on Eaglemoss 's end for a toy that retails for 35 to 50 dollars in the US . For that price it also could have lit up to show the blue lights contrasting with the dark paint job . But now I am just splitting hairs .
5 #### very cute . love it ... using it in my son 's nursery
4 #### Smaller then I first realized , but works great for what I need . Its very pretty
5 #### exactly as described . its under $ 15 and its small - you get what you pay for so I do n't understand some comments . mine spins fine and looks great on a bookcase or desk for decoration or to reference from time to time . its exactly as i expected , no complaints at all . loo
5 #### This little globe is a real gem ; easy to read , great colors , a metal stand , as well as a metal " equator " strip rather than the standard paper strip that so easily comes loose . I also love how kid - friendly this globe is -- easy for young eyes to read and interpret with a bit of adult instruction , and the small size means that it stays put in a child 's hands better than a large one . I love this globe !
5 #### I used this for signatures at my wedding . It looks very nice .
4 #### I wanted a globe to help illustrate the idea that the earth is round in a geography lesson . I do n't really have space to store a large globe , so the small size was a plus . There is some distortion around the equator ( where the two pieces of the sphere are joined together - the seam is a bit wide ) , but other than that the actual map is fine - and surprisingly easy to read . We also have a couple of world atlases , so we use those if we need to see details , but for quickly answering the children 's " where is _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ? " questions this globe has been great . And I love the antique color scheme .
5 #### Detailed and easy to read globe . Wanted something for my desk at work and this is perfect . Another reviewer mentioned the globe is hard to turn but I had zero difficulty spinning it . Really impressed overall .
4 #### I bought this for my kids to put on there office desk . It 's a cute mini globe & I really like the old style look .
5 #### For being so tiny , this globe has a lot of detail and feels like good quality despite its plastic base . I bought the constellation one also . For a small desk globe , this is perfect , especially for the price .
5 #### My 9 year old has loved these so much that we 've bought all of the sets . Super fun and hands on for all age groups .
4 #### cool , but not that great . Experiments were kind of boring .
1 #### Idea is good . But material is cheap and there is one light which does not work . Waste of time ordering it and then returning it .
3 #### This is indeed an excellent kit however , it needs a detailed list with pictures identifying each item in the kit . This got a little confusing .
5 #### Which my tiny wizard loved , and when his smaller siblings were around he was just as content working out color patterns as he was using the smaller parts to do other projects .
4 #### This kit was very user friendly and my grandson ( age 10 ) enjoyed the light experiments . He was most interested in the light sabers .
4 #### Light saber is on the small side , but all in all my son loves it . He is really fascinated with the prism .
4 #### This is a great kit packed with information . However the included LED light saber can be a hazard as the light coming from tip is too powerful and kids ( or even adults ) who would be temped to look into it could be hurting their eyes . Also I have a suggestion for small improvement . They include small red , green and blue transparent sheets that are supposed to be cut up for the Kaleidoscope . Instead I found these to be valuable to show how white light ( say sunlight ) passing through these sheets will become colored . These are also useful to show how different colors can be overlapped to create new colors . Seems a much neater way to explain the concept rather than mixing messy colored liquids ( not inlcuded in the kit , anyway ) . Otherwise , this is an awesome kit .
4 #### The 10 - year old looked at it as though he had received smelly socks . The six - year old thought it was fun . I 'm not sure she completely understands the concept of analogies , but somehow managed to get most of the answers right . That made the 10 - year old want to join in . As a mom , I love anything that makes them want to learn on their own - even if the motivation is jealousy .
5 #### I do n't know that I would say this would be FUN in the way you think of toys being fun . However , this is a very educational , excellent resource for practicing analogies . We have been told that if we want our children to do well on standardized tests we should have our children understand analogies . This book guides the child through analogies in a very step by step process . The one thing this book does n't do is help you recognize an analogy in every day life . It helps you recognize the patterns within an analogy . My son actually enjoyed doing this book and found it to easy . He is in fourth grade . But it was a good starting point for him . Worth the money .
5 #### When I got this book in the mail , i was n't sure what analogies were . Turns out this book is really helpful for smart second graders and third graders . I also found it fun . I love most subjects and unscrambling the words were most fun . I think this helps kids be smarter and better at analogies ..... loved it . 5 stars !
5 #### I 'm working with a couple of reading challenged pre - teens . I purchased this book to illustrate what I mean by " thinking while you 're reading . " I love that there are only four analogies per page and there 's a puzzle to solve with the results . I also love that there 's only one best answer to each challenge . All the analogies are multiple choice , and the words are pretty easy , which is perfect for my students .
5 #### got this for my wife --- she is learning english as second language . Its a great product and she quickly worked her way up to a level that was challenging , now its fun to learn english vs rote memorization of some things . Its a tool . Its one of many she uses to learn-- but it has helped her a great deal . Its fun for everyone , me included . Thanks
5 #### Great for my 8 year old 3rd grader ! She had fun with this book on a trip . She likes words and puzzles so it was perfect for her !
3 #### Some of these are simply not analogies . For example -- prey : hunt::kill : devour -- more like word associations , or words that have something in common . It can still be a good teaching tool , but parents need to stay on top of it .
5 #### This game is GREAT ! I had never heard of it , and my boyfriend was looking to replace his worn and battered version so I ordered it on here . What a fun game ! It 's a unique look at history and the way events contribute to one another , and even if you are n't a major history buff , you can play this game ... and win ! We also ordered expansion packs to extend our timeline and have introduced several friends to this over the months .
2 #### Being very experienced game players , my husband and I were surprised that we had to struggle to understand how to play Chrononauts . We are relieved to see that we 're not the only reviewers who have found the instructions for this game to be overly complicated and confusing due to poor explanations . This game has a good concept but is in serious need of a professional editor ! ! ! As a former professional game editor myself , I am appalled at the lack of clear directions and examples .
3 #### Fun game . I 've always loved time travel and the concept behind this game is quite clever . The solo gameplay feels a little broken because I played it and lost the game after two cards ( I reshuffled one back into the deck so I would n't lose after two cards ) . Even regular gameplay ( played one 2 - person game ) seemed like it might be hard to win sometimescertain game winning conditions require one card to win . Luckily there are a few " search through the deck " type of cards which can help .
3 #### I actually find this game to be pretty complicated . I know games like Fluxx usually have the straight forward instructions , but I got lost in the specifications in a lot of the situations . I must be honest and say that I have only attempted this once and by myself so far , so my review may be a bit shallow . I 'll edit as I become more familiar with the game , but considering I 'm a big fan of Fluxx , this was a bit of a miss for me .
5 #### At first , I could n't grasp the game . It was fun , but I just did n't quite get what I was trying to do , so I lost a few matches in a row . Then my opponent pointed out the games was just logic applied over time . I used to tutor students in logic . I win 85 % of games now . I do n't meant to keep track , but I do . And the first time I went logical I one all three winning conditions at once . I still have trouble with social interaction , though .
5 #### This is perhaps the best time travel game in existence . In this game , you are a Time Traveler , with a Secret Mission , a Secret Identity , and a very important job to do : Paradox Repair . You can win by fixing enough Paradoxes , gathering up the three rare and amazing Artifacts listed on your Mission card , or adjusting history in the three ways necessary to allow your character to return to the alternate reality from which he or she originally came . The constant changing of history is tracked by a special layout of 32 cards , called the TimeLine , which functions rather like a gameboard . The three ways to win provide for several different plotlines and layers of action , but you can also split the game up into two less complicated games : Solonauts ( The Solitaire Game of Changing History ) and Artifaxx ( The Fluxx - style Game of Collecting Amazing Stuff ) . Game play is solid , with a lot of replayability . This game is actually copyrighted ! Perhaps one of the best features of this award - winning game is that it 's made in America . On the website , http://www.looneylabs.com/games/chrononauts , Andy Looney , the creator , has written an interesting article called " Mysteries of the TimeLine " in which he explains how and why the timeline cards interact with each other . There 's even lesson plans on how to use Chrononauts in the classroom written by an actual teacher . If you 're into time travel games , Chrononauts is a must have .
5 #### Monty Python 's Fluxx is a pythonization of the popular Fluxx game that produces many laughs . The basic rules are simple draw one and play one , however the draw rules the play rules , the hand size rules and even the victory conditions can change with the play of a card . This is Fluxx but with python you get keepers like the Hand of God that can change things , the Knights who say Ni , rules that count " 1 - 2 , 5 ( 3 sir ) " and actions that can be taken if the rules get " Much too Silly ! " The game can run 5 min or an hour you never know , its a perfect reserve game to have handy if you are waiting for part of your game group to make it . It says up to 6 but you can play with more without trouble . This is a winner and a must for Python fans and with the economy tough it is a cheap and fun evening at home . Get it .
5 #### This is a really fun game , & a nice change of pace from your typical board games . There are add ons that you can purchase , but I have n't needed to do that yet . Highly recommend for any history buffs or if you 're looking for something different .
5 #### My husband really loves this game . I enjoy playing it with him . We have two expansion packs for it too . Great game to play as a couple or with more people .
3 #### It 's Fluxx with a time travel theme . I guess that 's not quite fair because I actually like this a little more than Fluxx because I really like games with hidden agendas / secret goals . In Chrononauts you are given a secret identity and mission , fulfilling either of which will win you the game . Then the rest of the game plays out a lot like Fluxx . The humor on the cards is legitimately funny as well .
5 #### Great game from the creators of Fluxx . Alter the timeline in this fun and dynamic time - traveling game . Collect artifacts like a convincing copy of the Mona Lisa , a sports almanac from the future , or even live dinosaurs while changing the course of history to get back to your home timeline . This is a great game to play with three or four history buffs . What do you think would happen if John Lennon survived his assassination ?
5 #### Easy to learn , fun game to play ; the more players the longer the game .
5 #### My family and friends hate this game for some reason , but my girlfriend and I love it and play it together once or twice a week . We love the moral dilemmas involved : whom to let die , Hitler or Reagan ? It 's a real toss - up ( I usually choose Reagan ; I feel that he did more damage ) . I would n't bother with the expansions , as they will probably be more of the same , just with a few more cards . One of this type of game in your possesion is enough .
5 #### I first played this game about ten years ago with my friends as freshman in college . It 's a great game that takes a bit of time to understand the many rules , but once you do , you 'll get hooked . This newer addition has added Gadgets and a few other new cards to mix up the game . It 's easily a family game , but not for kids under 6 I would guess as the rules can be pretty complicated . It 's also a great way to enjoy elements of history and play with the ideas of how connected major events could be in history .
5 #### this is a great filler . You play a time traveler attempting to be the first to get home . There are three ways to win- collect specific artifacts , have ten cards in hand at the end of your turn , or meet specific timeline requirements . The third option is the core of the game . There are 32 time cards arrayed in a grid on the table . Each card represents a year . Some years can be directly modified by playing cards in your hand . These are called Linchpin cards . Flipping a Linchpin results in a change in history . What happens if Lincoln is n't assassinated ? Or the Challenger never blew up ? Each change in history has a ripple effect . Events in future years can be changes , creating paradoxes in time . These paradoxes can be " patched " with different events which the players can try to use to get home . If you like lots of card interaction , fun mechanics , and a game that takes about 15 - 20 minutes to play , this is a great choice .
5 #### My friends and I absolutely love this game . With endless amounts of game play , nothing gets boring about it . Highly recommended .
5 #### I got this as a gift for my brother because he loves Fluxx and loves Monty Python . We played it as a family and it was great ! ! The references were absolutely hilarious and made it that much more fun . My brother hates when the Keepers have abilities , so it 's good that very few here had them . He was fine with the number of Keeper abilities . There were kind of a lot of creepers though . More than any other version I 've played . But it 's okay , they were funny too . Highly recommend to Fluxx lovers who also love Monty Python !
5 #### My older tweens and young teens LOVE this game . I can see it holding their interest for a while to come . It plays like a board game but packs up small like a card game-- great to pack for trips . Buy along with Fluxx for younger kids or different moods , and everyone is happy !
4 #### Fluux ! Monty Python ! What a great combination . If you enjoy the comedic genius of the movie , you 'll get and enjoy the light - hearted game !
5 #### My husband and I love the fluxx card game . This one was ok for us not having seen the movie I did n't understand some of the cards .
5 #### My cousin got me into Fluxx not too long ago and we had a blast playing it . My wife purchased this for me , knowing I am a huge Monty Python fan as well as loving Fluxx . You do n't have to own the original Fluxx game , as this is a stand alone pack and has similar rules . The object of the game is to win , but the way you win constantly changes ... or is in flux . The number of cards you draw , or have to play , or have to discard changes . Rules change . Objectives change . The game can last an hour , or 2 minutes . It is a fun game and can even be played with two players . Throw in the irreverence of Monty Python and the craziness of the game elevates . On rule is you have to sing a part of a MP song to draw extra cards , or talk in an outrageous accent , or quote some lines from one of their skits or movie . This is a great game for any fan of Monty Python . I would definitely recommend this game for anyone that likes Monty Python , or just having fun in general .
5 #### Hits all the great spots of original FLUXX , but with the added greatness of Monty Python . What 's not to like ? It is very Holy Grail centric though . It 's probably 85 - 90 % Holy Grail and only a few cards referencing any of the Flying Circus movies .
5 #### This game is so fun and easy to play . Love how they have all kids of themes . TIS BUT A FLESH WOUND !
5 #### looking forward to playing this , monty p. is a huge favorite
5 #### Fun game for our group who can all appreciate the Monty Python brand of humor . Fun , easy to play and an all around good time with lots of laughs
5 #### It 's the fun of Fluxx with the references to Monty Python , what 's not to love ? It 's mostly based on " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " but there are a few more references to MP 's other sketches and movies . Unlike other Fluxx games , I ca n't say I would recommend just anyone to play the game . You have to be fairly versed in Monty Python to get any of the cards , at least enough to have seen Holy Grail ... probably multiple times . My husband does n't get as many of the jokes as I do and he certainly ca n't compete in the challenges that have you quoting from the movies or breaking out in your favorite Monty Python song . If you love Monty Python , buy this game . Even if you do n't know what Fluxx is , you 'll have a riot playing it ! Trust me .
3 #### My brother - in - law is a huge game fanatic and also a Monty Python fanatic . He introduced us to Monty Python Fluxx . My husband and I are both Monty Python fans but our kids are not there yet . They played this game with us but did n't really " get it " . For me , it was just " ok " . I was sold on the concept - enough that I bought my son Zombie Fluxx for Christmas and have actually looked at a couple of the other games - but even though I know and love Monty Python humor , this game really did n't do much for me . When we all get together , I always find myself hoping we 'll play Zombie Fluxx instead of Monty Python .
5 #### My grandson is enjoying this 3rd version of FLUXX ! Keeps him constantly thinking .
5 #### Fluxx is a really fun game in general . All the rules are on the cards . It 's very simple to learn and has a lot of replay value . Games can be quick 10 minutes or drag on for more . It depends on the people you play with and how strategic they are with playing cards in order . The addition of Monty Python references is a blast ! It 's hilarious . Definitely would recommend if you 're looking for a simple card game to enjoy with friends and you like Monty Python .
4 #### Fun game if you love monty python and strategy .
5 #### Pretty fantastic if you like Fluxx and Monty Python it 's a must .
5 #### We like to play this game with friends and family members who have some familiarity with Monty Python . ( For some reason everything about the game gets lost with those who do n't . ) We 've owned the game for three or four years now and it has brought us great fun and enjoyment . Because the rules keep changing during the course of the game , every game is different and it never gets boring . Sometimes we get a bit confused as to what rules are in play or how certain rules should be applied . But then one of us starts singing The Lumberjack Song or Eric the Half a Bee and we all have a good laugh . It makes for a great evening of entertainment .
5 #### The Fluxx games are all really fun , but if you are a Python fan this is a must have game . There are many references to the series and movies . If you have no love of outrageous accents , do n't know The Meaning of Life , or are n't ready for Something Completely Different , this game will frustrate and confuse you . If you can quote Python sketches , sing Python songs , and enjoy card games - you should enjoy this game .
5 #### " My son and I really enjoy this game . Although two player is not the best way to play , it 's still plenty entertaining . We like how well Monty Python and the Holy Grail " melds with the madcap nature of the game , so if you 're not a Monty Python fan , this game is not for you . If you have n't seen the movie , it wo n't make much sense , although the rules are clear enough . The movie 's a hoot , too , so watch it . This is a very silly game that can be played with a variable number of players . A worthwhile addition to game night for Monty Python fans .
5 #### Fluxx is such a great little game - portable and easy to learn , and the constantly changing factor keeps it always exciting . I own a number of the variants and they are all similarly great and each has it 's own quirkiness making it easy to enjoy them all . ( I keep a copy in my car , a copy in my house , and a copy in my " games night " bag ) People who are used to planning a few moves ahead will take a little longer to truly enjoy this game since the constant changing can mess up all their forward planning , but once you accept this unpredictability as a challenge in itself , then you can have some real fun with Fluxx . Definitely recommend Fluxx to anyone .
5 #### The family are huge fluxx fans , and huge monty python fans . This was a gift for the husband , but the kids enjoyed it just as much .
5 #### The wacky style of Fluxx works perfectly with the Monty Python theme . This is a great game with the family , but not as much with friends who are less aware of Monty Python .
5 #### My favorite Fluxx set . New rules will have you singing , reciting , and outrageous accenting Monty Python while you play !
3 #### If you would advertise yourself as a huge month python fan this game is for you , also if you play regularly with other huge MP fans then this game is for you . Otherwise its hard to play because most people do n't get the references . I would recommend to the majority of people to choose a broader topic version of Fluxx , like Pirates or Zombies or the Original .
5 #### We bought our Monty Python Fluxx game about three years ago . We bring it out to play whenever we have people over who have a passing interest or more in Monty Python . ( There are a surprising number of such people still around . ) Because the rules keep changing , every game is unique , which means it never gets boring . From time to time we get a little confused as to exactly what rules are in play or how we 're supposed to apply certain rules . But this little problem is more than made up for when one of us launches into a rendition of The Lumberjack Song or Eric the Half a Bee . It 's great fun and makes for a wonderful evening of entertainment .
4 #### Fun Game ! Love the ever changing aspect that FLUXX provides . It keeps everything interesting and you competing until the end . The theme deck is also great . Just make sure you are playing with fellow fans .
5 #### Great game for the fan of fluxx and Monty Python .
4 #### This game is fun once you get the hang of it and do n't have to look at the cards so closely . I think I 'd prefer the regular version or perhaps the pirate , as I 'm getting a little tired of the Monty - Python theme .
5 #### absolutely love it ... always included in our family game nite that we have every weekend ... would highly recommend it to all my friends
5 #### We 've had this game for a couple years now , and we bring it out whenever we have people over who have at least a passing interest in Monty Python . Because the rules keep changing as one plays the game , every game is truly different , which means it never gets boring . Occasionally we get a little confused as to exactly what rules are in play or how we 're supposed to apply certain rules . But this little problem is more than made up for when one of us launches into a rendition of The Lumberjack Song or Eric the Half a Bee . It 's great fun and makes for a wonderful evening of entertainment .
4 #### It 's a fun game . For monty python fans this is a good buy , not many games are out there based on their movies but this card game is one of them and brings fun to many family / friend events
5 #### I love fluxx . The version you play is pretty much pointless , there are some very slight differences in the versions but mainly it is just a matter of what kind of things you like as they basically just add flavor to the game . The ever changing rules make it a ton of fun . If you are on the fence I would say buy one with a theme that you like and give it a try , I would bet you will end up liking it enough to buy some other versions for a different theme .
5 #### If you love Fluxx and Monty Python then this game is for you all the humor of the movie is there and is priceless .
5 #### When asked what family game might be wanted this year , Fluxx ( although not Zombie , Basic , etc ... ) was the top choice . I think I bought 6 different Fluxx games , and I will only be reviewing this one . All of the games have been enjoyed by all .
3 #### There are many versions of fluxx and this one is pretty good . It 's funny since its themed to Monty Python . The game itself is n't the best but it is n't bad either . There are many other card games out there that are much better .
3 #### I love fluxx , but am wishing i bought the pirate one instead . Its hard to get folks to play this one unless they 've seen the movie . A more general fluxx ( pirates , regular , space etc ) might have been a better choice for my group of gaming friends . My Monty Python fan of a dad enjoyed playing it with us , and its not a bad game . I just think the other decks are better .
3 #### I own most of the Flux titles and though this is a lot of fun and very stylized for the Monty Python fan , it is also nearly impossible to win if you play with two . This is the only title that for some reason does not have a good balance of cards . I have played it with three or more and the game works fine , though three is also very long . The best thing about all of the Flux games is that sometimes the games can end really quickly and unexpectedly . This title just does n't work well with small groups . I still am happy I have it and I pull it out with larger groups of players , but I go back to the basic game , Zombies , Space , or Martians . This is defiantly not a bad review , but just letting you know that if you were thinking about buying this as a game for only a couple of players , I might say that you should look at the other titles first .
5 #### This game is great . I am an extremely competitive game player . This game is all about playing the game . The rules constantly change and how you win constantly changes and you have to constantly shift your strategy . Even as a cometitive player , I ca n't get mad when I lose ( I lose at Risk or Monopoly , I get mad at myself ) I have not played the other Fluxx games , but love Monty Python and this definitely honors the spirit of the Holy Grail . Very fun and very replayable . I would not say this toy is educational , but it does require thought and rule following .
5 #### My husband and my uncle love Monty Python and we have been playing Fluxx . I decided to get the expansion / game to have them play . They played it for hours and could not stop laughing and having a great time . Came at an awesome speed . Enjoy it ! !
5 #### fun fun game ! if you like fluxx and you like monty python this is totally for you ! i especially like that there 's a card that allows you to sing monty python songs ! :)
4 #### I bought this game because I 'm a fan of Monty Python & Fluxx . It usually sells for $ 15 , but this set with " free wooden box " was adveristed at $ 12 . What a bargin ! ! ( or so I thought .... ) It does n't qualify for free shipping and by the time I realized it I payed an additional $ 10 for shipping . So instead of $ 15 & free shipping , with an order over $ 25 , I paid $ 22 for just this one item . I should have bought the less expensive version and a second / different game . If you have n't played Fluxx before , you may want to try out the basic version first . The rules start out simple but change rapidily or " Fluxx " . It can be quite confusing at times . The Monty Python theme of this game is hilarious & is a favorite with my family and game group . If you buy this make sure to go get the seperate " Castle Expansion Pack " and " Sir Not Appearing In This Game Promo Card " . These are an additional seven cards that are awesome . You can generally find these on ebay for $ 5 total .
5 #### Of watching Monty Python movies in the summer time . I liked this game because it 's true to the MP movies and makes you remember lines from the movies and quoting them and even some singing . The singing was a bit silly , but it 's only on one or two cards and hey it 's fun ! Re play is high as well .
5 #### Me and my friends love this game . We get to work on outrageous accents and have some seriously silly good times .
5 #### This is a fantastic gift for any Monty Python fan . The cards are amazing and the game is absolutely hilarious .
4 #### Fluxx is a ridiculous card game that I always keep in my purse . Waiting for your dinner at a restaurant on a busy Saturday night ? You might just look over to see my husband and I playing a quick game of the original Fluxx while we 're waiting for our meal ! Monty Python Fluxx is a fun way to incorporate one of our favorite TV / movie franchises into our card game ritual . However , it 's unlikely we 'll be taking this one out and about , though we do play it weekly at our home . The one thing that keeps this game at home , and not in my purse , is that it seems to take slightly ( 15 - 20 minutes ) longer to play . I do n't know if it is the nature of the Python - specific Creeper cards designed to sandbag you from winning , or if some of the rules are just different enough from the basic game to make gameplay more complex , but my husband and I have yet to play a game of Monty Python Fluxx that takes shorter than 25 minutes . If you 're a Python fan or a collector of Fluxx games , then pick this up - it 's a definite addition that you need for your collection ! But if this is your introduction to the world of Fluxx ( and Looney Labs in general ! ) then I suggest trying the base Fluxx deck first and see how fun and quick of a time waster it can be for waiting rooms and crowded restaurants !
5 #### Being a huge Monty Python fan is probably a requirement to buy this game , but any familiarity will make it fun to play . We have planed this game several times with two players and they are usually short games . I can imagine that a full table playing this would draw it out , but it would be even more crazy . I do n't think there is more than a half dozen cards that are uniquely Pythonesque ( like giving a bonus if you speak with a funny accent ) , but the game makes good use of the theme , drawing mostly from from Flying Circus and Holy Grail . My favorite card is " The Animator " which depicts Terry Gilliam at his drawing desk !
4 #### I love anything related to Monty Python and this game does not let down on that front at all , every card is related to Monty Python . If you like games that basically have no strategic point and almost no ability to predict what is going to happen at all then you will like this game . If you like strategy and planning you will be frustrated by the randomness in this game . It is hilarious and if you have a fun game group you will like this ! Fun .
4 #### Be sure to brush up on your Monty Python before you play this version of the Fluxx card game ! It would really help to watch at least one Monty Python movie first , as there may be a couple of times you 'll have to sing a song or recite lines of dialogue . And if you or ANY of your fellow players do n't know anything about Monty Python , forget it . Simply choose another version of Fluxx , because playing Fluxx is supposed to be fun for everybody . Note that this Fluxx version is for a slightly older age range and will likely take a bit longer than other versions just because of the Monty Python aspects and the inevitable arguments that will take place as to whether " Ni ! " is actually a line of dialogue . ;-)
3 #### This is officialiy the weirdest game I have ever encountered . But it can be a very fun game . Fluxx is a card game that ever changing rule and goals . Most of this game is based on the luck of the draw . The Fluxx card game has many different versions you can buy and one of them is the Monty Python version . There are some great quotes and artistic depictions of the Monty Python movies included in the game . It mostly refers to the Monty Python and the Holy Grail movie . So if you like Monty Python , you do n't mind a game that has ever changing rules and goals , and you like luck , then you will probably love this game .
5 #### Some of the cards in Monty Python Fluxx have you performing songs or quotes from the movie , so it really pays to be nuts for Monty Python . The other Fluxx games do n't seem to have such a strong dependency on knowing a certain subject well , so this is " hard Fluxx " in my opinion . It 's still lots of fun , and I have had quite a bit of practice with my sparrow quotes and singing the Lumberjack song after playing a few games of this . Great fun !
4 #### another fluxx game to play . cards are colorful . slow start , when you learn how to play , it gets easier and more fun .
4 #### This is definitely a family game and we 're glad the logic behind the actions that take place actually makes sense . Being about environmental issues , Eco Fluxx cards highlight the interdependence of species and the importance of environmental quality . Overall , it 's much more educational than we thought it would be . two thumbs up for families with kids , especially .
5 #### You have only one rule : pick up a card , place one down . By doing this , you will end up making the goal of the game ( such as : You win by having A_Card and B_Card out on the table ) . This game can last 5 minutes up to a really long time ( Game says 40 ) . Same as the original but with a nature spin on it ! !
5 #### A great game . So glad I got it . Much more to strategize than any Fluxx game I have and still lots of fun .
4 #### Love Fluxx . I only docked it a star because it 's not as good as Star Fluxx , Pirate Fluxx or my personal favorite Zombie Fluxx . Still fun , and family friendly .
3 #### This is a fun little " filler " game , but in my opinion Eco the least enjoyable of the Fluxx themes . Still , it 's pretty good and also proceeds go to a good cause . Win - win !
5 #### This timeline add - on to the award winning game Chrononauts , brings the timeline up to the year 2008 . It also include 3 new character IDs .
3 #### This is only ok , 2 of the 3 the expanded identities only work with these new cards , so playing them in the game will quickly establish your identity to your opponents . I would tell others to pass on this .
5 #### We love this game . It 's easy and fun and we like the facts about the environment .
5 #### I 'm a fan of the original fluxx and this version is fun . lots of goal cards which irks my husband a bit but we still enjoy it
5 #### I love it . My granddaughters ( 7 and 11 ) - not so much . We do n't compete - just make up our words and try to insert them . You can use whatever tiles are left to make up your words . They like that and I assume they are learning new words and spelling them . We tried using the 11 year old spelling words hoping that would give her another way to look at them . That did n't go well and I had to look for where she hid the banana . In the past we had an apple - same idea . Do n't have that at this house . I recommend the game - just make up your own rules .
5 #### Our kids and I love to play this game ! Its a classic that never gets old . Easy to take along on trips as well .
5 #### First started playing this game with grandkids nearly 10 years ago - such a great vocabulary builder & spelling tool - very fun even for beginning readers ! Now more of our grandkids are having fun while they do n't even realize they 're learning . Great game
5 #### Great word game for kids and adults alike ! I love that its easy to take on the go .
5 #### A fantastic fast pick - me - up game ! If you do a game night this is great for a first - off game to get things started . Many reviews on here say that the tiles received were the cheap , hollow , plastic pieces but I received the full , solid , heavy tiles that are best used for this game .
5 #### This game is so much fun and I love that it comes in a little banana bag so it 's small and easy to store . Great for traveling .
4 #### This is a nice game that can be taken on trips easily and something the whole family can enjoy .
5 #### This is a great game for people looking for a fast - paced , mildly intellectual game . I 'm not a huge fan of all the banana terminology you have to use in the game but it is called bananagram , so you have to kind of expect it .
5 #### Love scrabble ? You sort of make up your own board against other players in this game . Use the tiles and simply create words . Great learning tool . Competitive and fun .
4 #### I got this for a Christmas present for a young niece . Although she felt challenged she did want to play it over again . I think unlike Scrabble the idea that you can make your own board is helpful for the younger kids since they are working with their own vocabulary and spelling .
5 #### Probably one of the best family games I know . Try out the Double version if you have large groups ( over 4 ) .
5 #### Great game for my husband and me . Keeps our minds sharp and thinking of words not normally used on a daily basis . It can be challenging !
5 #### Nice and compact game . . .very portable for a picnic or a train ride or touring the country .
4 #### great game , just wished kids would have played it more
5 #### grandson loves making up words to spell . will help him with learning to read .
5 #### This is a fun game for settling down / getting ready for bed . It is quiet and can be played by anyone who can spell . Players a range and rearrange their letter tiles into interlocking words . I played it twice with adults and six or seven times with children . What I like about the game is the creative destruction . Bananagrams is GREAT for helping kids understand " happy accidents . " I have a child who beats himself up over mistakes . In this game , you have to take apart in order to build .
5 #### We LOVE to play this game with my parents and my children . It 's so much fun . My mother has this game at her house so we got this for mine . Fast shipping and no issues . Ca n't wait to play again !
5 #### The only game I like . I 'm not into games and this is the only one I actually enjoy playing .
3 #### Note : this is the version with cheap plastic pieces instead of ceramic . I did n't know there were different versions until I bought this one and found out .
5 #### If you 're into word games , Bananagrams is really fun .
4 #### Love the game , but was disappointed with the quality of the tiles this time which were hollow underneath . I have purchased several games in the past and the tiles were solid and smooth on the back instead of being hollowed out . Sad to see the quality of the product cut . I ca n't believe the savings amounted to much .
5 #### Friends introduced us to this game , and we really enjoyed it ! There are several ways you can play it , and we made up our own .
1 #### Very disappointed in these tiles ! They 're hollow - nothing like Bananagrams tiles from other games I 've played .
5 #### Love this game & it 's a hit with the fam !
5 #### We 're enjoying this game so far ! I also do n't mind that these are n't the " original " tiles ; they have the holes in the back BUT they make flipping the tiles over so easy . It 's nice playing this game with the kids instead of having electronics on .
5 #### We do n't play by the rules , but everyone loves building crosswords from these letter tiles . It 's great for kids who are learning to read and spell and fun for the family to do together .
5 #### Fantastic ! ! This is a really fun game ! ! My girls are home schooled and this is a great game for spelling ! ! Would recommend ! ! Love the little banana pouch ! By the way the ones I received are the real deal ! ! They are not knock offs . Solid heavy pieces .
5 #### This game is a lot of fun for a small group .
5 #### This is a game my ( 4th/5th grade ) students play and they love it . You can play the normal rules , or develop your own . My students even like just using the tiles to spell words and sentences as a " word work " activity .
5 #### Our family loved playing banagrams when we received it as a gift . Then my 87 year old Mom and her friends discovered that it 's fun to have the tiles handy when working on word jumbles . Moving the tiles around is good for dexterity , and it 's fun to see the words form from the movable tiles .
5 #### Love this game that I played at my sisters so I bought one for me and one for my best friend ! !
5 #### I love this word game . It works well as the game with directions inside , but it is easy to dream up your own solitaire challenges , too . Accompanying books for sale with Bananagrams in the title offer more challenges to enjoy using these tactilely pleasing letter tiles .
5 #### This is a great way to teach children to read . They love making up all the words . It 's a fun game , harder than you think , but you get the hang of it quickly . Great vocabulary builder .
5 #### Great Game , Love that it fits in a pocket and can be traveled with !
4 #### This was purchased as a gift for a friend . I added it to her " Little Box of Sunshine " . It looks like a fun game - kinda ' reminds me of Boggle ...
5 #### Fun for all ages ! Compact and light for packing along on a trip . Have bought two and plan to buy a third as a gift later this year .
5 #### I love everything crossword , scrabble , words with friends . Bananagrams is among my favorite word games .
5 #### A different version of scrabble that 's so much fun ! Great game for family & friends !
5 #### My grandson loved this and is learning how to spell because of it .
5 #### It is a great game for kids and adults alike . Comes in a fun banana sac . Ca n't go wrong with this if you are into these types of games . This is a word - game classic like Scrabble or Boggle . Pieces are solid and seem like they will hold up for years . The handy pouch they come in seems sturdy enough to also hold up for years of fun . This is a family game night favorite in our house .
5 #### This was a new game for Christmas . I loved it more than hubby and my 6 year old . Maybe because I love board games and challenging fun !
5 #### This game is only fun if you get the right crowd . Some people hate " thinking " games when they 're drinking . Half my friends did n't want to touch it and the other half vowed to come back and play it another time . This is like scrabble but faster and more fun in my opinion . I also did n't play by the exact rules . We divided the tiles evenly amongst the players and then just played until no one had any tiles left . Helps to have less rules when you 're drinking .
3 #### A fun game . Well made tiles . Cute carrying case . Ages 8 and up .
5 #### This is a great game . I have played with 2 - 8 players . It was fun every time . The game is shorter with more players , but it is still fun . This uses similar skills to Scrabble , but the game play is different . The best part of Bananagrams is that everyone is playing at the same time . You never have to wait for your turn . It makes the game much more fun .
5 #### I love this game . It is faster paced than Scrabble and so much fun . I got it to help get my kids spelling and putting words together , as well as for myself because it makes you think .
4 #### Very good game and has some learning built into it as well , kids will never know .
5 #### Love this game and own several copies . This one was a gift for my mom , who loves to play solitaire with the tiles . Ingenious game , will play it forever !
5 #### This is so much fun and packaging is perfect for travel . Great for a wide range of ages because you can make it as simple or as complicated as you want . Sneaky way to get my kid broadening his vocabulary
4 #### Love this game , lots of fun . No idea why my husband thought it would be a good idea to bring to the delivery room in the hospital , but other than that I 've enjoyed every time I 've played .
3 #### Cute set for people who like playing with crosswords and puzzles .
5 #### Fun past time with many variations so you never get bored . Also an excellent way to hone your word skills and expand your vocabulary
5 #### Great game for word lovers . Quick game - does n't take too much time per round .
4 #### I really like Scrabble and word games but this was just not as fun as I was hoping . Players must yell out words associated with bananas based on their actions , and this quickly became annoying . My husband and I both have expansive vocabularies that range across different languages and it was unclear which words were passable and which were not . Maybe this game is more for children .
5 #### Love to play this game with my family and friends .
5 #### I use this for spelling practice at home with my autistic boy , he is 11 . We have to practice our spelling words so using the banana makes it really fun . My 4 year old just likes to play with the letters , she is at that age where letters are so cool . I have not played the game so wo n't comment on it . The banana bag is well made and very durable . The zipper is well made also and I can tell this will last a long time . There are plenty of each letter included . I can take this banana with me easily since it is rather small . At first I thought the price was steep for something so simple but now I see its worth . Pictures included .
5 #### Fun game for two players up to many more ! We enjoyed playing with a bottle of wine and some yummy apps nearby .
5 #### Have n't played it yet , but looks like a fun game
5 #### I bought this word game for my mother - in - law for her birthday . She is literally obsessed with Words with Friends , So I figured that this might be a game she would enjoy . It took me months to get her to play it with me , she thought it seems intimidating . However , Bananagrams it actually really simple and fun to play ! I loved it and so did she . If you love word games this is a great family friendly game !
5 #### Bought this game for my son for valentines . He is in 2nd grade . SO much more fun and better than scrabble Jr.
5 #### This is such a fun game ! It is kinda like scrabble , but not . Everyone has their own tiles and has to spell words as quick as possible . It 's a great game for kids in jr high / high school as well as adults .
5 #### This is a great take on scrabble . No longer do you have to wait two hours for you brother to decide the best combination of letters to get 10 points . Lots of fun for the competitive family .
5 #### get it you want be sorry . I carry it with me on the road I stay in hotels a lot for work and I can spend time working on improving my spelling I have never been the best but am always trying to improve on it . my 20 year old and her friends love it to and have gotten hooked by it . she got a set for herself because I keep mine in my go bag for work . try there other games to for younger ages .
5 #### I played this with some friends and immediately became addicted to this game . It is so fun . I could play for hours . I love playing with my daughters who are 9 and 7 . I help them a bit but not too much . I am amazed at some of the words they come up . It 's great for learning to spell and I love it so much ! !
5 #### Super fun for word nerds . You do n't have to be good at crossword puzzles to play this . You just need to figure out the words that are possible with the random letters you select , then spell them out in a crossword puzzle - like fashion . Loads of fun with my sisters ; not so much with my math brain husband .
5 #### Prompt shipping and product as described . Would use this reseller again .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Bananagrams ! This game is fun for Scrabble lovers and non - lovers alike . It 's very portable , so perfect for bringing on vacation or to a friend 's house . If you want a long game , you can play a bunch of consecutive rounds , but if a short game is more up your alley you can limit it to just one or two rounds . This game is great for all ages , and even very young children enjoy playing with the letters ( even if they ca n't yet read or spell ) !
5 #### Got this for a gift for my mom because I hate scrabble ( I always lose ) , and she loves scrabble . So naturally she loves this ! You can play it with just one player so it is a fantastic game if you like games but ca n't get others to join you . Multiple times now however , when playing with a group of people , we 're found that you can get stuck and then you just are stuck the entire game ( bad luck . Same thing could happen in scrabble as well ) Also it 's funny because you can easily cheat along the way but when you get to the end they will find out !
2 #### Played twice . eh . not impressed . Maybe you have to be a Scrabble kind of person to play . Word games are n't my favorite except for Words with Friends . I do like the little banana case though . Easy to store .
3 #### We have only played this once . I really like the challenge but it is not one of my 7 yr old 's favorite games . It is made of good quality .
4 #### Fun game that I have had for awhile . Bought this copy for a relative who was recuperating from surgery .
5 #### I love this game . Everyone either loves or hates this game . It can get a little stressful and overly competitive as everyone is yelling " peel , " but it 's a blast ! I love how portable it is . We bring it whenever we travel .
5 #### hello , bananagrams is a fun game for everyone . we are scrabble aficionados , but carrying around a large box was not very handy . this game is held in a neat yellow banana that can fit into most women 's medium size purses or in anyone 's bookbag . now , we can play anywhere . the game idea is just about the same as regular scrabble , but there is no board , just crosswords . yes , some people said to purchase a used scrabble set to just use the numbered letter cubes , but we wanted something different . there is a larger version of the bananagram game that has more letters , so , that will be our next purchase . we will just have to buy a larger purse to keep this larger yellow banana secure . ha ... an outstanding game with very fast delivery .
5 #### This game is SO much fun . My husband and I enjoy playing and I always throw it in my bag when we 're eating out with our family- my 7 and 6 year old love it , too- it 's the perfect thing to keep them still in their chairs while we 're waiting for our food . We also play a hangman version of it- so nice not to have paper and pen everywhere . Plus , it 's so stimulating for the kids , I love how it 's helping their spelling and reading skills all while hidden in a game ! !
5 #### This is a lot more fun than Scrabble . Besides being fun , it 's also great for learning vocabulary and spelling .
5 #### This is a double game , and lots of fun . Easy to play anywhere with open space ( table , floor , sidewalk ) and small so easy to pack and take with you . My teenager liked it enough she stole it to take to college with her .
5 #### This game is amazing . I live in a dorm with 50 teenagers . This is a great way to get the kids together for a game night . If you like scrabble , you will probably LOVE this game . All skill levels can play this . I ca n't resist getting in on the game when the kids play .
5 #### Fun for the whole family ! You do not have to be the smartest or the oldest to win ;) It will help kids build a better vocabulary and help with spelling . In our family , if you use a word you have to know what it means ... not just how to spell it .
5 #### My 8 year old has fun playing this with me
5 #### Bought for my then 8 year old . Big hit . We all play on family game nights . Helps broaden his vocabulary and spelling . Much like Scrabble , but more kid friendly .
5 #### Brought this for my Dad to use when visiting Mom in the nursing rehab ...
5 #### My husband and I love this game ! It 's great for just two people or a big group ! Everyone should have this game ! My six year old loves to play with us too and really am amazed how well she can build words . Plus I love games that do n't require a big box . We store this in a kitchen drawer .
4 #### I 'm 68 - having a great time playing . I 'm a lousy speller so most of the time at a disadvantage . I 've never really won like I think I have due to misspelled words . Despite an almost no win record it 's still fun and I like the speed . We 've reworked the rules to include abbreviations which helps adult beginners enormously and I use the cell phone / google to look up words faster than I can flipping through a dictionary . Google can decipher my spelling and get me where I want to go .
5 #### A fun game that can go anywhere with you . Does n't take up much room in luggage or purse . I went out of town for one night and my sister brought this along with her . We played for hours and when I got home I immediately ordered myself one . I even play by myself at night for practice .
5 #### Such a fun game ! ! Ca n't find it in most stores and if you do it 's much more money ! Definitely a must have for people who love word games !
5 #### We love Bananagrams . We 've played it at my sister 's house many times , so we finally bought one of our own . The game we received is of great quality and just like the one she has . We love the packaging - simple but cute . Bananagrams - it 's like a personal game of scrabble , where you make your own scrabble board using the letters you draw . The idea is to finish your board before anyone else finished theirs . It 's very addicting ! We stay up late into the night once we get started with this game .
5 #### love this . play with son all the time . For hands on kids this is really good choice .
5 #### Just what we needed to teach our granddaughter to spell new words . It 's a great teaching tool .
5 #### This is a really fun game . Honestly we would just use Scrabble pieces for a similar game called " Go " which ads a new challenge with the numbers on each tile . This version is fun for a more laid back game .
5 #### Exactly what I expected and for a great price ! Bananagrams is a great game to play while on the road . The bag is compact enough to put into my purse when makes it very convenient when traveling .
5 #### Oh my gosh , such a fun game ! ! Perfect for the whole family to play or with friends . We have a 6 year old who 's learning to put words together , and this is a great game even for him to play ! Lots of fun ! ! !
5 #### Ridiculously addictive and can be played in many different ways . You can play it the standard banana grams way or you can try variations where you can ' steal words from other people ' . Really , the game is a bag of word blocks . What you choose to do with them is really up to you . The price for the banana is good because it has a lot of letters in it . I think it holds more than the apple and the pear version do . You will have fun with this game if you like games that are similar to Scrabble . It involves speed and some vocab . You can getaway though with knowing less words than in Scrabble . All you need to be able to do is spell the few words you do know correctly quickly .
5 #### Such a fun game- quick and easy to transport ! We bring it on vacations and family weekends all the time . The rules are easy to teach to friends and kids can even play along !
3 #### If you 're looking for a quick game versus the chess - like Scrabble , this fits the bill . Each player gets their tiles and must race to get rid of them by forming words in the communal space , swapping out letters if needed when stumped . The product itself is fine . The letters are of good quality , and the banana bag is made of sturdy cloth . It 's a quick , entertaining game . Nothing wrong with it , the 3 - star rating is just personal preference for Scrabble .
4 #### Fun game especially for anyone that enjoys scrabble and other word games . It has been the most fun playing with groups all approximately the same age so that vocabulary and reflexes are similar . I appreciate the cute banana shaped case to hold all the pieces as it does not take up much space , is sturdy , and prevents the loss of pieces .
5 #### My 8 and 10 year olds have loved it !
5 #### This game is so much fun ! Everyone in my family has a set . I bought this and Double Bananagrams . If you like scrabble , you will love this game .
5 #### This is a great family game ! Lots of fun for all of us !
5 #### these are really great , loads of fun with the grand kids
5 #### The new Scrabble , but hey it 's what they want now .
4 #### and give up too soon on this fun game .. I need to learn it better , though .
5 #### Highly recommend for any family game night ! Love to give this as a gift too ! All age groups enjoyed this .
5 #### Very fun game . Even for my 7 year old grandson .
5 #### This is a fun game . Works great to help the younger ones work on spelling and learn new words .
5 #### What fun ! Even early readers can compete with Grandparents in this game !
5 #### Fun game , especially with a bunch of people . Love scrabble so I knew I would love this .
5 #### After reading all the great reviews , I purchased this for a family Christmas gathering . What a fun game it was to play ! It was a big hit with everyone .
5 #### easy to travel with , games are fast paced and exciting competition , can be frustrating when you have to rebuild because of one or two letters - but that ' the whole challenge !
5 #### We really enjoy this game . Sometime with the little kids we also use the tiles to play sight word Bingo . Very versatile and fun .
5 #### Love the game but hard for my 6 year old . I would say 3rd grade and higher . My 3rd grader is 8 and does well . But if you have someone under 3rd grade I would do the Appplegrams !
5 #### This is a really fun game to pay with kids , and helps them expand their word inventory .
5 #### What can I say about Bananagrams that has n't already been said ? If you love word games and fast - paced play , you ca n't go wrong with this one .
5 #### This was requested by my daughter in - law as a aid to her Home Schooling my grandkids . They love word games and this looks like it will be fun as well as educational .
5 #### Fun scrabble for one or several . A different twist from traditional Scrabble .
5 #### This game is similar to Scrabble , but much faster paced and with nearly zero interaction with other players . I strongly recommend it as long as you know what type of game experience you want to have .
5 #### Such a fun game ! Ca n't get enough of it . My husband and I love to play as well as the whole family ! The tiles are slightly larger than what my friend 's bananagram tiles are but I believe that they have stopped making them in the smaller size . The tiles are in sturdy plastic with large letters etched into them and are easy to maneuver . Overall , makes for excellent entertainment
5 #### This game knows exactly what it is ... which is a bag of Scrabble tiles minus the Scrabble board but disguised in a banana sack ... but it 's still fun , and I 'd recommend it to anyone because word games are fun . 5/5 , just buy it
5 #### Christmas gift for hubby - should help us both in the mind game department !
5 #### Great game . Nice feel to the tiles and the bag . Ready to expand to the double set . If you 're a word gamer or board gamer , this is one you should n't miss ... best part ? You do n't need a board ! Just the bag of tiles and a flat surface .
4 #### lots of fun to do alone or with others
5 #### I love this game . Prefer it to scrabble because it 's more simply in play , also the individual game play is more fun than playing on a group surface ( although if you do want to play a group game , you could of course alter the rules and directions to do so ) . Really easy to get started , clean up , take camping or on vacations etc . 5 stars (:
5 #### Fun game , a hit with our family ! Super cute banana case with zipper for storage .
5 #### Our favorite game ! Perfect for families and great at parties with kids of all ages !
5 #### We are huge scrabble fans , so I was not sure that we would play this much . It is different and fun though . We usually bring it with us on trips as it is small and packs easily . Also the games go fast so it is fun !
5 #### So much better than Scrabble . We play this in summer to keep up our learning . Great fun !
5 #### Really fun game to play on your own or with a huge group of friends . Gave this to my mother in law for her birthday and it was a hit !
5 #### Love bananagrams ! We give this as a small gift often ! Such fun !
5 #### I own 2 of these Bananagram games . It 's my favorite game . If you think Scrabble and Words with Friends is fun , check this game out . ( I wo n't play conventional Scrabble ever again . ) My niece and I play for hours . ( It can be addictive . ) There are variations you can play of this game too . I like playing with 4 or more people for a faster pace . We played at work on our lunch hour . Lots of fun !
5 #### We love this game though we modified the rules slightly so that you ca n't call " PEEL " two times in a row . With that change , the pace slows down a bit and gets everyone a little more involved . But it 's fast - paced and fun .
5 #### Love this game . You take tiles to create words . Unlike scrabble you are building your own grid of words . I do like the fact that no one can mess io a good word you have planned .
5 #### I use this in my 4th grade classroom and my kids love it ! It would be great if the game had some word examples in it to help the kids start to build their words .
5 #### My complaint about scrabble has always been that it takes forever and it 's super frustrating . I know , I know , some people say challenging , but I never really enjoyed it . I always felt like I should enjoy scrabble more since I love vocabulary type games , but I never really had fun when I sat down to play . Then we got a bananagram set and in less than two months we 've played more than 15 times with friends we 've had over or just between ourselves . It 's deceptively simple and tons of fun . We 've won over skeptical friends too -- everyone who has tried it has had fun . Some friends who came to visit actually went home and immediately ordered themselves a set of bananagrams ( and promptly gave their scrabble board to Goodwill ! ) I consider this a really good investment .
5 #### My sister came for a visit . She had played this game with friends and wanted one for herself . She was wondering where she could buy it , so I ordered it from Amazon & we had it in two days . It 's fun & really makes you think .
5 #### This is a great group game ! I love that it is so compact too , not like the big box games that take up so much space even though they do n't fill their box .
5 #### This is a new fun game for our family . My cousins ages 20 - 30 love to get a group of 4 - 8 people at a table to play a game . Fast paced and exciting . Lots of laughing .
5 #### This is a fabulous game that makes you use your brain , be competitive , think outside the box , and be open to changing things if words need to be changed . Be aware of sellers however , I bought mine from Lucky Couple and it was counterfeit so definitely review the seller comments !
5 #### Cute game , great for kids too young to play scrabble and you do n't have to keep score . It is fun and easy to carry .
5 #### this is a very fun game that travels easily . My 13 year old , my 15 year old and I love playing this . It 's also competitive , educational and so much fun .
5 #### Love this game so much we bought two sets so we could have a longer game . Kids love this game too .
4 #### This is such a fun game for all of my family- adult children and grand children . We even take it on trips to play at our motel .
5 #### Better than scrabble if you are not a real competitive scrabble player cuz you each get your own set . A lot of luck of course depending on tiles you get . But works your brain and even some dexterity . Get it .
4 #### Great game and packaged to take with you on trips . Lots of fun . Plan to give a few of these away as presents .
5 #### Our kids enjoy this game . It is perfect for travel , too ! People who enjoy spelling , would enjoy Banagrams . This is a great game for the classroom , too ! A great way to practice spelling in a fun way !
4 #### This is a fun game the entire family can enjoy , and its also a lot of fun for just the adults to have a good round of fun . Its not bulky and you do n't need a board , and I like how you can throw the letters in the bag to take with you while traveling with the family . Sure , Scrabble has the name recognition and is very structured , but the convenience and portability of this game works well .
5 #### Simple and fun game . Does n't take long to play ... perfect for small parties . Not the best with word games , but banana grams I can handle :)
5 #### Great travel game . Helps teach how to spell and combine words and kids have fun creating their own games out of it since there are really no rules .
5 #### What a simple concept and so much fun - our family loves this game ! This is a fun gift for adult kids .
5 #### My daughter got this game when she was 7 , and we 've enjoyed it off and on for the past couple of years . I would say 7 is about the youngest .... as kids learn to spell more words correctly , this game gets easier .
5 #### I purchased this game because I 'm not a huge fan of scrabble but enjoy word games . I was pleased to see how fun it can be as well as the variety of games you can play with it . The base game involves a lot of chaos and interaction between the players and is a riotous , good time . The game - type that I enjoy the most is detailed in the rules as , " Banana Smoothie " and is much more relaxed and easy - going . ( The base game involves picking up new tiles and yelling out , " PEEL " when you need to grab more tiles and every other player will follow suit thereby increasing the amount of letters in their collection ... in Banana Smoothie you evenly divide up the tiles at the beginning of the game and the first player to finish wins . ) Anyway , great game and a nice learning tool for kids I would imagine .
5 #### Easy to play and the more you play , the more fun it gets . Some of the words folks come up with are a scream .....
5 #### I really enjoy playing this game with the kids . It 's a Scrabble type game without the hassle of having to get out a board and count points .
5 #### If you like word games , you must get this ! ! It is FUNTASTIC ! ! And one of the BIG BIG benefits is how easily it travels . All the pieces you need fit neatly into this bag which happens to be the size and shape of a ........ banana ! !
5 #### My son loves loves loves this game . It 's so simple and does n't feel competitive . Even my 5 yr old loves to build words with it . It 's great for the whole family , for bringing on vacation , or for increasing sight word exposure for young kids .
5 #### Bananagrams is so versatile . We do play the game the way it 's intended to be played , but we also break them out for sight word review , leaving messages for others . Our Elf on the Shelf even gets into it before Christmas , leaving notes for the kids saying , " Behave Yourselves " and things like that . Totally love this and the bag included for storage is VERY appreciated .
5 #### My 20 to 30 year old children loved this game when I gave them all one for Christmas . Compact and fun
5 #### I bought this as a gift and she loved it , my daughter and I went out and came back and my hub and her were playing . It 'll be a great game to take camping , everything stores in the pouch , takes no room and she 's learning and having fun at the same time .
5 #### Got as a gift for my granddaughter . It 's a nice game for kids and adults . Nice ice breaker or warm up game .
4 #### Bananagrams the game is ok , not great . I guess some people like it , but it 's not my cup of tea . What this is to me is a great set of tiles in a portable bag . I use the tiles to play another game , Snatch - It . Snatch - It is a much better game than Bananagrams , but it comes with terrible tiles . They 're harder to read , and there 's not nearly enough vowels . Buy Bananagrams , buy Snatch - It , use the Bananagrams tiles with the rules from Snatch - It .
1 #### I 've played Bananagrams with my family for years and loved it- now that my husband and I are on our own I wanted to get a set for us for Christmas- I ordered from Amazon and just received it and I am dismayed to find that I got a counterfeit set- I did n't read the reviews before purchasing because I knew I liked the product , but I feel let down that Amazon let sellers sell a counterfeit item . I feel like I 'm going to pay more in shipping to return it than I paid for the item to myself . Such a waste of money- the tiles are cheap plastic ( probably made in china with all sorts of chemicals in them ) , hollow on the back and the printing of the letters is horrible . I am so very disappointed right now .
5 #### My husband and I love scrabble and are very competitive so this is a super fun game for us to play .
5 #### Combined 2 games and played a massive Bananagrams game with friends . Would definitely recommend this for grade school to adult ' word makers ' !
5 #### Not much I can say about Bananagrams other than it is a great quick , easy and fun game . Takes little storage space and wordsmiths get a kick out of it .
5 #### I got this for my grandson to help him with spelling words and making his words that he needs to learn for school . He is in first grade and he is learning to build his words by picking out the letters . The carrying case is wonderful and it can be taken where ever you go . Well made too and the letters are smooth and not rough .
5 #### My wife and I continuously return to Bananagrams for its originality and speed . Players are given several letters and make words out of the all the given existing letters upon which the player says , " Peel . " Every player receives several new letter tiles until they are likewise used up in words and the player says , " Peel . " The process continues until all the tiles from the draw pile are gone , when the first player to use all the letters says , " Bananagrams " instead of " Peel . " Game over . The game requires quick problem solving , a wide vocabulary , the ability to adapt , and the ability to start over if you ca n't fit in the newly acquired tiles . It 's lots of fun amongst two people or a large group of friends ; it does n't become boring ; and it is fast if you have a hankering for a quick word game ! Any family or guest - entertainer needs it !

5 #### This is such a fun game ! Moves quickly and encourages kids to stretch their vocab a bit . Playing with only adults can get ugly though , so competitive ! !
5 #### This was a gift for my eight year old daughter . She loves games . This is a great family friendly game that is challenging but fun . If you like scrabble and you like crossword puzzles , this combination is intriguing . You get the spelling challenge of scrabble without the necessary time commitment . This game moves quickly and keeps the brain engaged .
5 #### I had never heard of this game before until a co - worker introduced me to it . I must say that it awesome . It reminds me of that card game speed . Each person gets a set of tiles and when when everyone is ready you flip over your tiles , face up , and start making crosswords out of them . You can exchange out one time but you have to take 3 from the community pile and every time someone gets close to finishing everyone else has to pick up an extra tile and this goes on and on until the tiles run out or someone yells " Bananagram ! " Then the fun begins with seeing what everyone else came up with . This game was loads of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Scrabble and/or Boggle .
5 #### This is a great game for game nights or just simply when you and a friend want to pass time . It is great for picnics as well . Similar to scrabble but without all the points ! Just a fast paced word game .
5 #### My family loves this game . Every person we have introduced it to has gone out and purchased it a few days after leaving our house ! It 's fun for two players , and even more fun with friends . * Can be easily turned into a drinking game .. BEERnanagrams ;)
4 #### If not for the extra words , buy it for the awesome packaging . Check out that lumberjack !
5 #### This game has taken our family by storm . Everybody enjoys it - from 7 to 70 . It is not , however , a game that lends itself to conversation - way too intense and fast - moving . We now have a number of them , and play tournament - style when the number of participants permits .
3 #### We tried this game several times , but it was not my family 's favorite . We keep going back to regular Scrabble . However , you can play this game much faster .
5 #### Cute kit , tons of words and themes available . I bought the dog version for my fiance for his birthday since we share a dog . We 've had a good time writing poems and our friends play with it when they are over .
5 #### So cute ! Great give away for dog rescue events
5 #### I purchased this as a stocking stuffer and it was a huge hit ! What a great little game to keep at the house or use for travel . Can be played with several different players . Great idea ! !
5 #### My wife loves to play Scrabble , but I think it is slow and boring . This game allows us to play a similar style game , but make it much more fun and fast paced . I love having to think quickly and creatively in my word choices . Tons of fun for two or more people . We usually take less tiles than recommend to make the game a little more fun and fast paced . I look forward to being able to use this when my son gets old enough to help him practice vocabulary words for school . I know many language arts teachers who use this in their class to make vocab . more fun !
5 #### More fun for the office break room and the huge whiteboard or fridge
5 #### Love this game . It is fun and quick . The rules can be tweaked to keep it fun and interesting . I highly recommend !
5 #### Good quality for the price , we 've moved them around a bit without any tearing , ripping or ridges . I got this for my 7 year old and had to take out the words " aphrodisiac " and " virgin " until she 's a bit older . They do get lost easily under the fridge , but that 's to be expected . This set does have a great number of sentences you can make , probably a good 6 line story .
5 #### REALLY enjoying Bananagrams ! I understand that it 's actually a " game " , but I like having it around to pass the time in the day ... waiting for water to boil or laundry to finish . It 's fun to just grab a handful of letters and put together whatever words come to mind . It 's like my own portable crossword puzzle ... no pencil required ;) On an alternative " game " side of it ... my six - year - old daughter and I like creating a giant grid of related words . Since Bananagrams comes with TONS of usable letters , it 's easy to make a lot of words , great and small ~ perfect for a little cutie pie whose spelling vocabulary is growing :) I have yet to play the other Bananagrams ' games as described in the instructions , but I 'll bet it 's a blast ... AND I think it would be a lot of fun for a game night with friends :)
1 #### Ordered it 2 different times , got something else each time .
5 #### This was given as a gift to a co - worker who adores squirrels . Needless to say , he loved it !
5 #### These little magnets are too much fun ! Very addictive .
3 #### the box was a little small but for the price its not bad . low rating is just because i find these things boring . but if you like magnetic word things for a fridge these are pretty funny . its just magnets you stick on something to make a sentence . we 've made a few comical ones but really nothing special I will add this the Quality of the product is good enough to use . the words are plentiful .
5 #### These are fun to play with . I spent a week trying to fit every single word and I did it ! and twice lol . I would like to buy more of a different subject to mix with it . fun for guest and when you are waiting on coffee or cooking or dinking around .
4 #### This IS called Haiku , and to that end , we 've been able to create several lovely nature themed short poems on our fridge . But most of the words go unused , as you ca n't form complete sentences due to the lack of linking verbs and conjunctions .... and , but , is , are , etc . As a supplemental set , it 's terrific , however , if you 're looking to compose long poetry or sentences , keep searching .
5 #### You can play by the rules , or make up your own . Who cares ? Anything that gets a 10 year old boy interested in making words by looking at a bunch of letter tiles is number on with me ! Great fun and great for building word , spelling and reading skills ! Kid testes , mom approved !
5 #### My daughter and I have so much fun with this . It is a great bonding experience . Not too many 12 year olds will unplug and do haiku with their moms :)
3 #### We 've got all the " 10 Days In ... " Board games , and in general , we LOVE the games ! This one , however , falls short of their usual quality mark . The Cons : 1 . There are n't enough tiles . While in the other games , there are enough tiles for 4 people to play and still have a large " draw " pile , when 4 people play this game , there 's a tiny " draw " pile . 2 . The game is biased towards the Caribbean Islands : each island has its own tile , and since there are so many of them , everyone ends up trying to make a trip through the Caribbean , instead of focusing on the North and South continents . 3 . There are n't enough duplicate tiles . In most of the other games , the " big " countries have 2 tiles , but only Brazil has 2 tiles in this version . This adds to the bias towards the Caribbean : if there were 2 tiles for the USA , Canada , Mexico , and maybe a couple other South American countries , game play would be more balanced and add the necessary tiles to make the game do - able . The Pros : 1 . My kids have learned a lot about the Caribbean Islands !
5 #### All of the " 10 Days " games are fun , and 10 Days in the Americas is no exception . A new area to explore ( North , Central & South America and the Caribbean ) and a new twist ( " cruises " , in which you can string together sequences of oceans ) make this a great addition to the series .
5 #### This is such a fun game for the whole family . It can be modified for younger kids and beginning readers . My 5 year old still needs a lot of help but for my 8 year old this is perfect . And it 's compact and easy for travel .
5 #### Love the healing words . Use it for my therapy practice . Very happy with my purchase !
5 #### I ordered this for a loved one who has just been diagnosed with breast cancer for the second time in her life , and is having a very hard time . This poetry kit is full of an excellent range of words , from the typical " beauty " and " heal " and " hope " to " medicine " " sick " and " hurt . " It 's truly a great set to have for the magnetic poetry word collector in your life who could use a little inspiration during a hard time in his or her life .
5 #### What a great way to get involved in the geography of the new world . So much of this is simply left out of our schooling and this is a super fun way to engage the map and subliminally learn . As with the others , the game is fun and captivating too-
5 #### This is a game that our family has played many times . I can honestly say I have learned more about other countries from this game than anything else . You and the other players will find countries ; I bet you did not even know existed . 10 Days in the Americas is great for the kids who are studying the American countries in school and crave more knowledge . It also has tremendous replay value , which is what I look for when I purchase a new game . There are four other games in the 10 Days line . They are Europe , Africa , USA , and Asia . All make a great learning adventure for the young and old .
5 #### For the first time in the 10 Days series , you can link travel tiles ! Th is truly the most unique element in this new addition to the 10 Days series . I 've had trips where I have 3 - 4 ocean liners all linked together before I even touch land again . I like that . I have also learned a lot about geography in central and south America . Very fun and a nice new way to learn geography of the western hemisphere . Something severely lacking in students knowledge base today .
5 #### My family loves this game . It 's everything I love about Scrabble without have to worry about scores and it 's much faster - paced . The little banana carrying case is great - makes the game really portable and perfect for bringing on vacation . We 've had it for a few years now and it 's held up perfectly .
5 #### This game is super fun . If you are looking for a game that you can talk through with your friends and family this is not the one because you have to concentrate a bunch . HOWEVER , inbetween rounds , you talk and have a lot of fun ,
5 #### My roommates and I are all in our twenties and we love this ! I bought it for one of their birthdays and there is always silly and/or inspiring phrases and poetry on the fridge . This one has a lot of connecting words and if you are only going to get one , I 'd suggest this one . Having more boxes from different topics would make it even more fun ! But I recommend this for any age and anybody who comes over always participates as well !
4 #### While I love the word selection in this Haiku set , the box to store the words in is very cheaply made . They are great for placing on the fridge ( or some other magnetic flat space ) for easy access to play with them .
5 #### Bananna Grams are made well . The tiles are a hard plastic and the zippered pouch makes it easy to store and/or travel with . It 's a fun game and it helps kids learn to think better and improves their spelling .
5 #### Our ( middle - school through high school aged ) children and I enjoy this fun little game . We can make the game as quick or as long as we want , and everyone works independently at their own pace ( not needing to wait for anyone to take a turn ) . It 's easy to set up ( just dump out the letter tiles ) , easy to clean up ( put them back in the zippered fabric banana bag ) , and takes up very little space and easy to just throw in my bag and take with us when we want . The main object of the game ( simplified , there are variations with the same main object ) is this : Everyone gets a set number of tiles , creating crossword - style words . The first person to use all of their tiles wins . Simple , but more challenging than one might think . I secretly suspected I 'd win pretty much every game , but our children beat me several times at this game more than I would like to admit :) It 's easy to make adjustments to make the game shorter with the included instructions . We have had a lot of fun with " Bananagrams " and recommend it !
5 #### Purchased as a gift for my daughter ( 16 ) and she enjoyed it enough to take back to school with her , which says a lot because she likes things minimal . Great distraction .
5 #### I purchased this a few months ago and we played it recently when visiting my son 's family . It is small and easy to transport , and they liked it enough to purchase one to take on their family vacation . It takes much less time than Scrabble , and there are opportunities for many to win , because each round is short . Good for kids and adults .
5 #### This game is awesome ! If you like wordplay , Scrabble , or crossword puzzles , you will love this game . It is suitable for most age levels , from families with young children , to adults . I 've played this at parties , at family gatherings , and solo . Very fun and highly recommended .
5 #### I wanted to get a set of Magnetic Poetry that had positive words without being overwhelmingly " chirpy " , and this set is perfect- a nice mix words focusing on general well - being and inner peace . Perfect compliment for any other set ( my other one is the Haiku set ) .
5 #### I got this for a colleague who teaches Haiku to her 1st grade class . She loved it , and shared it with the kids .
5 #### Refrigerator magnet poetry is so addictive and fun . What a great way to release your creative juices , often after a bottle of wine , with friends . This set is one of the best . It seems as if the " newer " sets have slightly bigger letters than the original sets of long ago . The words included are great for not only Haikus , but poems and phrases of all sorts . A unique gift for a creative person in your life , or just to indulge , these magnets are perfection !
5 #### I just received this game and brought to my Mom 's for an after Sunday lunch game . I bought this game because of the name ( My Dad was always giving away bananas when Mom had bought a few too many , will still chuckle about it ) Anyway , we had a lot of fun and also got a kick out of making up a word or two ( just for fun ) as we made up a few of our own rules like you CAN use a surname ( as my mom had my dad 's name in her tiles so of course we did ) Make up your own rules and have more fun .. This is great for kids and adults .. Getting back to real good clean fun games to interact is a good thing . I will be buying a few more to give as gifts .
5 #### I am officially addicted .... I love this game ! So much we bought a second set for the rv and have given it as gifts . Great fun .
5 #### This game take the competitiveness out of scrabble . There is no board and no points values on the letters . Just plain tiles in a banana - shaped bag . Great for kids , easy to travel with . Educational and fun . Use the letter tiles to work with kinesthetic learners when visual and auditory methods alone do n't work .
5 #### These magnetic poetry kits are fantastic for keeping on the fridge . It 's nice to have a simple way to be creative . This healing words kit is excellent for anyone who likes to try and keep a positive outlook . You can put up positive messages to yourself or whoever else to cheer you up .
5 #### I really liked this alot ....... Used it immeditely , as soon as it arrived , to write Haiku 's . I only wish these sets came in a tin container ... better to tote in your purse . Really loved the word variety . Awesome little item .
4 #### I like this little magnetic Haiku set . It is handy enough to tote right along with you . I do not use mine on the fridge . I spread the words out , and form poems right on the counter . Afterwards , I write the poem in my poetry journal . I have only one complaint . Although the box is lovely in its decor , I so wish this came in a metal box . Far easier to toss in your purse .... no crushing . However , that said , I so like this item !
4 #### Our family loves bananagrams and we already had one set that we have played with for a couple of years . I ordered a second set on Amazon ( $ 14.95 ) for my students to use , and was surprised to see that the tiles are now made of cheap plastic that is hollow on the back , rather than the solid tiles in my original set . I really wish this set had the same quality tiles that my original set did . The game itself is really fun to play , and great for all ages.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Bananagrams / dp/1932188126 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Bananagrams</a >
5 #### It is a fun game to play with the whole family . Especially if you like word games . It is a game similar to scrabble but a lot more fun .
5 #### Scrabble takes forever and keeping score sucks . I like this better . Aside from three rules ( no people names , no acronym , abbreviated words must also be words ( vet , veg , etc ) ) any thing goes . A three player game lasts between 10 - 20 minutes and we usually start we 20 letters . 15 for four player games . ( I get made fun of every time I play the word " ska " because no one has ever heard of it . )
1 #### Buyers should be aware that if you order this game on Amazon , it is likely you will receive a counterfeit product , a cheap knock - off from China , not the original , trade - marked Bananagrams game . The one I received was absolutely inferior to the ones being sold in Target and other stores . The tiles were hollowed out on the back , cheaply printed ( the letters seemed like they would get scraped off with any play ) and came in a cheaply made bag with a wimpy zipper . I sent it back and am hoping for a full refund . I went and bought a replacement at Target , and it is of such a higher quality , it 's disgusting . The tiles are like Scrabble tiles , heavy , with recessed printing , and there is a trademark on the brown label on the bag . The one I received from the Amazon seller looked like it came from a gas station , cheap garbage . Shame !
5 #### Great game to play during the holidays . Games go fast with 4 or more players . Does not drag like Scrabble gets sometimes . Very portable . Good to take camping , trips , etc . Better with 4 or more players . Buy it
5 #### Recently , our card group was short enough partners to play Pitch , so the Host brought this game to the table . My stomach turned a bit . I hate scrabble . I stink at it . My vocabulary is lacking . But of course , I gave it the old college try . This is much more fun than scrabble ! And you do n't need to be a wordsmith to win . I even beat my brainiac hubby in 3 of the rounds and got to call out Bananas ! The trick is to be willing to move your tiles around , even if you are proud of a certain word in your crossword puzzle and keep re - working it . The more you play it the better you get . I find myself paying close attention to words that use lots of vowels or use f , j or q. I hope to remember them for the next round of Bananagrams ! A tip for non - scrabble players ; I play solitaire with a dictionary on hand to try and get more ideas . We play with our 1st grader and while we make him have legit words , we let spelling slide . That makes the play very , very fun . My favorite word of his so far was WEEZL . We also let him use proper nouns / names . And we all stop and help him if he is getting frustrated . I still stand by my opinion that scrabble is dumb . Dumb because I stink :) Bananagrams = FUN
5 #### I hold game nights at my place twice a month and this will definitely make the list of most played . If you enjoy scrabble , but do n't like how long a game can take , or if you are the type to play online word games , then this is a game for you . The object is to be the quickest to use up all of your letter tiles to make a crossword . The game is over when you are out of tiles and someone has put down their last letter . It is fun , thought provoking and quick enough to play multiple games .
5 #### If you 're looking for a fun family game that challenges every one , try this ! It 's great for kids and adults alike -- we played it with my 25 - year - old and 26 - year - old sons and friend and everyone enjoyed it . It 's good for keeping your mind nimble . Love the banana storage concept . Looking forward to many more opportunities to play it . Will give it as a gift -- it 's a wonderfully fun present that is sure to please . Easy to store , too ! A perfect family game .
5 #### After purchasing this game , our poor , well - loved Scrabble game is now collecting dust in the corner ! Bananagrams is much more fun , and you do n't have to worry about those pesky points . When we need a change of pace , we like to divide all the tiles evenly , and then choose a theme like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings . Trying to make every word match the theme is much less fast - paced , but makes for a super fun challenge . =)
5 #### Let me give you a new family ritual before I even begin my review : Whenever someone in my family mentions Bananagrams , we all sing a little song to the tune of Menomena by the Muppets . It goes , " Dut dada dat ... Bananagrams ! Dut dada dat . " Now for the review . The basic premise of Bananagrams is that lettered tiles are distributed among the players , and everyone competes to use all the letters in the bag to build real words that are connected to each other like a crossword . Whoever finishes first wins . I 'm in my 30s , but when my siblings , parents , and I get together we play Bananagrams and have a blast . The game is simple but so much fun and fast paced . It 's good for your brain , vocabulary , and concentration skills . If you like crossword puzzles or Scrabble , and if you have some friends or family who share your interests , you 'll love Bananagrams .
5 #### This is a fantastic game ! It 's easy to take on the go like if you 're looking for a good game to take on vacation ( though NOT a car game , pieces will go everywhere if you try to play in the car ) . Excellent for encouraging verbal creativity . Bananagrams is very similar to scrabble but without the game board so you have more freedom to build words however you can . This is a great game for encouraging kids to expand their vocabulary and get creative .
5 #### Bananagrams is a great game for everyone , kids & adults , who can spell and arrange words cross - word style . And it does n't matter how many different levels of readers / spellers are playing . Since you 're creating your own board , you 're competing against yourself . With it 's yellow banana - shaped carrying bag , Bananagrams stows in your purse or backpack to take along everywhere ! I love travel games that still have full - sized playing pieces . All players start with the same number of face - down letters , someone says " split " and players begin creating their own Scrabble - style layout with their letters . When anyone runs out of tiles , she says " peel " and everyone draws another tile . You can always " dump " a tile , but you 'll have to draw three ! When there are less tiles left than players , the game continues until someone uses all their letters and calls " Bananas ! " She is the winner ... unless someone challenges one of her words . The dictionary can confirm any " rotten bananas " and the rest of the players may a chance at the win . If you need to adjust the difficulty , you could level the playing field : limit stronger players to longer words , or give the weaker players a little extra time at the start of the game . Bananagrams is great fun for adults and kids , mixed age groups , anyone who can spell . We do keep a dictionary around to double - check those rotten bananas . We LOVE Bananagrams !
3 #### I ordered this item assuming it was the Real Bananagrams . I was sent a cheaper " take - off " of the real Bananagrams game . There was no trademark for the game on the storage bag - which the original version of the game has . I compared the true Bananagrams at a local toy store and the version I was sold here was a cheaper take - off on the real product . The storage bag was cheap , thin material with lose threads . The true version of this game has a nice quality storage bag with the trademark on the bag . The instructions actually had words that were spelled incorrectly - funny as this game is about spelling . Just beware you might receive a cheaper " take - off " version of this game when ordering from this supplier . Disappointing and also dishonnest to sell it this way .
4 #### I absolutely love this game ! It 's always different , and can be played by many different age levels . Even my mother , who has Alzheimer 's , can play a simplified version . We do crosswords , and she builds separate words - but still " dumps " and " peels " with the rest of us ! My problem is this . I love this game so much , I gave my original game to my parents , since my mother also enjoyed it a lot . I ordered two more . The original set has heavy tiles - weighted and smooth . Very nice to manipulate . The new version has cheap lightweight plastic tiles . Ugh . The learning value is the same , but the cheaper quality of the materials bothers me . The lighter weight tiles seem to fall more easily , and are not as durable . One fell on the floor and inadvertently got stepped on ... and it cracked . That would not happen with the original tiles . So - look around for those older sets !
3 #### This is a fun and addictive game . When last in a hospital , I played for hours with my co - patients . That said , if you have access to a set of Scrabble tiles , you have all you need to play the game , and it is much less expensive . When we learned the game , it was with Scrabble tiles , and we called it Take - One . If you love words , you will love the game .
4 #### My husband and I are hooked on Bananagrams ! While I 've always been a fan of word games , Scrabble in particular , my husband is never as excited to get out the board and play a game . Bananagrams is the perfect alternative to Scrabble as it effectively eliminates the boring sit - and - wait - your - turn piece that often seems interminable . Since we can both play simultaneously , we both stay engaged and on our toes the whole game . One negative for us is that with just 2 players , a single round can take quite awhile .
5 #### The product came much faster than anticipated . We love the game and it was just as advertised , perfect for travel and great for playing when the neighbors come over . What a great educational tool and a great way to pass the hours while waiting for a flight .
5 #### It 's like speed - Scrabble . Great for when your dad plays scrabble and it takes three hours for a game . Easy to play and understand but so much fun . Great for two or more people . Travels anywhere . SO MUCH FUN ! ! ! Not many rules to learn , just create words in a crossword puzzle and use all tiles . Can rearrange puzzle as many times as you want to fit in remaining pieces . Most games take 20 or 30 min . We often wind up playing best 2 out of 3 because the excitement is so much after the first game . You wo n't be disappointed . We 've also found that non - game people are often interested because it 's quick and fun , so there 's no two hour commitment .
5 #### I first played this game at a Thankgiving party with a group of people ranging from 9 years old ( my son ) to 60 's . It 's fun for everyone and challenging . It was easy to learn with the guest who brought the game explaining as we played the first time . Even my 9 year old picked it up quickly . So I purchased it for home and we 've been playing ever since . I like that you get your own tiles and work from your own build . Each person works on their own word puzzle . I 've never gotten into Scrabble , so I 'm not a wordy , but I was able to play this . This is a fast paced game that encourages vocabulary and works on spelling as well as different meanings of words . A definate conversation starter with kids who will ask if different letter placings are words . The packaging is cute in the banana that holds the tiles . A zipper is used to open and close it .
5 #### Bananagrams is like Speed Scrabble , just without the points counting . It was a hit over the holidays with family members of all different ages .
5 #### This is the best game for kids of all ages , once they know how to spell a bit . We played it over and over with my 8 year old granddaughter and my 6 year old grandson could play it with help . This is an awesome game for teaching the kids about spelling and making all kinds of words . Highly recommended for educational purposes as well as tons of fun !
5 #### Love it ! It helped me put my son on a regular sleeping routina and got my baby sleeping through the night as he got adjusted to listening to the soothing sound . We use one as well in our room and ca n't sleep without it . LOVE IT !
1 #### I bought this for my verbal eight year old based on the reviews . We have had it one year now and have played it 3 or 4 times . For us , the negatives are : 1 ) you are essentially playing alone , building your own crossword without even needing to know what the other person is doing . The only time you pay attention to them is when they take a tile and you have to take one too . 2 ) the child ( at least mine ) sometimes needs help fitting in awkward letters or reconfiguring her board , but she 's on her own in this game . Handicapping the adults by having them pull more tiles does n't even this out so overt help is needed , which makes it less fun . 3 ) the child is not learning any new words since they do n't need to pay any attention to any board other than their own , so the educational value is less . If you are like us and think the above negatives are deal - breakers , then I would recommend the game Catch - Phrase which is interactive , educational , fast - paced , and kids can play even with adults if you let them skip phrases they do n't recognize . ( They still learn the phrases when they hear them defined on other people 's turns . ) We have the card , rather than electronic version . It 's a blast . Kids over on playdates always drag it out , and when we have family over everyone wants to play . This has never happened with Bananagrams .
5 #### This game is super fast to learn , super easy to play , and can be fairly short . You basically draw ten tiles and try to make words using the letters you have drawn . The first person to use all of their tiles wins . You can trade in one tile but you must take three . You can also take one tile and make everyone else take one as well . This is a portable game and it is super fun . We have come up with a scoring system of sorts just to provide an added twist . If you win , you get ten points per round . If you loose you must subtract 1 point for each letter left in your hand . Of course , you can easily come up with your own scoring system . It 's just something our family does for fun . We have also come up with various twists . Banana split , in our version you can play your letters on anyone elses words that they lay down . This makes you think just a little bit more . We love this game and would buy it again . Enjoy .
5 #### This is a great game for people who enjoy word games and word manipulation ( even though you can pretty much do the same thing with plain old Scrabble tiles ) . But for the price , you do get a cute banana shaped carrying bag . Bananagrams rules are simple enough for children , but adults can definitely challenge themselves with different variations of the game . I have played with as many as 5 people and as few as just myself and unlike fad games that I play once and forget about , this one is always nearby .
5 #### My husband hates bananas , so I got this game for him becuase it would be a funny moment on Christmas , and also , he loves scrabble . The banana seems very durable and nicely made . I love it !
5 #### Bananagrams is a great value . It is a good game for elementary children to adults . It 's easy to play and since there are no points involved ( like scrabble ) everyone comes out a winner . Helps children build their vocabulary and great for family game night .
5 #### Simple fun game that lets the player work on his own yet has a sense of competition . Much faster than Scrabble and lets you rearrange the tiles as your letters change . They are two different games ; people are going to like one more than the other . I like Bannanagrams best .
5 #### This game can be compared to a live crossword puzzle without the clues . It is also similar to Scrabble , but much much better and more fun ! The games do not take very long because the first one finished wins ! No complicated scoring or turn sequence . The letter tiles are built to last , and the banana bag is durable enough to hold the tiles for the life of the game . A great game to exercise the brain !
5 #### A friend brought Bananagrams to a retreat . Fun and easy to learn , this game was a hit and I knew I had to purchase it for my own family . We play at least one game of Banagrams almost every evening . Sometimes just my husband and I play . Other times our elementary - aged kids join us . A single game takes 15 - 20 minutes , perfect before bedtimes . What we really like about this game : 1 . Very portable . 2 . No board needed , just a flat surface 3 . You can change up the words you spelled , so you are rarely really stuck . 4 . Takes only 15 - 20 minutes to play a game . 5 . Playing involves spelling , strategy , and quick thinking . 6 . Rules are simple to learn .
5 #### Fantastic and fun game ! One of the best in a long time
5 #### Bananagrams is one of those games that 's fun for kids , adults , grandparents , uncles , aunts , and cousins . It 's a fantastic game that spans the concept of a " recommended age " and provides not only an awesome fun time , but also can help develop spelling and word skills . Bananagrams is portable and durable , the entire game fits into a cloth " banana " that 's only about 6 - 9 inches long . You do n't even need a pencil and paper to keep score - all that you need is a free surface . The game works well with almost any number of players , young and old . It 's just as much fun one - on - one as it is with a group of six or seven . You can even play by yourself if you want ! The final thing I want to mention about Bananagrams is that every player is involved with the game at all times . There 's no ' taking turns ' , and no down time . You 're always playing , and trying to make words . It 's a great game for restless kids who ca n't handle a game like Scrabble where you have to sit and wait for everyone else to make their words .
5 #### My daughter is 7 and loves this game . We play together , and she also plays herself by seeing how many words she can make from tiles she draws from the banana . It 's a great way to practice spelling .
5 #### Want to do something new instead of renting a movie or playing video games ? Tired of board games ? This is the ticket . It 's a fast and fun word game that plays as well with three people as it does for five ! Inexpensive and durable . You can even play poolside or at the beach !
5 #### I 've been playing Scrabble for years , and just got a chance to try Bananagrams for the first time a few weeks ago . I really like it ! With everyone trying to complete their own boards simultaneously , it 's a very fast - paced , energetic game . Bananagrams works well with just a couple of people or a larger group . Since each round lasts just a couple of minutes , if someone wants to get a snack or go to the bathroom or something , they can just sit out a round and nobody else has to wait . In some ways , the game is more accessible than Scrabble . A good vocabulary still helps a lot , as does a good familiarity with two - letter words , but knowledge of really esoteric long words is n't as important in Bananagrams as in Scrabble . They 're two completely different games , and I still do enjoy Scrabble , but I 'm definitely a Bananagrams fan now as well . There 's a time and a place for both .
5 #### This game really brings the whole family together - and gets everyone involved , from age 10 -100 , in our house , Grandma plays with us grandkids , and we all have a great time !
5 #### I got this game for my daughter 's 7th birthday . We love to play scrabble , but scrabble is a little difficult for her still , due to the restrictions of the board spaces . I thought the free - form style of bananagrams would be a little easier for her to master . This is a great educational and fun game for all ages . My 12 year old absolutely loves this game . She says it is her favorite game right now . I highly recommend bananagrams .
5 #### I 've played this game with 6 year olds to 80 year olds and had fun each time , more importantly , they did too . Easy to carry around and easy to play , probably the best new game I 've seen in years .
5 #### I bought this hoping to encourage my 9 and 10 year olds to 1 ) enjoy games and 2 ) practice spelling . WHO KNEW we 'd all fall in love . My mom comes over every afternoon and forces us all to play ! It is quite fun and anyone can win . I love it and buy it for friends . Highly recommend this game . So much easier and carefree than keeping score and strategy in Scrabble .
5 #### Fun game for all ages . Portable . No board needed . Make up your own space where you want to play it and your own way of playing it . Great for school age kids to show off how smart they are , too .
5 #### If you enjoy playing Scrabble you will absolutely love Bananagrams . It is a much faster paced game , which is great because you do n't have to wait for your slow opponents to make a move . You actually are punished if you go too slow , because the goal is to be the quickest . One of my favorite things about it is you do n't keep score so there is nothing stopping you from playing it on Shabbat .
5 #### The banana seems sturdy enough , the tiles are a lovely quality , and the directions are super easy , but the fun is all in the game . My husband and I play Scrabble a lot , but it can take sooo long . This game is much faster , easier , and more fun because everyone plays at once rather than waiting - sometimes endlessly - for another player to make the " right " Scrabble move . Highly recommended . I did order this game from Amazon , but it took more than six weeks to arrive .
5 #### Bananagrams is a brilliant game . It gets rid of some of the problems of Scrabble ( the interminable length of some games or turns ! ) by making speed an issue . You can vary how you play the game and it is fun for kids ( older for sure ) to play as well . We spent many after dinner hours this summer playing the game as a family . Even my wife who HATES HATES HATES games got hooked on this one . If you are at all interested in word games , you will be hooked on Bananagrams after your first round . So simple ! Perfect , get it ! Wish I had thought of it ...
5 #### As others have said , a bit like Scrabble , without the board and points . I read the negative reviews and simply can not identify with their criticisms ... particularly that adults wo n't like it . My husband and I LOOOVE to play against each other and get quite competitive - glancing at each other 's words to ensure correct spelling and propriety , speeding up , reworking existing words ... In fact , we were introduced to this game by a group of older adults at a family summer camp . While the children played soccer , we sat at a table and raced to beat each other ! That said , my daughter loves the game , too , and she 's learned quite a bit in playing . We always keep two dictionaries nearby - one that is current and Webster 's 1812 - and if she has a question about a word , she asks and then uses it in a sentence . There are always opportunities to learn , for all of us ! My favorite way to play is on my own , with a timer . The possibilities are many . Highly recommended !
4 #### So far our family prefers this new game to Scrabble - each person gets to work on their own words at their own pace , you get to arrange and rearrange your letters however you want which can be just as challenging as working off of somebody elses words like you do in Scrabble . One game with just two people lasted at least 30 minutes - but it did n't seem that long , it 's easy to get very involved in concentrating on the words and letters . Overall I would recommend it - we found it to be a little more relaxing and fun than Scrabble but at the same time a good challenge .
4 #### Reading the directions , I did n't think it could live up to its reviews . I brought it on a family trip thinking it might keep the kids entertained . One of the stops on our trip was to visit some old friends - and they had the game out on their counter . They play it every day . We were immediatly hooked . Yes , the play is very simple . Yes , you do play somewhat independently . But we really really like it . The fact that the leader can draw a hard tile and someone else can win at the last second . This one is a keeper . ( You could just google the rules and play with your scrabble tiles too . )
5 #### This is really a fun and educational game . Just a couple minutes into playing I knew it was going to be good . I just brought three more games for my mother and sisters !
3 #### This product appears to simply be official packaging for a game we 've been calling " Speed Scrabble " for years . Just ditch the Scrabble board and use the letters . Each time a player finishes using all the letters he 's drawn , he yells " Draw 2 ! " and everyone takes two more tiles . The first person to use up all tiles wins . Scoring is negative : just add up the values of everyone 's left - over tiles , like at the end of Scrabble . For three or more people , it does help to have two sets of tiles , of course .
5 #### My 7 year old nephew loved this low - tech toy , even brought it out to play with other boys at his birthday slumber party ! That 's compliment enough , huh !
5 #### I think there are enough reviews on this to describe the game 's qualities . A great game solo or with multiple players , even teams . Highly recommend this !
4 #### this is a fun game . Not like scrabble where you play WITH SOMEONE . You race to see if you can use all of your letters and then the fun begins . Everyone must grab a new letter ! So the play continues again . I liked this game alot !
4 #### We made up some of our own rules and enjoyed playing Bananagrams more then . The first one to use up all their first 21 tiles is the winner . The game is way too long otherwise .
5 #### This game was given to our family as a gift and my husband hates games . He was not excited and now he loves it . We 've played every night . It is a confidence builder for kids and fun for adults . It 's fast and competitive , and easy to learn ( except for the crazy terms which makes it funny when you ca n't remember the right term ) . Even our teenager loves it . Highly recommended .
5 #### If you like to play scrabble , you will like bananagrams . It 's fast and fun as well as challenging to play .
5 #### This game is fun for the whole family . It also teaches children new words and spelling . There is no board required and you are building off your own words . You are playing independantly and as a group . You can also play this game alone . Challenging and rewarding ! Great Game !
5 #### My wife discovered Bananagrams at a neighbor 's house and bought sets for her boss , for our house , and for a friend . Now we 're all HOOKED ! It has completey replaced Scrabble , the previous favorite , not to mention card games . One remarkable observation is that my 10 year old grandaughter , who had no particular interest in Scrabble , loves Bananagrams and can even hold her own with adults players .
5 #### Purchased this toy for our grandkids ( ages 4 and 6 ) and although they love it , so do we and so do their parents ! Although they are both reading , because they are young , the kids made up their own rules for playing . That 's fine , because later on they can play more " by the rules . " It works like Scrabble , but comes in a cute yellow " banana bag , " and tho this may sound insignificant , the tiles " feel " good ... as if they are made of a very sturdy and smooth plastic . Provides for economical play , too , as the price was right ! I would buy it again for other relatives .
5 #### I have nothing to add to all the exemplary praises of the other reviews , but did want to say that this game arrives in its zipped banana pouch carrier , with no bulky box or packaging . It 's the size of a fat banana , and would fit neatly into a Christmas stocking .
5 #### this is a great game ... especially if you like scrabble , upwords , or other games like that . it 's faster paced than other similar games .
4 #### Christmas gift for a nephew . Very much the explorer and wanted to go exploring as soon as he openeded it .
1 #### I let the salesman at the store talk me into buying this although I had low expectations . I bought this for my 7 year old son for Christmas . It was so incredibly useless . I put it all back together immediately to return for a refund . However , I had lost the receipt and I had paid cash . So we still have it . My son keeps getting it back out to try to play with it , but then he remembers it does n't DO ANYTHING ! It is virtually impossible to get the slide to hold steady enough to see anything at all under the microscope . It is uncomfortable to push the button to hold the light on while you 're looking at the slide . I understood that this was $ 20 and would n't work like an expensive microscope , but I 'm telling you , this microscope is the same quality I would expect from a $ 1 microscope from the Dollar Store . It is practically unusable because you ca n't hold it still and it 's too hard to find your object under it . My son plays with the little vial and the tweezers . Was that worth $ 20 ? No . Trust me . Do not waste your money on this . You and your child will be disappointed .
3 #### The plastic base for the microscope is pretty flimsy and does n't hold the slides well . It 's tricky to move the slide around and get the object lined up . The microscope itself is way smaller than I expected and just plastic . My son likes it better off the stand to look at the fibers on the couch or the lines in his skin . I also hoped this would be fun for a smart 4 year old with great fine motor skills and a high interest in science . Perhaps I should have listened to the age recommendation . It wo n't be a waste , and I 'm sure we 'll enjoy it . I had just hoped for better quality .
5 #### i bought this for my 8yr old grandson for christmas . He had a great time with it . It was compact so easy to carry around outside for exploring . the value for what you get is great . it worked perfectly .
5 #### My four year old son wanted this for Christmas . He loves it -- plays doctor with it . My 2 year old daughter loves it too . BUT it is n't made for small children . The clear plastic body broke when my son got too rough with it . I glued it and he still plays with it . The organs are realistic but easily get dirty so need to be kept off dirty surfaces . The scissors and tweezers were broken soon after getting but because my children stepped on them . I love this toy because my son has learned about the body but as far as durability , it is made for older children who know how to take care of it .
4 #### This was a Christmas present and it worked as expected . My son played with it a few times and it 's now sitting on a shelf .
5 #### My 4 year old has LOVED learning about anatomy and the human body . The companion book is great too , even for older kiddos .
2 #### the game is ok . I do n't like the feeling of it
5 #### My 7 yr old boy just loved it so so much ! ! !
5 #### Fun and educational toy . My 5 year old loves it .
4 #### Plastic is a bit hard to pull apart and put back together , feels like its going to snap / break , guts are cool and very sticky , over all cool toy .
5 #### This is so great for my niece who is 7 and wants to be a doctor . She is learning what each pet is called and does .
5 #### My son ( 5 years old ) loves this set . We homeschool and for the past few months we have been studying human anatomy . He enjoys being able to touch the parts , explain what they do and put them back in the model . Fun and educational .
2 #### Being a retired teacher , I was excited to buy this for my granddaughter because she was very interested in how the body works . We had fun going through the book and reading the information as we extracted the parts . We did have trouble opening the skull , but it did open . The frustrating part came when we tried following the directions to put it back together . We still have n't been able to get the hips to stay together . The sticky organs are fun , except when you are trying to put them back in order . Their stickiness becomes a con . After the excitement of operating the first time , we 've only used it one more time because it 's too hard to reassemble it ! Also , I think the hips are defective . The " pro " of this toy is the book and information for the body parts as the child operates .
4 #### My granddaughter ( 8) saw this on youtube and wanted it for Christmas . She put it together ( with a little help ) and was very interested in how everything ' fit ' . I was a little disappointed that she seemed so taken with the squishy organs that she did n't focus on what they do . I do think that she will come back to this often and begin to really develop an understanding of body systems . I plan to use it for teaching as conditions / illnesses present themselves I media or individuals she knows .
5 #### My 5 year old loves this . She had been begging for a human anatomy model . She 's either going to be a doctor or a serial killer ( here 's hoping the former ) . Anyway , the parts are a little tricky to get back in but it 's a good learning tool . I just wish his guts would stay in - we 've got guts hanging out .
5 #### Excellent learning resource ! Good for sensory and visual learners . The book that comes with it is a fun learning resource as well . Excellent value ! So happy with this purchase !
5 #### Great educational product for kids . My daughter enjoys learning about the human body especially with this interactive model giving her the sense of being a doctor . She now knows the organs and major bones with the help of the diagram and text included with this kit .
5 #### Got this for my 6 - year - old . She loved it ! ! Easy to assemble , interesting book . I just wished they would used a healthier food as an example .
5 #### Super fun human anatomy set for my kids . They love taking out the organs and bones and reading about their structure and function !
3 #### I had such high hopes for this but alas none of my children were very interested . It does seem very well made , realistic , and could be very educational if I had more time to sit down with them and play with it together . The only issue I have is that it is not a quick task to put all the parts back in the body when you just want to clean up . You have to get it all correct or it does n't shut . Would be better it came with a separate box to store the parts in for quick cleanup .
5 #### My five - year - old nephew and I had a blast with this item . The guts are fun and squishy . I definitely recommend playing with this toy at , say , a kitchen table , because the guts could easily get hairy and gross if they hit the carpet .
5 #### I 'm not sure if it 's autism related , but my 5 year old grandson is obsessed with the way the human body works , so I bought this for him and he was thrilled - he immediately named all of the organs as soon as he opened it ! He carries it in a bag with him everywhere he goes .
3 #### It was ok . Only major thing was the quality of the clear plastic outer case and the inner items snapping back in . Good luck trying to get it all back in and snapped in . I just gave up . Would have been cool to display in my child 's room , but we could n't get all pieces to snap back in and the outer plastic cased to to stay closed either .
5 #### Amazing . My kid has learned so much from this . Got this for my older child and the little one keeps stealing the pieces and losing them . I may have to order another one so we can have a complete set of organs again . I did n't have any issues with the body snapping back together . My kid loves it .
5 #### Believe it or not , my soon to be 5 year old granddaughter asked for this for her birthday . I think she feels it is a really cool puzzle ... but she will be learning as she takes it apart and puts everything back in its place . Great idea SmartLab !
1 #### This is garbage . Do not waste your money . Yes it 's cool for looking at but kids can not play with it . It 's hard to put back together and the organs fall out . The organs are also sticky so the first time they hit the ground they 're full of fuzz and whatever else is down there . My kids are 8 and 10 , this thing did n't last much more than a week
2 #### Not worth the money . I purchased two of these for my kids and once the body parts are out it is hard to get everything back in .
4 #### This has provided hours of entertainment for my child . The only thing I did n't like is that my child was able to separate the skeleton top from the skeleton bottom and it was not supposed to come apart where it came apart . ( That was obvious when it would not go back together like the rest of the pieces . ) Would be nice if the entire top was made to come apart from the entire bottom . Hard to explain and is nothing that some super glue wo n't remedy , I hope .
5 #### My daughter loves this . She 's only 5 , but is able to pull out the body parts and place them on the mat . It 's nice because we are able to talk about the body part , what it does , and I think even I m learning some things . Not sure if she 's ready for the FULL on conversation , but this human body is really nice and accurate . She loves using the tools , as she thinks she 's really doing surgery . Putting it all back in , correct , is just as fun .
5 #### Great for a 5 yrs and beyond . Talking about how the body operates and why to care for herself . Why her diet must fuel her body ... So cool that she wants to know .... What is this for ? , How does this work ? and inquisitiveness has developed her own powers of common sense and to think ... " If this works this way , then maybe that will work the same way ... " She 's trying to figure it out for herself and I love how inventive she is becoming ... HOPEFULLY not afraid of failure ... Just try again ! She took the body apart , identified the organ , talked about it 's purpose and put them back together ... I 'll never forget the experience . It 's best when grandparents calmly take the time to help the young on OMG ! I LOVE being a Gram ... Her excitement to learn ! She jumped up from the floor!! ... "MiMi ! ! THANK YOU ! ! I NEEDED TO KNOW THAT ! "
4 #### Super fun toy . My 5 year old has been dying to get this . She squealed with joy when she opened it for her bd . My only complaint is that once we took it apart the first time it does n't stay together well . Every morning I find guts lying on her bed . And sometimes the rib cage . ( It sits on a shelf next to her bed . ) And the intestines always come apart so they are just everywhere . Would I buy it again ? Yeah . Even with its flaws it 's pretty awesome .
3 #### Bought this as a Christmas present for my 5yo -- he saw it on YouTube , and asked for it . He 's very careful with toys , but if your child tends to be rough , this is not going to work for them . The " body " is very thin plastic , and the clips do n't quite line up , and it is very hard to use . The bones and muscle parts , especially the skull , hand , and foot , do not clip in , so they float around . The organs do n't fit together as well as expected , and fall out when it is together on the stand . BUT , he loves it . The book is fun , and the " organ - izer " is neat . I feel the book is OK for elementary kids , but the fragile , frustrating body is designed for highschool ( or adults ) .
5 #### My 3.5 yr old daughter is fascinated with the human body ( parts , organs , etc ... ) . So I bought this for her . She LOVES it . She knows all the organs ( this comes with ) and where they are in the body now . She has fun taking the pieces out and putting them on the organizer . Good , educational fun .
3 #### Interesting concept and very educational toy . My 5 year old loves playing with all the squishy organs and everyone is impressed that she can identify all the organs and their functions . Unfortunately this toy was poorly designed . It 's impossible to get everything to fit inside the body , especially the bones . It 's frustrating even for an adult . Wish the pieces would fit better because this is such a cool toy .
5 #### Purchased for a homeschooling anatomy cycle . My daughter loves to use / play with . It comes with a mat that she can match up the organs too .
5 #### Love this toy ! I 'm a nursing student but I got this toy for my kids to help them understand the human body and the types of things that I am learning in school . It helps me explain things to them . They love taking it apart and putting it back together . They have learned the names of the body parts as listed on the pamphlet so thy do n't have to look at it anymore . It 's super cool . I think it 's slightly expensive for what it is but still awesome
5 #### My granddaughter loves this toy ! She has watched the video so many times , she can identify all bones !
4 #### I bought this over a year ago . I wish it stuck together better for storage other than that it 's perfect and as advertised .
2 #### The pieces get dirty CRAZY fast , the bones are super hard to hook into place , and the organs also break apart easily .. so if your kids like to squish and pull on squishy things .. the organs will break . Its a good idea for learning and what not .. but do n't get this for your kids unless they are older and will really really take care of it and not " play " with it too much .
3 #### Very hard to put back together and snap into place . My son wanted it son badly so and he enjoys it but it is a pain to reassemble for him and for me
5 #### The book that is in the kit is a good addition for kids .
5 #### We saw this in a toy store and my 4 year old asked for it . I ended up ordering on here for part of his 4th birthday . He got a few other bigger toys , but this was easily his favorite . He loves it and I am impressed by how informative and realistic it actually is . Just beware that it 's not easy to put all those body parts back together once it 's dissected . It gives you an outline of how to do it , but I still tossed everything in a bag until next time .
5 #### Got this for a 9 year old birthday gift and he loved it . Now moms requestthis gift from us when we go to parties . It 's very well made .
5 #### My 6 yr old daughter saw this product on one of her you tube videos . I must say , it 's pretty awesome . lol she has learned A LOT from us dissecting the human body and putting it back together . I will say she had to have help with putting the organs back together but that 's to be expected since she is 6 .
5 #### My five year old is fascinated by the human body so we thought this would be a fun way to teach her more . She really enjoys pulling out all the pieces and learning the names of the different bones and organs .
5 #### Lots of fun . My 5 - year old daughter can tell me where all the body parts go and can assemble it with a little bit of help .
5 #### My little one learns best by doing ... each squishy piece has a name . We name the part as we put it where it belongs . What kid does n't love squishy ? She is learning organ names and does n't realize it . How cool .
5 #### Very cool . Squishy , life like organs . My 8 year old loves it !
5 #### My daughter got this for her birthday and loves it . It is very cool and has pretty good information .
5 #### Truly amazing toy as a grown up i enjoyed it more than my kids hahahha
5 #### my 3yr old grand daughter wanted this hope she likes it !
3 #### really like this except for the fact that there is NOWHERE to store the pieces .
4 #### My 4 year old loves the human body . he loves it . It is that sticky material so it got really dirty fast in our 3 dog house . Also the pieces are small so lost easily ( but did expect that ) .
5 #### My 4 year old grandson loves this toy . The body of the one we got snaps together well . And yes , the intestines pouch out a bit , but a little tape across the opening takes care of that when it 's not in use . The " organ - izer " is a great idea for my grandson to learn about matching parts with their pictures . He definitely gets that this stuff is also inside his body and it does n't gross him out . It was really cute when he announced before going to the bathroom that his intestines hurt . This is definitely one of the better toys I 've gotten him .
4 #### A Really Cute product , no it will not teach you advanced human anatomy but it looks cute on a desk . Just do n't let your kids be to rough with it , it could break easily but at the price its probably one of the best out there .
5 #### this not only grossed out the children while disecting , but they loved it and learned from it .
5 #### so much fun to play with . all of the organs come out and help you learn how the body works
4 #### Educational and the book is an enjoyable way for kids to learn about the body . Only complaint is that the body pieces rely on a slightly sticky material to stay in place and after some use the organs fall out of the body cavity .
4 #### This is a very cool set , my girls enjoyed taking out all of his organs . It was a bit difficult though snapping him back together since the little plastic pegs did n't fit in exactly into the other side . Overall a great teaching toy and the book has a lot of cool stuff in it too .
5 #### Very cool and better than advertised . My 15 year old loved it .
2 #### This was a fun project to do with my daughter for educational purposes , but it was very poorly constructed . It did not come put together , which would have been fine but we never actually got it together . We eventually had to give up and tape it to make it stay closed . The intestines also wo n't stay in , no matter how you put them in . We tried higher or lower , and they still fall out . I only give this two stars because it did get the conversation going for our human body unit .
4 #### This was very interesting for my 6 year old . It is hard to snap the pieces together so they need help . we had trouble keeping the organs in when we put the skeleton in the upright position once we were finished . It has a little book that comes with it about a bite of pizza and how I goes through the body .
5 #### AH - MAY - ZING ! My preschool aged daughter is into how things work so we bought her this for Christmas . She adores the sticky / squishy body parts and has learned all their names and knows how to assemble it without much help . My husband also loved it and had a great time refreshing himself on his anatomy course . What a great idea ! The bones do have a bit of a hard time snapping and staying in place but it does n't detract from the joy of the process . I think this could be enjoyed well into a childs school years !
5 #### An awesome fun and educational play set . Ideal age range would be 8 - 13 yrs .
5 #### My 6 year old girl ... she ask this for her graduation gift ! She say that she is going to be a surgeon ... she watch YouTube surgery videos ... I open it to see it .. it 's awesome!(I'm a surgical tech and I love this human body ! ) Amazon Delivery excellent as always !
5 #### This is one of the best purchases that I have from Amazon ! I love it so much that I ordered another one as a gift for my niece . My 4 - year - old daughter LOVES it so much and she enjoys the " organ - izer " game ( she calls it the " matching game " ) . She already knows the anatomy terminologies more than this model offers . For example , she knows the strongest muscle is the cardiac muscle and heart is about the size of a fist that has four chambers . We have been getting other human body books for her and she has learnt so much . I think this human body model is great to help initiating the interests of little ones . My daughter says " mommy , I know there are two types of bone marrows - yellow for storing fat and red for generating red blood cells , white blood cells , and platelets . " She ca n't wait to learn more about human anatomy and physiology every night at bedtime .
5 #### Freddy ( as we call him ) got my 5 year old very interested . Great educational toy ! Would reccomend !
5 #### Kiddos love this . Just like the one I had when I was a kid . Parts are squishy and prone to color dust but we still love it
4 #### This is a very , very cool visual aid for science . We are a homeschooling family with active , creative kids who love to explore the world around them . This cool squishy human body allows them to explore their own inner workings . It 's cool and its a great gross out toy for grandpa !
5 #### Bought one for my son when he was 5 , then requested one from my daughter when she was five . The tools are cheap but easy to replace . The body parts themselves are well designed , with a texture that mimics the natural feel . Kids love it . The body does stand up on a stand for display and they provide a great map of the body to organize and look at the individual parts . Very cool science toy .
3 #### It 's a great learning toy but the clear case does n't snap close right so it does n't hold all the organs in place .
3 #### Does n't stay together well , but it is fun to feel the insides .
5 #### I ordered this item for my 5 and 7 year olds . It 's pretty cool and I even had fun digging into it . Educational and just gross enough to be fun . Prompt shipping .
3 #### Little pieces are hard to handle and do not stay well . There are little bumps on the organs that fit into little plastic holes on the body to hold it together but it is not a good fit and it is hard to keep it all together . I love the idea but it is just a little too hard to hold together . I like the book that comes with it and the body is fun once it is together . It was very frustrating for my 7 year old and he had to have me get it together for him .
5 #### Santa brought this for my daughter and he loved it . She immediately opened it and started playing with it . The booklet will probably be ignored but the instructions are helpful for what order to put it back together in . Heck , I liked it , too !
5 #### My 4 year old loves this . Easy for him to learn body part . It may not be put together every much but he picks the parts and studies them . It 's says from age 6 or was it 8 . But for sure it a great tool For younger .
4 #### Really cool , but clear shell does n't go together very well .
5 #### Great visual aid ! Got this for 10 yr old grandson , who is heavy into skateboarding and dirt bikes , so I was taking a chance . He tore right into it , pretended to be grossed out , played exclusively with it over all the other Christmas gifts , and actually said to me , " This is the BEST toy I 've ever gotten ! " His 11 yr old brother was also very interested in it . The book is informative and easy to understand , the parts chart , with descriptions of each organ , was very helpful . I 'm ordering a second one to keep at my house so we can interact with it together when he 's here , to enhance the learning aspect of the toy . It 's a wonderful " sit at the table and play alone " kind of toy . I highly recommend this toy .
4 #### This toy / model is great to get kids interested in the human body . For the most part anatomically correct . It was hard to put it together as the skeleton pieces did not fit together well . I bought for my niece and she enjoyed taking it apart and putting it back together and learning where the organs went .
4 #### " The Man " as our five year old calls him , is a favorite toy . For young children , a parent will have to be there to make sure the organs and muscles and bones are able to be attached as they are intended . All in all , a very good educational product .
3 #### Good educational toy but the top cover would been little more firmer , it is not easy for kids to assemble it without confusion .
5 #### Exactly what I wanted . Great delivery time and great product .
4 #### Great toy ! The only problem we had with it was that hair clings to the organs like tape . We have a long haired dog , and I 'm constantly trying to clean hair off of the organs . Other than that , it 's lots of educational fun !
5 #### This is an awesome and inexpensive way for kids to see how the human body is put together and how all the parts work . I highly recommend it !
5 #### This is a great learning toy / tool . It shows a lot of detail , and it 's simple to put together . My only gripe is that the organs are made of that sticky rubber mess that picks up crumbs , hair , lint , etc . I have to wash the organs after each play session .
5 #### This is kind of expensive for what you get , but my kids LOVE it ! It 's a great learning tool , but the proportions are not exactly correct . So , take it for what it is . We 'll be using it for homeschooling . :)
5 #### I bought this for my seven year old who wants to learn everything he can about the human body . He loves it ! In fact , he played with it all afternoon . It fits together well . He loves the squishy parts . I love that it is a neat tactile experience with some squishy parts and some hard plastic parts . He READ the book himself ! He hates to read . He even made a bookmark with body parts drawings to mark where he left off reading . Definitely gave this product 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who has a kid fascinated with the human body .
5 #### My son loved this and it really helped him to understand the human body in a fun way !
2 #### I am not a stranger to difficult puzzles ; if you check my reviews you 'll see I did a 1000 piece puzzle of the Wicked poster , which is entirely solid blocks of color and almost exclusively three colors . This puzzle , however , is almost as difficult and ten times more frustrating . The pieces do not fit together cleanly , and sometimes when they do you realize later they were n't supposed to . I have redone the border multiple times , and have had large sections that I thought was complete only to have to remove pieces and use elsewhere . The end result is turning out great , but it 's taking us much longer to get there than it should . At several points we 're having to turn the puzzle upside down to see if the fit is correct on the back . If you 're a die - hard Harry Potter fan , this puzzle is for you . If you are a puzzle aficionado , run far from this brand . It will only frustrate you . The pieces do not stay together well and the slightest bump dislodges them .
5 #### A Christmas present for one of our grand kids . He loved it very much and we could n't get it away from him ! It 's a great learning tool for the future nurse or doctor . I recommend it for kids of all ages .
2 #### This is a fun toy for kids as long as you keep it away from hair , lint , carpets , breathing on it or it ALL sticks to the pieces parts
2 #### This was really difficult to put together and keep the body snapped into place . I would n't purchase it again .
5 #### A really fantastic educational book ! Love the ability to build the human body .
3 #### my son loves it . It is a pretty cool toy / resource for learning , but we got the luck of the draw with a defected " skin case " that does not click together or into the stand . Not so great for displaying , or for putting away at the end of the day .
3 #### Very interesting to be able to see and touch all the body parts , organs , etc ... Yet , it is not as sturdy as I would have liked . The organs fall out , the plastic case does not stay snapped securely , and one of the gray instruments used to look at the parts with already broke . I 'm sure my kids have learned from it but I got so frustrated with it , it is now in the basement .
5 #### I was very impressed with this , especially for the price . The insides are kind of gushy , and sticky , so they stay put , no little tabs to break off ! The pamphlet it comes with is also very useful . I highly recommend this to any homeschooling family
5 #### I must say I was a bit perplexed when my son saw this at a local bookstore and then begged for it through Christmas . Lo and behold , the boy loves to insert the squishy body parts into the plastic human shaped case and knows more about how the body works than most people I know ( including me ) . This is a well made , very detailed " toy " .
5 #### Bought this body for my 5 yr old preschooler . Its a great intro to anatomy and gives great opportunity for us to talk about how the body works . It is sometimes hard for her to snap the bones into the " skin " and sometimes hard to snap the front and back together , but this was made for older children . It comes with a book that explains what happens to your food once it enters your body - though we have n't used the book much . The organs are squishy , will break if played with too roughly ( my 2 yr old ran away with the intestines and broke them before I could retrieve them ) . Luckily we just smooshed them back in place ! What surprised me was when my little one started asking to play with it - I initially thought it would only be a " mommy - initiated " activity . Turned out to be a pretty cool Christmas gift after all . Word of caution if your child is younger - I do not let my child play with this unsupervised because of the small pieces .
5 #### My 5 year old loves it but does nt play with it too much , be careful or your cat will eat it !
4 #### Very interesting , but the parts do n't fit together or stay together that well
5 #### Great gift kids enjoyed this gift . Fast shipping and great price .
4 #### Nice model . My children can learn about the human body .
5 #### Directions in espanol .. lol .. its cool tho and can be figured out .
2 #### We sent it back . So inaccurate that my child was not going to learn much , and it fit together very poorly . The hard pieces did not mate up to the slots in the shell so it would n't stay together . Book was all cartoonish and cluttered and no good for my visual learner .
5 #### This is a well thought out toy for learning the human anatomy ! There are clear directions and it is a great way to teach the subject . It does have many small parts and would not work well for a child that is not detail oriented ... it takes time and patience to put it back together . It also benefits from adult interaction depending on the age of the child . It goes beyond expectation for what it is intended for .
2 #### The parts did not fit into the fram well , and it was extremely difficult to snap the outer plastic casing together . Purchased this for my " almost 11 year old " and while he thought it was cool - he was n't into reading the book as much as I would have hoped .
5 #### This was THE HIT Christmas morning . I 'm so glad I got it . I was n't sure about it because of other reviews , but the learning application possibilities was too tempting for me . Our 4 1/2 yr old is fascinated with the body and how it works and is always playing doctor . She was so excited to put all the ' guts ' on the matching sheet , so her and her dad did that while I festiduously assembled the clear body case ( which is the worst part and gets the worst review ) . Knowing going into it , that it would probably not match up good , and the tabs would likely snap off , I was prepared for disappointment , but hopeful . Unfortunately , the reviews on the clear case are accurate . Although I did n't break any tabs , I can see how that would easily happen if you were n't careful . And it must be the type of plastic or something , that it warps a bit ? ? ? All in all , it 's a GREAT learning tool for inquisitive young minds and I 'm sure it will come in handy down the road for science , health and biology projects .
5 #### This is such a fun educational toy . It 's kind of gross with the insides being sticky , byt it helps it all stay together , and my boys love it . Would recomend it to anyone who 's kids are interested in the way the human body works .
5 #### My nephew loved this ! The book that is included is very educational !
5 #### Almost 4 year old grandson loves trying to put the pieces in the plastic human body . Also seems to really enjoy using the tweezers . He already was fascinated by the human body so he could n't wait to play with this
5 #### Really cool and interactive activity for my curious 6 year old ! Even the adults got a kick out of the insides of the human body .
5 #### My little ones love it . I thought it would be a little advanced for my 4 year old , but the body diagrams had even my 2 year old putting him together . They asked for a brain next
5 #### great tool to learn about body . Children will have lots of fun playing with squishy body parts .
2 #### There are a couple of PROs 1 . My 6y / o grandson recognized all of the hard and ' squishy parts ( diaphragm threw him ) . 2 . " It kinda looks cool " when we had it completed . NOW the CONs . 1 . Holes for large pieces do not align well and when finally in , release really easily ( In fact , the bony foot will not remain in hole when " body is placed on stand ) . 2 . The " squishy organs " stick to everything ( except the model ) they touch and collect fibers , hairs , dust , etc . It literally requires a ' dust cover ' as soon as the ' organ bag ' is opened . 3 . When the feet are put in the stand , the head separates ( the clip on top does not snap tightly ) . 4 . The educational pizza trip stops at the upper small intestines ( grandson was waiting on the ' poop ) . The good thing is it was not expensive or I would have sent it back . My grandson and I had 90 minutes of quality time that is currently sitting on the mantel covered with a Zip - Loc bag pending arrival of a more suitable cover . I would not recommend this item . I would have probably given 3 Stars except for the snap issues and the dust .
5 #### fast delivery ! I hope my granddaughter will like it !
5 #### My 8 year old loves this ! Great purchase and fun way to learn .
5 #### Fun toy to play with . Kinda hard to put back together .
2 #### Concept is great , but does NOT work . " Organ"izer is cute , parts are ewie and squishy , fun to put together . . . oh , that 's where it breaks down , literally . You ca n't put this together . The parts do not stay in place , so you can not assemble this and then stand it up on display . You can put the parts in , but then that 's it . Forget the rib cage and plastic housing all together . I was really hoping for a fun way to teach my kid about the human body . This is not it .
4 #### The toy came unassembled . It was a little bit hard to attach to bone parts to the body . I had to help my 9 yrs old boy . Overall , it 's a great toy to learn about human body .
5 #### Great fun and educational ! We are using this with our human anatomy unit .
3 #### Fun gift , but realistically your child will probably only only play with it a handful of times as it is somewhat frustrating getting all the organs back in
5 #### Quick delivery . My 10 year old boy loved playing with this .
5 #### My daughter wanted this for Christmas . It is very interesting and she loved taking it apart . I will admit that it does not go back together very nicely though . We have to use rubberbands to hold the body together and the " guts " fall out a lot . She still likes it though .
5 #### Loved how much my son was able to learn about the human body and how actually enjoyed learning the information . I think the squishy - ness of the parts makes it that much more realistic . I did have minor problems fitting it back in once you try to close the body , but its not enough for a cause of concern . Overall I think the concept was great and very useful .
5 #### My grandson is only 4 but he plays with this for hours . Even told mama " Did you know that the skin is the biggest organ in the body ? " What a great science tool . Says it 's for kids who are older , but if your young one is interested in all things science like my grandson , it 's totally worth it even at a younger age .
1 #### Not that great . Hard to keep together . Keeps falling appart .
2 #### I am a little disappointed with this product . I wanted to have this to teach my daughter and once we put it together and started to take it back apart , it would nt go back together again correctly . Things fell apart , the two pieces would not stay together . It was fun for the first time and my daughter did learn from that .
5 #### A gift for our 4 year old daughter . It requires some level of supervision . She has learned the correct anatomical names of various organs and bones , enjoys assembling and disassembling , mostly she enjoys the interaction of us teaching her things and the time spent together . Makes for a fun family time .
5 #### very cool and fun for the kids to read about and explore . My 4 year old loves to ask for the brain haha ! This will com in very handy when they will be testing on it in school .
3 #### A challanger to put together once taken apart . The organs are moist and soft which is a little gross , but realism is there . My kids can not put it back together which means I have to do it . You also need to keep the small plastic sheet that come with it to hold the organs in place or they will fall out .
4 #### Got it today ... great teaching tool for the kids . The ONLY reason it did n't get 5 starts was because the very fragile plastic that held the skull together broke the same day ( today ) . Otherwise I would have loved it .
3 #### My kids love playing with this little human . But we are missing it 's liver now ... sad day lol . Once you loose a part it does n't stay together any more . But it is a good toy .
2 #### My son was dying for this , but after playing with it for several hours , he never picked it up again . A very expensive Happy Meal toy ( in terms of length of interest ) if you ask me .
4 #### We have a 6 year old grandson who had a great time learning about how the body works . I found some difficulty putting the pieces in securely , but , that being said , the education you can learn about outweighs the inconvenience . We are enjoying itl .
4 #### I suspect that 8 - 10 would be a better age fit for this product . It is smaller than you would think
5 #### This is the coolest . My 9 year old daughter is so intrigued by it , she loves the feel of the sticky , squishy parts , and the book that came with it is priceless . Great for homeschoolers . Also , works both for science and health class . To further " health class " , we will look into the affects of smoking on the lungs and body , and she will be able to see what the lungs look like and where they are located . She absolutely loves this product , and if she loves it , so do I , because I strive to find things that make learning fun and enjoyable for her .
5 #### My daughter loves this ! All of the organs are squishy and sticky which kids love .. anything to making learning FUN ! ! The tweezers and pieces used to pick up organs are a little flimsy , but other than that this is great quality . It has lots of education materials with it to explain what everything does . May be a little hard for a younger child to put the body back together .
5 #### My son loves taking " Dave " apart and finding out where everything goes . Very educational and fun . I would highly recommend .
3 #### This is really neat but very hard to put back together . It is very interesting and educational but it seems like this will be put back on a shelf and forgotten about .
5 #### My 10 year old had started asking me about internal organs and where they are in the human body , so I got him this . He thought it was the coolest thing ever , and now he knows where all those icky guts are .
5 #### We got this as a Christmas present for our Son who is almost 3 years old . ( Knowing that it 's for older children , but it still seemed like something a younger child would enjoy ) We were right ! For a young child , I would say this is not a solo play sort of toy , but it 's more fun together anyway . Our little guy loves learning about the body parts ( and squishing them ) and has very quickly picked up on the functions of each organ and some of their names . He 's also learned the spine , the rib cage and the skull . It 's fun to watch him learn ! One recommendation though ... be careful when taking this out for the first time . We must have mistook the plastic sheet that goes over the organs for wrapping . I did not realize until we finished putting it together that it came with this sheet . BUT it 's an easy fix if you just cut a sandwich bag , so not a huge deal . Bottom line for me , is this is GREAT - entertaining and educational for a wide variety of ages ! I am impressed !
5 #### Great packaging , quality product . Eight year old boy who received it was beyond ecstatic about it . The squishy factor makes such a difference than if it was hard plastic . Whom I gave it to is fascinated by anatomy and this was exactly what I was looking for to find a book / toy on the subject for him .
5 #### My grandson uses it for his homeschool science . It does have numerous small parts , but he has kept up with them so far . He sent me a thank you note saying how much he liked it .
1 #### The organs and bones snap in to hold them in place , problem is it does n't stay . its such a tight fit , one part snaps in causing a chain reaction of other parts popping out . With these distractions the teaching focus is lost and quickly becomes more a puzzle project than a teaching opportunity ; net - net , not a good teaching tool . Its also much smaller than I thought it would be . We returned it .
4 #### Bought this for my son , who was really into the human body and doctor stuff . The pieces are fun and squishy . He ended up liking the squishy body parts so much he just carried them around the house , and ended up losing a lot of pieces . the skeleton is hard to put together , and the pieces are hard to get in . It is not something my child could do on his own . If you want to keep the kit all together , you need to be willing to put it away yourself . A kid older than 9 or 10 might be able to do it themselves . It would be a good kit for teaching a science course or homeschool class .
5 #### I do research as a graduate student and this product helped me win first place from of 300 entries for Science Day . The presentation was in front of all Phd panel judges ! ! ! This product is excellent for any Science Project . Mine was on Organ Donation ! ! !
5 #### My son totally loved this set , he put it together and took it apart so many times it is n't funny . I would have helped him , but I dislike touching the ikky guts .
5 #### My three year old can now identify organs by sight . That 's pretty impressive to me . She loves taking them all out and putting them back in . The stomach and the liver are a bit tricky though
5 #### My 4 yr old loves this ! We 've given it as a birthday gift and its great fun for everyone . Be careful to keep it all together so you do n't lose organs ! We keep ours in a box with lid .
5 #### If you are looking for toys that are educational than look no further . My 10 year old girl loves this . She has learned so much about the body and organs by playing with this item . Great toy
5 #### The kids in our summer program loved it ! Great learning tool and worth every penny ! Great service too- Thank you !
5 #### My 8 year old grandson , who is learning disable , loves this Squishy Human Body . He is learning the body parts . It is really durable . Of course , it stays in the box when he is not using it . It is not for the toy box .
4 #### I really like this human body model as it allows my child and I to discuss his body with a 3 - D visual reference . My only negative is that they squishy nature of the internal organs make it difficult to put things back in place when the learning is done . Also , the clear plastic shell is open over the abdomen , which allows the intenstines to fall out . It is n't gross , but just a bit annoying .
4 #### Great instructional book and human body model . It is smaller than I thought . Other reviews warn that the parts of the body will get scattered about the house if you let young child play unsupervised . Well , my science savvy 4 year old grandson and 6 year old granddaughter started out exploring the parts and were able to put the body back together themselves . However , after a while , they created some other games and now , about half the parts are unaccounted for -- I think their dog ate some . So parents , this is great for older children , it is a great tool to learn about the body , and great for younger ones with supervision . Has anyone seen a spleen ?
4 #### I chose to rate Smart Lab Squishy You Explore it Human Body 4 stars because it is a fun and educational toy . This is a type of toy to complete together with your young child and undirected with older children . Cons , the forceps & tweezers are cheap . The forceps broke right out of the body and expected these materials to be better since we paid more ( $ 24 with shipping ) than the current price on Amazon of $ 17 . Also the texture is squishy but very sticky , if you drop it on the carpet everything gets stuck on it , especially if you have pets . Overall , a fun and educational toy that will be used many times over to teach inside the human body . I would like some of the books pictured on the box to be included with the set instead of having to purchase them separately .
5 #### My 6 year old son loves the hands on toys . He has put this together and taken it apart so many times . He still needs to be reminded to " go easy " as it will break with rough play , but if you 're willing to sit with your child and do this then it 's a great educational toy for the both of you
4 #### Well , it is a bit cheap , but that s what I would expect at this price . It looks so cool . The enclosed chart is big , organized , easy to understand where organs go . Clear body is cool . Squishy organs are awesome . Te chest cavity and organs are exposed , so dust sticks to them . I just keep a piece of plastic that camewith it to cover the hole . It is so cool the kids ca nt keep themselves away from it . Perfect and so happy with purchase . Highly recommend for homeschooling kids with .
2 #### Parts are too small and it was hard for my 8 year to take out and put together the right way .
4 #### This is the first time I purchase a doll that has its guts hanging out . I totally loved it . It is a great way that I am exposing my children to the human body . The inside parts do feel gooey . My 7 year old was weary of touching them at first . We had so much fun talking about the body parts . Next stop Museum of Science and Industry . They have a whole exhibit on animals and you can see the muscle and bone .
3 #### When I have received this toy , the book was missed . However , Amazon solved the problem . This toy was fun for my 4 years old boy , but I have noticed the quality is quite bad . It is hard to match pins and holes on the skeleton parts . It is also a big challenge to put the organs back as they are supposed to be in a real human body . Overall , there is good idea behind this toy and general impression is not very bad , but the quality is poor .
5 #### Organs get covered in dirt and hair quickly but they wash clean very easily too . My 3 year old LOVES this set !
5 #### We have had this for about 2 months and both my boys love it . ( ages 8 & 4 ) The parts are soft and squishy but are fun to take out and put back inside the body form . Great tool for learning .
3 #### I bought this for one of my sons because he is fascinated by the human body right now . On first glance , this is a very cool product . The book that is included is a fun , nicely illustrated introduction to the various parts and systems of the body . My kids LOVE the squish factor of all the little organs . That is fun . However , they are n't very practical . They are really difficult to get squished back into the guy once you 're done . I am not letting them play with it on their own because we are using it as a resource for our science lessons in our homeschool . I think if I let them have free reign over this , it would not last very long . I also wish it had a better way of storing it , because the gummy organs are going to get dusty quickly now that we 've opened it up . I will probably end up getting a shoebox - sized plastic tub to keep it in , as the box it comes in is n't going to cut it .
4 #### Despite the age recommendation that this is for an 8yo , we bought it for my 5yo daughter because she loves her " bones book " and is pretty good about repeating back the right words for bones and organs . Plus the " squishy " nature of the organs makes her laugh . The pieces are a little flimsy though , and some of the bones do n't snap back into the plastic " body shell " like they should , and they fall out . Overall it 's a good learning tool and she loves it .
5 #### Got this for my 9 - year old grandson for Christmas . He really liked the squishy organs . I made a good choice for once .
3 #### Toy did not hold interest of a ten year old boy . " Squishy " parts did not go together easily once removed . Would not recommend .
4 #### Cool toy , cheep materials used foceps useless organs are squishy . Good for intro to human body but not very detailed .
5 #### It threw me when my six year old asked for a body for Christmas . When he explained he wanted to know how the body works , I found this and I am beyond satisfied with this purchase . We do this often and we read the book that comes with it . The only way this could get better is if it came with a case to hold everything . He likes that the body parts are squishy and I like that he 's learning while playing . The Organ - izer is one of his favorites . He likes knowing what everything is called , and I like the book that helps with proper placement of the organs . I would buy this one again !
4 #### This product comes with lots of fun , realistic looking body parts . My only issues with it is that there is no storage case for the body parts and the entire body is difficult to put back together . It does n't stand up in the stand provided and bursts apart easily . But on the upside , my son has had this for more than a year and he still plays with it even if his focus is on the body parts and not putting together the entire thing !
5 #### I got this for my girls . We homeschool , and at least two of them will be studying parts of the body this second semester . What a great tool ! ! Ca n't wait to dive into it with them !
4 #### It looked like a fun way for my 7 year old to learn about the body and I was right it 's like a real life operation . I only wish the plastic pieces stuck a little better in the body but overall it was a hit on Christmas .
1 #### The organs felt gross as promised , but the workmanship ( or work - machine - ship ) was so shoddy that we immediately whisked it away from the 4 - year - old and sent it back . Luckily , he 's forgotten all about it .
5 #### I purchased this for my 5 year old daughter for her birthday . She is fascinated by the human anatomy and plans on being a doctor . She loves taking him apart and putting him back together . My only complaint is that the scissor tweezers broke coming out of the box .
5 #### THIS IS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR MY SON , WHICH OVER THE SUMMER HE CONSTANTLY ASKED ME ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY , THIS WAY WENCAN TACKLE TWO FOR ONE.I LIKE THE FEEL OF ALL OF THE ORGANS , SOOO SQUISHY , HE WILL LOVE THIS AND THE LEARNING ASPECT AS WELL . IT IS PRACTICAL , FUN AND EDUCATIONAL . YOU CANT ASK FOR MORE THAN THAT ! SGNOIGE / STL MO
5 #### I bought three of these , one for each of my grandnephews and niece , who are each six years old . Two of the children paid it no mind , but one of the boys , who loves to read and assemble all sorts of things , put it together in one afternoon while he was at his grandmother 's house , and now he displays it in his room , alongside his other model kits . I sent each smart lab with a few anatomy books for children , which included information on the heart , stomach , and ears . The little studious guy enjoyed everything . The other two children enjoy more physical activities , e.g. helping grandpa in the garden , so they were n't ready for this .
5 #### My daughter received this for her 5th birthday & could n't wait to crack it open . The ' squishy ' organs had significantly more detail than I expected , and the forceps & tweezers to remove them with made her feel " like a real doctor " as she said . There are also a bunch of removable bones & muscles . Combine this with a mat to place everything on to keep it organized & labeled , a nice book explaining what you are removing and how it helps the body , and detailed instructions on how to easily replace everything made this a winner for me to . My daughter is already asking when we can do it again . Highly recommend .
5 #### this toy is super cute , but if you kid does n't know how to read it might be a bit boring for them to do alone . Mine was 6 when we got it and he played with it just a few times , but now that he 's older i am hoping he will be more interested in it ! very cute body with squishy organs , really cute concept . plastic outer body that holds it all in could snap in place a bit better .
3 #### I purchased these for my preschool class because I had a student who was having difficulty learning his letters . Tracing a letter as you say its name and sound is an AWESOME learning tool . I was excited to see a product that would help me do this . However , the letters are raised on the paper and the only texture difference is instead of a glossy feel , it feels like your running your finger over construction paper . I was expected more of a contrast like fine - grained sand . Its not that great .
4 #### I 'm not a flashcard kinda gal , but I did want something like the Montessori sandpaper letters . These fit the bill nicely . They are made of heavy card stock , nearly cardboard . As long as you do n't get them wet , they should last basically forever . The color contrast is good . Simple tracing directions are easy for littles to understand . My 2 yr old daughter loved tracing the letters with her finger , and now that she 's three , I anticipate making new words with them with her .
5 #### I am a traditional guy and still like to give kids the paper book although I know there are many table Apps that can do same thing . This book has a nice set of challenges . I think different kids have different level of brain maturity , so be too focused on suggested ages . My daughter works on this at 10 .
5 #### Start with the lower levels of Mind Ware Analogy Challenges . Then go to this advanced level . Do n't be surprised if the kids do better than you do .
5 #### This is not exactly a toy , but for people who enjoy words and puzzles , it 's fun . I bought it as a gift for my 14 - year - old son , since he had enjoyed the other books in this series . It 's good practice for the standardized tests , but it 's enjoyable , too . I had a hard time finding this advanced level book , so I was glad it was in stock at Amazon .
5 #### These things are amazing and great we love them . The kids get really into it and these are NOT easy , they are challenging and it 's all about logic and thought . My kids quickly got better than I did at these puzzles !
5 #### I needed something to bring my lower level 7th grade math students up without making them feel as if the material was dumbed down for them . This book is it . I have even found that my on level or higher students are interested in them due to the puzzle nature of the problems .
5 #### Love these puzzles ! My son enjoys them and they are great to encourage logical thinking . We have most of the Perplexors in the series , check the others out . Great for gifted learners . My only complaint is the book is thin , so not too many puzzles and they can be gone through quickly . I have just scanned the puzzles and reprinted them at a later date so my son can work the puzzle again . Of course with enough time in - between so he does n't remember the answers . I highly recommend these !
5 #### My kids just love these . They are great problems that help to prepare for standardized tests when they get older . The questions are interesting , challenging , yet read in a way that the kids can follow and enjoy them . this is one of the few books where they actually ask to ' play ' . That should say a lot . I highly recommend , along with some of the others in the Perplexors series . I would say this is for 1st-3rd grade .
5 #### I purchased this book and the basic level book to help some elementary age children develop critical thinking skills . The puzzles work pretty well for this purpose . Students quickly figure out they have to use reasoning instead of going for the obvious . They are n't always happy about this . But that 's another story . I 'm very pleased with these books .
5 #### You do n't know what the picture is unless you do the dots . Some are really small to see so you might need a magnifying glass . Lots of fun and plenty of hours work . My son loves it .
5 #### Got this for my 10 year old for Christmas . He LOVED it ! He wants more . It 's challenging but not hard . Great boredom buster .
5 #### Fun and engaging . Can color when solved . Hours of artistic stress relief .
5 #### This was a gift for my 15 year old . He loves it . It fits well in our church bag so he does them at church , which I like because it keeps him from terrorizing his 9 year old brother and being disruptive . The pictures are very detailed and challenging . The biggest challenge is finding the right number since they are written so tiny . But they need to be small since there are so many of them . There is a good variety of animals . All in all a good purchase .
5 #### Bought this for my daughter who is ADHD and she likes it but my husband enjoyed it most LOL
5 #### These are great dot - to - dot books . I purchased some of these for my 7 - year old daughter and she loves them . There are other dot - to - dots out there that have over a thousand dots ..... these are not them . If you 've tried the thousand - dot - to - dots and found them too difficult , these may work better for you . This is a great way for a kid to sit , relax , and spend some quiet time . Surprisingly , this is also a great way for an adult to sit , relax , and spend some quiet time . Great gift for a young child .
5 #### A good book to buy for almost anyone who likes to do Dot to Dot . Especially good for anyone over 8 yrs of age . Older folks might need a magnifying glass but I do n't think I did and I am an older folk .
5 #### Bought this for my 9 year old after her occupational therapist recommended doing dot to dots . These are awesome for kids who are a little older and need more than just 20 or 30 dots . She loves the challenge !
5 #### Arrived on time & as described . A very fun & unique game ! We love playing it ! The bag it comes with is perfect for taking it along on trips .
5 #### I brought this as a gift for my 12 year old granddaughter who is a very bright student . She loves the challenge of these puzzles and was delighted to receive it .
5 #### My 5 year old son loves it ! He is so proud when he reaches numbers as high as 700 ! I gave one to my 11 year old niece and she loves it too ! Great activity to keep children busy . I 'm sure adults would enjoy it too !
3 #### THIS WILL OCCUPLY CHILDREN FOR A WHILE . THEY HAVE FUN WITH DOT TO DOT AND TRY TO FINISH THIS BOOK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE .
5 #### The one thing I do n't like about these is that the kids do n't let me do any . Seriously though the kids enjoy these and they come out really nice . Definitely a good purchase .
5 #### Bought these for my kids for christmas and they love them alot . My daughter would n't put them down for hours at a time .
4 #### My 7 yr old loves this book and it takes her a long time to complete the page . If I had to choose btwn this or the color by number , i would choose the extreme color by number . My child gravitates towards it more and it also takes a long time to complete a page .
5 #### For your 8 + year old kids , this is a good buy . Keeps them busy and helps them practice their counting !
5 #### There are so many numbers on the page it is overwhelming to me as an adult , but it is what my daughters wanted ... so we got them for them . Santa brought them , and they are happy , and that is what counts .
5 #### They were n't kidding when they said " extreme " ! My engineering husband was completely in a trance doing a page that went up well above 1,000 dots . And , our 7 year - old ( who we really bought them for ! ) thinks they 're awesome .
5 #### Hours of fun ! My kids ( ok , me and the hubby too ) enjoy doing these extreme dot to dots . Lots of pages . Got as an Easter gift for their baskets .
5 #### These books are fun and educational at the same time ( trivia in back for each picture ) Not only our 7 year old , but our 15 year old grandson & his twin 12 year old sisters could n't put them down .
5 #### This has amazing dots to see what kind of animals the pictures are once you have them put together , which makes it more interesting each time .
5 #### We really love this game . We played it at our local library and decided we needed to buy it for ourselves . It 's a lot of fun , it 's a great way to get your brain thinking about different ways to play your tiles . My son ( 5yo ) is the one who plays the most and when we do , we usually forgo the scoring system and we do n't hide our tiles and play it in a more cooperative manner so he can develop some more strategies . Eventually , we will add in the scoring system . Lots of fun , love it ! ! !
4 #### Okay wow , what a simple game right , but it 's great to play with friends or family . The kids learn color and shape all at the same time they learn patterns and color cordination and they do n't even know they are learning .
5 #### THis game is awesome . Its my favorite of the games I play with my grandson . I heartily recommend it .
5 #### My 10 year old does n't stop until all the dots are connected , he loves finding these under the Christmas tree .
5 #### This is a great book to keep kids occupied for time . There are some really challenging puzzles that are perfect for middle school kids .
5 #### My 8 year old grandaughter and myself love it . Easy to learn & play .
5 #### I wanted something for my kids - ages 11 , 9 and 7 - to do on a long trip in the car . I was a bit worried this would be to hard but my older two really enjoyed doing them . I also like them as does my Mother . They are very detailed , but lots of fun to see what comes out in the picture .
5 #### Another purchase for my 9 year old daughter . She likes it , I love it . I could finish the whole book for her . Warning , though , the numbers are extremely small ! I find myself bending over to bring the page closer just so I can read them .
4 #### I can not comment personally on this item but I do know my grand dayghter truly appreciates it and has already completed it since Christmas Day . Santa could not have brought her anything better than this type of activity .
4 #### This dot - to - dot is very intense but not so challenging that children lose interest . The final products are awesome and realistic .
5 #### I bought this to put in a bag of travel activities for the family to do on road trips . One puzzle took my 11 year old 30 minutes to do and 30 minutes of quiet in a packed car is a valuable thing . There are a couple pages that are too obvious as to what the end product will be and the kids bypassed those , but if they did n't know what the outcome was going to be ( although there is a key in the back of the book ) , they were very eager to commit to the 1000 + dots . I will buy another of these .
5 #### It 's a really simple game that helps kids get the idea of creating sets of same color - different shapes , or same shapes - different colors . I love that they are wood and they have a nice feel to them . The pieces come in a bag so play , clean - up , and storage are easy . I also enjoy games you can play across language barriers or games that do not require reading ( we host across ages and cultures ) . You can play this game between generations as well . Gentle game for spending time together .
5 #### grand kids a I like it , , Thank you ... Pat
5 #### If you need something to keep a middle schooler busy after they finish a test this is it ! I have several of this series and they are great !
5 #### I ordered this and other books of this type for my granddaughter who is 9 years old she LOVES them , I find them a very good buy as these books are the ones " we '' pick up to take along to the doc / dentist offices , it is easy to take and fun for the child while waiting in the waiting room .. I even have done some of the pictures myself .. You will not be disappointed when you purchase this and others in its line ..
2 #### This is definately an adult dot - to - dot . My granddaughter likes to do these . She is young and thought it would be something we would do together . Guess my eyesight is REALLY bad ! Very small numbers . Will keep for an adult to use .
5 #### I got this for my son 's 5th birthday , I think -- or maybe it was for Christmas shortly thereafter . He 's quite an advanced kid but has trouble finding things . That 's why I got this -- to help him learn to search . It was a bit too much at first ( which I expected ) . But once he got the hang of searching , he loved it !
4 #### Fun game to play with elementary children on up to adult .
5 #### My little grandson loves this game playing with his family .
5 #### My 13 year old and 10 year old enjoy these dot to dots . They are very challenging and keep them occupied for a while .
4 #### too much for 8yr old . I bought this and a calmer dot to dot extreme . He really struggled with these huge ones . I made some copies and did them myself and they are involved and time consuming . takes a lot of patience . if you do n't like tedious and precise work you wo n't enjoy this . cool to look at your accomplishment in the end though !
5 #### As a teacher , this is a wonderful " time - filler " after a day of testing , when some kids finish quickly and others take a very long time , but the early - finishers need to remain quiet until the end of the test . It 's also fun just to sit down and try the dot - to - dot yourself .
4 #### This game seems fimilurly similar to the card game Set . Set is also a fun game and you can play it by yourself .
5 #### Super fun , my 7 - years - old son loved it , and we did too ! ! ! Its a great game for him and the whole family , keeps you interested for a long time .
5 #### The game is as easy or as challenging as the age of the people playing .
5 #### My kids really enjoy this game . It 's a good size for starting out , but I would recommend ordering the extra pieces if you are going to have 3 - 4 kids playing together like we do . My kids love it and their friends too . They are 7 - 9 age range .
5 #### Our new FAVORITE game ! Get it , you 'll love it !
5 #### Wonderful game , fun , fun , fun & great quality :) .
5 #### We love this game , and love giving it as a gift . It 's simple to learn , sturdy , and portable . Great for ages five and up !
5 #### Great game ; instructions very confusing and different from the travel version .
5 #### Our children love it ! ! Great game ! ! Encourages quick and logical thinking .
5 #### This gets played so often , I 'm afraid we will tire of it .
5 #### how much fun is this game ? ? ? ? it 's great fun ! ! ! we LOVED it with 2 people , loved it on our camping trip with 4 and even 6 people !
5 #### Perfect family game ! My 5 year old caught on very quick ! We recommend it to all our friends .
5 #### Such a great family game and also a wonderful classroom strategy game ! Wonderful skills taught !
4 #### If you are a fan of abstract table top games , or like gamed like dominos , then this one is for you ! Lay the tiles by color or shape and see who has the biggest score at the end to win ! I do enjoy this game because it is easy to learn , teach , and play . This game has been put on the table a lot .
3 #### Great game , but the picture does come off the blocks too easily .
5 #### Oh how I love this game ! My son and I have over 25 board and card games as part of our homeschool effort . In poor weather we often play 3 games a day . This one is a particular favorite of mine because my 6 year old can play with a bit of help , but we will be able to play this at any age . Also , from a homeschooling perspective , letting my son keep score is a great way to have him practice writing numbers and doing addition without realizing he is learning . I think the box is absolutely enormous and the game is too heavy for us to take anywhere , but this is a frequently reached for game in our house . If you are looking for games with some substance ( I hate 90 % of the garbage games sold in discount stores ) this is a sure bet !
5 #### This game reminds me of IOTA . It is more accessible to the younger crowd than IOTA , but still fun for adults .
5 #### This is a very fun game for everyone ! It is simple enough to learn , match all the same colors without repeating a shape or match a shape without repeating a color , but it is a game that can challenge your logic as you advance
5 #### This is quite a fun game and can be played with a number of players , including young ones that do n't know how to read . It 's also fun ( and even quite intense ) when played only with adults . Excellent component quality . This game is a winner .
5 #### This is such a fun game for all ages
5 #### Great quality game . The pieces are painted wood and come with a bag inside . We ditched the box and just keep them in the bag . The instructions are n't too hard to figure out . We have loved playing this on the patio as a family . Fun for the whole family .
5 #### A great game of strategy that does n't need batteries and does n't make any noise ! ! Can play simply for beginners and then later cutthroat for the more experienced . The tiles are a nice quality wood and easy to handle . Tile holders would be nice but the tiles do stand up well on their own . The game was complete and I received exactly what I was supposed to get . I would have preferred it , however , if the box top was solid and did not have that lateral opening in it in case any tiles " escape " from the drawstring bag .
5 #### This is an easy to learn game to start or for kids but as you play more , it gets more complex and satisfying .
5 #### Any game my 9 year old wants to play and it does n't involve electronics is a win in my book . Fun for a wide range of ages too .
5 #### What a fun board game ! Bought it 2 years ago and it is a family favorite . We even play it on the beach !
2 #### Do nt understand how to play it so have not . I have read the directions and went on YTube to try to figure it out . It sits in my closet wasting away
5 #### Loved the game . Took it to game night and no one knew how to play . Fortunately I made copies of the instructions for everyone to look at as we played a couple of games without keeping score , After that we were ready to play a serious game . Everyone enjoyed it and want me to bring it to our next game night .
5 #### I have received my order and I am very pleased with the product , quality , presentation and packaging ! Thank you ! !
5 #### This is one of my favorite games . My mother - in - law bought it for my son for his birthday when he was young . We first played without keeping score and then once he understood it , then we kept score . We 've been playing it for years . It 's a great game for adults too . Especially if you play matching multiple tiles , it can be quite challenging . This will be a family favorite for years and years .
5 #### We like thinking games for our kids and we all loved this game . You can play with any age that knows their shapes and patterns , and we even played with adults and had fun .
5 #### This game forces one to think . For those of us who are linguistic , it is a challenge for us to re - pattern colors and shapes -- one can actually feel the strain ! My math genius granddaughter took to this like a duckling to water , and we love playing ! My mom is elderly , and I want to use this to stimulate her thinking .
5 #### Our family enjoys this game , especially our young son . We love that it helps with problem solving , spatial recognition , and planning ... all while having fun !
5 #### Great overall game with good construction . The the game itself I would say is sort of like scrabble but with colors and shapes . Qwirkle is easy to learn and is quite fun to play .
5 #### great family game ! ! ! fun for all ages . my 6 year old plays and my 85 year old mother in law plays it with us .
5 #### love this game east to play and even my 3 year old gets it
5 #### This is a new family favorite in my house . We have so much fun playing this . My twins are 5.5 years old and after watching a couple youtube videos on how to play that caught on fairly quickly .
5 #### awesome for kids and adults . wish they made a colorblind friendly version .
4 #### It was a gift . They seem to like it .
5 #### Gave this to my grandson for Christmas . He is a very sports - oriented boy , and does n't usually choose anything over playing outside . However , he loves this game and asks to play it very often . It is good for all ages .
5 #### Love love this game ! ! Me and my 8 and 10 year old boys love it and picked it up pretty quickly ( it really is n't difficult ) , but for some reason my husband just does n't get it . We just play without him , but I could play it over and over . And because it 's just matching colors and shapes , younger kids can play , too !
5 #### My nephew loves this game . my daughter and my nephew play for hours . It is a really great game .
4 #### Concept seems easy enough . Match by color or symbol . Use a single level , or let it trail across the table . In the beginning , scoring was a bit difficult to master . But , I think this game will grow on the kids .
3 #### Simple kid 's games . Good way to introduce young " board gamers " into the more advanced board games . Has good replay potential .
5 #### Our family and extended family all love Qwirkle . In fact , we love it so much , I just bought two more to give as gifts . The idea is a lot like scrabble but with only colors and shapes , everyone can easily play , including the non readers and spellers . Everyone also loves the idea of delving into the bag to see what new shape and color they pick . I highly recommend this game for families . Challenging and fun for all ages ! !
5 #### Have had this game for over a year now and even took it on our trip to Alaska with friends where we played it in the evenings in the almost all night long twilight . Great game that is easy to learn , fun , easy to modify , and makes some really interesting patterns when finished . Everyone who has played it wants to get it for themselves .
1 #### I wish I knew what I was missing my 15 - year old daughter and I played this once and we were bored by how easy it was . But there are so many high rated reviews ! What are we missing ? ? ? ?
5 #### This is a game our grandson requested from Santa for Christmas , so I am sure he has already played it and wanted one for himself .
5 #### Have been wanting this game . So glad I finally got it !
5 #### One of the best games for kids and adults alike ! We have a Board Game Club at our school 's after school program . This is one of the games we play with students in grades 3 - 6 and they love it ! We 've also played it at home with our adult children and friends on game night . Highly recommended ! !
3 #### did not hold kids interest maybe they are a little too young
5 #### This past weekend we took out our Qwirkle game for the umpteenth time when we had guests who were staying with us for a couple nights . I like this game because it 's easy to explain the rules so that a first - time player can quickly figure out how to play it , while at the same time there 's enough strategy to make it interesting . Another nice feature is that it does n't take a whole evening to play one or two hands . My experience is that a single hand generally takes no more than an hour . Finally , from a purely aesthetic perspective , it 's a colorful game as it spreads out over the board .
5 #### We played this game at a friend 's house and liked it so much that we bought 2 sets so eight can play . That worked great and made it a bit more challenging . The pieces are smooth wood blocks laquered in bright colors .
5 #### Tricky to figure out the rules and play it properly but we have had great success in playing it with friends and our son and his wife . It is a strategy game as opposed to knowledge , which makes it more enjoyable for those who do n't like trivia games . Great to teach colors , shapes , and sorting , too , and there is a Qwirkle Jr. for children .
5 #### Enjoyed playing with my 7 year old . It was too difficult for our 4 year old . Combines concepts of scrabble and dominos .
3 #### Great to teach kids many different things . It is a fun , very light game . Ca n't get my group to like it as much as our other games
5 #### Love this game ! I have given it as a gift numerous times . This one went home with an international volunteer from Colombia .
5 #### I purchased this for my 5 year old grand daughter 's birthday . My daughter is going to home school her and I think this will be a perfect game for her to practice making choices , matching items , and playing a game that has rules that have to be followed . I 'm positive she will love it .
5 #### We just LOVE Qwirkle . My whole family plays , including my 5 year old , who is a calculating player ! It might look easy , but it is a challenging game , to win you need to be strategic and plan ahead . It is our go to birthday gift and everyone who has received it has adored it !
5 #### One of our families favorite games ! ! Great for any age , we play with anyone who comes over
5 #### This game is so fun . Matching colors and shapes to make a scrabble type pattern sounds easy , but getting a high score is plenty difficult . I love this game because it is easy enough for young kids to play but interesting enough to keep adults captivated playing too .
5 #### This was a gift and i believe that she enjoys it very much .
5 #### This game has two rules ; same shape but different colors OR different shapes but same color . You 'd be surprised just how messed up that becomes when you play it though . It 's actually pretty funny to watch some people wrap their heads around those two simple concepts . I put this game up there with Scrabble , dominoes and the like . While maybe not as intense as Scrabble can be but not as simple as dominoes , it does have that similar mechanic and " feel " . It 's a great game . I would classify it as a " must have " . Might want the smaller " travel " version instead , however . Just a consideration .
5 #### This game is a hit . Played it with avid " I do n't do board games " kind of people , as well as those who do . Every time it is a success . Only problem I have found is getting rid of guests ... Because " one more game " seems to be a request . If you play with more than 4 players , get two boxes for more fun . Played up to 8 people this way for a super fun evening !
5 #### This is a fantastic game for 5 year olds and up . I have played it many times with my grandchildren , ages 4 , 5 , and 7 . The 4 year old enjoyed giving us the tiles , so he felt that he was part of the game too ! It helps children identify attributes , colors , and shapes , and also encourages them to develop strategies for getting the most points .
5 #### I bought this game on recommendation from a friend . It is now a new family favorite game . I like to think of it as a mix of Uno and Dominoes . We recently had extended family for a visit and it was enjoyed by EVERYONE !
5 #### Bought this for a family Christmas gift . We have never actually played using the rules . My kids have used this game to match colors and shapes . We have used the blocks to build roads for cars or to see how high we can stack pieces . This is our type of game . We encourage independent play and games that have multiple options , are great for this .
5 #### My sister brought this game on a family vacation . My 5 year old grandson loves it - we do play a simplified version with him and do n't keep score , but he enjoys the concept of the colors and shapes . Eventually he will grow into the full game . So I had to buy my own game so that he could play at grandma 's .
5 #### This is perfect for ALL ages . You would n't think so but let me explain ... I play it with my seven year old using the directions that came with the game . When I play " Quirkle " with my three year old , we just play by matching colors and shapes . When the kids go to bed , my husband and I often play it by ourselves , as well !
5 #### Great board game ! My kids an I can play this game for hours at a time .
5 #### My math teacher friend recommended this to me . I love it . I played it with my 2nd graders in my after - school program math sessions , and it was good for them . The matching / pattern making was great , but the strategy aspects were harder for them to grasp . The arithmetic of score - keeping was a good exercise , too . And they had fun . My husband and I played it , too , but with just two people of equal skill , it 's less fun . The winner is basically a coin toss . But it was a nice way to spend quiet time with a loved one . Better with more people or with mixed ages .
5 #### This is a great game for children and adults .
5 #### So much fun ! Really makes your brain work . Unfortunately , only 4 people - or 4 teams - can play at one time .
5 #### Such a fun game ! It was recommended by a friend and I 'm so glad I bought it . It is great for all ages . My 4 year old enjoyed it and understood how to play . I do wish the top of the box did n't have a hole cut out of it . I do n't feel like pieces will get lost because the pieces all go in a bag that is included . They would be more secure if the box top was fully enclosed .
5 #### I love how fun and easy this game is to play . It 's a great alternative to a game like Scrabble when playing with friends who are n't native English speakers and it brought out the competitive side in all of us !
1 #### This is a knockoff version of the game . Mine arrived without a bag ( the box states there should be a bag ) ; the tiles were not of the same quality as the Qwirkle games found at Target and the game description on the back of the box and the instruction sheet had spelling errors . I sent mine back for a refund - they were good about sending me a pre - paid return label in a timely manner though .
5 #### My wife and I absolutely love this game . An easy mechanic to learn , but wickedly difficult to master . This is a top 3 favorite abstract / puzzle type game . It also a great gateway game , but also has enough depth to keep you coming back . Great for couples and double date nights ! You will not regret purchasing this game .
5 #### One of the best board games around , easy to learn , fun to play . I highly recommend it .
5 #### great family game . great for kids from 6 and up .
5 #### This game is awesome . Very mind churning . I love it . We bought it for the kids , but my brother in law and I played . We spent a good 3 hours playing . The most time either of us could stand around one another . Qwirkle ... bringing Brother - in - laws together .
5 #### This game is AWESOME . At first i thought it was just a kiddie game but I quickly realized it was a lot of fun and quite challenging ! I would describe this game as a mix of Scrabble and Dominos . Fun for the whole family ( can get pretty competitive , too ! )
5 #### This game is great for family time with younger children around the age of 7 or so . It requires some thinking ahead and how to place the titles . We love to play this game with our family and my daughter is very competitive and has beat us a couple of times with it . One down side is you can only play up to four people , there are not enough titles to really play more than that . Would be great if they made it where more people could play with more titles . Game is fun !
5 #### Fun game for Family , and even little kids can understand it .
2 #### What happen to quality control ? Some wooden tiles are chipped on the corner and edge making them stand out from the other tiles . Not good since the game requires the face down side of all titles to be anonymous and exactly the same .
5 #### This is a very fun game . Easily overlooked by many i m sure but there is a lot more here than most would expect . Strategy , blocking and scoring big points are all here . Create combos with what you have in your hand or play on existing for tiles . Easy to learn and fun for all kinds of people . Do nt be afraid to pick this one up .
4 #### Had fun playing this with my 6 year old grandson . Match the color or the shape .
5 #### Great game , easy to play . The pieces are a fairly nice quality painted wood . It can be difficult to differentiate between similar colors ( like red and orange ) in lower light levels . Comes with a white drawstring bag to pass around and pull tiles from .
5 #### Love this game ! Great for all ages , and all ages can play together .
5 #### This is such a fun game ! I bought it for one of my sons and his family as they are great gamers and I wanted something very different for them . They loved it so much they brought it to our house the first visit they made after they received it so my husband and I could play it with them ! I then purchased a second game to use with my daycare children . It has provided many hours of play fun .
4 #### very fun game to play with friends and family
5 #### Awesome game great way to spend time with family and friends
4 #### This game is a lot more complicated to figure out than I thought it would be . It did not hold my kids attention and they usually like to play games ... even educational ones .
5 #### This is a really fun game . My four year old understands it well . It took him four or five games to totally get it . He and the eight year old can play it by themselves , and my husband and i do n't mind playing it with them either .
5 #### Great Family game ! and a fun game to play with two players . My husband and I have a blast challenging each other .
5 #### This has become our favorite game to play . It 's addictive .
4 #### This has been a fun game for our family . We do n't follow all the rules , but it 's fun to make up our own . And the math be as simple - or as complex - as the children / adults playing in the game . Which is all fun . :)
1 #### Fun game gave as a gift . Was missing some game pieces . sad cause this was gift for the whole family . can anything be done?we just open it . Thank You JimL
5 #### I love this game ( I 'm in my 30s ) . My son has a harder time with it , but if we play as a team , we love to rack up the points together .
5 #### Qwirkle is awesome . We love it in our family and regularly give it as a gift . Easy to learn and play , it 's not so simple that you lose interest .
5 #### This is a great game ! It takes a little while before you get the hang of the scoring system , but it 's so much fun . My husband and I love playing it together or with friends . We try to make the most points out of the least tiles . We 've gotten really creative . Once someone gets on a Qwirkle roll , all bets are off !
5 #### Love this game ! A must have for any game lover .
5 #### I have been looking at games for our family since now our youngest two are finally old enough to play . We live on an acreage in Minnesota and so having things to help pass the time during long cold winters is a must . My daughter is in kindergarten and I thought this would be great for her and my preschooler to learn spacial reasoning , patterns , matching etc . this is also one of the games recommended for the elderly and Alzheimer 's which is what I do . We have played this a couple times and the kids love it . My daughter who just turned 4 can easily follow along . The pieces are durable and excellent quality . The colors are vibrant . They love uno type games where game play is matching so this is great . We just play the game at this point with out keeping score and the kids love it . I loved Rummikub when I was young and this is similar . A good introduction to that . Definitely a good purchase for us . It is also great to have games that is n't parent torture that the kids enjoy and want to play .
5 #### Great game ! Play it with the hubby and my girl friends too . Simple to understand yet challenging too
5 #### Great game for everyone in the family . We play this game with toddlers through seniors and everyone has a fun time . The colors and shapes make it easy for kids to play . Teaching them basic strategy is easy too , suggesting they at various options to plot their moves . So happy I chose this as the family game this year . We will have many hours of family time playing Qwirkle .
5 #### Great game , even our 5 year old likes playing
5 #### Wow , this has been fun for the entire family right out of the box ! Do n't hesitate , buy this and you wo n't regret it . You can vary the level of difficulty by keeping your tiles face up or down . The games last 30 - 60 minutes , which is nice staying power . Make sure you have a large enough table . Our rectangular craft table sometimes just is n't wide enough for the pattern of the tiles , and we need to do our best to improvise . Easy to keep score , easy to follow and remember the rules , this game has staying power and will be a go - to for game night for kids as young as 6 and up !
5 #### This is a great game ! Buy it . Trust me .
5 #### Loved it . A little challenging . Very similar to playing Uno . You have to look for similar attributes . This is a good game for fun and learning .
5 #### Great game ! Fun for kids and adults . No reading required .
5 #### We bought this for Christmas for our family . My 7 year old and 12 year old regularly beat the adults . Who thought it was a good idea to teach them this game ? ;) We sometimes play in teams with a younger child and an older person and that can be a great way to teach them strategy and teamwork . Fun game , for readers and non - readers alike .
4 #### The tiles themselves are very nice . We originally bought the travel version which is identical in game play to this version but has smaller tiles . In both versions , you keep the tiles on their sides when they 're in your " hand " ( kind of like dominos ) and in the travel edition the shadows would make it difficult to differentiate between some colors ( blue / green , orange / red ) . However , with this edition , it is much easier to tell the colors apart . The game itself is okay . We found it dragging at some points , but it is a good background game to play while having a good conversation . Also , keeping score ( by tally ) can become tedious .
5 #### This game is simple , fun , and enjoyable for almost every age . It plays like this : Each player randomly draws 6 tiles and keeps them secret from everyone else . The player who can make the biggest set goes first . Sets are made by either having the a row of the same shape but different colors , or different shapes of the same color . And you play until all tiles have been played . It 's pretty straightforward , fun and if you get bad tiles you have the option of swapping out for new ones on your turn . A lot of it is based on luck so if that bugs you then do n't get it . BUT , it does lend itself well to creative and visual people , since the more possibilities you 're able to see on the board , the more points you 'll be able get in the long run .
5 #### Young and old alike enjoy this game . Had a great time at the holidays !
5 #### Fun game ! I like that it can be a 2 person game as there are n't many good games that are 2 person . I think it is also good for all ages .
5 #### I use it in my first grade class and the kids love it !
5 #### If you enjoy strategy games this one is a fun game to play ! I do enjoy strategy games so it is fun fore me to try to reason out how to get the most points with each turn . The instructions are easy to understand . And the blocks are sturdy and the colors are vibrant . The only thing that I would say is that the orange and the red can easily be missed up , but that was n't a huge issue . I just needed to double check what I was playing down . I would highly recommend this game !
5 #### We love this game . Even my 4 year old daughter plays with us .
5 #### This has some really important game qualities : 1 ) It 's easy to just pick up and play , even if you 've never done it before . The list of rules is short and it does n't take long to figure them out . 2 ) It 's simple enough that a young child could play and enjoy it . 3 ) For advanced players , there is plenty of strategizing and foiling of others plans to go around . Even though it 's easy to learn and entertaining for young beginners , this is still fun for highly educated , highly competitive adults .
5 #### bought this game for 9 year old grandson . wanted a game we all could play rather then video games . love it
5 #### Fun game . I had never heard of it until recently . I got it for my 7 year old grandson . We had a blast playing . He does n't have a long attention span but he kept playing this one for a long time .
5 #### We just played tonight with our 7 & 10 year olds . I was surprised at how quickly our 7 year old caught on ! None of us had ever played before but this will become and easy family game for all of us . Quick learning curve .
5 #### Teen kids were n't interested at first since it looked too simple , and they liked to be challenged . It was both easier and harder than we thought and a lot of fun .
5 #### Family favorite ! Seriously , I love this game . I love the fact that I can beat my husband whenever we play alone ! hahahahahahaha ! This game has provided hours of fun for our whole family . And we 've had kids as young as five play with us . You have to buy this game .
5 #### We purchased this for A Christmas gift for our granddaughter . The family had a great time playing it . She is seven years old and the rest of us are various ages . Everyone was able to understand this concept and a great time was had by all . This is a wonderful game that young and old can enjoy . Is not difficult to learn . The game seems to be made of quality materials that look like they will hold up for a long time .
5 #### Great game that is fun for the entire family . We like puzzle games that require thought and this one delivers .
5 #### For up to four players . This is an easily learned game even for my 7 year old . Our entire family could join in including teens . This game provides hours of fun , making you think and strategize without having to invest hours in a long game . The games are just long enough . I would recommend this game for 1st and 2nd grades as well for learning patterns and strategy . It is a great way for them to develop critical thinking . I highly recommend this game as well as others we have purchased from Mindware .
5 #### My grand kids love this game . It works for the 5 to 12 year olds .
5 #### Super fun and easy to learn even for young players . You can learn more strategy as you play and for the older players .
5 #### We LOVE this game ! ! ! We play it with just a few of us , two of us , or at parties . It is easy enough you can play with children , while drinking , or on vacation . Simple concept , but challenging . We buy it as a wedding gift and attach the normal gift card to it . Its a fin little think to have around .
5 #### Looks like a fun game ... will be giving as a gift . Can`t wait to play it .
5 #### It takes a minute at first to help kids ( 7 & 8) understand the rules , but it 's one of those thing that once it finally clicks , they pick it up really quickly and enjoy it . The other reviews are true , it 's like dominoes and scrabble , but I thought it was a lot like the card game Set as well . It 's got that same " everything has to match or everything has to be different " element to it that makes it more challenging . And since it 's turn based , there 's still that competitive element of hoping that your opponent does n't see / take the opening that you see and plan on using . Really fun game , and yet really simple design . I like that the little squares are not super cheapie , so the game should last a long time .
2 #### I think we could love this game if the directions did n't suck . They are n't clear and leave a lot that you just have to guess at . Maybe once we figure out our house rules we will be bigger fans . Was super excited for this game but was left frustrated and let down by the lack of direction .
5 #### We really like Qwirkle ! It 's a great family strategy game . We 've had it for a while now and we always enjoy playing it . The game play is unique and challenging while not being too " hard . " I 'm glad we added this to our game collection .
5 #### We 've had loads of fun playing Qwirkle ever since we bought it six years ago . It 's a game that requires enough strategy to make it interesting , while at the same time being simple enough that a first - time player can be competitive . We 've played it with family and friends , and because it 's easy to explain , it 's fun for everyone . Almost anyone ages 10 and up can enjoy it . Moreover , a single " hand " takes maybe half an hour to play , which means you can play several hands in an evening .
5 #### My husband and I have a great time playing this one together .
5 #### This game was new to me , but thought my grandkids would like it , they had played it before and loved it so it gave us a good ouple of hours of funn time with grandma . Near the end it was a little more tricky on putting the tiles in place and that is what made it more fun you have to think a little and be creative .
5 #### I love this game wish I could find more friends to play with :)
5 #### It 's a great game , it 's fast to play and easy enough that anyone can pick it up quickly . It 's a simple matching of colors or shapes but there is a strategy with not wanting to set up someone else 's qwirkle while still scoring high yourself . Clever placement can go a long way to a win .
5 #### A Favorite Family Game ! We have had this game for a few years now and we still love it ! It is very portable so it goes on many vacations with us . The pieces are nicely made . I would highly recommend this game if your family likes to play board games !
5 #### This game is fun for everyone , so glad we got it !
5 #### Excellent game for anyone . Its VERY easy to learn , VERY easy to play and can be some what challenging at the same time . Game play is very much using your five tiles to play either matching colors OR matching shapes to score points . The more tiles you play and affect on the game board the more points you receive . It is durable as all items are thick wooden pieces painted and it comes in a cotton bag to hold it all . I 've taken it to the bar once or twice as drunk people can not hold a discussion but can play this game .
5 #### My 5 and 8 year old grandchildren love this game . It 's a great way to teach matching colors and shapes . I actually bought a second set so we can build a great big design . One set is for the coffee table , but two sets are for the dining room table ! After we are done the kids like to get our their little Leggo people and the Qwirkle design become a fantasy world for the kids . This is fun for the kids and me . Also , it keeps them entertained for a very long time ! I 've attached a couple of photos .
5 #### This is our go to gift for families . We have so much fun playing this . All of us , 7yrs-69yrs .
5 #### I love this game ! Good quality wooden game pieces .
5 #### We absolutely love this and everyone , all ages plays this
5 #### I bought this game for my grandson almost a year ago when he turned six . He and his sister love playing it . It 's a game that promotes thinking and problem - solving skills , and it 's fun for adults as well as for the kids . The game pieces are good quality .
4 #### this is an addictive game ... our family enjoys it much .. bought a travel one later
5 #### Great family game ! All ages enjoy this fun game !
5 #### Our family loves table games and this is one of our new favorites !
4 #### I 've only given this four stars , because I 've found this somewhat confusing for a seven year old . I assumed she would enjoy the game , but she 'd rather play Uno . Purchasing this for a seven year old , may well have been a mistake on my part . I 'll put it away , and bring it out a few months from now .
5 #### This has quickly become a family favorite ! I would call it a mix between sudoku and dominos where you have to match colors and/or shapes without repeating any color or shape in a row . If you 're lucky enough to get all 6 of either a shape or color in one turn , you get the maximum points which is called a " Qwirkle " . There is a lot of strategy involved and you have to look in all directions to make sure you are getting the most points possible . A couple of times we 've noticed that someone had actually repeated a shape or color and no one noticed for a couple of turns which was quite funny , but we kept on and finished anyway . There are 6 shapes and 6 colors with 3 of every tile so the possibilities are endless ! ! It takes about 20 - 30 minutes to play depending on how fast or slow some of the players are , so it does n't take forever . We 've found even some young kids are able to pick up on this although they might need a little bit of assistance . Great family game !
5 #### Great fun for the whole family . Matching shapes and matching colors even for the youngest ones .
5 #### It was a beautifully made toy . I was impressed !
5 #### our family loves board games and this is one of the best ones yet ... it will most probably take a game to learn it through properly but after that the game should be nice and easy , and for the younger players , it 's also a great way for pattern recognition !
5 #### Simple to learn and fun to play . Highly addictive .
5 #### This is such a fun game . It can be as challenging and strategic as you make it , or simple enough for kids to play . I love the high - quality wooden blocks , too .
5 #### Because of a delayed delivery problem , I 'm late in writing this review . My wait was well worth it . I love this game . It can be played with several players , or just by yourself . The games pieces are easy to store in the included cloth , draw - string bag .
5 #### The game is better played at a large table with a white ( not yellow ) light so that the colors of the tiles can be easily seen . The game pieces are of a very nice quality . This is one game that is definitely more fun when you play using the rules . Keep it simple when teaching younger children to play so they wo n't be discouraged . Once they 've gotten the hang of it , show them the more advanced moves . It really is a game of strategy for advanced players .
5 #### Qwirkle rage is a thing in our house . This game is great because you can play lightheartedly or cut - throat . It is fast and easy to teach / learn . Also have bought a few of these for gifts that were well - received .
5 #### We bought our Qwirkle game about four or five years ago , and we have had great fun playing it ever since . What I like about it is that it requires just enough strategy to make it interesting but is n't so difficult to figure out that a first - time player ca n't be competitive . We 've played it both with family members and with friends , and because the basic rules are simple and it 's easy to explain , it 's fun for everyone . While it may be beyond the grasp of the youngest of children , just about anyone from age 10 and up can really enjoy it . A single " hand " does n't take more than half an hour or so to play , which means you can play several hands in an evening .
5 #### It has been years since I found a new game that I really enjoyed . This is it . Fun and thought provoking but not super intense .
5 #### We just got this game for my daughter 's 6th birthday . We all love it ! This game has great quality wooden pieces and a nice cloth bag . The directions were included . The game is simple yet challenging . Its kind of like scrabble with shapes . All the 1 star reviews say they got a cheap version with no instructions or bag . The site must have gone back to selling the good one . Ours is perfect .
4 #### Family loves thsi game ... just wish the colors would not wear off as easy and color where better for GREEN / RED color blind people like myself .
5 #### really fun game , came on time , my grandson is eleven and likes it very much , its fun to play this game with him .
5 #### Great game for the whole family . We love playing this . I 've purchased it for other children in my family as well as friends and its a huge hit .
4 #### too complicated for this grandma and 11 yr old grandson
5 #### Great game , lots of fun . Almost everyone we have introduced to this game has bought one .
5 #### This is a fun little light tile placing game . The tiles can have one of six shapes in one of six different colors . On your turn , using tiles in your hand , you try to form a line of tiles that have either the same color or same shape . You score points for the number of tiles in the line(s ) you create . It 's a very simple abstract game that is easy to teach and play . Play goes fairly quickly . CAVEAT : There are some quality control issues with the manufacturer . My game did not come with any rules or drawstring back as was listed on the box . I was able to download the rules after a search on the internet . My wife knitted me a bag so that turned out okay . Some reviewers complained about bad or missing tiles . All my tiles were intact so perhaps I got lucky . despite these issues , I give the game 5 stars because I enjoy playing it .
4 #### Well I like it , but the grandchildren have not shown a lot of interest . The baby likes to play with the tiles . I think as the other children will like it more in a few years . We really have n't had much time to play with it , but it seems like a great game . I have no regrets buying it .
5 #### Introduced to this game by a child , we have come to love it .
5 #### I really enjoy playing this . I do recommend it and think families will have fun with it .
5 #### Fun game for adults and children can also play
3 #### Too intricate for the people I bought it for .
5 #### We love this game ! We got it for our 6yr old and it 's the first kid game we have had that adults can play because they WANT TO . We 've even played it without our daughter ! It 's REALLY FUN !
4 #### It is a fun game , but I think kids enjoy it more than adults .
5 #### This game is great to play with the whole family . I even played it with my four - year - old it is great for pattern and color recognition and sorting . It 's one of those games the family can play together without getting bored . It 's so variable each time you play is so different . The best part is cleaning up and putting them back in the box in a certain order . This is great for kids to learn how to do a matrix . Cleaning up is my daughters favorite part . The game itself is really high quality . The tiles are thick wood and it comes with a sturdy bag . The box is pretty heavy duty . The instructions are very straight forward
5 #### Love this game ! I wish more people could play at the same time ...
5 #### This game is great for kids and adults alike . This is our favorite game . I highly recommend it ! ! !
4 #### Fun game , though the fact that tiles are non - unique detracts some from the elegance and there are probably too many tiles overall ( might be worth sorting and playing with a subset sometimes ) . It 's not a serious enough strategy game that I want to play one long game instead of multiple short ones . It will scale well with number of players ( though it becomes less strategic with more , of course ) , which is a great trait .
5 #### We got this for our kindergarten as a game we could play as a family and it has not disappointed ! The first read thru the rules seemed a little complicated but by the end of the first game our son could play on his own . However , it was not to simple for grown ups . This can definitely be played with a lot of strategy as well . Neither my husband nor I were bored . It was challenging and fun for all of us . I am confident that we will be able to play this game for a long time . We are all excited for this weekends game night so that we can play it again !
5 #### I love board games . Qwirkle is sort of a mix between dominoes , scrabble , othello , and any number of match - up games ( think uno ) . What 's great about it is that even with deceptively simple looks ( match colors or shapes , 6 of each ) , the game gets really complex , really fast . Playing with a group is a lot of fun , because even when you have good moves , you 're not trying to give away the elusive Qwirkle ( a line of 6 ) , worth 12 points . It 's a great family game because of the relatively simple rules , and scoring is n't too complicated , but you definitely need to bring some addition skills ! Overall , a great game to bring out at family gatherings and with friends .
4 #### I wanted to find a game that the WHOLE family could play . This fits the bill . Rules are elegant in its simplicity . My youngest ( 6yr ) is not at a huge disadvantage against older siblings . Also there is no theme that appeals only to any specific sibling . Average game ~ 20 min : not too short or long . Pieces are durable and nice size to handle . I believe they also sell a travel set but this full size set is easily portable . I just wished pieces were better manufactured - it seems a little cheaply made in that pieces are not symmetrically cut ( ie , not quite square pieces ) and painted poorly ( eg , hint of green tinge to black background for green pieces , etc ) I enjoy playing this game
5 #### Like Scrabble , but you do n't have to be a word genius for two letter words .
5 #### I 'm on sort of a game kick these days . I have three kids , ages 6 , 5 , and 3 . I bought this game as a family present from Santa this past Christmas . This game is for really anyone . It 's a cross between scrabble , dominos , and rummy kub . It has colorful wooden tiles and a draw bag comes in the box . The box is really nice . The game was Germany Spiel des Jahres a couple years back , which is saying something , since achieving that rank is sort of a worldwide recognition . This game is light , easily played , and easily scored . But it still takes some strategy and brain useage . My 6 - yo gets it . My 5 - yo will get it soon ; she usually plays on my wife 's " team . " My 3 - yo wo n't get it for a while , but he likes to build things with my tiles while I 'm playing . We put the kids to bed and me and my wife played alone . I bought this game for my mother - in - law too , and she was way excited . This same company makes another game we bought called Q - Bits . My 5 - yo and 6 - yo get that game , it also is a high quality wooden game , and it 's also a thinking game . I have to say BIG thumbs up on Santa . My only recommendation ... I bought my wife a waffle iron too . So now I have waffles and we play this . A man 's got ta eat , ya know ?
5 #### Fun game for the age group . Can use to teach younger ones shapes and colors too .
5 #### My 12 year old has wanted this game for a couple years now . Loving it !
5 #### This is a great game ! ! My 6yo daughter got this for Christmas and it is so much fun !
5 #### Excellent game to stimulate the mind . Appropriate for 6 year old kids and 40 year old adults .
5 #### Fun for kids and adults ! This has been our favorite Christmas game purchase thus far . Scoring is a little complicated for kids , but we just play without scoring when playing with our 5yo . I like that it 's a fun game to play even if there 's no one " winning " .
5 #### Takes a bit to get your head around the scoring , but once you do , it is so fun .
5 #### We are loving the game ! Family with 11 , 13 , two thirty something 's and grandpa in his late fifties and everyone loves it . Even though we can only play four at a time , each of us enjoys the play . I love that the kids can play on their own and have fun , competitive play . It 's been addicting . We play daily . Great addition to any family game closet . ( the kids even love playing with their friends )
3 #### Game was difficult to understand at first . The group did not want to play it again .
5 #### wonderful game for almost all ages . qwirkle has been a go - to for Family gifts and has been enjoyed in our home for years .
5 #### Great game learning game for preschoolers ( colors , shapes , matching ) . Fun game when you have a variety of ages - everyone can play and have phone .
5 #### The reviews are right , great game , lots of fun !
5 #### This is a great game . I have played with a variety of people and it kept everyone entertained . Not overly complex but challenging at the same time , makes it the perfect combination for a good time . I also find that this game can be played at most ages which makes it nice for a family game night . One of my go to games at get togethers .
5 #### This is one of my favorite games . We play it all the time because it 's simple . Anyone can learn it , even kids . But it 's still challenging for whatever level you are at . Great family game .
5 #### My family loves this game ! From my 5 year old to mom and dad .
5 #### Good game ! ! I got it for Christmas and it 's fun ... Took a bit to work through the rules and we played incorrectly through the first time ( we played using whatever tiles you could rather than only of one color or one shape in a turn ) but the way we played was easier for our 6 year to join in ... So , we 'll probably play that way with her again as it kept the game shorter as well . Our daughter is pretty good with games so after a few times , she was getting into it ... But the positive was really that hubby and I enjoyed it with the two of us and since we usually have different tastes in games , this was great ! I recommend this to families , couples and is ideal as a " pull out " game with a couple of friends !
5 #### Terrific game . I frequently gift it to families . As for the age range , our 7 1/2 year old has been playing for a while but the strategy can prove difficult ( maximizing points ) She has most fun playing against neighborhood friends the same age vs. adults . Not many fun , challenging board games for only two players . This one is really fun .
5 #### This is a fun family game , truly good for all ages . Unlike some games where it 's difficult for the younger ones to beat the older ones , this game has a more level playing field and my younger child can beat the older one , and the kids can beat the adults . The theory behind it reminds me a bit of rumikube . One of our favorite family games !
2 #### my eight year old girl never plays with this game ... :(
5 #### Great thinking & strategy game . It comes with a muslin fabric bag that holds the pieces & the instruction sheet ( for when the cardboard box gets all torn ) . It 's really quick to learn , but fun to play again & again . My 7 year old can play this and we have a great bonding time . Highly recommend !
5 #### Our family really enjoys this game . Its fun for all ages as my 7 and 9 year old enjoy it as do I. Its a free flowing game that can be played anywhere which is an added benefit plus there is a fair amount of strategy involved .
5 #### I love this game , now I get copies of it for gifts to friends and family ! Simple rules - similar to dominos - matching colors or patterns to score points . Kids pick up on it quickly , too !
4 #### Fun tile placing game . It can drag a little as time goes one , but overall a very enjoyable game .
4 #### I still have to read the instructions whenever we pull it out of the old game closet , but it 's much easier for someone with my sort of " problems " to understand then let 's say prison rules dominoes people try to teach you after a keg stand and you 're accepted into their midst ( hmm could that be the cause of said " problems " ) . Nice construction . I imagine that I could have entertained myself for hours as a child with these ( pre - NES ) . Uniform shaped pieces with a variety of bold and simple decorations to make patterns ( nobody to play with ) . Ha aha haha . If you 've read this far , you have too much time . Or you 're fascinated by weirdos going about validating their existence in strange ways . I 'm an attention vampire . And to keel me you must play this game . Play more board games . Demand that stores have better board games . Have game nights at your house . Do n't let your children turn into me . hahahaha
3 #### It 's annoying to try to tally up points . Fun as a mindless game with my kindergartener .
5 #### My nine year old son loves this game and we enjoy playing it with him . It 's a game that makes you think and teaches kids patients . Good quality wood pieces that are kept in a sturdy canvas bag .
5 #### Excellent gift ! When opened there was an odd smell to the box and game , almost minty ... I believe it 's just from the materials .
4 #### One of our favorite board games that challenges the brain . It is suitable for all ages as even young children pick - up the simple game rules .
5 #### This is a super fun game . My daughter is 8 and she loves it . It was difficult at first to understand the strategy , but after 2 or 3 games we all got it .
4 #### While this game is great , I had a few issues with the craftsmanship of it . Some of the tiles looked a little dingy , some prints were a bit off center . Otherwise it is fantastic . I suppose you ca n't expect every box to be perfect . It 's a great game to play at parties since it 's basically a quicker version of Scrabble . Only thing I wish is that the reverse side had some kind of special marking to keep your place while you count score . Anyway , it 's a great game for kids too since they do n't need a high vocabulary to play it like you would Scrabble . You can play casually or get really intense into battles of logic and strategy .
3 #### Had difficulty with shipping and with the product missing both the pieces bag and the instructions ! That was a little tricky to explain on Christmas morning ! ! ! The game has received great reviews , but we were n't all that enthused after playing a few times .
5 #### A fantastic game . Incidentally has very good educational properties for the young .
5 #### Qwirkle is a game of patterns . It is much like Set , but 4 players can play and there are more tiles . My husband describes Qwirkle as " Sudoku " with tiles . It is lots of fun and is great for younger kids to get them to recognize patterns .
4 #### Great game , especially for younger gamers . Would really benefit from some kind of better re - boxing option for shelving ( the box it comes in is unnecessarily big , but the bag of tiles is awkward for shelving ) .
5 #### This game is great for the whole family . It took us awhile to figure out the directions which several of us felt were confusing but once we did everyone loved it ... from age 5 to 55 ! We took it to the beach and we played every night .
5 #### An all - time favorite game for our grandchildren and adult children . Always requested when they visit although they also have this game .
3 #### I had super high hopes for this game after reading all the reviews . For some reason our family just ca nt get into it ...
5 #### A challenge and an exciting game for all ages
5 #### This is a great family game or a fun party game . We received it as a Christmas gift from my in laws and it was quickly a family favorite . It 's fun just for me and my husband to play or for the whole family to join in .
5 #### Very fun game ! Has a lot of rules , so it 's a little more difficult for young children . We did n't keep score because we had to help the 8 year old we were playing with . It takes up a lot of time , so perfect for a rainy day !
5 #### A great game , if not a bit time consuming .
5 #### This game is a keeper ! Fun , simple to play yet strategic . If you love games this one it worth buying .
5 #### Loved playing this game with my 6 year old grand child
5 #### This is a really fun game for the whole family . Uses color and pattern matching so it 's simple , yet it does take some thought for strategy to really maximize points . My 10 year old has really taken to it and it is nice to see her using her head to plan out some moves ! !
5 #### My kids , 5 & 7 , love this game . It took a little longer for the 5 year old to catch on , and he still seems to focus a little too much on getting a Quickle vs. just accumulating points , but it 's a great " family game night " addition .
5 #### Love this game . It is a great family game for ages 8 to adult .. It 's challenging but easy to learn . My 9 and 12 year old grandchildren can beat me regularly .
5 #### Very satisfied with this and the fast shipping with Amazon Prime .
4 #### This is a good family game- young children can easily be included , yet adults can use strategy to make this a more challenging game .
5 #### Great family game because it is a game everyone can enjoy . We play it with my grandchildren and play a modified version which makes it fun for everyone and anyone can win . Basically , my 5 year old twin grand kids they only have to match one side . It is still too hard for them to try to get all sides . But , adults and older children play the normal way . This makes it pretty much anyones game .
5 #### Even our 5 year old gets in on the fun , as the official scorekeeper ! If you want to learn more about the game , go to Youtube and search " Tabletop Quirkle " and watch Wil Wheaton show you how it 's played .
5 #### this game is made well . I love the bag that is has with it , it is made well also . We have only had the opportunity to play it once , but it seems to be fun . The only con I can see is I wish it had a pencil and paper with it . I can never seem to find one around the cabin . But that is an easy fix ... :)
5 #### Fun , easy game and easy to transport . I highly recommend this addition to you games . Love , love , love that it is not plastic ! It is wood and painted .
5 #### Our family and friends enjoy playing this game with us . Our grandchildren ages 8 & 10 are so good at it they can beat their grandparents easily . A great game to play with young and old .
5 #### I bought this game for my 2 years old son . This game is outstanding for learning shapes , colors , sequences , memory game and groups . I know that we will improving age by age the way we will playing with it . I am very satisfied . Even the price is expensive , it is really interesting for using and teaching your kids the multiple ways that we can play with it .
5 #### This is a very fun family game . It 's good for all ages . Kids have to plan ahead before their move ... easy to understand .
5 #### Both my Grandchildren ages 5 and 10 loved this game , as well as Grandpa who they told to " Please sit on the couch " and let us play !
4 #### I think it 's a neat game . My kids never played with it alot . It comes with a bag to take along on trips if you want . I actually wish my kids would play it more .
4 #### This game can be simple when played by children or those not very analytical , or it can be really challenging if you use every possible combination of " what works where " . It 's a great game for kids or for strategy minded puzzlers , which is rare . The tiles are very high quality and my only complaint is that indoor lighting can make the red / orange tiles appear the same color and the purple / blue look the same too . A pretty small complaint , all said . Much fun !
5 #### My whole family ( ages 5 - 80 ) all love this game . It is easy to learn yet has enough strategy to make it really fun . It 's also nice that it can be played outside because there are n't any cards or a game board that would blow away or get ruined if wet . The game is sort of like dominoes only way more fun and the bright colors against the black tiles look so cool . I 've actually bought 3 of these games . One for us , one for my parents and one for our son & his wife .
5 #### We 've had our Qwirkle game for more than three years now and have played it many times . For a game that has seemingly simple rules , it requires a significant amount of strategy to play it well . Every game is different and requires a good deal of thinking . Thankfully , the explanation of the rules that comes with the game lays out the rules in an easy - to - understand , logical fashion and explains all the possible combinations clearly and in detail . There 's no setup involved . All one needs is a fairly large smooth surface to play it on ( like a dining - room table ) . The individual pieces are made of wood and appear to be nearly indestructible . It 's compact and stores easily . About the only problem is that the colors of the different pieces are hard to differentiate . Even in good light it is difficult sometimes to tell the orange and red apart and the blue and green . Other than this , this is a great game and has provided many hours of fun for our family and guests .
5 #### We bought this for our 6 year old granddaughter for Christmas . We all love the game . The pieces are well made too .
5 #### My grand daughter loves this game , she is 7 yrs old and it is great for counting and color object skills . she can even beat the adults at this game . great delivery and service ! Very happy !
5 #### Everyone should have this game ! It is great for all ages . My kids started playing at 4 or 5 . We often do n't keep score . It is n't necessary for kids to have a score yet . We always have fun with it !
5 #### This is the one family game we can all play and works even with language barriers ( my in - laws do n't speak English ) and my kids can play with their grandparents and everyone has fun . My daughter first started playing this with us at age 3 - and sometimes she wins ! This is truly the best game in the world and I give it as my preferred gift to friends with kids . Great price and wonderful convenience having it on Amazon !
5 #### My small kids can understand this game , but it has enough strategy that the older ones can also enjoy it .
1 #### Like many others the box was sealed but had no bag inside , no instructions , the paint was rough and peeling . In addition the wooden tile paint smelled terrible ! ! I tried airing out the tiles for a week on the porch but everyone who saw the game said the odor of the tiles was horrible and probably toxic paint . I threw the game away and wish I could reorder but too many others say they were disappointed by knockoffs also .
5 #### What a great strategy game that will help teach younger kids matching skills ( as well as colors and shapes ) and will also prove to be challenging enough for adults to play without the kids . Its just an all - around fun game that reminds me of scrabble with shapes and a pinch of Sudoku . The idea is to build off of the other players tiles , building rows of colors and shapes with no overlapping in order to rack up points and create qwirkles ( complete rows of either one specific shape , all six colors , or all shapes , one color ) . The game becomes tricky when other players block off possible qwirkles , and new rows start spurring off left and right . Its the perfect balance of ease and challenge , and a great game for everyone in your house !
5 #### Our 7 year old grandson wanted this game and he loves it . Perfect family game to grow into also . Not a kiddy game .
5 #### This game is deceptively simple . It requires critical thinking , planning and loads of concentration . It took two adults one game playing slowly and reviewing the rules to get the hang of it . It takes 30 - 45 mins to play depending on how many are playing . This is our favorite game that we have bought in the past five years . Highly recommend .
5 #### Bought this game for " Family Night " at our son and daughter - in - law 's house . We have never played it , but they have told us they really enjoy playing it .
5 #### I recommend this game as it is fun to play and all ages can participate . It deserves it high ratings !
3 #### This game was very " Meh " for me . We hardly ever play it . Fun idea I suppose , but for whatever reason it just does n't stay interesting for too long .
5 #### Our sharp grandkids played it with us , and enjoyed it , but needed our help . Their ages are 5 , 8 , and 10 .
5 #### Simply put , this game is for all ages . Just a delight to play , so easy to learn , but with so many twist and turns . There is usually no clear winner till the very end of the game . When the game is finally completed , with a ' surprise ' winner so many times , I am always reminded of what Yogi Berra said : " It ai nt over till the fat lady sings . " I usually do n't get to sing , but this is still a fascinating game .
5 #### We bought this as part of a family game night Christmas basket for our very good friends & neighbors with 2 daughters . They LOVE this game and we have been over several times to play it with them . It makes thinking a lot of fun ! !
4 #### Fun game for the whole family . The only thing I do n't like about this game is the extensive recording of points on paper . I feel like this aspect could have been better integrated in the game itself . It 's really annoying to constantly keep track of score on a piece of paper after each person plays tiles . Otherwise a good and fun game !
5 #### Terrific strategy game , simple , easy to learn , but it really makes you think ! This is great for me to play with the kids as my visual processing skills are not the best . Perhaps I 'm making new neural connections . :) Some suggestions for improvement : It would be great to have little trays to hold the tiles at a better angle for viewing - maybe like the tile holders Scrabble has ( though bigger ) . Also re : storage - a drawstring bag would be appreciated ! Much better than trying to put it back in the box after each game , which is a pain . Also , my game had no instructions - luckily they are readily available online . I highly recommend this game for kids and adults . Tricky and fun .
5 #### The first time I played the game with 2 other players , who both thought they were smarter than me and laughed at me when I asked questions on how they interpreted the rules . One of my opponents had played the game prior to our " match " on more than one occasion . It turned out , I had interpreted the rules correctly and missed many opportunities to play the way I should have been " allowed " to play , but I still beat the other two players . I would play every day if I could . Great game for mental stimulation , motor skills , strategy , etc .
4 #### Our family with 3 boys ( 11 , 9 , 6 ) likes this game but the 6 year old usually is done before the game is actually over :) It can take a while to play . The scoring is also fairly complex , despite the easy concept . I still like it and recommend it to families , just be aware of the length .
5 #### My daughter ( 5 ) My husband and I all love this game . My daughter asks us to play this game all the time . We brought it to a family party after Christmas and all the kids 5 - 12 loved playing it .
5 #### So much fun for people of all ages . I only wish the company had chosen slightly different shades for the colors . We have found that some players have a difficult time distinguishing between the purple and blue , and between the red and orange . Our family does n't have that problem , but it has happened enough times that we realize it 's an issue .
4 #### This is a great game . Does not take long to learn the rules . Can take up to an hour to play a game which is great . Fun , fun , fun trying to outwit others for that Qwirkle .
5 #### Bought a second game to make Mega - Quirkle and have 8 people play .... makes it harder to count tiles .... IT was great ! Woof !
5 #### My son had requested we buy family games for his 3 , 5 and 7 year olds at Christmas . I read so many reviews on games I 'd never heard of and this was one that I took a chance on . When she opened it , my almost 8 year old grand daughter exclaimed that " this is the game we have in our gifted class at school " and was so excited that I knew I 'd made the right choice .
5 #### Takes a bit to get the rules down , but once you learn it , it 's really fun for all ages . Looking into the travel size one .
5 #### My husband and I love this game because the two of us can play a challenging game together . It is also great for a group . We purchased this as a gift for my brother - in - law ( age 23 ) and it has quickly become a favorite !
5 #### Bought this for our five year old and was pleasantly surprised at how much fun it is for the whole family . So glad we got this game !
5 #### This was a Christmas gift and enjoyed by all of the family , adults and 5 year old , I highly recommend it for up to 4 players .
4 #### I love this game so I purchased it for my grandson for Christmas . I have n't had the chance to play the game with him yet so I do n't know if it was a good fit for him . I think as the newness of his other gifts wears off , he 'll turn to this game .
4 #### Bought this for our 6 year old grandson and we enjoy playing . Still learning moves and rules - but not hard .
5 #### This is a great game for kids and for adults , or for them to play together . It is well made and will last forever . The premise of the game sounds easier than the actuality and it will entertain all ages .
5 #### We bought this game on a recommendation from someone who 's only played it with more than 2 players . It 's a great game to play if you want a quick under 30 minute round . We play it quite often and we never get sick of it . Great game for all ages as well with the use of symbols and no words .
1 #### This came with only the tiles . No instructions and we still have not figured out a way to print instructions from Mindware 's site . There is also supposed to be a bag -- this was missing , too .
5 #### We gave this game to our 8 year old granddaughter . It took her and I a while to figure out the rules , but they are well written out , and once we applied the " example " game , we figured it out . We 've played it several times with older brother , parents and grandfather . What a game ! It definitely is challenging and I know , as a retired teacher , it is extremely good for thinking , spatial knowledge , and conceptual development . Getting a " qwirkle " is one of our goals when we play . 10 year old brother got 7 qwirkles in one game and I still ca n't get over that ! This really is worth every penny for kids . It is similar to scrabble , but uses shapes and colors in the " crosswords " of patterns . Everything has to match in some way - either by color or shape . Exceptional game and really expands the brain !
5 #### Bought this game because I heard people talk about it and was not disappointed . Great family fun ! The only negatives I could come up with would be some of the colors are hard to see against the black tiles and I wish more than four people could play at a time .
5 #### A friend gave my daughter one of these . There are some great videos of how to play on Youtube . We loved it so much I bought one for my sisters family and my brothers family . It 's one of those simple games that adults can enjoy as well as children .
5 #### I bought several of them for m kids and as birthday gifts . All kids loved it . My daughter even took it to school for a " game day " and could not keep up with those who wanted to play with her . Highly recommended .
5 #### Since I ordered this game a year ago - without knowing anything about it - it 's become the number one favorite board game of all my friends . Most of my friends now own this game , and my monthly game group plays it almost exclusively . I even play it over my lunch hour at work several times a week with some other Qwirkle fanatics . One thing I like about the game is that two people can enjoy it as much as 4 or 5 . This is one of many very creative games offered by Mindware .... check out their website .
4 #### The day after Christmas friends came to play at our house- The kids wanted to show their friends how to play Quirkle.--Not the new video games . Now that is a recommendation ! ! !
2 #### The box for this says that the game includes both a bag and instructions . Neither were present and I do n't know how they would have fit it into the box since the tiles * just * fit if laid perfectly flat in three layers . I 'm lazy so I have n't decided if i 'm returning this or just sourcing a bag and getting instructions off the Internet , but think twice before buying this SKU of this game
5 #### Bought this for my grandchildren for Christmas . It is age appropriate for both adults and children and should provide several hours of entertainment . I like these types of sets because the have an educational value as well as being a toy . Well pleased .
5 #### I love Qwirkle . It is fun whether two or more play . Very challenging when their are more players . This is a great family game addition to your collection .
5 #### Also purchased this for the twins ( 11 years old ) . Not sure they love it , but I 've played this game and love it !
5 #### Already a family favorite after just one weekend ! My 6 year old grand daughter kicks my butt in this game . I 've played this game with both kids and adults , and a mix of both , and we always have a great time . It 's an easy concept game so it 's quick to learn . The key is looking at all your options so you can maximize your points while trying to not setup a possible Quirkle for someone else .
5 #### Our family enjoys playing this game . It is easy to pick up on . I would also recommend this game for the classroom . It is perfect for rainy day recess time and for math class when studying geometry , or science when discussing characteristics . This is a great spatial and patterning game .
4 #### This is one of those remarkable games that in our family is enjoyed by everyone from 7 yrs old to grandparents . Each age group plays at a different depth of strategy and all enjoy even with mixed ages playing same game assuming some basic courtesy and respect is present ! My only compaint is that the game requires ability to differentiate colors and shapes and some of the color tones are so muted is difficult for middle - age eyes to distinguish .
3 #### A version of dominoes for kids , but a little boring from the kids point of view . It is better for just practicing colors and shapes .
4 #### I love the game , but my kids do n't so much . They would rather play Spot It or UNO or SkipBo or regular Dominos .
5 #### I 've purchased this for my child 's friends for birthday parties too . This can be as low at $ 18 . I like the game enough that I bought the smaller size too . I love that it comes with a bag .
4 #### This game is a great brain - teaser . It 's for 2 - 4 players . My adult family has really enjoyed it . Have n't tried it with kids yet but I think an older child could play easily enough .
5 #### My six year old granddaughter can grasp it and we all enjoy playing it together . Can be played and enjoyed at different levels ( i.e. with or without defensive measures ) .
5 #### This is a cute well made game for my grand kids . They enjoy playing this game . The Amazon description was very clear and accurate . The product was packaged well and arrived in good condition .
5 #### My family loves this game ! It 's easy to learn , but can involve strategy for more experienced players . The tiles are well - made and feel great in your hands . I am glad I added this to my game collection .
5 #### I ca n't wait to play this game with my grandson ! I think this might keep him busy for a little while !
5 #### I love the puzzle like logical quality of color and shape - matching . In a way this is like the game of Set in that concept . However , the continuous counting and color recognition while gaining points is especially stimulating !
5 #### Great game ! Even our 4 year and 6 year olds have a fun time trying to find and make patterns .
1 #### Purchased this for our 6 year old . tried to play it once . the instructions were too difficult to understand and play . getting rid of it today .
5 #### Grandchildren loved this game . It was an immediate hit with them , even though they differed in ages ... ranging from six to nine . Works as a great FAMILY game .
5 #### We LOVE this game . 5 year old , 9 year old , 30 year old parents , 60 year old grandparents all love it and play together . Great game , it fun , educational , just really classic . highly recommended for ALL ages .
5 #### A family game for all members- from the youngest to the oldest . Simple to learn and fun for everyone . Recommend highly
5 #### This is a very easy game to learn where you can easily modify the rules to play for all ages . While , I bought this game to use with my young clients , my 2.5 and 4 year old daughters both loved playing a modified version of the game .
4 #### We 're always on the lookout for a new game . Because of the reviews I decided to give this one a try . The reviews were right ... this is a good game for everyone . We 've played it over 10 times and still finding new ways to be strategic . We 're a family of 4 with the youngest being 12 . All of us learned it easily and quickly . At first we took it easy ( strategic - wise ) on our 12 year old but she kept beating us ! This game can be simple and quick or as strategic as scrabble depending how you want to play it . If you 're looking for something new - give it a try !
4 #### This game is great for families with children of varying ages . It can be played and enjoyed by the whole family .
5 #### Probably best for kids 8 + , altho younger might manage with some help ..... but kids love it and the best part is that it is n't boring for adults . The tiles make a colorful design as you build the game and the pieces are high quality wood . I would buy more as gifts .
4 #### It is a fun game . I am not sure how long it will hold up , though . The pieces chip black paint very easily .
5 #### The Qwirkle board game was a Christmas gift for my twin nephews . I was told they really enjoyed the game . The vendor was quick to ship it before Christmas .
4 #### This is a clever game and can be played by most members of a family , even the grade school kids get involved and can win . It 's fun , and does n't take all night or day to play .
5 #### This is a REALLY fun game . It 's fairly easy to understand , and great to play with the whole fam ( up to 6 players / teams , i think ) . Really flexes your brain , but in a fun way that wo n't make anyone feel dumb ( like Trivial Pursuit sometimes can ! )
5 #### Very stimulating game and keeps you thinking . When you first play to get the hang of things it can be quite confusing . But once you worked it out , its like riding a bike . I brought this for my 6 year old niece , the age guide is 6 + but she lost interest very quickly because i think its too advanced for her age . I ended up playing with my older sister and we spent about 40 mins on one game . Was addicted to it .
5 #### Simple game with hi replayability . Our 6 year old can play it . One of the best features is that the adults still enjoy playing . Highly recommend .
4 #### Really like this game for our two Grandchildren . We all like to play and can enjoy it through the years .
5 #### The whole family plays this ... from the 6 yr old who proclaimed it to be " My Favoritest Game ... I love the little blocks " to the elders ( but not necessarily wiser ) 66 year old . We all enjoy the " family " times we have ... good memories , good fun . The younger ones learn " matching " and the young adults learn strategy and EVERYONE has fun !
5 #### Qwirkle is a very simple , yet very fun game ! Kind of like a cross between matching and dominoes . What I really like is that you can play it with almost any number of players , and even relatively young children ( such as my six - year - old ) can play competitively .
4 #### Qwirkle is a game that makes you stop and think about size and color relationships . It only takes about 30 minutes to complete , so it 's great for when you do n't have an hour to play something .
5 #### My 5 and 7 year olds love playing this game as do my husband and I. It is a fun game that you can transport and play anywhere . Keeping score can be difficult for younger kids so an older child or adult will need to help if a score is going to be kept . If no score is going to be kept and they are just playing until someone runs out first , then no adult is needed .
5 #### This game is really simple but a lot of fun ! ! ! It is a great family game and not to complicated to play with young children . We play with our 4,3 , and 2 year old children . Our 2 year old typically plays on either mommy or daddy 's team or he really likes to hand out the tiles when a player needs new pieces to play . He pays extra attention to how many tiles each player used on their last turn so he knows exactly the right amount to hand out so it really helps with his counting skills . Our 3 and 4 year old boys play their own tiles but we do need to help them " strategically " speaking . Definitely helps for kids to recognize patterns and practice their " finer " motor skills when it comes to placing the tiles on the board without wrecking the board . I really enjoy this . The tiles are wooden and decent quality . It comes with a pouch to keep all of the tiles together . My favorite aspect of this game is that it builds memories with the whole family !
5 #### We love this game and so do our kids and grandkids . It 's nice to have a fresh concept in a table game . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I gave this as a gift to my great niece on her 6th birthday . She opened it and began playing immediately . A friend said they had the game and had n't really ever played by the actual rules yet . They had adjusted them to fit the ability of her young grandson . The pieces are sturdy and colorful and they come with a bag to keep it all together . I have n't gotten to play with my great - niece yet , but I am sure she is enjoying it with her 3 year old brother .
5 #### Bought this game for my granddaughter when she was three . She already knew her colors and shapes , so that educational value was n't of benefit to us . Still , she LOVES to play with them ! One of her favorite games is to match them , " Concentration " style . She gets the whole set out to play that way , which of course makes the game interminable ! If I limit her to only two of each , it 's quick and fun . We 've also used them to create patterns , and she has lined them up on the floor and made " roads " for her duplo car . She stacks them into towers . She piles them into her little wagon and pulls them around the house . She 's used them to make facial features on the floor . The only way she does n't get excited about playing with them is the primary idea of a dominoes game . Since she 's only four now ... I 'm sure we 'll do that eventually ! Really , worth every penny , very durable and esthetically pleasing as well .
5 #### I ordered this expecting a " dumb " game to play when we 're bored but it actually does take some skill . It only took one game for us to understand what was going on and then after that we were making qwirkle 's ( a term in the game for getting six in a row ) and all kinds of combos . It 's a fun easy game to take to parties since it 's easy to learn yet hard to master . Shapes and colors make it easy for everyone and since I 'm a horrible speller I like this much better than Scrabble but it has the same feel .
5 #### We purchased this for my in - laws for Christmas this year and played with my father - in - law , step - mother - in - law , brother - in - law ( 11 ) , and sister - in - law ( 13 ) . Everyone LOVED it . The game was quick to pick up and start playing as the rules are not too complicated . As we played more it remained challenging as we all started to develop more strategy . Played with 6 people and the games usually averaged 30 minutes - about the perfect time .
5 #### Fun game to play with grandkids . They also have fun stacking them and knocking them down , sorting them , etc . A great purchase !
5 #### I love puzzle games and this one has become a favorite . The rules are simple to understand and it all comes down to your strategy . Great to play with a group or just two .
5 #### I got this game for grandchildren . They range from the ages of 18 to 11 and it was a good game for that and older folks so it was a win , win .
5 #### This is one of our favorite games because everyone can play it well . The tiles are high quality as is the bag the tiles are selected from . It is fun to play as a family from age 5 and up . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### Unlike a lot of games I 've gotten for my daughter , Qwirkle was one I was not familiar with from having playing it as a child . Not sure if it was around back then , or if it 's just a modern version of a classic concept ( like dominoes perhaps ? ) . All I know is that I love playing it and so does my almost - six year old daughter . And the cool thing is we can each play at our own level and still play together . I do n't have to " dumb down " my playing at all . And she never has to feel like I 'm letting her win . Her moves have surprised and challenged me just as often as the other way around . Not many games like that , are there ? Highly recommend .
5 #### This is a great game that different ages can play together . The pieces are easy to handle . I wanted something that grandparents could play with grandchildren , and that my parents could play to help fight dementia . I recommend this game for those reasons .
5 #### This is our new favorite game . It is fun and easy to play . I also used it as a teaching tool for our toddler to help with colors and shapes !
5 #### My kids and the kids I teach love this game . It 's a simple yet strategic game . You will enjoy this game .
5 #### The kids ( 9 and 11 years old ) love this game and so do the parents and grandparents .. Nice quality wood game pieces , with a nice clothbag included Makes a nice gift .
5 #### This is a game that anyone above 5 can play and enjoy . It lends itsrelf to playing alone or in teams and provodes endless hour of entertainment and good natured competition . Our children and grandchildren love to play it with us .
5 #### This game is so much fun and best part even the little ones can play . No big rules , no set up or anything ... just out of the box and ready to play . Fantastic concept . Colors are vibrant , I hope the paint holds on without chipping .
5 #### This is fun and challenging for the whole family and can even compete with the video games because of the personal interactions .
5 #### This is the first time any of our friends and family have seen this game . It intrigued me enough to buy it . So far , we 've played in one time and once we got the idea of the game , it was really fun to play . The shapes and colors are really nice and bright so we 're going to play this game in a modified fashion with our 3 grandchildren . Boys 7 and 5 and our little princess at 2 1/2 years old . They 'll be able to match shapes and colors and will have a great time with us . There wo n't be many rules for them to understand as we 'll match them to their level of understanding . Now I 've run across a new form that uses blocks which will make the game more complicated in puzzling our way to win . Will eventually get it , too , but right now this game is THE one we 'll enjoy as we teach more friends and family how to play . Great game . Just buy it , especially if you like puzzles or Dominoes . Fun for all ages regardless of what the box age states .
5 #### Thank goodness . Something I can play with my six year old son , who has Asperger 's and my , forty five year old molecular biologist boyfriend and everyone is happy . Great game . Simple and challenging , all at once . Perfect .
5 #### We have really loved and enjoyed this game ! Sometimes we play it with children and sometimes we play it with just the adults . Easy to learn and understand . Allows for conversation while playing but just enough strategy involved to make it fun as well .
4 #### Had a lot of fun playing with the kids and adults . Easy to learn and moderately challenging for most levels .
5 #### My six - year - old daughter and I have played this game a few times since receiving it . It is * * Fun * * Challenging * * A great way to spend time together * * Easier yet more challenging than Scrabble ! As a Scrabble lover , I understand that it can be frustrating for younger cutie pies to keep up without getting frustrated ( with Scrabble ) . This game has a similar premise : creating a grid by building or adding onto rows - in this game : of color or shape . Starting a new row or finding a way finish an existing row of shapes or color ( " Qwirkle ! " ) really makes you use your thinker BUT it 's very fun so the mental challenge is greatly rewarded with lots of smiles and high - fives :) We have yet to use the scoring system ... We just like the challenge of tile arranging !
4 #### This is a little hard to get the " hang " of the rule but fun to play . Better for kids 8 years old and upward .
5 #### This is not an average mind numbing game . There is stratagy and thinking envolved , be we love it . Our 6 year old struggles getting through it , but it stretches him every time he plays .
4 #### Need a gift for a family that loves game nights . They say all of the kids get to play even the 5 year old and it does nt bore the parents .
5 #### It 's rare that I can get my 12 year old and 7 year old to agree on anything to do together . This game is super fun , and allows us all to play . Recommend ! !
3 #### Bought for a Christmas gift to 7 and 9 year old girls . They were not impressed with the gift . Like other things better . Maybe , when their Mom sits down with them they will get excited about the game .
4 #### This is a good game if your kids are highly analytical and strategic . It is a trumped up version of dominoes and plays well once you get into it . It can teach both kids and adults a thing or two about thinking . I do have to choose this game for my kids as they like to play games that are more like junk food for the brain , but they can maintain interest for a while once it is underway . My kids are 14 and 11 . I certainly would n't go much younger than that , they will be bored .
5 #### I gave this as a gift to some cousins . They are 6 and 8 . They immediately opened it and we all got engaged in this game quickly !
4 #### Both my 9- and 5 - year old can play this , which is a rarity . Would have given 5 stars , but the time between turns can be exasperating . The game packs into its own pouch , which is an added portability benefit .
5 #### I got this for my daughter for Christmas . She plays it with Mom , friends , and her 2 younger brothers . It has been an instant hit .
5 #### We love this game as a family . It can be as challenging or easy as you want it to be , making it good for all ages .
5 #### A group of us played this recently at an " end of the world " party a few weeks ago and found it fun but challenging . At first it seems like it might be too easy , but once you truly understand the rules , strategy becomes very important . Not sure that youngsters would understand all the nuances , but they could still play with some adult assistance . It does n't take a long time to play ( we finished three games in about an hour ) .
5 #### We got this for our kids but we ended up playing ourselves . The kids get the idea , but the strategy is beyond them ( the older is 6 , younger is 3 ) . For them , they just match the colors / shapes while the adults really try to max out points . Easy to learn , quick game , fun for everyone .
4 #### I thnk that this game is great for a wide range of ages / abilities . We played initially with our 6 year old and we decided to count the quirkles . That made it more acceptable for her age . If we had kept score as outlined in the instructions , she would have lost miserably . But , as it was , she hung in there and did a great job .
4 #### The Qwirkle board game is fun and we play it as a family . I would recommend it as a gift .
5 #### We got one of these games on the recommendations on Amazon . We were not disappointed , it is fun , quick to learn , and can be played with children as well as adults . I tried it on all of them from grand kids to married and college kids and my husband and I alone . It was fun in every instance . We then bought 13 games for Christmas presents for friends and families confident that it would be an addition to good times together . Recommend it as well as Spot It , both new games we tried this year .
5 #### We play this game with young and old . For the young kids , it is easy if they recognize colors and shapes . For the older ones , there is some stragegy involved to get the most point . A very fun and engaging game for the family
5 #### I 've taught all my friends to play ( adults ) and we now hold an annual Qwirkle championship play off . Easy to learn . Decide if you want to play cooperatively or offensively . I take it with me when I travel . Have nt found a friend yet who does nt enjoy this game .
5 #### We got this game for our son last Christmas and he still plays with it . It 's really a lot of fun !
5 #### We love this game ! It makes mom and dad think , but even our seven year old can play . Our three year old is in charge of doling out the tiles for us , which keeps him entertained while we play .
5 #### This was purchased for my great grandson who likes stragity games . It is for christmas but it is something he asked for .
5 #### It 's deceptively simple at first glance . The second time you play it you start to realize how strategic it can be .
5 #### I love this game .... perfect for playing with the grandkids . Easy to learn . For little ones you can play with shapes and colors .
5 #### Bought this game based on other reviews , my 3 and 4 year old loved it . they may not always play the game the way it was intended , but the possibilbities are endless for matching and sorting . . . a key development for their age !
3 #### It 's a fun game for kids of all ages and adults . Colors are hard to distinguish for individuals with color blindness , though !
5 #### I do n't think that my kids are following the exact rules but they still love this game ! I was secretly pleased when I also say this game at their elementary school .
5 #### It is hard to find a game for kids and adults to play together , but this game is great ! It is challenging and educational for kids . I played it with a 5 year old and 8 year old and they both loved it and only needed a few reminders of the rules . It teaches patterns , and is very fun . It is really well made too , nowadays most things are so cheap but this game is wonderful . A great game to purchase for a family !
5 #### I bought this for my brother 's family . They loved it . My mom played it while she stayed at his house and is now asking for it for Christmas . It is a great family game and appropriate for all ages .
5 #### Used with ALZ patients and is enjoyed . Used for memory work and color recognition and pattern making . Sturdy and practical .
5 #### Bought this for my son when he was 5.5 and he loves it so much that it has become our go to gift for 5 and 6 yr old kids . It 's a hit !
5 #### I bought this game for my 4 year old for his birthday . We played it shortly after his birthday and he needed a little help when it was his turn . He got a little frustrated the first time we played because he wanted to do it all by himself . After playing this game a handful of times he needs very little help now . The game is fun for the adults in the house too . It reminds me a little of dominos because you have to match future pieces with pieces previously played . I think it is a little easier to play than dominos because there is a little less strategy involved . However , it is still a super fun game . I would recommend this game for a bright 4 year old , but be prepared to provide a little assistance . A typical 5 or 6 year old should be able to play this game with little to no help . This is a fun family game that everyone can play and enjoy !
5 #### I am a certified Scrabble Club Director and I think that this game does what Scrabble is so good at doing without the need to know words . At it 's core Scrabble is a game of logic and pattern recognition and those are the two crucial elements of Qwirkle . In this game you maximize your points by scoring a row of 6 same shapes of different colors or 6 different shapes of the same color . I play this game with my nephews who love it . The playing pieces are sturdy wooden blocks so the game will stand up to a lot and it is very easy to learn and to teach .
5 #### " lovely " . the perfect present for my little girl the color the size all is perfect , i m really happy when i see play with this
5 #### I bought this game on reading the positive reviews , must say one of the best buys I 've made . I play with the wife & kids it 's so much fun . My 6 yr old has actually beaten me a couple of times , I was really trying to win . Very easy to learn & each game is always different depending where you place the pieces . A Must buy . So much fun .
5 #### Our friends taught us how to play this game and we had to have it . Gave several as gifts last Christmas . Fun , thoughtful yet relaxing interactive game . Everyone should own it . Highly recommend seller .
5 #### I love this game ! It requires a lot of thinking and logic . My 7 year old daughter needs help sometimes but it is a lot of fun ! The pieces are great quality and will last many years .
5 #### We really enjoy this game of Quirkle . It has been played by Adults and even young children in our extended family . It can be easy for the young ones , or challenging for the greater thinkers as they come up with complicated moves . It is a little like playing scrabble , but easier !
5 #### Game is great for adults as well as children . A mothers group that I meet with love to play this game ! It teaches strategy and categorization to kids too !
4 #### This game is pretty simple to learn . The idea is to make ' runs ' by matching colors or shapes . Scoring varies based on the tiles you place in a single play and if you are able to complete a series . My daughters enjoying playing it , especially my 8 year old . I find the game a little on the simple side for adults but it is much more enjoyable to play over Candyland and other child targeted board games . This game is a great family game . Add another game like Sequence and you have the makings for an enjoyable family game night .
5 #### I came across this game about a year ago and read the reviews . I decided I was going to buy it , and added it to my wishlist for future reference . A few days ago I ordered it and after it arrived , my boyfriend and I sat down to play it . I 'm 31 , and he 's 33 . We played two games , both of which he hung me out to dry , but we had fun playing . The game might start out simple but it quickly because one of strategy and is a definite challenge . It reminds me a lot of Scrabble , but with colors and shaped instead of words . I can see this game getting a lot of rotation in the future . Great buy !
5 #### My 10 year old LOVES this game ! Grandma and Mom like to play too . My 6 year old can play with help . Great family game and makes the kids think .
5 #### I play this with my 10 year old . It is very nice game . Game pieces are hard wood and durable . Does not need anything further . It helps kid to design a strategy , anticipate future moves , locate patterns , plan moves based on their current pieces . Overall I loved it . The game is certainly for kids in 8 - 12 range .
5 #### This game is like UNO meets dominos . I gave this toy a 5 star because it is super fun to play with any age kid . And I do mean ANY age . It became the adult game during shared family dinners with firends . Then we let the kids play . They just could not stand seeing us have that much fun . Now that we incorporated the kids and I am talking ages 3 - 10 its even more fun . We have ammended the first play of the game rules a bit . And we play " nice " or " to the death . " Nice is when we try to make the perfect game board with as many " Qwirkles " as possible . As for " to the death " its mean and selfish plays that benefit that player at that moment . Either way its a hoot . It 's as stratigic as you want to make it . Gave it as Christmas gifts to special families this year . COuld not determine if it was to ensure i could play at their house or so they could enjoy the game with their family . It recv'd a 4 instead of 5 on durability because it is a choking hazard to small children but MY DARN DOG keeps trying to get in on the game by capturing pieces in his face as they fall to the ground . As I say it can get a little rough in play ! Great game !
5 #### My whole family enjoys playing this game , my 4 year old , eight year old and my husband and me . It is a great game for girls and boys alike . As other reviewers have mentioned , it can be difficult to distinguish between colors ( even if you are not color blind ) . Nevertheless , great game that can be as easy or challenging as you make it !
5 #### Looks can be deceiving .... this game appears to be so simple , yet it is complex & addicting ! Love it . Have had friends over & played for hours ... on more than a few occasions . I have also bought it as a gift for people . A staple game for your collection , you will not be disappointed . Different from other games , so you will not feel cheated that you bought the same game with a different " facade " .
5 #### My 7yr old caught on to the rules quickly with only a couple of reminders throughout the game , and loved it , and I enjoy it also . I found the construction of the blocks to be fine despite other reviewer 's complaints , although I agree that it would be better if some of the colors had more contrast . In bright light it is fine , but more subdued lighting requires a closer look to tell the difference between green and blue , or orange and red . Overall , great game , with enough challenge to keep it fun . Recommended .
5 #### We got this for our 7 year old daughter this past Christmas and she loves it ! In fact , we all love this game . It took her a few games to realize the strategy part of it , but now that she 's figured that out , she seriously kicks butt playing this ! She absolutely loves to yell " Qwirkle " and has become rather skilled at getting them ! She asks to play this game every day . Even my { almost } two year old enjoys sitting and matching the shapes and colors { with supervision of course } . We had our neighbors over one evening and they and their eight year old loved it so much they went out and bought it the next day . It 's no wonder this game has received its awards and excellent rating ... This truly is a fun and educational game for ALL ages . If your family is into playing games , other than video , I highly recommend getting Qwirkle .
5 #### This is a game for all ages . It is very educational , and can be played on many levels for " kids of all ages " . For the young , you can leave the chosen tiles face up . Great for learning strategy and problem - solving , colors , shapes , etc .
5 #### I knew nothing about this game until our son asked for it for Christmas - after he said he had played it in school ! ! Bought the game and even I am very entertained with it ! Good mind exercise and nice twist on a domino theme .
5 #### I saw this game on the cover of a magazine , and in several stores , and it was all the awards it received that got my attention . I needed a game that me and my husband could play with our kids . ( ages 6 and 14 ) . That is not an easy task to find a game for such a broad spectrum of ages . We usually stick with Uno . But this looked promising , so we picked it up . We played it wrong the first couple of times , but with each play we figured out the rules better . ( it is not one that you can just skim over the rules and " get it " right away . But once you do " get it " it is super simple . ) It kind of works like Uno crossed with the strategy of Scrabble . We love it .
5 #### This is one of the best " board " games I 've ever played . Its addicting and fun ( I 'm 25 ) . The pieces themselves are really nice and visually appealing too .
3 #### Got this for a family Christmas present . Friends of ours with similar age children ( 8 and 11 ) had recommended it and the premise seemed good . We play it sometimes but it just does n't grab us like other games have . We ca n't quite work out why but we just do n't find it very exciting and challenging .
5 #### I can totally see why this game was endorsed by Mensa . I bought this for my 5 - year old 's birthday and we just opened the box . The pieces are very nicely made , and feel high quality . It took some time teaching my son how to play the game , but he eventually picked up the basics . While it is a simple concept , there are definitely strategies that can be enacted to make this game more complicated and technical than it looks . For this reason , I believe that it would be enjoyable for a range of ages , from 5 to 100 + .
5 #### We love this game . My daughter starting playing it when she was six . It is easy to learn and fun to play .
5 #### My mother - n - law bought this for our son 's 6th birthday . It is a huge hit with my son , my 7 year old daughter , and mom and dad too . We love playing this together . We love games but this is by far the most fun ! The kids love counting up their scores especially when they get a great match . Definitely a 5 star game ! !
5 #### We have thoroughly enjoyed playing Quirkle . It did n't take long for my 6 year old son to catch onto the rules of the game & it 's fun to watch his mind work to figure out his next play .
5 #### Many people in the U.S. may not know this , but Qwirkle just won the very prestigious Spiel des Jahres award . This means it 's the German family board game of the year . Germans take their board games pretty seriously . Yes , lots of games mention the awards they have . Most of those awards are weak . Congratulations to Susan McKinley Ross for this elegant , beautiful and family friendly game . Keep a lookout for her new game called Color Stix . ( no , I 'm not affiliated in any way with this game ... I 'm just a board game fan ) . [ ... ]
5 #### Qwirkle is a game that is fun and also makes you use strategies and your brain . My three year old grandson also uses it to make patterns with both color and shape . All family members have enjoyed this game .
4 #### I bought this for my 6 year old . It 's a game that is actually fun to play with your kids . He is still trying to understand all the rules for play , but that 's part of the fun . I think we will really like it when he can understand it .
5 #### Some of our friends introduced us to this game , and after playing it one time we knew we would soon be purchasing it . The game is very simple to learn and easy to play - simply matching colors or shapes . While there is some strategy to the game , there is more luck involved than anything else . One thing I especially like about this game is the wood block construction . Extremely durable ! This is not an educational game , so if that is one of your primary goals for game purchases , look elsewhere . However , if you 're just looking for a new family game that you can play at parties , at the campsite , at church youth functions , or just around the kitchen table , this is the one you 're looking for ! You will not be disappointed !
5 #### I play this even without the kids . It is fun and brain challenging , but not hard for kids to learn .
5 #### I was very impressed with this game ! The tiles are made of wood and are smooth and feel nice to touch . I gave the game to my grand daughter who was turning 5 . She caught on to it immediately , and she seemed to enjoy it .
5 #### Great game ! My 3 - 5 year olds loved it , and my wife and I loved it . We have played it 4 times and we got it 2 days ago . It has great educational value for the young ones with matching shapes and colors , and counting . For the older ones , the strategy comes in to play , and point counting can be involved . I highly recommend this one as does my wife who likes very few games .
5 #### We love this game ! Received it for Christmas and have played it EVERY DAY since . I 'm surprised about the number of players ( 2 - 4 ) that the manufacturer has on the box . My whole family ( family of 9 , ranging from age 4 to 45 ) have gathered around the table to play at one time . Definitely more than 4 people can play this game . My youngest can play with a little assistance from an older child sitting next to her . Just make sure it 's the person who just played their turn , and not the person that is about to play after her . That 's just to ensure that there 's no temptation to cheat :) If you like board games , you should get this one . Grown - ups like it just as much as kids , and many people can play , or just two . How often can you say that about a game ? The game combines thinking and luck . The 4 yr old has won a few times . Qwirkle Cube is fun also , but I like this one better . The cubes rolling around , falling off the table , etc .. got on my nerves a bit . It 's still a fun game , but if you 're looking to buy only one , get Qwirkle original . Hope this helps .
5 #### I bought new toys for the house which included games , toys , and puzzles for my grandchildren ( infant through 10 ) , my 17 year old son , my husband , and me . The older grandchildren have n't tried this yet -- they are too far away . This game uses a lot of brain power if you want to win , especially when you are first figuring it out . The scoring could not be done easily by 10 years old unless they had a fair amount of help at first . I like this game because there is a lot of strategy and as the board changes , you must adjust . If you like Rummy - cube , you might like this , but it is harder . I do n't like that my 17 year old beats me ! !
5 #### We had a lot of fun playing this game . My granddaughter age 7 loves it . Adults and kids will have a lot of fun . It 's easy to learn and moves quickly . The pieces are very sturdy , which surprised us . We 're used to opening boxes to see cheap plastic game pieces .
4 #### This game only takes about 5 - 10 minutes to learn . Your strategy for play will change as others make their plays , which keeps it interesting . A great game for all ages , even if all of them do n't read very well yet . My only complaint is that the tiles are not painted as brightly as shown on the box . The yellow is more chartreuse ( yuck ) and the orange is not very bright . If your tiles are in shadow in front of you on the table , they 're not visually very acute . Our table has overhead lighting , so it 's a bit of a pain . I kind of wish they had made the paint design thicker so these were actually more tactile , as described .
5 #### We just played this for the first time and we 're hooked . My 5 year - old can play , but strategy is a little beyond her . The 9 year - old completely gets it , and both my husband and I thought it was great . I love that it 's so simple and easy to pick up-- just a bunch of solid wooden tiles in a canvas bag . Kind - of like an abstract version of Scrabble . Lots of fun . As simple or as complicated as you want it to be !
4 #### Bought this game for our 8yr old son and 6yr old daughter . The kids love it , the age of 8 and up is right on , my 6 yr old needs some help but still likes to join the fun . a great game and exciting to get CIRCLE QWIRKLE ( say that 10 times!)- or any other qwirkle . Mix between Dominos , rummikub , scrabble and sudoku . kids and adults love it .
5 #### My daughter began playing this game at age 6 . She will now play it with anyone who offers ! It is challenging and fun for adults as well . The only downsides are that you need a fairly large , flat surface to create the tile patterns , and you need to be prepared to play for 30 minutes or more in order to finish a full game . If you bump the table and jar the tiles , it can really lead to chaos if the game is fairly far - along . Overall , however , I highly recommend it , even for adults .
5 #### We have fun with this game -- it 's easy to learn , fun and quick to play . My 6 year old grandson can beat me . I do not agree with the reviewer who said the quality was bad . My game was in perfect condition -- maybe his was a fluke ! Buy it -- you wo n't be sorry .
5 #### I bought 3 of the Qwirkle games for my grandchildren for their birthdays because I 've played it and found it very fun and educational . So far I have got one response that they have played it and liked it .
5 #### I purchased this game for our 5 1/2 year old daughter thinking I would hate the game but the rest of the family would enjoy . Well I was pleasantly surprised -it is my favorite game to play , and not just because I win often . Our daughter enjoys it as well . We let her keep score which is one of the reasons she likes the game . She has beaten the adults before . We plan fairly -we do n't need to dumb it down for her , she can hold her own and thinks about which tiles will give her the most points . The game is easy to learn , fun to play , and addicting . Our only complaint , which has already been mentioned is the red and orange tiles can be hard to tell apart under some lighting . Pink ( or white ) would have been a better color for either one of them . If your younger children do n't like it at first , play partners with them or wait a few months and try it again . It really does have educational value as well as being a lot of fun .
5 #### We are seniors and always looking for good games to keep our minds clear . This is great . The blocks are very durable and the reds or oranges are a little hard to see apart . But , game itself is great ; and sure makes the cob webs get out of our heads . We just count the qwirkles and not each tile row ; but still much fun .
5 #### I purchased this game for my 6 year - old and we now enjoy it thoroughly , but it has taken us a couple of tries to get the hang of the game . Specifically , we were unclear about the optimal patterns for the tiles . You may find that for a younger child , the game takes more time than the child has in attention span ( by the end of the game , we 're both a little bit ready for it to be over ) . The good news is that we work on math by keeping track of the scores ( heh , heh , I love hidden learning ) . I think that if you stick with it , this game will be enjoyable through adulthood .
5 #### I bought it for my six year old grandson who loved it & we loved playing with him as well . A game for the entire family .
5 #### My family and I often meet at family gatherings and play games . While we tend to try lots of new games , only a few of them have earned a place on our ' permanent game shelf ' . Qwirkle quickly became one of our favorite games because it is easy to learn , easy to play .... yet challenging because every game is different . My husband and I purchased multiple copies of this game to be given to several family units at our upcoming family reunion . I 'm sure we will have a fun and boisterous " Qwirkle Tournament " involving all ages ( 4 - 99 ) ! ! ! Even our youngest grandchildren ( ages 4 - 9 ) quickly mastered basic moves and picked up ' higher strategy ' thinking ..... it 's hard to find a game that is easy enough for the youngsters , yet appeals to adults , too ! !
5 #### Received this game yesterday and played it last night at our ladies ( all over 30 ) game night , everyone loved it ! In fact one of the ladies called after she got home to ask me to order her one . Ca n't wait to play it with my family , I think my children will like it as well . The game is a combo of luck ( what tiles you pick from the bag ) and strategy but mostly strategy . It 's all how you play your tiles as to how many points you get so one has to think a bit which is a good thing . I think this is a game we 'll come back to time and again . If you are questioning as to whether or not to buy it go ahead you 'll not be sorry .
4 #### I first tried playing with my wife to see how it worked and my son watched . I played with him yesterday and he actually did better than my wife . I think it teaches him to look at things differently and to have patients . I just wish that the tiles were a little thinner so it did not take up too much space in the bag . it would also make the box lighter . It is a good tame though . I am glad that I purchased it .
5 #### I bought this game for my boys , 9 and 4 . I wanted something fun that the whole family could play together ... which is sometimes difficult to find since the youngest ca n't read yet . I was n't sure if this would be too hard or not for the 4 - year - old , but he seemed to catch on pretty fast and he really enjoyed it ! Now and again he would ask for help , but that did n't seem to bother him , since he actually got to play by himself and did n't have to be on anyone 's " team " . Anyway a couple of the other adults who played this game liked it so much they 're going to purchase it themselves . It really is fun !
5 #### i got this for my son 's girlfriend for christmas . we all played it ... quick / easy to learn . it is fast paced as well , which holds your interest . the whole family really enjoyed the game ... just wish it could play more players at one time . i will probably by this for myself now that i have seen how good it is !
4 #### The first time we played this game with my 7 and 10 year old daughter they did n't like it and were easily distracted . We played it the next day and they really thought it was fun . The math from adding who was winning was easy for each girl and after everyone had a couple of turns we stopped and had the kids add up who was ahead . You definitely need an adult to explain it the first few times but after that they get the idea . I like where it takes them and would recommend it to other families .
5 #### I just bought this game about 2 months ago and it is very fun ! My 3 yr old likes to match up the shapes and colors , my 5 yr old can play the game and has even tought his friend to play it . It 's a great family game . There 's some strategy and logical thinking involved , but great for all ages to enjoy a family game together . A recent review here mentioned that the pieces seemed poorly made . Mine appear perfect , paint in good condition , designs are well centered , I am very happy with the quality of this game .
5 #### I am a game snob - I spend an inordinate time researching high quality games . My top criteria are : SIMPLE , UNIQUE and FUN . This qualifies on all counts . My husband , 11 year old girl and 8 year old boy play a lot . It is right up there with Blokus . :-)
5 #### I got this game for my daughter , who is a movie addict . She has enjoyed the other Scene It games in the past and this one is just as entertaining . This is the comedy edition . It features comedy movies from a while back , like Caddyshack and Animal House and also more current films like The 40 Year Old Virgin and The Hangover . It is a dvd game which is very easy to play , just pop in the dvd and use your remote to play the trivia portion and on - screen puzzles . Gameboard and collectible tokens included . If you 've enjoyed Scene It games before , you wo n't be disappointed . More of the same fun and some little changes to keep it interesting . If you 've never played before , but you enjoy movies and like competitive games , get some friends and family together and play . It 's fun and the movie clips actually make you laugh . I 'd highly recommend .
5 #### I 'm sure you 're familiar with " Scene It ? " since there are a dozen variations of the game out , and " Comedy Movies Deluxe " is the latest to join the team . Gameplay for this one is n't that different from other versions of the game , so you can easily step into this one with almost no learning curve if you 've played another version before . The thing that sets this one apart is the wonderful collection of movies you 're playing with . This game borrows from movies from classics like " Caddyshack " to more modern hits like " The 40 Year Old Virgin " , " Bowfinger " and others . The thing that makes this though is that it does carry a " Family " label , meaning though it may touch a few raunchy comedies , the clips you see are nothing you 'll have to be embarrassed about . If you want to relive some hilarious moments from movies you might have missed and more you 've definitely seen , this is a wonderful way to spend an evening with the family .
3 #### I LOVE the Scene It games because I love watching movies . Getting together with a group is even better to play this sort of game - and the bigger the group , the more fun it is . I 've played the original , Disney Scene It , Harry Potter Scene it , and there may have been one more . I was glad to try the Comedy one even though I am not a fan of comedic films . I still figured I would enjoy it . Well , game - play is pretty much the same as the other Scene Its so I wo n't go into that . What I will say is this is n't nearly as fun as the other games I played . It 's actually sort of hard . I may not be a big comedy lover but people in my group were and even they were stumped half the time . Some of the puzzles were hard and the trivia - even harder . But if you are a fan of interactive games , and movies , then I would recommend it . Plus the price is great compared to some of the other Scene It games .
4 #### I finally got the family together for game night and insisted we play Scene It Comedy Movies . I 'd played Scene It before and had a blast . All of us had laughed till we had tears running down our faces . I expected the same here . Instead , I had a good time , but my Mother and young adult children ( early 20s ) were n't familiar with most of the movies referenced . I still recommend the game to friends but I make sure they play with people who are " in to " comedies from the 60s to the present . Otherwise , they will have a game that becomes boring . What did n't I like ? The music and graphics on the DVD became a bit monotonous after a while . Do n't know how that could be improved but we were ready to go right in to the challenge instead of the cute opening graphics .
4 #### Mmm , I think I 've played the more generic version with other people and enjoyed very much . This one did not seem as fun although it was comedy movies ?
4 #### I 've played the short version of this game 3 times so far and each time we got duplicate questions . It took some getting used to using a PS3 controller to answer some of the questions , but it worked out in the end . This game is a lot of fun . They take movies from over the last few decades , so if you have young people playing they probably wo n't know some answers . I look forward to playing this again and hope we get a broader range of questions .
5 #### Great fun ! This game was is a hit with the little ones and the adults ! There 's lots of strategy to be used , but the littlest toddlers can even play without that ! If you make a set of six ( by shape or color ) you get six bonus points , and you can set up your future plays with a bit of planning .
3 #### I played Scene It ? Comedy Movies Deluxe with my spouse . Neither of us had played a Scene It ? game before . The instructions are easy to understand and all of the components seem well made . We found it mildly entertaining . Some questions require no skill , just luck . I do n't think this is a game that we will want to play again unless we have a bigger group . I do think it would be more fun then .
4 #### Of course , you will not have seen all of the movies in this game , yet you may be familiar with the scene . If you knew all of the answers the game would not be fun . Along the lines of obscurity , older / black & white comedies included in the set would make the game more approriate for older players . For example , having never watched a Ben Stiller movie on purpose , I can pass on those questions . Though the rules lack logic at times with occasional clumsy game playing , the game is a fun experience . Some questions based on various scenes are quite random and require little knowledge . The big question is , " Would it be something most people would play often ? " It probably would spend time on a person 's shelf and be played on the holidays . Aside from certain situations , it would see little action . To play the game for maximum enjoyment , one really needs more than two players . Four players would be ideal .
3 #### I really thought this game would be more fun , or even more funny , than it is . I have played other Scene It ? games , so I knew what to expect with the gameboard set up , rules , categories , and so on . I think this game works best when it caters to a more specific movie interest , like Harry Potter , Star Trek , Twilight , etc . " Comedy Movies " just seems too generic . If you were to create a game around this , it might have been better to sample some older classics like Some Like It Hot or the Marx Brothers films , and mix them in with more modern classics like Tootsie or Groundhog Day , rather than relying exclusively on more recent films , some of which were not so great . And could n't they find funnier clips ? As for the " bonus games " , they 're nothing special , just some on - screen prompts to play versions of games like Charades and Pictionary . I 'm sure some players will find this fun , and if it were the first Scene It ? game I ever played , I might find it more fun too . It 's just that there are so many better versions out there .
2 #### We had a big family game night last week and I broke out the new Scene It Comedy edition . It featured written instructions as well as instructions given on the DVD which was included . The game board can also be expanded for longer games . About 10 of us played the game and most of us were confused by the questions . I have never heard of a lot of the movies that were included . All in all , unless you are a complete comedy movie buff , I do not recommend . I have played other Scene It Games in the past and enjoyed them - I think I just was n't into the Comedy Movies that were included .
5 #### I should point out that I am completely unfamiliar with the series , and will be relating what my wife , her cousin and her mother say about the game . I should also note that they are HUGE fans . In the week that I got the game , they have been over twice to play . As a point of reference , my mother - in - law was last here about a month ago and my wife 's cousin has n't been over in months . I wish I could say it was my charm and devilishly good looks ..... alas , that is probably not the case . As a non - participant , I can tell you that they get very excited . Seeing some clips , the video look great , everything is clear , and it seems pretty easy to play . Of course they know everything , well , my wife 's cousin does , and she makes it look easy . My wife finds it the most challenging .... but they love it , and it 's a great excuse for them to get together . It 's not that my wife 's cousing runs away with it , she still finds it challenging . I should also mention that my wife is not really a " game person . " And for her to enjoy a game so much is pretty impressive to me .... so , if you are a fan , I think you must buy this . My wife agrees . My mother - in - law agrees . My wife 's cousin , well , her birthday is comming up , and she is very clear on what she wants .... this !
5 #### Yes , this is a product that will only appeal to Stephanie Meyer 's Twilight series . Should this be a deterrent to buying this game ? No , of course not ! There are a lot of different Scene it ? games out there geared towards different subject matters so there are plenty of options that will appeal to most . This version will be loved by all of those who love the movies and the books alike . There were plenty of options and so much to do that it could be played many times without worry of repetition . This would be fabulous for a slumber party , no doubt about it ! If you 're looking for a gift for your loved one who also happens to be a fan of the series , this will make a great one !
3 #### If you have played other Scene It ? games and had fun with them , then this delivers the same quality of fun as you would expect here with the Twilight themed version . While probably teenage girls would have more fun seeing pictures of all their favorite actors and testing their knowledge of everything int he films and books , its a limited scope and so not really for everyone ( regardless of how popular Twilight is ) . This game is always more fun with more people involved as its designed to be either a family game or party style game . So getting enough people who know all about Twilight would make or break the fun factor in this game .
4 #### This is a ca n't miss for fans of Stephenie Meyer 's vampire books and the accompanying films . It 's perfect for a birthday or holiday present for tween girls ; it 's also a great one to play for a slumber party or Twilight themed party . It 's not a great game for the whole family to play , in that there are not that many men who are Twilight groupies , but it could be very fun for a mother - daughter group . The Scene - it games can be played over and over without too much repetition , since they include a variety of puzzles , trivia games , clips , and more so you do n't get bored quickly like you do with some board games . I can really see this one as a crowd pleaser at a party , since it can be played in teams if you have a big group .
5 #### Very fun as long as you know your facts !
5 #### Great for family game night . You think you know it all but you do n't once you start playing
4 #### Bought this for a twilight fan and they love it :) great gift
5 #### Love this game so much in the movies I have never noticed
2 #### If you 're an obsessive fan of all the new B effort motion pictures and direct - to - video sequels being pumped out by the Disney studio , then you 're likely to be very pleased with this game , which seems to give a lot more attention to Bolt and the newest Winnie the Pooh cash - in than the classic masterpieces that made Disney a household name in the first place . Few and far between are My Play and All Play questions relating to the classics , instead utilizing the game as a sort of advertisement for all the garbage that is n't already in your video collection . Add to this a thoroughly lackluster presentation ( at least the disk loads faster because there are n't any impressive sounds , images , and effects to cue ) , and I give Disney a C-/D+ for their efforts here . It works , and some families are going to enjoy it , but those of us who think of Snow White and Beauty and the Beast when we hear the name " Disney " are n't going to have much use for this game .
4 #### We got this for the family before our first trip to Disneyland ( we 've been to Disney World several times , but never Disneyland ) . It was a fun way to get into the spirit and see Disney hidden gems that we had missed before . Not being the biggest Disney movie fans out there , we did n't fare very well in the game , but we all had fun . This was also our first Scene - It game , but I think we 'll get the Star Trek one now , since that 's more up our alley . Another positive for a family game is that you can play this in about 30 minutes . This is n't a marathon board game that sucks all the fun out of the game over the hours ( I 'm looking at you Monopoly ! ) . Its just right for a family game .
4 #### I like the Scene It games pretty much . The premise is similar to a Trivial Pursuit type of experience , but with 2 changes . One , all ages can play ( with an older helper to read , use the remote , etc . ) and two , the " questions " sometimes involve watching a " scene " ( hence the name Scene It ! ! ) and answering questions about that . The kids think that the dvd part is amazing ! They love watching the scene and trying to guess what the question might be . I think it is kind of cool myself ! Still , sometimes the game gets slightly long for younger children . My family does have fun playing this game , but it is one where you do n't want to immediately play over again when it is done .
3 #### This game operates a lot like the old game Trivial Pursuit . You move your piece around the board and answer questions , trying to be the first to complete a circuit around the game board . The questions are all Disney - themed , but many of them focus on the tween and pre - tween oriented Disney shows of the past ten or fifteen years or so . So , unless you 're really up on those shows , it 's not likely to have much appeal . This game would probably work best for families with kids under 13 or 14 years old . I did n't find it very fun .
5 #### My daughter and I loved the game for a while but after you play it so many times you know what all the ansits not really a challenge anymore .
5 #### I purchased one as a gift for my Niece and then decided to get myself one . It 's fun to play , It has more choices than the other versions of scene it .
3 #### This was the first time we 've played a " Scene It ? " game , so most of my feedback revolves around the format instead of the specific version . Also , we only played it once , and I have not been able to get my 7 - year - old interested in playing it again . First , after playing this I 've realized there 's a LOT about Disney movies I have no clue about . The questions are very challenging . Fortunately , kids can get the easy kid 's questions instead of the grown - up questions . Second , I was disappointed that in the course of normal game play we only got to play one video . I thought each question would involve watching a video clip but mostly you use the DVD as a timer , or for some other games . This is luck of the die , but still , I was n't thrilled . Also , there was n't enough Pixar in this one . Our kids love Pixar , but do n't necessarily know or care for the more obscure Disney films from the 1960 's . Buzz Lightyear trumps " The Rescuers . " A great thing about this game is that if you want to make the game shorter , you fold the game board up into a smaller shape . Very handy , very easy . The format of the game supports grown - ups play with young children . Hopefully I 'll be able to talk my kid into playing this again soon .
4 #### WE had a little trouble getting the disc to play right in our new Blu ray player . Fortunatley they had some alternative directions to start play with this issue . This is a great updated Disney Addition to the Scene it famiy . Easy to maneuver through te menu and options . Fun for all ages and genders .
5 #### My best friend is a huge twilight fan and so when her birthday came around I had to give it to her early because she tried to buy it herself .
4 #### This gane covers the first three films . It is fun , but if you have someone who knows the films by heart ( like my spouse ) then it can be kind of one - sided . It sets up and plays like all the other ' scene - it ' games .
4 #### As the wife of a youth minister , I have gotten sucked into all sorts of teen - obsessions . I always take a group to see whatever Twilight movie is newly released . It is always fun . This game offers another way to get my girls to interact .
5 #### A very fun game to play with your teenagers and their friends .
5 #### Love this game ! It was a gift for me and it is great . If you love the 80s , it is a must have !
4 #### My husband loved growing up in the 80 's and he has a birthday coming up and I saw this great deal . Ca n't wait till he opens it up to relive his childhood days .
5 #### If u grew up in the 80 's you will love to play with your friends . Played it with friends who grew up in different parts of the country and it was fun to see how we had different experiences with trends growing up . California , Carolinas and New York parts in the 80 's .
5 #### Scene It is a great game , and this 80 's version makes it even greater ! Lots of pop culture trivia from the 1980 's -- obvious & obscure . You need to know your stuff to win this one . Fun game for parties or friends -- or just couples who want to sit around and have some fun at night .
4 #### Fun enough to play , especially when you 're feeling nostalgic . It goes by too fast and does n't last long enough . Not very exciting , but was able to enjoy reminiscing for a little while .
4 #### We played this game at our 80 's themed new years party to ring in 2011 . It was quite a hit , everyone really liked playing it . Has good quality clips & worked great in my Panasonic 5 disc all in one home theater system .
4 #### I have played this game three times , and we have all ready had doubles on a few questions , so that , along with the crappy tie - breaker is the downfall of this game . It is fun otherwise , and even if you were not around for barely any of the 80s , at least half of the questions were still easy to figure out . I would recommend this version of Scene It if you have a tv , dvd player , and can stand the 80s .
5 #### My husband and I are forever playing games with our kids and own several SceneIt ? games . I was thrilled to see something from " our " generation . Our older kids enjoy it too ! ! Hours of fun ! !
3 #### My Twilight - obsessed teenage daughter and her friends played this game several times . They enjoyed the trivia questions , but preferred to dispense with the game board . They were more interested in the clips and outdoing each other with their vast Twilight knowledge than the details of the board game itself . They especially enjoyed the fact that all three movies released to date were included in this edition . That being said , it is a great sleepover game for teenage girls who are in to Twilight ( are n't they all ) ? If you 're looking for a great tween gift or planning a party or sleepover , this is a good choice .
5 #### My daughter and her friends play this , but of course , they have seen all the movies and read all the books . I do n't think I could get an answer correct to save my life ! Lots of fun for the teenagers !
5 #### If you love Scene it and Twilight you ca n't go wrong here ! This has the first three movies combined in it with the classic scene it game style . Me and my sisters and girlfriends love it !
4 #### I purchased this for my 3 year old when it was 75 % off just before Christmas . He enjoys the interactive DVD that teaches about animals in their different habitats . The DVD asks questions that require the user to use the computer mouse to select the correct answer . It comes with a cube puzzle that can be put together at the end of each DVD segment . Great for the discount price I paid , but surely not worth the retail price .
4 #### My daughter and her friends love Twilight and she was very excited when " Scene It ? Twilight Saga Deluxe " came out . Scene It ? games are always great fun at parties and this one is a huge hit for those who love the Twilight series ( we played and enjoyed&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Disney - Scene - It - DVD - Board - Game / dp / B000GQ26Y6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Disney : Scene It ? DVD Board Game</a>&nbsp;quite a bit as well ) , but I honestly never have any chance at winning since my daughter and her friends have seen every movie and most of them have also read the books . The set includes a game - board , DVD ( you need a TV and DVD player or PC capable of playing DVDs ) , trivia cards , " Fate " cards , dice , and metal game pieces . This is a very engaging game that really gets the players involved since there are so many interactive elements . Recommended for fans of Twilight ! CFH
4 #### Scene it ? Twilight Saga Deluxe is a fun game for the whole famliy . It will be more fun , however , if you have watched the movies . There were a lot of different scenes not seen before so that made it more fun . The game is very engaging and would recommend it for 10 + as well . I played this with my daughters , and do plan to get more Scene it games in the future .
5 #### My wife is a Twihard and absolutely loved this " Sceneit ? " game based on the three Twilight movies . If you do n't like the Twilight movies obviously you wo n't like this game . For the die hard and even casual Twilight fans I think you will find it a lot of fun . You do n't need to really read the books to have fun with this game in my opinion , just need to have watched the movies . Overall a lot of fun .
3 #### Enclosed in this box is not just one game , but three ! Twilight Scene it includes questions based off the first three movies in the Twilight saga-- Twilight , New Moon , and Eclipse . The board game folds together to form a quick game or folds out to form a longer game . As far as game play goes , Twilight Scene It follows suit with the other Scene It games . There are questions that are playable on your DVD player and questions you read off of cards depending on what dice you roll . You move a token ( of which this game comes with four ) around the board until you reach home base and answer the final question of the game . I found the DVD menu 's to be a little slow , but overall , the DVD worked fine in my player . The questions are all aimed at the movies , so this game is not for fans solely of the book series . DVD games are n't my favorite genre , but this one was n't too bad . The New Moon questions , from what I can tell , are pretty easy , but me and the the other players in my demo game got stumped a few times on the Twilight and Eclipse ones ! This game is perfect for your next ' Twilight ' party or even a movie release party ! If you are in love with the Twilight movies , I think you 'll be in love with this game set , too !
4 #### I guess it was because I told the boys that girls liked Twilight because Edward was the ' perfect ' boyfriend .... but after that , my teen boys , 14 and 15 , started studying the Twilight movies like they were some magickal text . They swear that they HATE Twilight , but could n't wait to dive into this game when I got it . The game is hard , but it 's fun for them , and I play it too . I really liked the books , and I 'd think I 'd have an advantage , but I do n't seem to , as I never win . There 's a lot about character names . I 'm bad with names . The puzzles include putting the scenes in order . I really like those . There 's a short version and a long version . The short version takes the 3 of us an hour . It 's a well made game . Our biggest complaint is the narrator 's voice . It is supposed to be " Carlisle " from Twilight but it just sounds like , as my son puts it , " Some guy sounding fake English . " I 've had it 3 weeks now , and it 's been played 5 times . I 've no doubt when we have company it will get pulled out again . This would be GREAT for slumber parties .
5 #### As a major Twilight fan , I was very excited to receive this game , and my opponent knew I would beat him in no time . While I did indeed win , I admit that some questions really stumped me , either because I was having a " brain freeze , " or did not know the answer ( " Name the Actress " ) . I think they could have created better game pieces , but the Fate cards are fun and the questions and activities diverse . ( I particularly liked the " bonus " game where you answer questions to determine whether you 're a werewolf or a vampire ) . The questions were evenly spread across all three films , which was also a nice touch . This was our family 's second Scene It game -- the other being a Disney game -- and while the gameplay was exactly the same , the menus , music , and voice - over were much more mellow , subdued , and ultimately more enjoyable and relaxing . Although not introduced , I am pretty sure that the game 's narrator is supposed to be the character of Carlisle , though clearly it 's not the actor providing the voice .
4 #### This is a pretty fun Christmas game to play . If you have played a SCENE IT game before , you 'll already know what to expect . I 'd recommend it .
3 #### My four year old nephew and I played this Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer game on a chilly and gloomy Saturday afternoon . In order to win the game , you ( as Clarice , Rudolph , Santa , or Hermie ) have to rescue the misfit toys before Bumble can get to them . The DVD gives you challenges that you have to win in order to get that misfit toy . The mini - games on the DVD include a memory matching game , finishing a song lyric , and a guessing whose voice it is on a sound clip from the movie , along with some other games . My nephew liked the game for about 10 minutes but then got bored and started to make the characters talk to each other . Older children might like this game and play it all the way through a bit better . As for me , I kind of liked the DVD mini - games that we play in order to get the misfit toys the best . It 's a great idea for those who have grown up watching Rudolph on TV every year . So it is n't the best game out there but I 'm sure that kids 5 and older would find great enjoyment from it .
3 #### I played this DVD game with my kids and it was a little lame . The whole ' misfit toy ' cardboard circles were very lame . The DVD itself had some fun things in it , like short clips and ' guess who wins the race ' , but there were n't that many things in there . All - in - all , we played it for 45 minutes and will probably only play it for 45 minutes every year .
3 #### This game works for us sometimes ....... and sometimes not . The premise for the game is cute . We love this movie and watch it several times each Christmas , so when I was offered to try out this game , I jumped at the opportunity . Unfortunately , the game did n't always quite work out the way I was hoping it would . The questions were appropriate for my 5 year old and she always gets excited when she answers one correctly ..... but she is an extremely sensitive child . The way this game works , Bumble has an opportunity to steal presents and once he successfully steals 6 presents , * HE * wins the game . This REALLY upsets my daughter . She does n't mind losing a game to her mommy or her daddy ..... or one of her stuffed animals , as they often play with us ..... but she has a serious problem losing to a " bad guy " like Bumble . Overall , this game is kind of cute , but we do n't get all that excited about it . It 's one of those take - it - or - leave - it kind of games , i.e. if the weather is bad and there is absolutely nothing else to do , we 'll drag this game out . But we usually pick just about any other activity ( over this game ) if given the choice .
1 #### Do NOT buy this . Game can not be played without software and the DVD does n't work . The phone numbers and websites listed are all defunct . Paramount bought Screenlife , the company and then shut it down in early 2012 . It looks like it could have been a lot of fun . Nice concept , but DVD materials should have been available on - line . Now we just have a gameboard and some pieces and NO GAME . DO NOT BUY ! This toy and all the screenlife games should NOT BE FOR SALE ! ! !
5 #### My kids ( ages 3 and 5 ) love the Rudolph DVD Game . It works in much of the same way as a regular Scene It Game but it is simplified so that even my 3 year old can get the answers right . My kid 's have watched Rudolph a few times but you do n't need to know the movie to play this game ( although it makes it fun to know the character 's names ) . We did not play with the game board because I found it too confusing for younger children . We just played with the DVD and did not keep score . The DVD would show a scene and then ask a question related to the scene . An adult really needs to supervise for younger children who are n't familiar with the DVD remote control . My kid 's really enjoyed it . The only problem I had was with the game board which was divided into 4 sections - my kid 's could n't really get the concept of it and I found it a little difficult to understand myself . Overall , a fun game .
4 #### The Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer DVD game was a bit tricky to understand at first but once underway it made for a great evening of family fun . My 6 year old son was excited when he saw the box and after a bit of setting up and explanation we were able to get into the game . The game essentially has you rolling dice and moving around a game board . In order to collect tokens you need to answer questions on the DVD . Most of the questions are geared for young children so there is more fun than critical thinking involved but enough difficulty to keep adults interested . The game play is approximately 30 minutes . For the price this is a great game that that young kids will really enjoy . Positive Points Include : - Easy to understand and play ( after the initial setup ) - The questions are a nice mix of easy to understand and fun - Game time is just right where it is short enough to be fun but not too long where it becomes boring Negative Points Include : - Kids need some parental assistance with the DVD and setup - Not a lot of replay value after a few sessions - DVD instructions are sometimes not in tune with what is happening on the game board
3 #### Without repeating what has already been said in other reviews , I simply want to add to the advice that this game is for hardcore Simpsons fans . I thought I was one ... until I played this game . I have watched the Simpsons since the early 90 's and have seen most episodes at least 4 - 5 times . This game was still very difficult for me . I thought that I would be able to play it with my kids ( 10 and 5 ) who watch the Simpsons with me , but it was really to difficult for them . However , I enjoyed watching the clips and it 's a great collectible for serious fans . I also got it for a fantastic price on Amazon , so no regrets !
5 #### This is exactly what you would expect from Scene It with an all Simpsons theme . This game and a partnership with the Television show make for a nice combination . For avid fans of the Simpsons , the game is a little easy so perhaps you might make a rule that you need to have the entire name of a character ( even the obscure ones ) to get the answer right . The game on the disc looks solid and crisp and it does NOT look like something that was just thrown together . If you like the Simpsons or are huge fans , you wo n't be disappointed buying this .
5 #### Finally bought this for myself for Christmas . LOVE IT . Pros : Being a Simpsons fan is pretty required . You ca n't fake it with this game . There 's not multiple choice . The pieces are cute and the board is bright . The game is not hard and is fast paced and you can adjust the playing time to fit your schedule . Cons : Wish it was actually a console game , like on the PS3 so you do n't have to manually set your timer , etc . Need an update or extension since it 's a few years old now ! Overall , love it , super fun , I even snagged it on a special so I paid under $ 7 for it on here ! ! ! Could n't pass it up !
5 #### I do n't get along with my siblings too well . After we all got married and ruined our lives with kids , we lost touch and rarely spent any time together . When we all got together and rented a beach house in St Augustine , we were bloody sick of each other by day two . Then I busted out Simpsons Scene It . It turns out we all still loved old episodes and watched them frequently . We fought tooth and nail to get every answer right and played through twice . When I won the game , I stood up and told my brothers to stand tall . My exact words were , " A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man . "
4 #### You need to be an expert to know the answers to the questions . It is fun with very knowledgeable players . The Cash Cab board game was way too easy so it was not fun . It is better to be really hard than really easy
3 #### Got this for Christmas . When we played it , it was not much fun . It takes forever for scenes to load up and some questions are just impossible . My hubby and I have been watching the Simpsons since the beginning and struggled with a lot of these questions . A regular trivia game with cards would have been more fun .
4 #### This is a fun family game for Simpsons fans . It is more fun that other Scene It games I have played and was more enjoyable for the whole family . This is a good value since it 's the Deluxe version for the same price as some stores sell the regular version . Some of the trivia questions are hard , but everyone has a chance to do well since many of the questions are based only on observations from the clips that are shown . This would be a great addition to a family game night collection as well as a welcome gift for a fan of The Simpsons .
3 #### Bought this game from Amazon at a really low price . Played it with my niece , nephew , and daughter , and unfortunately it was n't very fun . The questions were pretty hard and I think only real die - hard Simpsons fanatics would know the answers to most of the questions . Too difficult for the casual watcher .
4 #### Great game ! It was a little harder than we thought . The cards are sometimes ridiculous as in " Who would EVER know that ? " pretty hard to get . Otherwise it was fun and had a good time watching the scenes from Simpsons .
4 #### just finished playing it , and it was fun ... for me . lol . If you are going to play this game with others , they have to know something about Star Trek . I played with my brother and his wife ( casual fans of Trek ) and I just left them in the dust . I guess it is better to play with others on your knowledge level . If we had the same level of knowing , it would have been more of a game . I wish there was an option for an easy , medium or hard question . It does n't have that . Let 's just say this , the game is supposed to last around 45 minutes , but it was over in 20 . I love it and I think it 's great fun . It has some trivia you answer by the other reading a card and other questions are answered by watching video clips . Overall , I would recommend this game to those that want to play alone or with other Trek fans . If you are the only Trek fan playing , you may be the only one that has fun . A question that was in the game , for example , was asking the name of the actress that played Spock 's mom in the original series . How is someone that does n't know Trek going to answer that ? Fun and challenging , but almost impossible for casual and those that are n't really fans
4 #### As a die hard Trekkie , I was afraid that this game would be much too easy for me . I had previously tried the Disney version of Scene It and had little difficulty answering every question correctly . Gameplay is identical to other versions of Scene It - you start on one space and roll dice until you get a question wrong . Some of the questions are easy , but most are very difficult and will require a real Star Trek expert to answer . My only complaint is that it only has one difficult level . The Disney version of Scene it had two sets of questions - one for adults , one for children . I wish that Star Trek Scene It had two sets of questions - one for casual viewers and one for hardcore trekkies . It makes it difficult to find somebody to play with when most your friends are only casual fans while you could recite the entire scripts to episodes in your sleep :-p ... some questions are very easy , but a lot are obscure . Still , if you have a group of reasonably knowledgeable Star Trek fans you ca n't go wrong with this game .
5 #### Star Trek scene it deluxe is the best game I have ever had ! If you have friends or family who are BIG FANS of Star Trek , or they just like it this game is a great gift for them and they will love you for it ! The game covers all the movies and all 5 tv shows , with Questions and filled with video and audio clips . The game tokens are the ships from the four main TV shows they are Star Trek , STTNG , DS9 , and Voyager . You only get 1 tin or box even though it looks like you get 2 !
5 #### He 's a huge Trekkie and he said he loves it . I 've never watched the show , so I certainly could n't play this game , but it was a good gift for a Star Trek lover !
5 #### I was not very sure when i ordered it if it will be worth $ 100 stuff . But every dollar well spent . There are different books like Think and Associate , Concentration games , Visual Perception . These are basically puzzles which let your little one think . They do n't feel they are studying or something , its like game for our 3.5 years old . And boy am I a proud mother or what . I was happily surprised with our son 's capability to solve these puzzles .
5 #### my 4 - year old takes this out and just starts playing with it . she has her own ipad , and whenever idle will clamor for TV ( which she knows she is n't allowed to watch ) , but i just feel better as a parent when she picks this up on her own and loves playing with it . its something tangible that builds her skills and intellect .
5 #### I introduced the early learning series to my two year old grandson and he took to this like a bee to honey ! ! He is a curious , rambunctious , insatiable learner who likes to do everything by himself after being shown once . I show him what is expected for different exercises and he takes over ! ! He enjoys hearing my input and praise as he goes along , but he is thrilled to have a learning tool that he can control by himself . The confidence that this product purports to instill into young learners is truthful . This in itself makes the product a step above many other tools I have used to teach youngsters ( I am a specialist in teaching learners with developmental delays ) . In the process , he is also learning critical thinking skills and basic building blocks on which phonemic awareness , basic math skills , and problem - solving skills are founded . The price is well worth it !
5 #### This is a large , easy to read puzzle . I homeschool my 13 year old son and we got this to improve his memory of states / cities . My 11 year old also loves pitching in on the puzzle . It is made of very sturdy pieces , and each have very easy to read cities / state / landmarks . It is fabulous . It takes up more of my kitchen table than I had actually expected , but well worth the placement . I am thinking I may look for a frame and glue the pieces together and put this on the wall as a map . I very much recommend this purchase , well worth the $ 12.99 .
4 #### It 's a nice puzzle , take note that it was to big for a standard card table so make sure you have a place to assemble it
5 #### Great puzzle ! We got it so my 10 year old son could learn about the location of the state 's as well as the capitals . Worked great and he really enjoyed learning . Would recommend it to anyone . Pieces are sturdy and lock together nicely .
4 #### This puzzle was a lot bigger then I was expecting , it 's about the size of a normal 2000 pc . It was very easy to put together and only took about 1.5 hours . Some pegs were bent but I just bent them back . This would make a great picture for the kids room or a classroom puzzle as a teaching guide . The pc . are very big and you wo n't have to worry about losing them .
5 #### This is a nice quality puzzle . The pieces are well made and fit together well . The map of USA is very detailed and educational . I bought this for my daughters and was surprised by the amount of geographical information contained on the pieces . This is a very good educational product . I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys puzzles and/or maps .
5 #### To call this a wonderful " game " seems a little limiting . Memory is a fun game , and the cards are certainly beautiful , and very sturdy . However , this game can be used for more than just the game of memory . The cards are sturdy enough to be stacked and built with ( something my toddler loves about them ) , and the colors and pictures stimulate the imagination and senses . I recommend this game highly not just to people that have children that enjoy playing " Memory " , but also to parents of toddlers that like to build and look at pictures .
5 #### I go for almost anything with Harper art work . These are sturdy , colorful cards and my 93 year old mother enjoys playing the game . She is having memory issues ... maybe these will help somewhat , but mainly it is something she enjoys because it is not too difficult . We have not played it enough yet to see if her ability to remember where the matching card is improves . Just having the images to look at improves my mood
5 #### Beautiful graphics . Keeping this memory game at Grandmothers house .
5 #### My mother has been trying to improve her memory . The things I found for memory boosting were either too hard and frustrating for her or too " kiddie " looking which was insulting to her . She 's always been a bird lover so these Picasso like bird renditions with their bright colors gives her something bright and happy to look at as art , as well as a means to exercise her memory . She started out using five pair , but then worked her way up . You can make this as hard or easy as you want to . Even better , it 's a way to exercise the brain without it ever feeling like a chore . We 've played against each other and found ourselves talking about the various pictures from an artistic point . Nice conversation starter as well , and a good way to draw old stories out of someone who has memory issues .
5 #### This is one of those toys that I bought more for myself than my daughter , but it is really well made and a good way to introduce her to Charley Harper .
5 #### I came across this beautiful game recently , and fell in love with the delightful bird illustrations ( there are bugs , stones , and forests , too ) --- then I remembered how much my children loved a similar memory game . I have n't been a fan of the Charley Harper bird calendars and such , but for some reason I love the bird drawings in this game . So , I ordered this Charley Harper game for my little granddaughter . She 's a bit young to play memory , but not too young to enjoy pretty birds she can pick up and play with as tiny blocks . Three cheers for an old favorite given vibrant life !
4 #### We received these as a gift for our almost 3 - year - old . The designs on the cards are pretty and nice to look at instead of the usual cartoon - y memory games . There are a lot of cards , so I usually lay out half of the cards instead of the whole pack at once . They fit in the box if they 're all put in carefully ; not sure if they 'd fit it you just toss them in the box in a pile .
5 #### I love Charley Harper illustrations . This is your standard memory game with lovely art . Makes a great , unique gift .
3 #### Looks nice , but not as big as the red or the white in the evolution packs , and is just as costly for this one figure as those sets are for three . It 's not a bad figure at all - just a little small for the cost ... a little unimpressive for the cost . The red and the white sets are very nice . And the gargantuan green is well worth it .
5 #### Perfect , exactly what I was looking for , adorable turkey stickers for applying to cards or envelopes for Thanksgiving , very colorful and nice size .
5 #### Very cute stickers ! They are high quality - no ripping when I try to peel them off , and they stick very well to my paper planner . Great for decorating the Thanksgiving holiday in my planner !
4 #### I really liked these stickers . They are a good size and they 're cute . The kids loved them ! Great for the holiday or any other activity !
5 #### Great value in stickers . Very nice size and coloring . Good for rewards or to decorate presents or cards . Would buy again .
3 #### I purchased this game for my husband last year . We picked up how to play it pretty quickly but it was kinda boring and repetitive .
5 #### The games is EXTREMELY complex . However if you are a true hardcore fan and you have the IQ to get through the instructions then the games is a lot of fun to play . The cards are great quality and the box is nice and sturdy to hold the game when you are n't playing it . If the instructions are too much for you there are great tutorials on YouTube that further explain this game . It 's a fun gift for your brainy Back to the Future friend of family member ! ! !
3 #### This was a nice game to play , but I would not play it all the time like I would some games . If you are a Back to the Future fan , then it 's a nice game to have .
4 #### I saw this game at a store and lost my mind . I needed this game and I bought it on the spot . There was no way to say no . When I brought this to Comic Con , I realized I could only play this at lunch due to the space needed for the timeline . Players are people in the BttF who only exist if a specific timeline is left in place and not able to be changed . Play involved draw and play a card . Played cards can be items , devices and time machines . Players use time machines to fix their timeline and then destroy time travel . WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME : I like that winning is surviving , that multiple people can survive , and that time travel is n't easy to destroy . The items , their abilities and the time travel mechanics are just what a die hard fan would want . WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME : Why am I playing non characters . I 'm upset I ca n't play main characters , but get it . Why ca n't I play side characters who actually exist in the franchise ? WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR ? Die hard fans of BttF or anyone with a love for time travel principles . RATING ! 6.2 out of 8 . Game play is only bolstered by franchise and cards with well loved classic BttF iconic items .
3 #### But the replay on this is very limited . We bought this because we liked Fluxx and my husband loves the BTTF movies . I do n't care much for this game , but he seems to love it .
4 #### This is a fun spinoff version of Chrononaughts . It is more streamlined and focuses exclusively on the timeline . You can not win by fixing paradox or collecting items . You MUST create your ideal timeline and then disinvent time travel in order to win . Having said that , Time Travel is a little more difficult in this game , often requiring items . Really , this is a fun game but also a great homage to the series of movies .
5 #### If you like Back to The Future , or ever wanted to go back in time and change something , then you 'll probably like this game ! It 's by the makers of Fluxx , but it 's not really a Fluxx game . It 's similar to Chrononauts , everytime you go back in time and change something , there 's a ripple effect , but you can fix these effects , and each player has a certain set of objectives they have to reach to win the game . No one else knows what they are , so when you do or undo one thing in time , sometimes screwing someone else over in the process , you help yourself , or sometimes help you 're neighbor . Will you erase Marty McFly from existence ? Or help Doc create the time machine all over again ? This is definitly a fun game , and who does n't love Back to the Future ? ! ( anyone who does n't should immediatly get their nerd card revoked ! ) Highly Recommended !
5 #### It 's fun ! It 's random ! It 's about half skill , half luck . Best played with 3 or more people . Games can last from 15 minutes to 2 hours . Ripplepoints do not need to be played with , they 're just an extra step , unless you 're playing with mega BTTF Fans , it 's best if you do n't play with Ripplepoints . If someone asked me to make a BTTF card game , it 'd be pretty hard to top this . The instructions seem confusing at a glance , but I assure you , it 's pretty simple to get a hang of . Oh , I wish it came with the pizza rehydrator card . I 'm going to feel like my deck is incomplete forever !
4 #### Since every American kid and quite a few non - American ones are familiar with the Wizard of Oz , this ever - changing card game based on the Oz theme is fun for all ages . Nothing really scary here , just non - threatening , non - competitive family enjoyment . :-D
5 #### okay so i am in love with the wizard of oz ! and when i started to inot the world of Fluxx , i knew i had to buy myself a copy of the game . i had played star fluxx and wanted that but when OZ popped up . i could n't say no ! the box of cards come in perfect shape . but after a few days the box started to rip on the sides . i ve had to type them . but the cards remain in great shape . it 's a fun game of never ending change . and is a great party game . once you understand the basic 's your golden .
5 #### We had so much fun playing this the day we got it . I love the creepers , new action and rule cards , and the fun combinations of the goal cards , never a dull moment , so it keeps it fun . We played for about 3 hours straight . Enjoy it , we sure did =)
5 #### Another fun and quick game by the Fluxx team . this one as you can tell adds in the world of Oz and is a fun game to play
5 #### I love the flux series and these themed version puts a fun twist on a challenging and strategic game .
4 #### This game is hard to explain , but is quite enjoyable , we played it with friends and liked it so much we came home and ordered one from Amazon for ourselves .
5 #### This was a really fun game . It is pretty easy to catch on since the rules are written on the cards and they change as you go . No long rule books to memorize . Great for people that do n't enjoy intense strategy games . Anyone can win . We had lots of laughs playing this game .
5 #### Great game for family game night . My kids , ages 8 and 11 , both get into it . The 8 year old particularly loves the changes rules in the Fluxx games and that it is about one of her favorite movies .
5 #### I was SO impressed with this game . I 've played a number of different versions of Fluxx before , but this has to be my favorite . The art was beautiful and , since Oz is in the public domain , there was no need to skirt copyright like in Star Fluxx . I bought this game for my dad who collects Oz books , but I was so impressed I may also buy a copy for myself . Nice job , Fluxx ! !
5 #### I 'd you love the wizard of oz and card games this one is for you ! !
4 #### Already a Fluxx player with Space and Martian Fluxx themes but figured Oz Fluxx would get non - gamert family members interested . My family ares big Wizard of Oz fans . The game card 's cartoon caricatures are cute and keeps to the overall theme well . I also picked up the promo card . "If I Only Knew The Words " too for and extra $ 1 . Like all Fluxx games , the play varies wildly with every hand . Not very strategic , so older gamers may get a little board but it 's a natural for family game night or for just light gaming .
4 #### almost as good as regular Fluxx and Star Fluxx .
5 #### Another great version of a very fun game . I continue to be amazed that such a basic game can be so fun and easy to play .
5 #### Fun game for little ones . Our kids 10 and 8 figured this out on their own . I enjoy playing it too !
5 #### I have never played fluxx before . This is my new favorite card game ! A bit of a learning curve but even my 9 year old can play . I am a big Oz fan , so had to ahve this !
4 #### I love the Fluxx games . While this one is not my favorite , it 's still fun . I love e that the game changes each ti e you play it . I highly recommend the Fluxx games .
4 #### This is a very basic version of Fluxx . There is only 4 creepers in the entire deck and 1 of them can be discarded if the other is in the discard pile . I 've played rounds where we sent all 4 creepers to the discard pile within the first 5 turns . However , this is my girlfriend 's favorite version because it is simple and cute . I find it being the one that we play most often as she becomes accustomed with strategy games . It is a solid starter that you wo n't be disappointed in . * minor spoiler * PS . I always get those monkeys . I do n't know how it happens , but I always end up with the monkeys .
5 #### Everyone quickly learned how to play this simple yet dynamic game . The basic actions are simple yet the game play and large number of cards offers interesting scenarios . Changing goals and rules makes it quite entertaining . Should include some blank cards so you can add your own customizations to the game .
5 #### Fluxx is such a great little game - portable and easy to learn , and the constantly changing factor keeps it always exciting . I own a number of the variants and they are all similarly great and each has it 's own quirkiness making it easy to enjoy them all . ( I keep a copy in my car , a copy in my house , and a copy in my " games night " bag ) People who are used to planning a few moves ahead will take a little longer to truly enjoy this game since the constant changing can mess up all their forward planning , but once you accept this unpredictability as a challenge in itself , then you can have some real fun with Fluxx . Definitely recommend Fluxx to anyone .
5 #### This was the first Fluxx game we bought . When the wife was pregnant we tried to stay in as much as we can so i got her fluxx . We fell in love with it we just about own every type of Fluxx there is .
3 #### Fun once or twice .. but grows old ( could mix with other Fluxx decks as needed though ) . Cards need more actions / powers to create a greater variety of strategies .
5 #### This is a fun and clever game with a theme . It is instantly appealing to kids , women and men ( for the Fluxx ) . Sure the first few games are slow and might be confusing since the game is changing constantly , but after you get what Goals , Actions , Keepers , Creeper and Surprise mean this game can be picked up and started in seconds . Sometimes games end in a few minutes and sometimes we 'll have to shuffle the discard pile a couple of times . There is strategy in what cards you keep , what you play and the order you play them , but other players can easily foil your strategy . For the price this game is great to have around ! Pros : No game setup , easy to teach and learn , fun , no game is the same , great theme ( Oz ) , some strategy Cons : Can have a slow ramp up for newbies , luck elements , game length is variable ( 2 mins - 20 mins )
5 #### I love this game ! I am a huge Wizard of Oz fan and a huge Fluxx fan , so when I saw they had an Oz version I was super thrilled . I love how the rules of the game change as you go . It 's a really fun game .
5 #### I love the original Fluxx game and I love the Wizard of Oz , so this was a natural next purchase . Not only does this give the classic game a twist L. Frank Baum would be proud of , but the actual gameplay varies from the original set . The Keeper and Creeper cards add extra curves and turns never seen before , as well as plenty of new rules and the introduction of Surprise cards , and fantastic art to boot . I do n't find it particularly more or less challenging than the original , just different in a way that 's worth the extra cash . I 'd recommend this even for a first - time Fluxx user who likes the Wizard of Oz , hours of fun , and high replay value !
5 #### Fluxx itself is an amazing game .. Add a twist to it and it gets even more fun ! OZ Fluxx is great for anytime !
5 #### I love this game ! It 's fun with all the Oz characters . We play this often . Same rules and a few new from the other games . This is one of our favorites , next to Pirate Fluxx !
4 #### Me and the wife play this a few times a month , switching in with other games including flux 4.0 . Like the other flux games this one works in the same veign , and where i find flux 4.0 can be over fairly quick , this one goes on for a little bit longer , as the goals are slightly harder to full - fill , plus the cool " not so fast cards " are a sneaky addition .
5 #### Fluxx is an always changing game that is quick to learn and provides a lot of replay value since the goal for winning will be different not only every time you play but multiple times during any game . 2 + players and keep in mind the game will again be different when you add that 3rd and 4th player . We own several themes of Fluxx with Oz being one of our favorites .
4 #### Many of the cards in this game will remind you of sci - fi and fantasy movies and television shows you have been watching for years . It 's fun having them combined into one crazy card game . Fluxx games are always crazy , but this version is one of the most fun for sci - fi fans . Enjoy !
5 #### I love this game ! I already own all the fluxx games , and I bought this for a friend ! Its always a go to party game !
4 #### My son loves this game . I do n't quite understand why , but he 's a big fan
3 #### This game is kind of boring , probably more fun with 3 or more players . Lots of great science fiction humor .
4 #### We enjoy all the versions of Fluxx . If you know space movies , then this is more of a wow ...
5 #### We play this at lunch all the time ... I would recommend adding in the extra roles you can find online ... super fun even without them
3 #### I ve seen people play this game and I know its a fun , deceptive game to play at parties while drunk . HOWEVER ! ! It came with no rules or instructions ! ! I do n't think its the sellers fault maybe just the packaging .
4 #### I love this game , but admit that many friends do n't like the changeability of the rules , but can change three times in a turn if you have 4 - 5 players .
5 #### Another hit in the Fluxx series of card games . i own several of these card games and they are all fun to play and a relatively short amount of time is needed to play .
5 #### If you love science fiction you will love this game . It 's Fluxx taken to a whole new level of enjoyment . Everything is here . Firefly , Star Trek , Doctor Who , Star Wars , Mystery Science Theater , Hitchhikers Guide and so much more . You 'll absolutely adore all the references to your favorite sci - fi books and shows . By far my favorite themed card game ever .
5 #### Star Fluxx is an entertaining game in which each player starts with 3 cards , and from there the game just keeps changing . However , Star Fluxx is easy to learn , since each card clearly explains the changes to the game . Star Fluxx begins with just a couple of very simple rules ( take a card play a card ) , but new rules are added to the basic rule , and they take effect immediately . Thus , every game of Fluxx is always different from the previous one . To win , a player must meet a goal 's conditions ( s / he wins even if it is someone else 's turn ) . To play a goal , a player places it up in the center of the table discarding any previous goals . Thus , you can be on your way to a win one minute , and light years away from winning a minute later . Most goals require keepers to win , and players must play them in order to win , but by doing so you will put keepers at risk , others can take them and creepers ( cards that usually prevent you from winning ) can be attached to them . In addition , to the above cards , players can play surprise and action cards , that change the game and might have different outcome if played during your turn , or during someone else 's turn . Over all Fluxx is a great game for 2 - 6 + players , it takes about 30 minutes , and in my opinion plays better with a large group .
5 #### It 's a gift . But every Fluxx I 've played so far has been a blast ! So my Star Wars loving nephew is going to love this !
5 #### Great little game . Have used 3 - 4 times . Friends seem to like it . Cards come in a little box so it 's nice to store on the shelf .
5 #### Fun game ! I was deciding between a few versions of fluxx for some first - time players , and this was the perfect choice
5 #### I love Fluxx games and this one is just as fun as the rest .
4 #### It 's a quick game , normally lasts 15 minutes when I play . I give it four stars because it 's just not the greatest game in the world and certainly not the best fluxx game available . I just love the theme !
5 #### I can not stress enough how much we love this game . This was our first version of Fluxx , and although we have played ( and own ) several other Fluxx versions since then this one still remains everyone 's absolute favorite . My mom is obsessed with it . My sister and I are obsessed with it . My nieces ( even one who ca n't read yet ) are obsessed with it ( although the youngest one needs a lot of help obviously ) . It is one of 2 games that goes on every vacation with us . Some versions of Fluxx have odd cards / rules that take a while to get used to ( like the way that the zombies are used and passed around in Zombie Fluxx ) but this game is straightforward and fun . I also like that it is a quick game ( we 've had games as short as 2 minutes , but even our longest game was only about 15 minutes long ..... although that being said we are addicted to it enough that we will play it would 2 - 3 hours straight ) .
5 #### This game is a lot of fun and small enough to easily bring with you anywhere . My husband likes to bring it to work and play it on his lunch break sometimes . The games go quick enough that you can easily walk away whenever you want but it 's fun enough to play for hours as well . It 's also easy to learn and only takes 1 game to understand . It 's the kind of game that attracts it 's own crowd at a party and people will go out and buy it or one of the many other Fluxx games when they get home . There are lots of different variations of Fluxx which is great since everyone has different interests . Our personal favorites are Cthuluhu Fluxx , Pirate Fluxx , and Monty Python Fluxx . They are each fun for their own reasons and different enough to own more than one .
5 #### Lots of fun ! Our family enjoys this game ! We also have pirate fluxx !
4 #### Light , fun card game that sends up old sci - fi tropes . Star Trek , Star Wars , Dr. Who , 2001 and more are all represented .
3 #### A friend of mine introduced me to the wonder of Fluxx . And I really loved it . The game 's ever changing rules definitely make each play completely different . I played firefly Fluxx and enjoyed it . Star Fluxx tries it 's best to touch upon many different franchises while not having the copyright rights to them . Now that 's not he problem , but after playing a newer version of Fluxx , playing an older version I 'm not used to the unpolished look to the cards , and there seems to be less rules and more goals and keeper cards that add more complexity over the game . Not my favorite deck but I 'm still glad I own it .
5 #### Hilarious and fun addition to our Fluxx games . Yarrggggh !
5 #### Absolutely love this variation on Fluxx . If you 're a pirate fan , like talking like a pirate , and like Fluxx , you owe it to yourself to grab this variation and introduce it to your friends . Getting everyone to play with pirate speak is great fun !
5 #### We are always looking for games that can be played with only two people . This game is fun , and is always changing . I love that there is a chance for you to talk about your greatest fears as well in this game .
5 #### Fluxx games are great party and family games . Good pirate theme with some new interrupt cards
3 #### Other Fluxx games I 've played seem to have more Creepers which help the game stay challenging . This one only has two . The accent card is fun , but get 's old pretty quick . I definitely like the original and Batman Fluxx games better .
5 #### Gift for my nephew for Talk Like a Pirate Day & he loves it .
5 #### If you know anything about Lovecraft or the Cthulhu mythos ( which I 'm assuming you do because you are on this page ) you know that Lovecrafts works have an overlying theme of chaos , madness , and insanity . That theme fits extremely well with Fluxx ! The rules can change in an instant and you really can not predict how the game will go , which makes it very replayable . I suppose you could also think of it as Calvinball the card game . It also manages to feel very Lovecraftian ( unlike some other themed versions of games that feel identical to the originals only with different characters ) . I 've only played it with two people , but I can imagine that it would be just as fun , if not more so , with a lot more . Games last anywhere from 5 minutes to 45 , depending on how the cards fall . The boyfriend and I have been playing this about every Sunday since we bought it , that that was months ago . I would highly recommend this game !
5 #### This is an amazing game edition . It can take a playthrough to fully get down the rules , but once you play you know exactly what to do . Fluxx - Cthulhu Edition plays like normal flux except that it involves the mystery , horror , and doom of H.P Lovecraft 's monsters , characters , and items . This edition has an added type of Goal called the UnGoal - where if its conditions are met , then Doom ( the monsters ) Win and everyone loses ( unless you play with the added Meta Rule ~ which allows whoever is holding the Cultist or Secret Cultist card to win ) ~ Which I think is a great addition / change from normal Fluxx as it adds an aspect of not only trying to work against each other but with each other at the same time ( unless you 're the cultist of course ) . The rules , goals , and keepers are constantly changing throughout the game , making it both a quick and long game , a ton of fun , and has a high replay value for the price . I have played this game with both friends and family and is enjoyed by all . It 's been asked to be brought out / played whenever we 're together . Lovers of Cthulhu and/or Fluxx will greatly enjoy this edition .
3 #### Played this a few times and can get a little crazy in game play with new rules and goals / ungoals , but not a bad game . I would HIGHLY recommend getting " Hastur the Unspeakable " Promo card , and maybe a few others if REALLY want to add some fun to the game . UPDATE : I read reviews about this game fore deciding to purchase it . While I feel Cthulhu themes , like zombies , has been overdone I bought this Fluxx due to a review that said it was the best out of all other versions they played . While it is nice to have a game that has a chance to win , it turned out to be a nice way to make the game end faster after it seemed to drag on and on , wither from not having the right cards to having a creeper out on your field . The randomness of the game made it feel more like you needed luck than anything else to win . Having played 3 - 4times it now sits on my shelf collecting dust , even after buying some extra promo cards . Sadly live and learn , but I could not recommend this game if you want a clear cut way to win without sitting there for a long time just to get to an end .
5 #### Have n't played it yet but looks very tempting , heard it was very hard
5 #### This has to be up at the top of my husband 's and my favorite Fluxx games ( we own nearly all of them ) . There are clever references from Star Wars , Star Trek , Doctor Who , Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , and more . But it 's not the references that makes this our favorite Fluxx but the game mechanics and some of the special action cards . I do n't want to spoil it , but Brain Transference is my favorite . It stays fresh and fun when we 've over played all the other Fluxx varieties .
4 #### Star Fluxx is fun in that it is unpredictable - the games can swing suddenly . It 's also fairly simple - the rules are : draw a card , play a card ( at least until someone plays a card that changes the rules ) . Not a whole lot of room for strategic depth , but it 's fun . Fits in a small backpack pocket nicely . Nerdy sci - fi references are definitely fun , if that 's your thing .
5 #### Great game to play with friends and family . It has an easy learning curve and the kids love changing the rules .
5 #### Awesome fluxx variation . Probably my favorite so far . Great balance of creepers and a lot of fun with pirate accent rules and having people call you the captain when you get the captain hat . I recommend it . Looking forward to Cthulhu fluxx as well .
5 #### Fun game silly and frustrating but entertaining to play . Something unlike any other game I 've played .
5 #### This has got to be my ultimate favorite version of fluxx . I do n't think it would mix well with any other versions , but the game play is exciting , and the doom point mechanics are an awesome addition to the game we know and love .
5 #### A game for all ages . We have not actually played yet ( life has gotten in the way ) but the cars are amazing and the game concept is great . Will be a perfect couples family game . !
5 #### I love the flux series and these themed version puts a fun twist on a challenging and strategic game .
5 #### Working great . Easy shipped Great game to play at home .
4 #### It 's Fluxx , It 's Stars ... what more could you ask for . Versatile and entertaining for the whole family .
4 #### the unpredictable rules card game fluxx with a funny space theme . If you like your games with straight clear rules , this game is not for you . If you like to manipulate rules and a little chaos in your game this is the game for you . recommend for 3 to 5 players .
5 #### Cthulhu fluxx is a nice and well rounded ' hard ' version of Fluxx I would say . It is VERY well balanced as far as action / rules / creepers etc cards in the deck . Not too easy but not too hard . Of the variations , I feel like it is one of the best as far as experiences as to what Fluxx can be . Also being a fan of Lovecraft , I enjoy the references . I would n't recommend it as a first version to play , but it is definitely one to enjoy .
5 #### Love this version of Fluxx . The addition of the Creepers makes for even more fun and changing games .
5 #### Son plays this game with his friends . They said that it is fun .
4 #### Such a great game . It was such a fast paced game and yet somehow still took two hours ! Still , I love it , and I definitely recommend as an addition to any major card gamer or tabletop gamer .
5 #### Have n't played it yet but looks very promising and if it 's anything like the other Flux games , I ca n't wait to play it , came in such a timely manner too
3 #### Not as much fun as Pirate or Zombie Fluxx , in our opinion . Maybe avid Cthulhu fans get more enjoyment from it .
5 #### This game is so funny ! I initially got interested in the game Fluxx from the YouTube show Tabletop with Wil Wheaton . I bought this version as well as Star Fluxx . Both games have some unique and funny gameplay and the rules are even funnier ! I love playing this game with my family
5 #### Great addition to our collection of fluxx ! Only two creepers , but a ton of fast paced fun .
4 #### I Love this Deck . Its definitely one of the more harder decks to play , the rules are a little complicated , and its easy to get lost to the rules lol . But if you can master the rules , and keep on track with what s going on , then you 're going to love this game . The game itself can be thrilling , and nerving at times , since it is possible ( depending on the rules you play by ) that everyone can lose , and Cthulhu could win . Now that is wicked , " Doom Wins . " This game really is n't for the faint of heart . This deck is hard ! Not really best for a casual play , this game might give you a headache . So of course , this deck is great for veterans , but if you 're a casual player or a new person trying to get into the Fluxx , I would n't recommend this as your first deck . Maybe Star Fluxx or regular Fluxx is a great place to start . Things to know about this Deck A lot of Creepers Rules can easily get out of Control Doom Points ( basically a Doom Day Clock to End the Game ) And Secret Cultist Card ( Its a surprise ... shhhh ) If you can handle this , you 're going to have a great time . Have Fun ^_^
5 #### We LOVE Fluxx and all of its variations . This one was purchased for an H. P. Lovecraft fan , and they are sure to love it .
5 #### I already owned Monty Python Fluxx and loved it . Cthulhu Fluxx is another great addition and I would recommend it to any Lovecraft fans . Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
5 #### I love Cthulhu Mythos and I love Fluxx .... put the two together and there is great fun to be had .
5 #### Christmas gift , she said it was just what she wanted .
5 #### I had my doubts as to whether this game would be as good as the reviews said . This is absolutely a great game , especially for the price . The game can go to opposite extremes with one hand ( ex . play all ) . The big plus : A quick set up . This is one game you should own .
5 #### Awesome game , constantly changing , never the same boring thing . For sci fi geeks there are a lot of great references . I 've played the regular flux as well and like this ones card options a bit better .
5 #### We love all the Fluxx games ! I love how this one pokes fun at favorite space shows ( Firefly , Star Trek , Star Wars , etc . )
5 #### We love the Fluxx games ! We have Zombie Fluxx as well . One of the cards makes you groan like a zombie . And Pirate Fluxx has a card that requires you to talk like a pirate . Avast ! Looks like I needs to be brushing up on me pirate speak !
5 #### Great fun game . Quick games ( sometimes ) . It 's nice to have a few versions of FLUXX to switch between .
4 #### I got this as a birthday gift for a board - game - and - cthulhu - lover . We go back and forth on the games we 'll play . I 'm into strategy and spatial games : days of wonder games , carcassonne , blokus , that sort of thing . He likes storied RPGs . I * really * do n't like the Mars Attacks ! and Last NIght on Earth games , but the birthday lad sure does . I was hoping this one would meet us in the middle . My SO prefers my games , and was quite concerned as we went over , gift bag in hand . " You realize we 're going to play that now , right ? " " Yeah , but it 's HIS birthday . I did n't buy it for us , I bought it for him ! " His wife was even more concerned , and threw me a few dagger looks . Apparently she does n't care much for tentacles . Whoops ! Fortunately , it went over well with everyone . The birthday lad loved it . His wife liked it ( winning the first round helped ) , and found the tentacles were small enough not to bother her . Ahem . My SO and I tolerated it well , though it 's not going to hit our favorites any time soon . Best of all , it 's short . Happy gaming , folks - hope this helped !
5 #### I am a big fan of Lovecraft . I enjoy his work , and feel sympathy for him as I read . He was dealt a rough hand in life , and I think it really shows in his work . Melancholy , sometimes depressing , with little hope or cheer ; but exciting and thoughtful , as well . I buy some of the merchandise ( games , plush , etc . ) , but sometimes feel that the spirit of his work gets lost . I do not feel that this is the really the case with this Fluxx game though . As with all Fluxx games , the rules constantly change . You may be doing great then BAM ! You 're way behind everyone else . There is really no strategy , mainly just luck and trying your best . The cards are different in this version , darker of course . One card I got made everyone tell a fear they had , for example . It 's pretty fun , and the game can last just a few minutes ( seriously , we had a three player game once that ended in about 2 minutes ) , or it can go on for quite awhile ( well over an hour ) . I think it 's fun in any size group , and the price amazon has it for is really good . I would n't recommend this for smaller children , as there is reading , they might not enjoy the artwork , and depending on the length of the game they get bored . Great for Lovecraft fans though !
5 #### Out of all the fluxx I 've played this is my favorite . Although it seems as if someone always wins pretty fast . Still really fun ! Highly recomended for game night !
4 #### I like this version , but I do n't love it . My favorite Fluxx version is Star Fluxx , but this is a close second . I 've read a good deal of Lovecraft but for anyone who is n't familiar with his mythos are bound to be confused . My husband struggles to remember what cards go together and does n't enjoy it as much as our other versions .
3 #### I thought this game was going to be a lot of fun , I 've had heard great things about it but after playing a few games , it 's just MEH , not that good .
5 #### Keith Baker , the designer of Cthulhu Fluxx , gets the Lovecraftian point : in a mad universe in which the forces of unreason will inevitably destroy us all , only random , idiot chaos wins . This is what makes Cthulhu Fluxx so much fun to play . You ca n't win with the various Creepers , but you probably ca n't win without them , either . The Ungoals throw the game to the forces of evil , and even the regular Goals are delightfully twisted ( " The player who has Federal Agents and the Drunk on the table wins " ) . If you know your Lovecraft , you 'll enjoy getting the story references , and if you do n't , it does n't affect the gameplay . As usual with Fluxx , sheer luck determines the winner , but in Fluxx , unlike , say , chess , winning is n't the point . You get to play with madness , and is n't that cool ? This is by far the best version of Fluxx I 've ever played . It 's more complex than&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Zombie - Fluxx / dp/1929780664 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Zombie Fluxx</a > , nowhere near as coy as&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Star - Fluxx / dp/1936112191 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Star Fluxx</a > , and unlike&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Stoner - Fluxx / dp/1929780451 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Stoner Fluxx</a>&nbsp;you do n't have to be high to enjoy it .
4 #### Star Fluxx is an extremely simple and quick to play game . You can be up and playing in about 5 minutes . It is also a lot of fun as long as you understand that this game is not fair . It is meant to be crazy and as the name suggested constantly in Fluxx . The rules will continue to change and your card draws will be the main determination of whether you win or lose . Having said that , my gaming group loves this game and we can always pull it out when we want to play a light card game .
5 #### I have had this game for years and have played this game well over 100 times . I have also played it with many different groups of people . Every group has loved it . I have tried nearly every Fluxx game , and always come back to this version . In my opinion , it has the most versatility of any version . For those familiar with the game , it has Creepers , Keepers with abilities , a good amount of surprise cards , and some fun / unique action and rule cards . If you 're looking for a card game that has depth , but it easy to learn and lighthearted , this is the game for you . It 's just as great for 2 players as it is for 6 people . You do n't need to love space or sci - fi to love this game , it 's universal to all groups ! Give this game a shot , you definitely will not regret it !
4 #### This is a love or hate game , I happen to love it and I take it with me every where . We play it at restaurants and always get people asking about it . Every card is a Star Trek/ Star Wars/ Dr Who/ Firefly/ every sci - fi on earth reference . If you like sci - fi get this Fluxx .
3 #### This game has 2 rules and no end case , so if everyone at the table is paying attention it can be hard for this game to ever end . As a result it usually out lives how fun it is . That being said if you like silly cards and piratey things it is a fun game to play while someone preps the next game of the evening
4 #### This is a fun game and does n't take much time , right around 20 minutes . One of the things we like about it is that it 's small and easy to pack for travel .
5 #### A simple yet challenging game . The rules start out very simple and then they keep changing . Having Cthulhu around just makes it even better .
5 #### My hubby is a Lovecraft fan and enjoys games , at least easy to learn ones . So he got this for father 's day . We were able to pick up and play a couple games right away and it 's alot of fun . The " single deck " in the title is misleading , you get the full game . The artwork is very cool and fans will enjoy the characters and places from HP Lovecraft novels .
2 #### I was dissapointed that the cards looks just like the original Fluxx . The same border , text , and bland pictures . Cartoon Network Fluxx is a much better example of how to do a follow up to the original .
4 #### This is a good fluxx version , but it 's not my favorite .
5 #### We love this game , easy to figure out , easy to play .
5 #### This is our favorite version of Fluxx . Second best would be Martian Fluxx . It would definetly be easier to learn with an easier version if Fluxx but this was our first so it is doable to learn on this version .
5 #### Such a fun game ! Very easy to learn and a lot of fun to play with two people or more . Its fun that the game changes every time you play it
5 #### This game has been a great staple for my nephew and I. We love the sci - fi fantasy aspects of the game and the non - copyrighted keepers like the Lazer Sword . I play fluxx frequently and love it !
2 #### Really ca n't get into this game , and neither can anyone else . Still , it gets good reviews , and I 'm hoping that one day the right group of people will get together . It seems like it should be fun . I 'm going to keep hope alive for this one , but so far .. nothing .
3 #### We 've played a few games of Fluxx and while it is easy to learn and play , it just is n't a very exciting game . The idea that the goal continually changes is neat , but it continually changes so often you really have no way to strategize . It ends up coming down to holding cards in your hand that you ca n't play so another player wo n't win , until you have to play something to end the game . Thankfully it was n't very expensive . This is my first Fluxx style game but I assume all of them are very similar in nature .
5 #### Cthulhu Fluxx is a pretty cool card game . The atmosphere of H.P. Lovecraft 's Cthulhu Mythos is astounding . Lots of Creepers and Keepers ! Fluxx Card Games are cool since the rules are always changing . Fluxx games are fast to play and easily understandable . This is a fun game , even when ' Darkness wins ' .
5 #### I have n't played any of the other versions of Fluxx - but this is a lot of fun . Easy to set up and super easy to explain the rules ! ( which is a bonus cause we usually play games like Arkham Horror - with a 30 min set up time and 30 min of explaination to start the game :) This is a fun way to kill 20 min or an hour !
5 #### Excellent addition to our Fluxx Collection . Bought this as a whim when it was a Lightning Deal - we already have several versions of the game . This one has become the most played deck we have . Highly recommended .
2 #### I was dissapointed that the cards looks just like the original Fluxx . The same border , text , and bland pictures . Cartoon Network Fluxx is a much better example of how to do a follow up to the original .
5 #### I bought this for my fiance as a christmas gift , and he and our friends love this game . Anytime there 's some lull in something to do , this is one of 2 of out go - to card games . It 's very easy to learn and catch on to , and a lot of fun . The games are always so different . I recommend this
4 #### Note : This review assumes the reader is familiar with Fluxx mechanics in general . Pros : ( 1 ) Fluxx + Lovecraft = Good ( 2 ) New card mechanics , including Investigator , Doom Count and " joined " Creepers ( that attach to a Keeper ) ( 3 ) Ungoals add an interesting twist , particularly when the rule forcing them to be played is down . ( 4 ) Two promo cards available ( can be found at the company web - site if your game store does n't have them ) ( 5 ) I really enjoy the Lovecraft flavor of this game , and the creative way that the lore was worked into the cards ( particularly the Necronomicon ) Caveats : ( 1 ) People who do n't like randomness in their gaming tend not to like Fluxx . It 's not true that there is no strategy at all , BUT strategy only takes you so far and can be easily disrupted by the strong random element . ( 2 ) The Ungoals can make it so that no one wins , and some people may find that frustrating . However , we generally play with the optional Secret Cultist rule , where if an Ungoal is met , the Secret Cultist wins , and someone usually has that card at the end . I 've only played one game where there was no winner because of an Ungoal . ( 3 ) People who are n't fond of the Lovecraft mythos , or for the dark gloom and doom flavor , might prefer a different version of Fluxx .
5 #### I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this game , the pacing is random and chaotic . However , it arrived missing five cards ( among them the Cover card itself Cthulu ) rendering a surprising number of goals to be unattainable .
5 #### This was a gift to my ( adult ) cousin , and she adored it . She has played the base Fluxx game , but did n't enjoy it as much as she loves this .
5 #### Fluxx with pirate : what 's not to love ? Like the original fluxx the game can be taught in thirty seconds . The game of ever changing rules now with a pirate theme . Pirate goals , pirate keepers , and pirate rules ( talk like a pirate is the best ) . If you love causal games for the whole family and pirates , this game is for you .
5 #### I purchased this on a lightening deal so I got it at a good price . We love Fluxx and we love Pirate Fluxx now too . This one is so much fun . But , all they 're games are fun !
3 #### We struggle to work with this game , though it 's fun even through the struggles . The rules change constantly , the goals change constantly , the play changes constantly - and the pirate theme , while kind of fun , gets a little old . I think if I was a little less anal and a little more flexible , I would enjoy it more . As it is , I do n't really enjoy it because I need at least a little structure . My 12 year old and my husband like it pretty well , though .
5 #### My husband was thrilled to get this deck as well ! We have n't played it yet .
5 #### Great game for the family and friends . It is a fun game to play just pay attention to the game the rules always change . We have a Table Top Gaming Group club and we play this game and average of 20 times a month . We are now keeping track of our games on FB ( Table Top Gaming Group ) and have played this game 34 times in the past 22 days .
4 #### These are fun and just the right amount of sillyness .
5 #### Probably my favorite version of Fluxx . I love the sci - fi flair it has .
5 #### Fluxx is such a great little game - portable and easy to learn , and the constantly changing factor keeps it always exciting . I own a number of the variants and they are all similarly great and each has it 's own quirkiness making it easy to enjoy them all . ( I keep a copy in my car , a copy in my house , and a copy in my " games night " bag ) People who are used to planning a few moves ahead will take a little longer to truly enjoy this game since the constant changing can mess up all their forward planning , but once you accept this unpredictability as a challenge in itself , then you can have some real fun with Fluxx . Definitely recommend Fluxx to anyone .
4 #### This is a fun game for all ages , its basically a game of creating and constantly recreating rules with a pirate twist . Good for two or more players !
5 #### This one is one of the most recent versions we 've purchased . Whole family loves it . Great game , love how the rules constantly change .
5 #### The themed ( think every sf tv show or movie you 've ever seen , especially the B - type ) randomness makes for some silly , casual fun . Works great as a party game that allows for some tangential gibes and interactions . The randomness makes for a good casual game with little conflict .
5 #### Best Fluxx deck - almost enough actions and variety to create more than one successful strategy .... ha - fun nonetheless
5 #### Purchased as a gift and brought a smile of anticiaption .
5 #### Family never thinks much of my little " finds " . We now own two of these , one for the house and one that travels from friend to friend .
5 #### Arrrr matey , this game be loads of fun ! Me beauty will even play and she 's not the sort which likes tabletop games ! So , buy it now or walk the plank !
5 #### I LOVE this game ! Any of the Fluxx games are so fun and dynamic and change for every single game play . If you like Pirates and fun times , get this !
4 #### It another good Fluxx game , especially since we have 7 -8 people playing at a time .
5 #### I played this game with my cousins last year , and fell in love with it . So I bought me a deck of my own . At first the game can be a little confusing and intimidating , but once you learn the rules , the game can be quite fun , and addicting . It definitely fuels competition between friends lol . A great addition to this game , is the use of surprise cards , gives the game a edge and keeps players on their toes . Just because you think you will win , does n't mean you will ( wink ) . Compared to the other Fluxx games I 've played , in my opinion Star Fluxx is the best , the game hits the sweet spot between intense and easy going . One game you could have a long intense show down , or a casual easy going game . Also the Makers of the Game are great . When I lost one of my cards , they were able to send me one free in the mail . They 're really caring for their players . PS Finally got that New Model for my Computer ^_--
4 #### We bought this based off of reviews from a great board game review website , but in the interest of trying to maintain the guidelines for review wo n't mention the site at this time . :) But we also looked at reviews on here and that cinched it for us . Once we opened the pack we played it over and over and even play it when friends come over . In fact , we let some friends borrow it some time back and it has n't returned yet . lol There is some reading involved so if you have children that are just beginning it might be a neat way to help them along , but would n't recommend it for children who are too young to really read well , unless it is just the two of you playing and you want to use it to help them enjoy reading . Having said all of that I do n't want to give the impression there is a lot of reading involved like a novel level . Just that each card has a little information on them that involves game play . So enjoy ! We sure do . Oh we also picked up the regular Flux version and it is also great fun !
5 #### Great game is a good game and is a nice fun filled game to play with a friend at game night
4 #### the Fluxx games are loved by kids and hated by grown ups . IMO , this is because there is no strategy . Randomness and Chaos prevail . My girls love this , love how the rules change frequently and have lots of fun laughing when the Captain 's Hat is out .
4 #### While I 've not personally played all version of Fluxx , the format to playing is all the same . Some minor strategy with a lot of randomized gameplay thrown in . Classic and Pirate Fluxx have been the two I 've played with my significant other and friends . Pirate Fluxx is definitely themed appropriately and is slightly humorous , but more generic than I feel it could have been . There are certain cards that cross the 4th wall , forcing you to talk like a pirate or address a player as captain which I find to be a bit too cheesy , but for younger or more casual players , that 'll be fun to do for a few times . Overall gameplay can either go quick , or drag on a long time depending on how the stack ends up . I 've played games that have burned through near the entire deck with two players which gets boring and tedious to deal with , but most games are pleasant .
5 #### Pirate Fluxx is my favorite Fluxx compared to all the others ( and I 've played almost all of them ) . This one is exciting because you can " hide your booty " and " get scurvy " and you have to " talk like a pirate " sometimes if that rule card is played . So much fun !
2 #### I was trying to find a kind of fantasy game to play with my 6 year old son and this was a fail . It was confusing and boring . The goals are just having certain cards . Too many cards for my son to keep track of and the play was really boring . I will try the Dungeon board game next , that 's probably more like what I was looking for .
3 #### I like fluxx . Expected better from StarFluxx . But still playable . Zombies and Pirates all day , Cuthulu is the most complex
4 #### Fun game . It gets repetitive quickly though . Not so different from the other fluxx games with only a few really differentiating cards to set it apart as truly unique .
5 #### crazy random fun with constantly changing rules and winning conditions . great art work on the cards .
5 #### You want infinite fun anywhere ? You want almost infinite replay value ? You want uncertainty of when someone will win or lose ? This game is a regular at my tabletop , fun and simple enough for everyone . When a game does n't have stable rules things get chaotic , this is chaotically fun ! ! !
5 #### Was n't my favorite fluxx game , but the kids enjoyed it . There 's a rule where you have to talk like a pirate so it was a lot of fun .
5 #### I thought this would be the same as the other Flux games , but with a space theme . However , there are cards in this set which employ totally different mechanics than the other versions ; making this more than merely a re - theming .
5 #### I ordered this as a birthday gift for my teenage son . He loves them and has been asked to take them when he goes to visit friends . Our family loves them too . It can be difficult for us to find a game that we all like and this is one we can all play . We love the game so much , I bought a second set and have given 2 sets as gifts . Highly recommend . There are many topics if you are not a space fan !
4 #### The basic game called " Fluxx " is as simple as ' Draw a card , then play a card . ' From there , everything gets crazy . Some cards played alter the rules , change the victory conditions , or even add new game play elements . It 's an easy game to learn , but since the rules change often , player need to be able to pay attention . Great game for kids or families .
4 #### Fluxx is the ever changing card game . The additional elements in Pirate Fluxx make this one very different from the traditional Fluxx and different from other themed Fluxx games like Oz Fluxx . Be sure to brush up on your " Pirate Speak " for when the talk like a pirate rule goes into effect and you can enjoy being the Captain complete with the hat !
4 #### a good gift for a game playing friend who can be hard to buy for . This game comes in several versions , which is nice to adapt to other intersts that they have .
4 #### Wonderful game for novices and experts alike . The only real caveat is the length of play , as the victory conditions can change at the drop of a hat . Games can be as short as a few minutes to almost 2 hours ( these are the extremes I have been a part of ) , something to keep in mind .
5 #### It plays pretty much the same to all the other fluxx games . It does add some really cool keeper interactions . Loved this as an addition to my games cabinet .
5 #### This game offers a unique experience to gamers of all levels . The rules change as you play , creating a unique game each time . Great for any gamer in any family .
4 #### If you are introducing the game to new players , make sure they are comfortable with variable goals or you will be in for a frustrating game . If you can deal with the fluctuating rules and changing goals , then this is a fun game . This edition has a special appeal for science fiction fans with all the in - jokes and nods to various popular stories / movies / tv shows .
5 #### My husband had me order this after playing Fluxx with friends in his downtime during deployment . We played it together with our 7yr old son tonight and I 'm ready to buy another deck to mix in . This is a great game that keeps things fresh with no boring lag between turns . It was a little slow going at first as my son and I learned all the " rules " but once we got going , it had us all tied in . Also ready to check out some other Looney Labs games ( Aquarius maybe ? ) now too !
5 #### We have played many variations of this game and this is my favorite . Especially love suprise cards which can block other player 's actions ( or even block their block ) . COuld live withouth the " talk like a pirate " card though .
5 #### I have about four different Fluxx card games and this is my favorite . This is definitely a must have for Scifi fans . The best addition to this version are creepers that attach themselves to Keepers .
5 #### Fast paced , constantly changing and very unpredictable . I would recommend this to both gamers and casual players alike . My family and I enjoy playing this game and it has great pace to break up some of the longer games we play .
5 #### This game is as hilarious as the other Fluxx editions . Delivery was fast too ! It will be great to shuffle into the other decks we have and see how crazy things get !
5 #### Hysterical ! Lots of fun ! Expect nothing less from the folks at Looney Labs . Great for two or more players . Highly recommend this game .
5 #### Fluxx is an ever - changing game , competitive without being ( forgive the pun ) cutthroat . It 's a fantastic ice - breaker game for when friends or relatives come over , since it gets people talking , laughing and even a little trash - talking ! Rules and goals change with a flip of the card , and even the most inexperienced player can win . Pirate Fluxx has great winning combinations like Keg of Rum , and Key Lime Pie , Surprises like That Be Mine and Avast ! Halt ! , Actions like King 's Ransom , Mutiny and Rough Seas , as well as all of the standard Actions and Rules . It 's a very cute twist on the basic Fluxx game , and a nice addition to your game closet .
4 #### this is a very fun , quick , and easy to learn game . startup is very quick , and cleanup is even faster . This game is great for anyone who likes star wars , star trek , or sci fi movies in general as you are sure to get the references pretty quick !
4 #### bought this card game a gift . The kids really enjoyed playing it . Did not seem to hard to play . Easy to read instructions
5 #### My son - in - law is building his game collection and requested this . He was excited to play it during the Christmas holidays
5 #### Played for the first time with fellow nerdy friends recently , had to immediately hop on here and buy it myself . If you ever watched any nerdy sci - fi shows or movies , this interesting game will keep you laughing with all the inside jokes and characters . Even without them , the interesting gameplay keeps you guessing until the end .
5 #### I am actually using this game in my counseling group with younger students to help them with their rigidness and dealing with the unexpected . The students love it and it has been great in getting them to be more flexible with their thinking . We play it with teams which makes it a little bit easier for them to understand and speeds up playing time . I play as my own team so I am able to have a little bit of control in changing things up . With your immature students expect them to point out that FLUXX sounds an awful like a certain four letter word they ca n't say . Actually , I thought the same thing when I first came across the game . The students love the pirate theme idea . We use a toy parrot to set in front of them if they get the captain card because , then we do n't have to worry about head lice with a hat . The students really get a kick out of having me call them the captain . Their favorite card is the talk like a pirate card , because I have the worst pirate accent .
4 #### This variant is easy enough to understand : Everyone is a pirate and the goals and themed New Rules will be piratey in nature . Arr ! Ye defines the game as it goes , so ye do , and there be little point in long - term strategy since the goals be a - changin faster than the wind at Cape Horn , so they do . I like this variant mostly because it allows me to talk like a pirate from the get - go and rewards me for doing so occasionally . The cards are amusing and the theme is a rich one , comedy - wise . But it is flawed in that there are only two creepers in the deck ( cards that prevent a win ) - Chains and Scurvy . Though it is fun that in this game scurvy is a communicable disease , both creepers are just too easy to be rid of and to be honest they might as well not be there . The game conceit had room for many more creepers in my opinion , so why the deck only has the two is beyond me . Despite that I recommend it to all would be pirates and most pasty - faced landlubbers too .
4 #### Colorful characters , a bit of " cut throat " and a few silly cards can create lots of fun . Out of all the Fluxx games , Pirate Fluxx is our second favorite . Zombie Fluxx is our # 1 so far . Original Fluxx is the easiest to learn and " kindest " to newbies , so I 'd start with that one , regardless .
5 #### So . Much . Fun . It 's a great card game , really easy to learn , can be played with both adults and kids , and on top of it all , makes fun of science fiction shows and movies we all love .
5 #### Definitely my favorite of the Fluxx games ( We have several versions ) . I bought this for my hubby the sci - fi geek , and even though I 'm not nearly as well versed in the sci - fi genre as he and many of our friends are , this is a great game . Best part was , I sent it to a friend and got it signed by Will Wheaton for him ! My hubby declared that the game / autograph combo was the " best birthday gift ever " , considering we were married on his birthday , I 'm not sure if I should be thrilled or offended ;)
5 #### Fluxx gets a lot of tepid reviews from players claiming the game is too random and contains too much luck . Well , those aspects are true . You can totally be winning at one point and in the very next turn , you 'll be furthest away from victory . As long as you are aware of this element , Fluxx is an entertaining little card game . I use Fluxx to introduce my friends and family to the deeper world of board games . Its just nice to be able to share your hobby with others and not intimidate them . I am also a fan of sci - fi and the reference in Star Fluxx are nice little bonuses . Sometimes you win a lot . Sometimes you lose a lot . Its really about how much of it feels controllable . By yourself , its absolutely manageable . Oh but this is a game with others . How foolish to expect any outcome at all . Well at some point you 'll draw a correlation between who you play with and how much you enjoy the game . You might not like the results , but therein lies the most important choice you 'll ever make in this game : who you play with .
5 #### Keep your Fluxx play in more flux by adding Star Fluxx or playing it stand - alone . While this is not our favorite theme Fluxx game it mixes well with any of the others and plays well on it 's own too . If you 've ever played any other Fluxx and have a desire to reach for the stars then this one might just be for you .
3 #### This card game that is quick with more luck than strategy . Good for a filler game between games , while waiting for something to start , and has humor in the cards for those versed in Star Trek and Star Wars . So their are jokes and one liners from the star theme .
5 #### This was a gift , very simple to play . Take a card , play a card . Very easy to play and does n't take that long . If you like games this is n't a terrible choice .
5 #### Lots of fun ! The rules are always changing , as are the goals to win by . It 's also great because it can be played by only two players as well as with a group .
5 #### A quick , easy game for kids of all ages ... easy to pick up & play anywhere & everywhere ... a must play for any gamer
5 #### I do not recommend this if you are new to Fluxx - start with the basic game and learn that . You will need people who are able to deal with change to play with you - in Fluxx the rules keep changing , and I have found that some people hate the game for that reason . This version of Fluxx is my favorite . It is more complex - the first time through , it takes forever to read each of the cards and understand the implications . To resolve this , make sure you have time to play at least three rounds the first time you sit down with the game . This version is even wilder than regular Fluxx , with more changes and quirks . If you are a science fiction fan , you will laugh out loud over some of the cards and actions associated with them . If you need a group of people that are willing to play with you - I have found them through Mensa and through meetup.com . Enjoy .
4 #### This card game is ridiculous in a good way . It starts out pretty simple , but can get incredibly insane after a few rounds . There are always cards to try and reign in the rules if they get too out of hand , but there 's almost no way to relax because there are some cards that will mess up any strategy you may be working with at the time . It 's become one of my favorite card games now . ( the other being uno )
5 #### This game is so fun ! The rules always change , strategy is almost non existent , even the game you have going in your hand may not be there for long . Yet in all the chaos you ca n't help but laugh and have a good time . You could even turn it into a hilarious drinking game . ;)
5 #### This card game is so much fun . The rules are super simple so it 's a great game for young children . My gaming group loves games like munchkin and betray at house on the hill . So this game fits right in . The game plays as follows everyone gets 3 card to start . To win the game you have to have the cards in play that are on the goal card that is in play . Each turn you draw one card and play one card . ( Unless a card allows you to do more of either . ) . Now here is where it gets fun . EVERYTHING can change and does you can play cards that change how many cards are drawn and played , how many cards you can have in your hand , and the most fun you can change the goal on your turn . The star edition of this game has a bunch of dr . Who , Star Wars and Star Trek references . Such as the " light sword " . Star fluxx was also featured on tabletop with wil Wheaton [ ... ] That is a link to a video showing them playing it . It is worth watching .
5 #### We love playing this game . The re play is high and it 's good value for the price of the deck . I just wish my husband would n't take it to work and leave it there . I 'd like to play it more !
5 #### ITs like your in space , and playing with space themes . My friends and I really enjoyed play with this fluxx . I also own few other fluxx games ... all of them are fun espically when you create your own rules and mix them with other fluxxs . very cool , and longer as well but fun .
5 #### I love the addition of keepers that have abilities . I also wish that there was a pack that integrates this version with the original . Like Cookies for the captain or other goals that use the original game and the Star Fluxx Keepers .
5 #### good game great game to pass the time . anyone can play and it is easy to understand . we paly it all the time and we try to stick each other . That is the fun part of it .
4 #### I do like these cards because they are sturdy and the photos ( not cartoons ) are great . The price is great too ! But as soon as your child can sound out words , he / she can not use these to quiz himself . The Spanish word is on both sides , so you have to cover it when wanting the child to respond to the picture without reading . But I agree with the other review - for ages 4 and under , these are nice , practical words that are useful for any level of Spanish learning . TREND makes a card set that 's similar , and has the photo on one side , English and Spanish on the other , so you can teach English or Spanish . I like those a bit better , but they are a little more expensive . My own four children ( ages 5 and under ) and I use both sets before and after our Flip Flop Spanish Workbooks .
5 #### If you 've never played FLUXX , then this is a fine introduction to the game . All versions share similar rules and the basic game is original and fun , with nary a learning curve to stop novice players from enjoying it . If you are ( or know someone who is ) a sci - fi movie fan , then this is a must buy . Most movies and shows in the genre are referenced in thinly veiled quips that consistently bring a smile to my face . FLUXX itself is a fun game even for 2 people , although the entertainment increases with more people . I am quite pleased with the purchase .
5 #### I bought this for my son for Christmas . He loves playing it and so do his friends . Fun and easy to learn . Different . The more you play the better . Recommended .
5 #### Great card game , with completely different style of play and rules than you will be used too . There are many types of Fluxx games available , but when I saw Star Fluxx , I did n't even consider buying any of the others ( OK , maybe the Monty Python , but I think the non - trademark style of the cards makes Star Fluxx so fun and hilarious ) . This was my first time playing Fluxx and I did n't have any problems understanding the rules , but I do find myself forgetting some of my keeper powers , but that s just the fun of playing , knowing you may have been able to win last round if you had done x , y , or z. Of course , since there are many pathways to victory , there are also many pathways to have victory snatched from you , completely unrelated to your own stupidity . Most Star Fluxx games for us become a battle of attrition , to see how long you can play before someone gets lucky enough to have the right keepers , without anyone being able to foil their victory .
5 #### Keeps you on your toes . constantly changing so you do n't get bored . Very clever and funny similarities with Star - Geek stuff
5 #### This is a space themed version of the game Fluxx . A lot of first time players find Fluxx to be complicated but once you understand the mechanics of it then its actually a simple and fun game to play . To win the game you have to match your hand ( called keepers which are face up on the table in front of you ) with the current goal in play . For example , the goal might be to have the captain , doctor , expendable crewman , and one other crewman card . The game starts off by drawing a card and playing a card . You can put keeper cards down as part of your turn but you may also play a rule card or goal card , etc . A goal card changes the winning objective . A rule card might change how many cards to draw during your turn . The game gets crazier when players have cards to steal keepers or cancel actions . Also in the mix are creepers which are cards that attach themselves to other cards for better or worse . Typically a creeper prevents you from winning the game tho some goals might actually require it . I recommend at least 3 - 4 players for this game as it does get a little too predictable when you have only two players . The best thing about this game is because the goal can change and discarded cards can come back into play nobody is every out of contention to win the game .
5 #### The best part of these vocabulary cards is that the creator included the articles ! Not just reloj but el reloj . Too many Spanish learning books leave them out . Then students have to learn them twice .
5 #### I picked up this one after watching Wil Wheaton 's Tabletop . This is an incredibly fun game , and it highly addictive . Even if you 're not the average CCG gamer ( Magic the Gathering being the most common ) , which we 're not , you will still find this very fun . My wife compared it to the strategy you use in gin rummy . But lets be honest , most reading this review , or checking out this product are already gamers of a sort anyway . This version of Fluxx can be played anywhere , tho a small flat surface with no wind is best , an airplane tray would still work . As with all versions of fluxx , the game starts simply enough . You have three cards to start , and you draw one , play one . Seems simple until you play rule , action , or goal cards to change things up . You win the game with keepers and are either hindered or helped with creeper cards ( depending on the goal ) . It is a VERY random and sometimes silly game . My six year old daughter loves playing the game , even though she can not follow most of the rules , and acts as a spoiler most times making a random game even more random . The best part of this one is for sci - fi buffs ( geeks / nerds ) , there are lots of sc - fi show / book / movie in - jokes that will keep everyone laughing . This can be quick or grueling , it all depends on the rules and goals of the moment .
5 #### This is your standard late period Fluxx game with New Rules & Action Cards you 've seen before in other sets and Action Cards that are by - and - large the same as in your other sets . There are four new cards that may be played out - of - term to mess with other player 's card plays . But the clever part is in the Goal , Keeper and Creeper cards , which manage to evoke every popular Sci - Fi " vehicle " you 've heard of ( and maybe some you have n't ) without actually requiring a license from any of the IP owners . This is so clever I have no way to describe it . Play is the usual " define the game as you play " affair . The theme is an amusing and clever one , as I 've said . I recommend it , though my favourite variant is still Martian Fluxx .
5 #### This is my favorite Fluxx of the 4 styles I have played . While all my other Fluxx games basically change themes , Star Fluxx has some new rules and action cards .
5 #### Sturdy cards . Use them often with our kids . Nice images too .
5 #### We are loving these cards ! Nice size and quality .
4 #### Only a few words that are off track on meaning but basically a good start for reinforcing words in spanish . Good quality .
3 #### Bought this as gift for grandchildren to announce our upcoming vacation to Mexico . As flash cards they are OK . Only about half seemed relevant to what the kids would want to know . Identifies only things , nouns . There is no help with verbs .
5 #### We use these all the time and my toddlers are bilingual and the flash cards help .
5 #### These are some of our favorite Spanish flash cards . Great price too !
2 #### useless for my needs , I gave them to charity .
5 #### These are awesome great reinforcement for my children , one is 9 years old and the other is 3 , they are both able to use it . The 9 year old reads and makes sentences . The 3 year old repeats after me and he says it if he knows it before me . Now I do have a question how do I get to review products that are sent to me for free ?
4 #### they are good for beginner language learners . Unfortunately , my niece who came from a Spanish speaking country knew more English than I gave her credit for . But her American mother - in - law decided they were good for her !
4 #### I gave these to my grandson to practice . They were to elementary for me .
5 #### I 'm slowly trying to learn Spanish because I will be teaching in a school with a high population of Hispanic people and wanted to start somewhere . These flash cards , along with others I bought at the same time , are perfect for learning basic things that will also interest my preschool students . Great quality cardstock . I put mine onto split rings for on - the - go learning . Definitely recommend .
5 #### These cards are a great thickness to work with , and the curved edge makes it easy to take one off the stack . The topics included are nicely comprehensive ( colors , body parts , shapes , etc ) . My kids will do one " section " of vocab at a time and I can quiz them . I am going to look for another set of flash cards that have Spanish on one side and English on the other to add to our collection . This set has the same Spanish word on both sides with one picture of the word on the back ( just like the box pictures ) . We ca n't use them for quizzing ourselves back and forth for learning vocabulary , but they are good words to learn with a nice , easy read font .
5 #### Good set that has a lot of words the kids pick up on fast .
5 #### Trying to teach my daughter Spanish and these cards are fantastic .
5 #### Purchased for my godson who 's having difficulty learning Spanish hoping this will help him
5 #### I love these flashcards my daughter is leaning quick because they have a picture paired with the word . I 'm very satisfied !
5 #### Excellent flashcards for a English speaking speech pathologist working with Spanish speaking children
4 #### Cards are okay . I wanted smaller cards to carry in my purse . These are as wide as the box is tall ( maybe 6 " by 3 " ) . Would be good for someone holding card up for a class .
5 #### This product is Great . I already rated this product . I 'm satisfied with this item .
3 #### The flashcards were useful .... but after using them just a couple of times , my nephew ( 8th grade ) lost interest and so they were n't the useful tool we had hoped .
1 #### Do nt buy if you do n't know spanish ! These cards have No English on them . Thought they were spanish translated . They are only spanish , have pictures on them but you have to hope that its what you think . I should have listened to the other hints when they said not for beginners ! Wish I could send back !
5 #### I am teaching my 2 year old both English and Spanish .. these cards work great for our spanish day 's :) :)
5 #### Granted , a few reviews on here made mention of the fact that there was no English translation or pronunciation key but other than that - they 're great ! They 've covered every object under the sun ... perfect !
4 #### This would be a good purchase for someone who is beginning to learn Spanish . The vocabulary is pretty basic . The pictures are nice . The corners are curved on one edge in order to sort these cards easily .
4 #### it was exactly what i needed and i would recommend to any one trying to learn a new language easily
4 #### I like having these flash cards on the nightstand . We can review them in bed first and then I can read my daughter a relaxing book to help her fall asleep . Estas tarjetas de repaso son buenas para tener en la mesa de noche . Primero repaso las tarjetas con mi hija y despus de eso , le leo un cuento ms relajante para que duerma .
5 #### These cards are great and they came in the mail fast . I am re - learning spanish that I forgot and learning spanish that I did n't know . I feel like I 'm at the beginner stage with learning spanish again and these cards make it very easy to learn a lot of important and common spanish words . Books have not worked very well for me , but these flash cards are great .
5 #### I love dot - to - dots and this just adds to it . These are great for plane rides or just hanging out at home . Even after you 've done all of them you can color them too to make them come alive . I plan on buying different ones too . Thanks .
5 #### Bought as a Christmas present for my 7 and 10 year old boys . They love this . They love numbers , and drawing , and they get to do both . So perfect !
5 #### Giving it as a gift for my 87 year old mother
5 #### I love doing adult Dot to Dot . I enjoyed it very much .
5 #### Great for passing time , lots of fun to see end results ! !
5 #### Fun at any age - a good gift to yourself or someone else .
5 #### I got this as a gift to give my sister and she thought it was a lot of fun doing it and she is in her 50 's ..
5 #### Absolutely amazing way to waste time while on vacation or at work on a slow night . You pretty much need to have a straight edge to connect half the dots . The dots are super small so they 're really hard to see . If you have bad eyesight I would n't recommend these . They should be good for kids over the age of 10 . I liked this book so much and it was so fun to do the puzzles that I bought other books by the same makers .
5 #### I bought this book for myself when I was recovering from a surgery that would keep me in bed for a long time . What a treat . The book is printed on high quality paper , the designs are wonderful with the only exception being Easter Island , and it 's a very relaxing nostalgic pastime . The book was well worth the $ 9 I paid . I did two or three a day , first in pencil , then retracing with a black marker and boy did that make the pictures really pop ! I have not colored mine yet but I can only guess they are even more beautiful that way . I love the international scenes . I will be very sorry when I finish the book . While there are other extreme dot to dot books published by this company , I am not as impressed as I am with these . Go for it and make the purchase . It really is fun !
5 #### So challenging and fun ! Goes well with our Social Studies curriculum and keeps the fast finishers busy .
5 #### My son loves these . Ordering more for this christmas .
5 #### Lots of fun . It takes a while to figure out what the picture is . Sometimes it is a surprise , other times , I can see what it will be sooner . I enjoy these puzzles for the challenge they are . These are not your typical puzzle . You must search for the beginning , # 1 , and then when you reach a star , or end mark , you again search for the next number .
5 #### Oh my this is quite the dot to dot ! ! I got it for my 7 yr old grandson who loves doing dot to dot pictures . This is quite challenging with pictures that require dots in the hundreds and even some that go to into the one thousand range . I got this for him for Christmas 2015 and he is still doing the pictures and it is now August ! ! Great buy for any one any age who loves doing dot to dot . The American theme is also awesome and has caused my grandson to ask questions about the places that he is drawing . Ca n't go wrong with this book ! !
5 #### I bought this for a gift for my 11 - year - old nephew , he has had other sand loved them . but to be honest , I 've bought another one for me because it looks like a lot of fun ! Ca n't wait !
5 #### My kids think these are the greatest puzzles ever . They love the complexity and enjoy doing them to see the finished picture .
5 #### This book is really fun and enjoyable . Both my kids continue to enjoy it as a fun extra for our homeschooling .
5 #### There is no way to describe what you see ! I did n't know that so many little dots could occupy a single page . This book is phenomenal , my kids , 10 , 12 , and 14 work on these dot to dots for a long time , and when they start to see what is revealing through their connecting of those dots . I think it teaches our kids great deals of patience and helps reinforce their concentration to levels that most children in our world today lack . Very challenging for all ages , even adults .
5 #### Great product . Fun to do something with just a pencil and paper . The concept is easy but there is definitely a challenge involved . Highly recommend for those who like puzzles and games .
5 #### This is a book with dots of different places around the world that you line up the dots to put together , it is challenging and fun at the same time .
5 #### I had to beg my son to let me have this ... It 's just too cool and makes for a great diversion from TV .
5 #### I was introduced to these by a teacher at my school and had to get some for myself . They are fun , even for adults , but especially for kids . We work with teenagers and even they love them !
4 #### Grandson was entertained . keeps a child busy on the plane ride .
4 #### This has been fun for my 10 year old son and I to work on . The numbers are fairly easy to read and we 've had fun trying to guess what we are drawing .
5 #### I find these Dot to Dot books to be very interesting and challenging . There not as easy as i,2,3 . The designs are American icons across the country . They are educational as well as attractive . And , bonus , answers are in the back !
5 #### Adults : sharpen your pencils . If you liked puzzles , and dot - to - dot books when you were a kid , you 'll love this dot - to - dot book . I bought my first extreme dot - to - dot book for my adult children for Christmas stocking stuffers , and they immediately started to work on the puzzles . I bought more books ! It 's a pleasant thing to do , and is great for a low - stress , take - your - mind - off - stuff kind of thing to do . What can I say -- I love puzzles of any kind and this book is fun to do !
5 #### I never realized there were such challenging and fun Dot to Dots out there . When you think of Dot to Dot you think of a child and these are great for adults too .
4 #### My grand daughter enjoys this and has almost completed it since Christmas morining . I would think it was a good purchase .
5 #### This was a gift for myself .... I never knew they had such large connect the dots . So much fun and such a challenge . So relaxing and great pastime . I love the pictures which you can color if you choose . Would recommend as a great Christmas Socking Stuffer or a anytime gift .
5 #### Perfect for older children who like to color but are to old for normal coloring books . Fun watching the picture come to life .
5 #### Extreme Dot to Dot books are AWESOME . My 7 year old is in love with them . The illustrations are great , it 's almost magical how the images appear out of these fields of dots . I know a couple of adults that love these as well . Get it , young or old , you 'll love it !
5 #### Complex and fun challenge for adults and teens . Love the USA theme .
5 #### This was a gift for my twelve year old granddaughter . She loves these extreme dot to dot . She is a very bright student and loves the challenge of these puzzles .
5 #### I have visited all of these places . .. and just got introduced to dot - to - dots . This is better than TV , and it is a break from reading . I have ordered several other adult dot - to - dot books . I recommend everyone taking time out to try this craft , you may find you like the change and challenge .
5 #### So much fun . Good way to pass the time away .
5 #### My kids loved these - I bought two different ones . They keep my kids ( 8 and 9 ) entertained , and they are challenging . My kids love trying to figure out what the picture is of , and my daughter even colors the pictures .
5 #### Christmas Gift for the grandsons and each one love doing them . They are ages 11 - 14 .
5 #### My daughter loves it ! Hours of entertainment . Much nicer pictures than your normal connect the dot puzzles .
5 #### My nine year old son loves the Extreme Dot to Dot . They can entertain him for hours .
5 #### Awesome . My 3rd grade daughter loves it . My kids are fighting over it . I may have to buy another one . Great for car rides or quiet time .
5 #### Another Christmas gift that was welcomed and well received by a young 30 yr . old man .
5 #### This book goes in my 8 - year old 's church bag for Sunday mornings , along with his Boogie Board . He 's almost completely finished all the Dot - to - Dots , so he 'll be getting another Extreme book for Christmas . This is only our first , but it was a great introduction , and a nice challenge for a little boy .
5 #### Looking for a cheap way to occupy the children for , oh , hours without resorting to television ? These are great . I ca n't pretend they are educational but they do get a pencil into their grubby hands and have them looking at numbers . Children also feel a sense of achievement and completion which is wonderful . Very handy to have for fidgety children at a restaurant .
5 #### This was a gift for a 10 - year - old granddaughter . They are extreme ! Most pages have scenes with hundreds of dots . In many cases , until the lines are drawn , one can not guess what the image will be . She carefully worked with a straight edge when drawing some of the lines to keep them near perfect .
5 #### This is a fun and challenging dot to dot book ! I bought it for my 8 year old daughters birthday . She loves it ! There are different versions of this available online with animals and such . This book has a lot of great pictures with a LOT of dots to connect . She says It is challenging but fun . After she gets done making the picture , she colors it . I would absolutely recommend this product !
5 #### My kids ( ages 4 - 12 ) just LOVE this book . It 's great fun for the older ones , and it 's great for learning to count for the younger ones . Great for this homeschooling family !
5 #### We have done several of the extreme dot to dot books . They help my busy , active children focus while listening and learning . My children can remember more details when occupied with a simple activity to do while learning .
5 #### I bought this for my son who has vision problems . It is very , very tiny print . Good for working out your eyes .
5 #### I find it hard to write a review about Dot to Dot puzzles . I enjoyed doing this book even though the numbers are small I do n't have much trouble . But I do have a magnifying glass handy . I loved them as a young girl and I still really enjoy them as a Senior citizen . I read a lot and do Dot to Dot puzzles .
5 #### My sister loves these ! Found at Michaels stores for cheaper though ... so that was a bummer .
5 #### I purchased this for my 11 year old , and he really likes these books . These books are almost imposable to buy on the stores .
5 #### If you love dot - to - dot then this book is for you . It has some great puzzles and they can be very challenging . I enjoyed them greatly .
5 #### My kids think these are the greatest puzzles ever . They love the complexity and enjoy doing them to see the finished picture .
5 #### Bought this for myself . Loved doing them and plan on buying more in the future ! ! ! Keeps my brain working like it should ! !
5 #### very challenging , very interesting , loved the dot to dot , no complaints about this book at all----great great great great great
5 #### Got this by request for one of the grand daughters . I ordered several different topics . They have been a big hit , and it is interesting to see what all shows up in the picture as you complete the progression of dots by the number . It is quite surprising ! All to the good , no bad surprises . Nice when traveling , nice when she just wants some quiet time . I find she will work for a while , then lay it down , and come back later to work again . It was a good choice .
4 #### My grand daughter likes this and has already completed it since Christmas morning . I would call it an acceptable purchase .
5 #### This book is a ton of fun ! Fun to see the color - by - number drawing and fun to see what your own color - choice drawing looks next to the color - by - number picture . Even kids five and up would be able to color this book if they are the patient , studious type of kid . Bouncing - off - the - wall kids probably would not be able to sit still long enough to enjoy their progress . I do n't worry about quickly finishing a drawing , I just like the " ozone " time I get coloring at my own pace . Great for winding down and chilling out !
5 #### Please note that I have bought everyone of these there are published and wish they would publish more but am finding saying the same things over and over are becoming so redundant that am getting tired of leaving feed back , just know these ARE GREAT AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE
5 #### My 7 year old granddaughters favorite . It requires a lot of talent , and the coloring spots are small , so it requires good sharp markers of colored pencils , and a good eye hand coordination .
5 #### I 'm gl as d I bought this one . Very relaxing as the colors brig these gardens to light .
5 #### Very nice color by number book . The pictures are very pretty and my son and I have a great time coloring them together . Each project also has a blank version you can do in any color you choose , but these were a waste for us . I just pulled them out of the book and put them away for use as coloring pages when my son gets older . He is 5 now and loves the concept of color by number , but he has no interest in just coloring on its own .
5 #### These are lots of fun , and a couple people can work on one at the same time . Beautiful results .
5 #### Looks like this is something that will keep my grandkids busy for hours .
5 #### I enjoy coloring and this is great for adults to have fun with .
5 #### Bought this for my elderly mom to keep her mind going . She likes it .
5 #### This has so much variety and different colors that when you get it finished , it is amazing what the picture is once it is all colored in
5 #### The girls starting playing with these immediately after opening them on Christmas . They are ages 9 and 5 . Great " busy work "
5 #### I love the Color By Number but want the whole book that way . I ca n't wait to get more . I keep looking and watching !
4 #### I really like this and it is challenging . However many wrote how they liked using the Sharpie Utlra Fine pens , so I got the 24 pack since Mindwave has a 24 pack but read the reviews for them and and glad I got the Sharpie 's but NO color names on the pens :( . And would have given this five stars but you only need about 9 - 10 colors ! ! They do give you empty pages of ones you have done previous with the numbers , so you can be really creative by yourself . Maybe , but PLEASE Mindwave do books with far more colors ! ! Like to match your pen set or equal ? !
3 #### This game is a sort of Rock , Paper , Scissors style battle game where each player plays a unique character that combines a set of their own unique cards to a set of common cards both players have to create an attack with different power , speed , and range values as well as special effects . The goal is to get your opponent down to zero life before they get you . I 'm not a big fan of outguessing games so the Rock , Paper , Scissors mechanics that underlie this whole game kind of put me off . I do like games with a lot of content and variable player powers though so that sort of elevates it a little but this is n't something I would seek out to play that often .
5 #### Been a player for years since the original sets came out . The price has gone up , but so has the quality . Minis are high quality and so are the books and maps . Well worth the price !
5 #### It 's worth the price for the nice plastic Mech models that came in the box . Wish I could buy more of the plastic models ! A classic game that I 'm teaching the kids .
5 #### Great table top war game . My son and I love playing .
5 #### Miniatures are great . Materials used are of great quality , and the game is outstanding .
4 #### Everything you need to get into the game . The minis are suprisingly good quality if a slight bit under - scale to the IWM minis . Start here and then get some of the other books to add the special rules . See you on the battlefield .
5 #### Pretty epic . Easy to learn , but hard to master .
4 #### The best way to describe this game is Othello with drafting and special powers . This is a two - player game played in two rounds . Each round starts with several tiles laid out for players to draft . Each one is the same on either side but in a different player color . Players take turns drafting these characters and then alternate playing them to the field . Each tile depicts a character with a number on all 4 sides of the tile . When placed , those numbers are compared to surrounding tiles . Any of the other player 's tiles that have lower numbers compared to the placed tile are flipped to the current player 's color . The tiles almost all also have a special ability that can be anything from moving other tiles around to switching tiles between players hands . This makes for a lot of replayability . The game is a pretty short one if you have a little time to kill with just two players and each of your games is going to be varied with 50 different characters . The gameplay is reasonably easy but the sheer volume of different powers to read and learn make it a little less accessible . This game fills a really nice niche of quick 2 - player games that is hard to find .
5 #### A really good , light , quick , filler game that goes over pretty well . It 's a push - your - luck game with some strategy . And the strategies can vary a lot depending on the character you choose . I would definitely recommend this to most gamers .
5 #### I have the kickstarter version which is identical to this one except that it contains a few additional cards and one extra dice . it 's a great game . I showed it yesterday to a friend 's son who is 10 years old in 5th grade . he plays magic the gathering . He liked it immediately . I lent him my game and he brought it to school today and played with his friends . It 's a dice game but it involves lots of strategy too .
4 #### Light game . Press your luck with dice dragons and other baddies . Good filler game . Great components . Do n't forget to use your characters special abilities .
5 #### One of the best games I have ever played ! !
3 #### I like this game as a solo game . It is really best as a solo game as there is not interaction and a lot of downtime if you are not the active player . This is a fun little push your luck dungeon crawler . There is enough there to keep playing this .
5 #### Great fun easy set up . Simple to play solo or with friends . Multiple heroes make for varied ways to play .
5 #### At first impression I thought to myself , " I got ripped off ! " Then I read the instructions ( need improving as it does n't describe the game fully in my opinion ) , watched a couple of youtube videos and realized this is a simple yet fun game ! ! Going to order the expansion cards next !
4 #### Love RPG games but really hate the setup and all the add this add that , but this game makes for a simple and very fun way for a cool adventure . Late night fun .
5 #### Four of us ( all with " euro " experience ) played last night and everyone enjoyed themselves . None of us had played before . Reading through the manual is a little daunting and I highly recommend watching some of the youtube videos out there for this game . After the first round , I understood the mechanics and by the end of the game , the rest of the table had too . The main board ( well , set of 6 boards ) is awesome . The engineer board had a slight alignment issue . The player boards are a little crowded and would benefit from a third - party acrylic overlay to hold the pieces in position . Also , thicker card stock for the player boards would have been nice . The meeples and other game pieces are well done and the overall art is great as well . I will come back and update my rating after a few more playthrus . There are enough things going on and interaction between players on the board , that it seems like figuring out a reliable strategy for winning will be difficult . It should hold our interest for a long time . I do n't recommend this as a first " euro " game . There are a lot of options and it would be overwhelming . Some of the table suffered from trying to analyze too many options .
5 #### This is truly a great game , and though I have n't played all of his designs , I consider it the best game Stefan Feld has made and it has quickly become one of my favorite games . It 's just so rewarding , the modular board and set up ensures familiarity but fresh decisions every game . The future round information provided allows for quite a bit of planning , but you do n't have to and can play more or less tactically and still have a great time as well . While a lot of the feld designs feel very much like point salads and lack a real feeling of tension ( a notable example is the commonly lauded Trajan , which I rate highly as well , but which feels like it runs out of steam with everyone just kind of falling across the finish line ) , this game plays very very tight and every action is really important . This is a bit on the heavy side as a result , and depending on your expertise the set up can appear INCREDIBLY intimidating , but the rules are n't that tough and especially if they are explained to you the average gamer should have no problem picking it up pretty quickly . HIGHLY recommended .
5 #### Fun and easy to learn game . Quick and fun for most ages .
4 #### Had my eye on this seemingly simple dice rolling game for a while , but just never pulled the trigger . My gaming interests have been swaying more toward lighter , quicker games to be able to play with my 5yr old . Low and behold Santa brought this to us in 2015 . [ Had picked it up on a good sale ( ~10 $ ) ] . Although there 's many who have given this game poor reviews , after 2 plays , I do n't see it . It 's quick , mildly strategic , LIGHT AND FUN dice game . 15 minutes of rolling dice and pushing your luck should n't be a brain burner , and this is not that . It can be , if you really want to think out your moves , and try to maximize to greatest extent when to use certain dice vs treasure , etc ... but if you take it for what it is , it 's great fun . My daughter has taken too the rules quite well and love the rolling and sense of adventure . A win in my book .
5 #### This is a very simplified version of a " kick in the door and steal their stuff " game . It is played using two sets of dice and some nice counters . There is the adventurer set that can come up as any one of the classic player character troupes , e.g. , wizard , warrior , cleric , etc . , and a monster set of dice that come up with a series of potential monsters . There is a set of tokens that keep track of experience , magic items , and bonus points . The objective is to score points , and the further you delve into the dungeon , the more points you are likely to get . But , WATCH - OUT ! If your party is defeated , you score NOTHING that round .
5 #### Great game . My girls love it ( 6 & 7 yrs old ) . Very easy to master but never boring .
5 #### This is a great filler game for your game nights ! It does n't take much time and its really easy to teach to the newest of players .
5 #### Cards , dice , XP , and treasure packaged in a treasure box that you use to retrieve treasure from during the game . Easy to understand directions . Quick gameplay . Check out the downloadable game play mat to help visual learners and players keep the pieces straight .
5 #### This a great filler game . We bring this out while waiting for the others to show up . Its fast and fun to play . While it is described as a 4 player game - you could potentially play with a couple more players , but it really drags the game down . 4 seems to be a the sweet spot .
5 #### No disappointment here ! A perfect little filler game with just enough " strategy " to keep it from getting stale . High quality components . Easy rules .
4 #### Pretty fun game for 1 + players . I like it best as a solo venture , since with vanilla rules , only one player is in the dungeon at a time . You can house - rule it to support more than one pretty easily , though . The components , especially the dice , are great quality . The use of Roman numerals for tokens may seem gimmicky , but it has a precedent in RPGs : you can codify , say , the number 9 with just ' IX ' rather than a 5 and four 1s . When several people are playing , that can be useful . The gameplay is straightforward . The balance shifts from strategy toward luck as time progresses , because this game is really about getting the high score and it 's better to retire than to die and lose your points . I 'd say the RPG elements , while present throughout , are there more for theme - but they definitely enrich the game . Fun game , cool box , quality components , decent price point , pretty fun solo , and expandable in player count . I could n't ask for much more . It 's great to break out between other games , and occupies a fairly unique space in the realm of dice games .
3 #### The box and contents are " cute " but the game itself is just meh . I had hoped my oldest son that loves rolling dice of any kind would find this entertaining but he lost interest pretty quickly . there really is not a lot of strategy involved . If you get to level 5 and only have two dice left , no manner of strategery is going to allow you to continue .
5 #### This is a wonderful pressure light style game . I grew up a dungeon & Dragons fan and this scratches an itch .
5 #### Solo play is fun as well as 2 players
3 #### When I have to watch videos so I understand how to play a game it loses a lot in my eyes . I spent almost an hour attempting to understand the directions and after several failed attempts this has been shoved to the back of the game shelf .
3 #### fun little game for an afternoon . not worth the $ 15 they are charging according to its longevity in this home .
3 #### A fun enough press your luck game , though the components could use some improvement . Cute , and if you play with character cards there s a little variety , but there s not a ton of strategy . Would be great for kids !
5 #### Tasty Minstrel Games has created an amazing dice rolling adventure game , Dungeon Roll . Gather your party , defeat the Dragon and get the treasure , but to win you must have the most experience pointsand you do all this with Dice ! Dungeon Roll is played with a few cards , tokens and mostly Dice . You literally roll to gather your party , another player rolls the enemies ( which could be a Dragon ) and you have to use your Dice to defeat monsters , gather scrolls and things or get treasure . Before I explain further let me tell you about how awesome the pieces are . The game is meant for 8 + but my son knew how to play at 5 with no real adjustments . You could leave out the special abilities or do what we do and explain each characters ability when he gets the card . Now I can explain the fun part ! For more on my review check out http://mygeeklings.com/dungeonrollreview/
5 #### Fun , easy , quick . We can sit down for a quick game at lunch and know we have time . It is infinitely re - playable and super simple .
5 #### Awesome quick and fun game for the whole family .
3 #### Fun to learn , but lacking any real depth . Multiplayer only in competing for scores otherwise the other person is irrelevant .
4 #### Really fun family game . We play games like : Love Letter , Settlers , Forbidden Island , Magic , Pokemon ... and it clicked with me and the kids for a 30 minute dungeon romp . ( 10 minutes per person to play since each family member does their own " delve , " then the next . Seems like getting to the higher levels in this game takes a LOT of luck , or maybe the expansion packs . Not sure if we will purchase those for an additional $ 15 bucks or so . I made a spreadsheet for the " Achievements " the game has at the back of the instruction manual for each kid ( and me , I suppose I 'm a kid , too ) . Fun little targets to shoot for each time you play . The reason not 5/5 , for the above mentioned higher level difficulty . It does n't feel like you can do it with the base pack . Maybe I 'm wrong , we 've only had this for a week now .
4 #### Dungeon Roll is a quick & easy fantasy dice game where you delve a dungeon and combat monsters to rack up as much experience as you can get out alive with . It adds dynamic to the typical press - your - luck type custom dice game ( like Zombie Dice or Martian Dice ) by including 8 character roles with unique abilities and treasures which can affect gameplay . It comes neatly packaged in a decorative and very portable chest , making it easy to play just about anywhere .
5 #### Dungeon Roll is a very accessible dice game for those that are new to the board game hobby and for those that are pretty familiar with tabletop gaming . Get a character , Roll your party dice , fight some monsters and collect some loot . At the end of 3 rounds ( a round being where each player has gone into the dungeon once ) and at the end see who has the most experience points from the dungeon and your loot . Always be careful of the Dragon waiting to take you out though ! Fun press your luck mechanics , very easy to learn and highly recommended . For more you can check our video ( it is too large for the amazon upload ) here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0grgPx18RhA&feature=youtu.be
1 #### Dungeon Roll is barely a game . It ALMOST as boring as Candyland , and involves 1 or 2 more decisions . Here are all the decisions available to players of Dungeon Roll : Roll the dice ( not a decision .. well , I guess you did decide to play ) See what happens ( also not a decision ) Roll again ? ( ooh ! First decision ! ) Stop rolling ? ( ooh ! I can choose this more boring option instead of rolling again ! ) Quit the game forever ( Definitely the right decision . ) Do n't buy this game .
3 #### I love the box , and the theme and components .... but this game just does n't have me going back to play it very often . Pretty simple dice game .
5 #### Was surprised how fun this little game is . My husband is hooked and my 12 year - old loves it as well . I am also in the fan wagon for this game . Roll dice , fight monsters , collect treasure , maybe beat a dragon .... all in a box with a couple of player cards and some dice ... Love it .
4 #### This is a lot better than most other press - your - luck dice games like Zombie Dice and Martian Dice . The game is played by rolling 7 " hero " dice then rolling a number of " dungeon " dice equal to the dungeon level starting at level one and increasing by one each round . The different hero dice are used to conquer the results of the dungeon dice . The further you go the more experience ( this game 's points ) you receive . It is still a pretty simple press - your - luck dice game but to fill a few minutes this is , like I said , a better option than most because the decisions actually feel a lot more important than whether to just go again or not . Plus each player plays a hero with certain special powers giving it some variety .
5 #### I back the original Kickstarter and have since bought several more for friends .
3 #### I bought this as a gift and was surprised at how small the box is . I was embarrassed to give him only this because it 's only about 2 " x 4 " so I felt I had to toss in a 10 dollar bill . Do n't know if the game is fun or not .
5 #### What is really nice about this game is that it can be played alone and still be a lot of fun . The printed instructions are pretty vague , and I would have dropped my review to 4 stars , but TMG has excellent play - by - play demonstrations on YouTube that clearly explain the rules . It is not a complicated game , at all , once you watch the videos and go through a few rounds .
5 #### Fun quick game for a couple of people ! If too many people play it can get very boring waiting for you turn to come around .
5 #### Got this a month ago and finally had a chance to play it a week ago . It 's pretty fun . I played it 2 players and with 3 players . Office cards are pretty OP . I have n't tried to play it without the Office cards . Simple game and pretty fast to teach new players .
5 #### I d heard a great deal about this game on the podcast The Dice Tower , and bought it here on Amazon hoping for a winner . And it is ! I ve played three times now and every time has been enjoyable , while allowing me some new insight into strategy for my next play . Everyone I ve played it with has had a great time as well .
3 #### Bought this on a whim . It 's on the lower end of medium weight games and it is a fun , well designed game . It just is n't all that exciting to play with how many other options are out there . This has become our " we do n't know what to play " game .
5 #### I really like this game ! I was just trying to build up my game collection a little bit after discovering boardgamegeek.com and the world of board games that are actually interesting for adults . I play this with my wife and as far as thinking games go , this is one of her favorites ( I think ) . It offers plenty of decision - making for a lighter / moderate game . I take longer on my turns though because I 'm that guy who tries to optimize every move . I ca n't help it ! It just feels right to make the best decision . I think I 'm getting way too personal in this review .
3 #### Solid game , works well for 2 players and is very transportable so a plus for us since we spend a lot of time in the hospital at the moment . I would recommend this for 10 and up .
3 #### I know this game has its fans and I do enjoy the artwork ... but this game was really boring to me . Not enough variation with the cards . I heard there is an expansion coming out which may improve the game , but I do n't want to pay more to make the game what it should have been in the first place . Just not for me .
5 #### Two sided cards gives it a play mechanic different from other deck builders . Fast and portable makes it a good game for travel or dining out .
3 #### My 12 year old son got this for Christmas . The idea is interesting , but it is hard to figure out how to play due to the confusing directions . Hard to shuffle cards when you have to make sure the same side is up . We played it several times and did n't feel like playing it again . Maybe we 'll pick it up again sometime , but right now people like other games better in our family , so it is relegated to the pile .
4 #### Good little quick game . However , it 's easy to cheat since both sides of the card are being used . Even if the cheating is n't intentional it still happens . For example . I shuffle my deck then draw my cards . My deck of cards is slightly skewed and I glance down to fix my deck seeing the card top of the next one down . Now I have the information of the next card even though it was n't on purpose . Still a great casual game . Oh yea , the instructions suck .
5 #### Deck building games have been on my radar after playing " Dominion " earlier this year . The concept for Flip City is easy . Get rid of the cards that harm you and set yourself up for a winning turn before your opponent . The game was easy to understand after spending 15 to 20 minutes with the instructions . Teaching people takes a few minutes and after one game , strategies starts to take shape . The cards are nicely designed and the mechanics work rwally well . The biggest issue with this game is the awkwardness of making sure you do n't accidently flip a card or drop a card during shuffling . Since the cards are two sided , this can be an issue when it happens . In the first two weeks of having this game , we 've played about two dozen times with players from the age of 7 to 40 + . Surprisingly , this is a solid two player card game . It 's rare to find a game that holds up with just two players and Flip City is one of those games . This is a great little card game that is already getting a lot of play around our house ! PRO : - Simple deck building concept , easy to teach . - Really fun and fast - paced once you play a game or two . - Still really fun with just two players . CON : - Shuffling can be awkward - While the cards are new , there is a lot of accidental peeking at the cards in a players draw pile .
2 #### My rating may seem too critical , but it 's honest . The mechanic of flipping a card to upgrade sounds great in principle , but really makes for a very poor experience when implemented . Because the cards are two sided , shuffling becomes a very tedious and awkward experience . You do n't want to look at the cards while shuffling , because that would be cheating . So you shuffle under the table . But then if you drop the cards your current game is completely messed up . It 's a novel concept , but a horrible when implemented . I like the simple artwork , but the theme is terrible . I like it that the theme is neutral , but it 's terrible in how buildings are suppose to translate to powers of the card . A better theme is desperately needed to bring this game together . Overall , I can not recommend this game at all . This is one of those games that has potential , but definitely needs to head back to the game testing labs . Two sided cards could be an interesting concept , but trying to shuffle cards while not looking at them and not dropping any of them is just not going to work . Simple artwork and generic theme are very much appreciated , but trying a card 's image to it 's function needs to have some mental connection . Otherwise the theme is nothing but distraction . A proper theme helps the player remember what each card does .
3 #### The jury is still out on this game . There 's not really a lot going on , so I 'd definitely label this as a beginner game . I 've only played it a couple times as a two - player game . I 'll check back when I play 3 + players , but I do n't think it 's going to get much more interesting .
5 #### Awesome small game and easy to set up and play with multiple new players
2 #### I played this with 4 players . I found it to be dry and boring and I could n't get into it . The decisions were n't very interesting and when the price of the goods unpredictably change , which can happen at any time , everything you 've worked for becomes a waste . Boring , frustrating and annoying .
5 #### If you like good art , good theme , & a small footprint , this the the game for you . It has some " take that " moments as you maybe placing your dock worker on a shop that someone wants to use . It plays fast , is easy to learn , & it is small package with endless amounts of fun . The different buildings you can use or buy changes from game to game so replay is very high . A great addition to any collection . It is the perfect game for travel with a heavy game with great portability .
5 #### Harbour is another tiny masterpiece from Scott Almes . If you have n't tried Tiny Epic Galaxies , do yourself a favor and go try it now . This is a worker placement game . Each turn you will move your worker to build , or spend resources to get ahead in the game . It is a very quick game . One major draw to this game , for me , is the size . Harbour in total is 6x4 inches . This enables me to pack it along with Sushi Go and Tiny Epic Galaxies so I have games to play while I am on the road . You can watch Wil Wheaton play it on YouTube .
5 #### There is a full game in this little box . It is one of our favorites . If you want a quick worker - placement / resource - management game with almost no setup then you have come to the right place ! The variable market mechanic is very clever and it works great .
5 #### Really Fun game you can carry easily in a backpack or bag . Easy to learn and fun to play .
2 #### I appreciate the attempt to create a good game with a small footprint , but this just falls way short . The abilities on the buildings are very lackluster and you never feel like you are doing more than moving markers up and down a track . The top hat mechanic also takes it down a notch or two . The top hats allow you to use an opponents building without paying the fee . But it is just too easy to get a top hat and it is not unusual for everyone to have one . That just removes part of the reason for buying the building . All in all a very dull game that as none of the good type of tension necessary in a good game .
5 #### I love this game ! My son is 8 and he can play with no problem . It has enough addition , subtraction and multiplication in there to count this as a math activity for this homeschooling family . I agree with other reviews stating the game ends too soon , especially when you are only playing with two players . You accumulate benefits for each of the buildings you purchase and the game is supposed to be over when someone has purchased their 4th building . We have played past that by a bit before deciding to be done just because it was getting late , but I could see 6 or 8 buildings be a good limit for 2 players for sure , probably good for 4 players as well . It 's a fun game with great artwork and pretty relaxed play , I enjoy playing it in the evening before bed . There are some great youtube videos explaining gameplay if it 's your first time playing , but the instructions are well done and it 's pretty easy to pick up .
5 #### Fantastic game . Love the 1 - player mode . Because the box is so compact , this is the game I take with me when I travel so I have it to play whenever I have a little down time . This really is a nice little treasure . So glad I purchased it .
5 #### Great game . There 's some timing strategies that come up after a while , but enough variance that it has a lot of replay - ability .
5 #### I love the idea of these sorts of games but have n't played them much so was a little nervous when I opened the box . But , wow . What a lot of fun . Just finished my first game with one other person . It took a while to catch on and we played the " wharf " side of the player board which seemed less complicated . We talked through the first several moves out loud . Once we got the hang of moving the market pieces the game picked up pace and was a TON of fun . I 'd recommend for folks who like the idea of these sorts of games but who do n't have a lot of experience with them ( might be fun for folks with a lot of experience , too , I just do n't know . Great price , great art on the cards , fun game play . Glad I took a chance and bought it .
3 #### Great concept that needs a good polishing . Each player gets a store card . Unfortunately the print on everything is VERY small , so the other players can not read each other 's storefront specs . The cards in the middle of the table , between players , also have that problem . reading & knowing what the options are on the cards is crucial to playing , so this is a big deal . One of the players in our group mentioned that the " engine " is very slow in this game . It is very hard to get the right combination to earn the store front cards , which means that the cost & the worth of the storefront cards needs to be adjusted . There are at least 3 cards that readjust the worth of your goods & 1 tax card that can be used over & over . These cards slow the game down so much that everyone frequently finds they are starting a turn with no goods on their card . they need to go back & redo the rules & or the cards to make this a game you would play twice .
4 #### I avoided this game for a while because I thought it was too complicated when reading the rules . It actually is n't and even as a 1 player game , it 's a lot of fun . The 4 star rating comes from the rule book , it 's terrible lol . The rules are very difficult to understand and are not specific enough , I play a lot of games and read many rule books , this was tough for me to understand , I looked up a quick YouTube walk through of the game and I grasped it right away .
4 #### Fun game . Reletively small footprint makes it a great game to play solo . Would be tough to get it to the table in a normal gaming group but should do ok with family .
2 #### rules were not clear , this game just does n't seem to play well
5 #### Great game on the go . Small package and easily fits when going on a trip . We take it with us on a dinner date where we know the service is slower .
5 #### This is a great game that works for 1 - 4 players . As I live alone it 's great to find a game that works well for one player . Game play is fairly easy and quick as the goal is to buy 4 buildings in order to win the game , you do that by selling 4 different products that the price fluctuates on just like a real market . The artwork is great and humorous plus a good quality .
5 #### Great price for a big game in a little tiny box !
5 #### Received game in ample time and it was great quality .
5 #### I love this game . I have been searching for good solo games . This is definitely the best I 've found to date .
5 #### These new characters really make the Dungeon roll game more interesting . I whole - heartedly recommend this . The game starts getting stale with the originally packaged characters . These new ones mix things up in a great way . This is a booster that most certainly breathes new life into a game .
4 #### Adds dimension to the base game by injecting 8 new heroes with unique special abilities and traits . I look forward to seeing more expansions like this in the future ...
2 #### Sadly we already had this booster from the original game , but did not know it till we opened it =(
5 #### Cool booster pack that refreshes the game . No reason not to get it .
3 #### There are some fantastic characters added in this expansion , as well as more than a few that are head - scracters , to say the least . Overall not a bad first expansion , it just seems that the ' good ' characters were hold - backs from the base game and the others were half - hearted attempts to fill out 8 cards . I do n't know how the choices were made on what to include in the base game and what were earmarked for expansion(s ) but after purchasing the base game and this expansion , it just feels like the hero cards were gerrymandered a bit so that you 're always gon na get a mix of ' REALLY USEFUL ' and ' WTF ' in every set of heroes . But hey , for $ 5 , what was I expecting ? My recommendation : if you play with a large group , or play frequently enough that the extra heroes would freshen your game , go for it ... otherwise it may not add much to your DR experience . Perhaps in the future , we 'll get a bundle ?
5 #### This is the 4x game Stars Trek fan 's have been waiting for . Each player controls not just a ship or fleet , but the entire faction and finally the Federation wins the way they should , by diplomacy and encouraging others to be a part of the Federation and not by winning space battles or conquered planets . Each faction attains victory in accordance with who they are ! The game involves exploring and evolving your side the most in many ways , from research or technology advances , or cultural hegemony , the universe is yours to see ! Finally with its organic way of building the board , no one game is ever the same , the replay ability of this game is extremely high , and as Gale Force 9 introduces new factions , the number of players increases . I saw this at Gen on and instantly knew it was a must have
5 #### One of the best games ever if ( a ) you 're a Star Trek or scifi fan and ( b ) can round up three players . There 's a lot of strategy to this , along with resource management . It 's a 4X game . There 's some luck to it too , however . If , as one player , you consistently draw multiple Warp 3 planets or hazardous phenomenon before you 've improved your shields -- and particularly if someone else draws nothing but uninhabited worlds ripe for the picking -- good luck recovering from that . It can be done , but you 'll need some Trade Alliances and excellent gameplay on your part .
4 #### It is a bit simplified for my taste , but it is still really fun . It is obvious that many , many expansions are going to come from this and what is lacking will probably be added in time . My only 3 complaints are that the rules need to be clarified in certain sections , the star ships only have one type per race , and the system discs are too big ( it does n't allow for as many systems on the map as I would like ) . But , it is a lot of fun otherwise and a must - have for any star - trek fan . Playing as the Romulans , I used my cloaking device to completely destroy the Klingons on the offensive . You got to love this game .
3 #### We loved the concept , but the game seemed extremely unbalanced due to the large role randomness plays . We tried it several times and experimented with multiple alterations to bring more balance , but each time we all ended up frustrated .
5 #### This is a Christmas present and is currently wrapped and under the tree .
4 #### Enjoy this game a lot . Subtracted one star because it lacks some sort of away team mechanic . Other than that , captures the feel of Star Trek well and is fun to play . Each race has their own abilities and play style that best complements that race . Will get better when more races are added to the game via expansions . So far , Cardassians and Ferengi have both been announced .
5 #### All I can say is this is a great game . I brought it to my monthly board game group and those of us that played it really enjoyed it . If you love Star Trek , 4x type games , you 'll love it .
5 #### You get 50 cards to add to the various decks of the game , 25 new Job cards and 25 new Supply cards . There are 5 new cards per deck i.e. 5 new Space Bazaar cards , 5 new Amnon Duul Jobs , etc . Some of the show specific ( while I realize the entire game is show specific , there are generic cards like Merchant and Helmsman ) include Elder Gommen , Nandi 's Gun Collection , and The Best in the House . Tabletop games tend toward the expensive side , and thereby expansions / boosters tend toward that as well . If you have the game , and need a little more variety you 've already got this piece of shiny .
5 #### More FTG Love . If you love Firefly , owning this game line is mandatory imo . Playing it with my kids has been a lot of fun , but even if I never played it , I 'd still be buying it for the TITAN SIZED attention to detail paid by its creators . IMO this game is a labor of love for its creators and I reap the fan based benefits . KEEP IT COMING GF9 !
3 #### I wish it were stated in the title that this is an xpansion pack . Not being familiar with the game , I bought these thinking it was the game . It does say in the description that it 's an expa soon pack , but trying to rush through Xmas shopping I did n't also check the description .
5 #### If you love the show and movie , then this is an awesome way to extend the experience ! My husband and I have played it with people both familar with the show and others who are not and a fun time was had by all !
5 #### All the original supply depots and job masters get a few more cards that are pretty cool . All the jobs have a new mechanic where you are paid a bonus for every trait you need on the job . All the new crew and equipment are pretty uniquely cool . And once again , if you 're a fan of the show ( which you do n't have to be to enjoy the game ) flavor wins all around .
5 #### Played it with my family , we all thoroughly enjoyed it . ( We 're all adults . Not recommended for children . )
4 #### I d buy this again for 30 $ Easy to learn , fun game .
4 #### I never saw the TV show . I got this because I ride , and I game . I got it on impulse , and I 'm glad I did ! I really like that , despite there being a lot of location tiles , only a few are played . These tiles interact well with the event cards , which seem to refer to episodes or events of the series . With repeated play , I imagine even better expectations of what 's coming . I really like this rather elegant insertion of source material into a game mechanism . The components are top notch . Little plastic guns and bags , plastic figs , and little cardboard money . Some games , the money runs out , so I 've tossed in wooden " gold " to swap out with 5 dollars . The only thing that I 'm not so keen on is the reinforce mechanism . It feels a bit too easy , but the game is straightforward , which I like . The one bonus about this reinforcement style is that it rewards having a single unit out there , running around . But it 's safer and easier just to have a mob riding around . All in all , a solid game , finding that sweetspot that forces you to bust out of solitaire , without going overboard with attacking others .
5 #### Super fun game . Mysterium meets One Night Ultimate Werewolf . Entertainment for days . Good replay and very addictive . Right up your ally if you host game nights from 4 - 12 players .
5 #### Great expansion ! I highly suggest it as an addition to Firefly 's base game . Its not a necessary addition , but it will add some more re - playability .
5 #### Great addition to a great gae . It 's a little overpriced at $ 10 , but it fits in with the original game without the need to find new storage ideas . Overall a must have for any player of firefly the BG .
5 #### Just as high quality cards as the base game . Wish it were a bit less expensive .
5 #### Fantastic set of upgrade cards to bring your Firefly board game to the next level .
3 #### If you really like Firefly : the Game , then there is no reason not to get this expansion . That said , it is a little light on content . The pack is just a set of new cards that combine with the existing ones in the game to add some new items and missions . You get 5 new missions for each of the 5 contacts from the base game as well as 5 new items for each of the 5 supply decks in the game ( 50 cards total ) . They do n't add anything spectacular or amazing to the game , just more variety which is good , but not a necessity unless you play the game a lot .
3 #### The first thing you need to know about this game is that it is n't a board game in the classic sense . There is no board . Instead there are site tiles . Instead of being one player , you are one gang . The gangs are made up of 5 members and 5 prospects . Each gang begins with the amounts of cash , guns , contraband , heat , gang members and prospects listed on the bottom of the Clubhouse Card . It 's a pretty complicated game , which is the main reason I gave it 3 stars . If you 're used to complicated games , this is the game for you . If you 're more used to Monopoly and Clue than to Dungeons and Dragons , you might be a little overwhelmed by this game . While playing we had to constantly refer to the rule book , and not just the first or second time . I had to force my kids to play the game with me and they were a little bit frustrated by all the ins and out , in spite of being over the recommended age for the game . Luckily the game comes with a glossary as well as the rules so you know what the deuce they 're talking about . Whether you are a fan of the show or not does n't really matter . Knowledge about the show wo n't help you in any way .
4 #### Great for fans of the TV SHOW ! Lots featured from the show in the rule book including photos and detailed explanations , which is very well written . it is truly a game of negotiations and alliances . You are dealing in contraband and guns with the object being to get as much money as you can . 3 - 4 players take on the role of each of the biker gangs featured on the show . The game takes place over the course of 6 game rounds . The game tiles take the place of a board , which represent the locations from the show . You send your characters to the locations to take its benefits . Each player gets a shield indicating their gang affiliation , which features a Round Summary , Order Summary and Throw Downs . The game comes with location cards , game tokens , Dudes , Prospects , ' contraband ' bags , cash , guns , and Anarchy Cards . Honestly , it helps to have some sort of a container to keep all of these pieces in . You will need a steady playing area , something large to spread out on . This game takes up a lot of room and requires that you keep track of lots of little items . We played for about an hour and 15 minutes . Honestly , the game is slightly confusing and we spent a lot of the first two times playing it correcting behavior and referencing the rules . Now that we have the hang of it , it makes for an interesting game night with friends .
5 #### What a great game . This game is full of twists and turns . This game had me and my tweets guessing each and every move . I found that that this game was fun and exciting for everyone over thirteen . My kids also play with their friends . Lots of laughs and sighs when you loose . Overall it 's not your average game . It 's full of surprises .
5 #### This is such a fun game . The cards add more to the main set and all of them are nice sturdy cards .
4 #### Few new game cards and missions and a ship pretty cool
5 #### If you love Firefly and are a board gamer , this game is pretty good . It 's pretty involved though , not for amateurs .
5 #### This game is awesome . My adult siblings and I like to get together frequently for game / movie / whatnot nights and this one always finds its way to the front of the rotation . It 's a somewhat lengthy play but lots of fun ! Highly recommended for SoA fans !
5 #### For SoA fans , this is a must have . Even if you are not a fan of the show , but enjoy games of strategy , you 'll like this . Using show characters , you 'll manipulate their positions to ensure that you end up with the most power and most money of any of the 3 or 4 players . Even if you 've never seen the show , it 's an easy to learn game and fun . Strategy , Fun and Imagination , along with constantly changing situations , will make it fun to play this game many times .
5 #### Never watched the TV show , but I got this simply because the description intrigued me . My wife and I tried it the first time with our friends , where one quick game turned into six ... it 's actually a lot more fun then we were expecting . You play with game pieces that include handguns and stacks of cash , where the object of the game is to exploit and fight other players in the game . The rules of the game are a bit complex , as we played the first two rounds with the institutions in hand to get everything right , but you only play six rounds and the game is over pretty quickly ( 45 minutes to an hour ) .
5 #### Let me start by saying I am a Big SOA fan and was thrilled to get this game ! It definitely did n't disappoint and I would not hesitate to spend the money on it . There are a lot of rules and may be difficult form some to understand but thankfully for those , there are YouTube videos that explain the game . Keep in mind this is not a game for children so if you 're looking for a family night game this is NOT it ! Otherwise I most definitely recommend this product .
5 #### I got this because I like games , not because of the show . In fact , I 've never seen an episode , so its merits or deficiencies with respect to that are n't the focus of this review ( though I am more curious about the show now ! ) . I was n't sure what to expect . I figured it would be more for fans of the show and not so much a " real " game . I was wrong . This is full of strategy and is a fully fledged - out game . Yes , as some reviewers pointed out , it Does take time to learn . Most good games are like this . Once you figure it out , the gameplay is interesting and engaging . Good for people legitimately into strategy - based games . Nice !
5 #### If you love Son 's of Anarchy and board games , you 'll love this game ! Each turn , players rival over turfs , gang up or join each other , it 's non stop fun and so much comparison to the show its as close an experience you 'll get without joining an actual biker gang ! But if you do , you should play this while watching the show !
4 #### EVEN the box looks like Cards against Humanity so I was all over this in seconds . However , bigger box = more complicated game . There are lots of pieces . I can understand the money , badges , cellphones ( circa 1990s ) . But then there are also plastic bags and guns , motorcycles and people . I have seen less complicated Tarot layouts than this game . You really need strategy to play . This was one of the games that we played while reading the directions the first few times . Then people started cheating and we went back to the directions . The directions ought to be laminated . Fans of the Sons of Anarchy series seemed to get the game more easily . They also may have enjoyed it more . Or it could be that they are the most eviI mean , best - lookiI mean , better behaved ? I like this board game , maybe because I like the idea of complex board games . It is a lot more fun to play board games with friends than it is to play video games . There is lots of laughter .
3 #### Sons of Anarchy Men of Mayhem is , so my board - game experts tell me , a well - designed game that serious gamers or fans of the TV show can enjoy . According to https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156091/sons-anarchy-men-mayhem , some of the early printings are missing the Black Market reference card , but you can make your own .
5 #### Great game to take to your local Harley Davidson club and play . It has a bit of a learning curve , but once you get past it you will enjoy the game . You do n't have to be a fan of the show to play this game and have fun with it . The other nice part of the game is that it can change each time . How you negotiate or take over territories will be different almost every time . Highly recommended !
3 #### This game was horribly confusing to get started , so many things to read and understand . That does n't make for playing a fun time . Once we all understood , it was fun , but way to much work to understand a game .
5 #### A fun game for fans of the show - but you do n't have to be a fan to play ! The game is like Monopoly meets Risk meets bikers . I know this one is based off of another board game , but I have n't played anything like this before , so I ca nt give a review of the comparison between the two . Basically , you have to control an area , run drugs , guns and combat rival gangs to win . You trade , you take action and you make deals with other player to advance . They have all the characters and world that is shown in the Sons of Anarchy television show , which makes it fun for the fans , but you do n't have to know the show to play , you can just use it as biker game for those that have n't seen the show . Overall , I like the game , the pieces are typical of a board game in this price range . The game was fun to play and it was a bit complicated at first , but it was n't hard to get into the swing of things . A great present for SOA fans or a game to change up your game night .
2 #### I tried out this game with the other residents of my senior citizen complex , and it just is n't for us old geezers . The instructions are quite complicated . I do think those in their 40 's and younger will get a kick out of this . It 's just not for us old geezers .
5 #### My friends and I got together to play this game - we had just botched an attempt at playing the Myst boardgame ( we really should have all fully read the directions before playing that one ) and were looking for something to play that did n't require us to spend hours going through the instructions . We pulled this out and skimmed the directions like normal . I have only seen a few episodes of the show , two of the people we were playing with had never seen it at all , and the others were die hard fans . Having not seen the show did n't seem to effect the enjoyability of this game . Once we got going and got the hang of it , this was a lot of fun . We were all different biker gangs competing for territory , guns , drugs etc to see who could end up with the most money at the end of the game . On one hand it reminded me a bit of Risk , where you are trying to get the most usable territories and hold them so that you can expand from a strong base . However there is a lot of negotiation and tactics involved . Our group had a great time playing and we will certainly play again in the future . Because of the imaginary violence , drugs and other adult things , I would n't advise playing this with your children .
5 #### This is a great solid game for ADULTS ! So many are too easy and you lose interest very quickly . That is not the case here . At first , the rules almost seem overly complicated . But , after you read them and then actually play it becomes fairly easy to negotiate or thug your way through the game . Whether you are a fan of the show are a board game fan - this game has many twists and turns and I do n't see it getting boring anytime soon . It even has an added more complex way to play to change it up a bit , just in case you might consider getting bored . You can play this with 3 or 4 players or 3 or 4 teams depending on your flexibility . You can mix and change it up a bit as you go to your liking . But , overall the game involves 6 rounds and has 6 stages within the rounds . At the end of the 6 rounds , the player or team with the most money wins the game . This is a game that involves negotiating , bluffing , back stabbing & a bit of strategy to come out ahead . This is just like the TV show really !
5 #### Tie - in games tend to be crap but I collect them for IPs that I love so when I saw that there was an SOA one I had to have it . While I have n't played it yet -- my Friday night gaming group has been on hiatus -- I was extremely impressed with it when I unpacked it to prep it for the first game night we 're back in session . This is so well put together it 's insane . No cheapo materials used here either . The only bummer I 'm seeing is that you 've got to pay so much for the expansions . My gaming group is a solid 6 but occasionally we get as many as 9 players so the base game is on the small side and yet requires at least 3 to play . Will update with my crew 's thoughts once we 've been able to play but I would definitely recommend it to tabletop gamers looking for something legit .
4 #### As add - ons go , it 's not exactly earth - shattering . It adds some new jobs , and some new gear . While that is certainly appreciated , it 's a little underwhelming . Especially since , to me , the most tedious part of the game most in need of some fresh air are the navigation decks . But anyway , the price is low so there really is n't any reason NOT get this add - on . I just wish they had done a lot more !
5 #### It is an awesome game . W ehave friends come over and play every other week . The game takes about twice as long as the scenarios say .
4 #### We play a lot of the European - style games ( Catan , Dominion , et cetera ) so this was a fun ' Americanized ' version of a strategy game . I 've never watched the show but that did n't seem to make a difference as to how much fun it was . The only downside of the game is that it is a 3 - 4 player . We either seem to have the two of us , or more than 4 , so it is n't as expandable as a game like Dominion . Anyhow , lots of fun , also lots of little pieces ...
5 #### This is a challenging board game that combines different game styles to great effect . At its hear it is a worker placement game , where you compete to allocate workers and get the most resources . However , there is also quite a bit of direct competition as well as negotiation as players can fight over locations . This all ties together very well with the theme of battling biker gangs . The artwork and manual also work well with the theme . There is some flexibility in the rules , including two different difficulty settings , which makes it easier to jump in while providing more challenge further down the road . All in all , this is an entertaining and deep game with an appeal that should extend past just fans of the show
4 #### GaleForce does a decent job of making board games of TV shows . I 'm a little torn on this one . At the face level it seems fairly simplistic , the tokens look cool , there are n't a ton of pieces ... but the rule book requires some good study , there 's a lot to keep track of , particularly regarding throwdowns ( fights with other players ) and the after effects like heat ( police pressure ) and hospital ( injuries from the fight ) . We definitely spent way more than an hour the first time , making sure we had all the rules nuances accounted for , and learning strategy regarding interactions with other players . That is probably my favorite aspect of the game , the trading resources and bribing other players to gang up on another player , and it helps to have more players in that regard . Right out of the gate there 's a few expansions ( Calveras , Grim , Irish ) that allow you to play with additional players , but they really do n't give you too much beyond that . You could probably invent your own just as easily . There really are n't spoilers to the show . The theme , names , and locations align , but you can play the game without needing to have seen the show or worrying that it will ruin the show .
5 #### We are big fans of SOA and thought this would be a fun game to play . That 's an understatement ! A group of us got together to play it the first time and we lost track of time . What a great gift for a fan or even for someone who has never seen the show .
5 #### I 'm a huge SOA fan so I naturally connected with this game . The pieces are all a higher quality build and the game is attached at the hip to the show . They take actual screenshots from the show & real events to immerse you in the SOA world . Overall really awesome game that had actual thought put into it . This is not just some gimmick to play off the show , but rather a real , interesting game .
4 #### If you are a fan of the show&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Sons - of - Anarchy / dp / B00S9S12ES / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Sons of Anarchy</a > , this game is intended for you , but to the credit of Gale Force Nine , this game is playable ( and enjoyable ) by people who have never heard of it .

5 #### i love the game i love how the box is detailed with soa , man if u love bikes , guns and this show of soa sons of anarchy you 'll love this game it has a lot of things money gangs man i see this game on youtube before i got it and i loved it everything in it best thing i ever bought
5 #### Very fun game ! Wish there were more gangs included . The expansions are almost the same price as the whole game , but love the game . Even my husband likes it and he does n't even watch the show . Very fun . New game night favorite .
5 #### If you enjoy the game , this expansion adds more variety ( replayability ! )
4 #### Great expansion to one of the best games ever made . The quality of the cards is not as good as the original game , which is why I 'm only giving 4 stars . After playing the game several times , this expansion is refreshing . You do n't have to be a Firefly fan to play this game . It is that good .
4 #### This is a nice little edition to the Firefly game . It adds 5 cards to each of the jobs and supply decks , some of the supplies being weapons , people or ship upgrades . Its good to have to keep things a bit different from game to game . I gave it 4 stars due to the price because its basically just a deck of cards
5 #### We have enjoyed playing this game . A good group game .
4 #### I got this for my friend for Christmas . It was more of a joke gift but it turned out to actually be a lot of fun . More often than not , board games that are based off of franchises turn out only sub par , but this one was good ! People who have not watched the show probably would not enjoy it as much but It actually has solid game mechanics .
5 #### My friends and I have a ball every time we run a campaign . I have yet to try the solo games but it 's a crowd pleaser whether you 're in the know about the series or not .
5 #### Great addition to the game . The new jobs and equipment and more depth to the game . Looking forward to future expansions .
5 #### Games like Formula D are a perfect example of the importance of theme in a game . At a fundamental level , there is n't much of a difference between this game and Chutes and ladders . You roll a dice and you move . Of course there are things like different dice that correspond to the gears in a car , points that correspond to things like engine , brakes and tires that wear out as the race progresses . These are the things that mechanically make the game different . But the theme of being in a race with up to 9 friends is what makes it fun . We 've been racing each other since we could crawl so a race to the finish line is the most natural thing to anyone , even if they do n't play board games . A game takes less than an hour and rules can be explained in less than 10 minutes . The board has 2 sides that feature different tracks and has advanced rules once you want to bump the complexity a bit . A great game for groups or family but plays well with even a few players .
5 #### This is a perfect game : easy to learn for both the " basic " and " advanced " modes , fast to set up , really fun and very enjoyable for all family members . It is also very flexible in terms of game length , you can play a single lap in some 20 minutes , or can plan for a full racing season that may take a full day if you desire . Also it is very flexible in terms of number of players , as it can be 2 - 10 . I have even played it solo ( practice mode ? ) and even then is quite fun . You can also play with " stock cars " or can even make your custom ones . Worthily is to mention the top notch quality of all its components . I just wish the cars were bigger , but as it is the board is already big enough !
4 #### The tried and true mechanics of the previous edition of Formula D(De ) with an graphics overhaul , the addition of components for tracking wear , speed , engine , etc . Including 20 cars of Formula One and Street racing types . And the new rules addition that add Street Racing ( think : Fast and the Furious and its 1st sequel ) with a collection of Drivers with their own specific skills and character to add more flavor to the plain vanilla game . With the first new ( 2 ) Track expansion slated for release later this month . ( Sebring / Chicago ) This game is backward compatible with ALL PREVIOUSLY printed tracks from the older editions .
4 #### bought it for my sister , she has n't invited me over to play it . I want it back . Who should I suggest she gift it to me ?
5 #### My family absolutely love this game . I bought it for a holiday gathering of our adult sons and families , and everybody had a fine time playing . It includes two game board options , and various skill levels of play , so it is fun for a group . It is a welcome addition to our games closet .
5 #### A reference standard racing game flexible enough to work with casual gamers in a party setting ( with basic rules and a 2 - lap race ) all the way to advanced players using the advanced rule set . Relatively few games in this category , and fewer of those truly capture racing excitement in the way that Formula D does .
5 #### Fun game . My friends and I really enjoy it . Can be a little slow with a big crowd , but banter more than makes up for that . I ca n't wait to buy some more tracks for it . I only wish there was storage in the box for more than one track .
5 #### I love this game . It really has the race feel and its very easy for people to get into . My two daughters ( 9 and 12 ) are always ready for Formula D !
5 #### This is a great game . I really like it . I can play it with my 7 year old son and my gaming group . The game is made to play up to 10 people . It 's really fun with more people since you have to start making decisions well before the turns so you do n't get bunched up or take damage . it has two game modes , beginner and advanced . I would say the beginner mode is just fine fine for 80 % - 90 % of the people playing this game . the advanced mode is more for tournaments and really hardcore gamers . it also has two types of racing ; track racing and street racing , each have some unique things that can happen . There are a bunch of track you can buy for the game , and there are also some user created ones you can find if you search the interwebs .
5 #### This game is quick to learn and you can play it with a large or small group . Also has two forms of rules and so many expansions so the tracks do n't get boring . Love playing this on game night .
5 #### Hands down my favorite board game . It 's great with 2 people ( you can each race with a couple of cars like a team ) it 's great with 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 people ! The game is super deep too . Meaning , there 's a really easy to pick up and play beginner mode , then there are still 2 - 3 more modes you can play with increasing difficulty and complexity . Absolutely a fantastic game . A must have .
5 #### What a wonderful board game . I will add this as a side note to add some discussion to what others have said : there is a " light " version of the game that you can get people playing very easily with , and a more " heavy " version with a ton of rules and some great depth . This game also really opens up to some great house rules if you want some real marathon sessions , or a quick 30 minute game . Overall our family likes this game a ton !
5 #### I 've been hunting for a race game that everyone in my group wants to play , and this is finally the one that hit . The concept of shifting and using specially - numbered dice to represent the different gears is amazing , thematically speaking , and makes sense to people . The risk / reward gameplay is elevated , so expect euphoric highs when exiting a corner in fourth gear , and devastating lows when you are forced to downshift to avoid destroying your car . The advanced rules cater to players interested in a more technical experience . In this mode , car damage must be monitored across multiple categories , much more care must be taken in every respect , and a weather element is added . Racers can set up their cars as they see fit before every event . On the street course , each player is given a character with their own stats , a special ability , and a single - use ( per lap ) turbo . Special areas of the map can help or hinder you , and the car models for this event are completely different . It 's a lot of game in one box . Traffic is a BIG deal in Formula D , so when playing with less than six people , I highly recommend each player utilize both cars in their team livery . A second set of dice is also a worthwhile addition , as having a set at each end of the board reduces awkward / repeated die passing . Fair warning : you will probably end up wanting all of the expansions . Running a season is great fun .
5 #### I LOVE this game . Having played the original , I was worried this version might have lost something since it switched companies . It did n't . It only added more features . I really like the additional stats , they make sense and are easier to use than some of the old rules . I 'm not a big fan of the tuner cars rules , but my kids love them , and if it gets them interested , more the better ! ! I also love the stat markers . Much , much better than the old ones . I ca n't wait to get more tracks .
5 #### Great family game or for a group of friends !
5 #### Fun easy racing game that is fully of tense dice rolls . As with many games , who you play it with can really make or break the fun . But if you help build the excitement this is a super fun time . This game also plays well with large numbers of players and is great for game nights where more than an anticipated number of friends show up !
4 #### I wish I had more gamer friends to play this more . This appears to be a simple roll the dice and move your mice board game , but there 's a bit more to it than that . Do n't get me wrong -- it certainly is n't a deep or heavy board game as far as strategy goes . You do have to use your special moves , brakes , and other various moves that may cause some damage to your car in order to move ahead just at the right time .
1 #### Boring and slow paced . The board also coming in two pieces and do n't line up well . They also are very hard to keep connected and the have a slight bend in them that makes it hard to
2 #### As many others , I first viewed this game on TableTop . Purchased it to play with a mixed group of gamers & non . Two of the group are huge car fanatics , so I thought this would be a good option to get everyone involved and having a good time . Let me start by saying this game drags on and some of the rules just over complicate a simple game . Our game with 7 people took nearly two hours due to the fact that you are constantly passing the one lone dice set around the table . This game fills the void for huge groups , but other than that it is a pass for me .
5 #### I love this game . It 's one of the most fun games I 've ever played . Even though it 's fairly simple and there is n't intense strategy as other games , Formula D can always be sure to generate fun !
4 #### Our group was looking at other options to include for game night and I happened to find this one based on a few online recommendations / videos . The game is a lot of fun , but make sure your group has at least some interest in ' racing ' . One reason this game caught my attention was the amount of people who could actually be involved . The game comes with some really fun manual - shifting boxes that add a different feel and conversation when playing . Everyone wanted to get to the highest gear quickly but found they were taking damage quickly . This game also comes with 2nd track on the backside for more city - style driving and slightly different rules . We have n't gotten around to trying that side out yet . When opened ... this game is huge and draws a lot of attention .
5 #### I grabbed a copy of Formula D having no idea what to really expect . I wo n't go into a great amount of detail about how the game is played , as that 's been done numerous times in numerous reviews here and elsewhere . What I will say is that I chose it for Game Night with my wife one night , and she was reluctant to try it . She did n't want to play a " racing game " at all . I told her we can give it a shot for one game , and if she does n't like it we can switch to something different . Several hours and several games later , we finally put the game away . We loved it . From start to finish it 's just a FUN game . There 's enough strategy involved to give it some depth , but also enough chance that even with the best strategy something might go wrong ... which to me is very realistic when compared to " real " racing ... you can have the best car , the best driver , and the best crew ... but none of that matters when an engine blows . We really enjoyed our time with the game , and look forward to many more sessions ... also , we look forward to moving to the advanced rule set . I highly recommend the game . It 's great .
5 #### This is a great casual game to play with friends and family . It may not have deep strategy or hard decision making but it definitely produces some exciting moments and has enough strategy so that this is n't just a roll and move game . I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for something fun to bring to a party as the game accommodates up to 10 players and is really quick and easy to teach . You ca n't go wrong with Formula D.
4 #### My family really enjoyed this game although it takes quite awhile to complete a game ( we had 6 players ) . There are a lot of rules , but once you get the hang of it , it 's easy to pick up or explain to others .
3 #### Pretty fun but the starting line can make it an unfair advantage with more than 4 or so cause you start off so far behind .
3 #### This is just a roll - and - move game . They 've added some rules to it that convolute it in an attempt to give it some more interesting decisions , but all they do is convolute it and turn a game that should at the very least be accessible into something that takes way too long to teach for what it is . The only real decisions that are left to the players is whether or not to shift up or down but really there 's not a lot of decisions to make there . Most players will be left shifting in the exact same way on each turn and all that 's left then is luck of the roll . This game does accommodate a good number of players though and looks good with a lot of content and some really solid pieces . That 's all that 's good I can say about it though , as the player number rises so does the down time and in a 6 - player game I quickly found myself getting bored just 3/4 through one lap .
4 #### So far I 've played the " basic " version several times and we had six people playing . Ages were 7 , 30s , 60s , and 90s ( huge age gap ! ) . Everyone had fun ! Took the 7 year old a whole game to really understand the how to use the different gears , but had more fun on the second round . All the adults enjoyed it too . Can see this game being less fun with less people , but I have n't tried it yet . Key point is to stress thinking about what you 're going to do on your turn between turns to ensure the game does n't bog down .
4 #### Nice and easy to pickup , just played the basic game so looking forward to getting into it some more
5 #### I looooove this game ... I was convinced that I would within five minutes of reading n watching videos about it .. just one of those that you know you 're going to be into even before playing ... I love formula one so the theme just strikes a chord with me . It 's a racing game of luck and strategy .... because you start with the shifting of the gear that you want to use for your movement , then select the dice associated to the number corresponding to that gear . Once the dice rolls you will move you little car according to the number you get on the dice .. fx : 1 - 2 gear is a 4 sided die , so you have four possible options . If you roll a 1 , you move one space , 2 is 2 and so forth . But there 's a lot of stops that you have to make , so if you move ahead too much and do n't make your required stops , you lose points and those points are crucial to make sure your brakes do n't mess up . There 's also points for your engine , body , etc ... It 's really cooL. I have not played any other racing game but I have watched some videos about other tittles and I think this is the best one of it 's genre . If you 're looking for a great fun game or are a bit on the fence about which racing game to get ... I recommend you go with this one .
4 #### An amazing racing game that had all of us laughing and having a great time . For a roll and move game , it was pretty amazing to me how close the race was for the entire time .
5 #### I have 6 grandsons . The 6 year old got this for a Christmas gift . He loves the game and learned how to play without much help . The game does not take too long to play . He has had many hours of fun playing it .
5 #### I love formula D ! It is a interesting mix of strategy and dumb luck . My family kind of likes it . My wife was a little frustrated with the rule book for advanced play but I found a free reference sheet online that helped clear that up . Before the reference sheet we had to go back to the rule book a lot . My child age 5 understands the basic rules but gets bored about halfway through the track . I print off a Formula De Mini track from online and found it much easier to keep his attention . I would agree with the recommended age on the box . Finally , I also ordered extra dice that helped speed the game up but I would recommend waiting to see if you like the game to make this investment .
5 #### Formula D is a great party game that gets the entire room cheering . Even for the starter players , there is a set of basic rules that most can grasp very quickly . Every time I have played this game , I 've had a great time . I do not enjoy cars or racing but the excitement of this game really gets your adrenaline going . The game lends easy to advanced players who want to implement the advanced rule set that want to make the game far more complicated and even more exciting . With the amount of people that can play , this game is a great pick for people that want to start introducing people into unconventional board games . I highly recommend this for anyone that is looking for a game to include a large group of people .
4 #### This is a pretty fun group game , but can drag a bit with multiple players . This is because people want to calculate their moves on the board before committing to the best possible route . A fun variation we like to play is that when you start your turn , you declare your gear and then roll . Once you roll , you ' drive ' the car the necessary moves . No take backs , no do overs . This encourages players to pay attention to their car when it is not their turn , and also adds and element of hazard that would be present in a real driving\racing situation . Makes a good party game , but you may want to limit games to one lap per game .
3 #### The game offers some entertainment , but is best suited to be a casual family evening but would not be one of the first games chosen . I would recommend playing the game with at least 3 players or it will not be engaging enough .
5 #### I love a great game that is unique and different than the rest . Quick and easy to learn with advanced play that will challenge all hard core gamers .
5 #### We were looking for a lighter game to play with the kids over the heavier euro strategy games we prefer . Formula D is a reprint of the original Formula D. This version includes a street racing variant . Although I ca n't comment on that variant as I 've not played it . The game comes with a family , or basic , version of the rules and then a set of advanced rules . The basic rules are great for playing with younger kids , but the advanced rules are best for older kids and adults . The basic premise is to roll dice to make your car go and to get around the track first . However the strategy comes in when you approach turns and you must ensure you stop a certain number of times in each turn . This is also complicated by the fact that you are rolling different dice based on which gear you are currently in . The higher the gear the faster you go and the harder it is to stop the required number of times in each turn . Obviously there is a lot more to the game than my simple explanation , but overall this game is a very fun , light game that all people have enjoyed . Even those not into racing . The fact that it also supports 2 - 10 racers is great for family gatherings .
5 #### For some reason I totally blanked on the age - range for this game . My son is 7 . Fortunately , there are Basic and Advanced rules . I found the Basic rules were sufficiently " difficult " and understandable . We play with just three players , but it 's easy to see how more players = more fun . I happen to drive a manual transmission ( and 6 - speed to boot , just like the game ) so it was a good opportunity for my son to get a grasp on the concept of changing gears . We have so much fun that my son actually plays multiple cars against himself , with the only the sound of tumbling dice . Wonderful .
4 #### This is the only car racing game you every need . It can be taught in minuets to new players . The game is at its heart a dice rolling game , so some of the decisions are out of your control but there is still enough strategy to make it feel like you are in control of your car . The extra tracks are a most , the Germany and Spain expansion are very good tracks . This is one of the few games that can play up to 10 players , which is super fun .
5 #### Why do I love this game so much ? I could not tell you with 100 % certainty , but it is definitely one of the only board games in a while that I actually enjoy playing win or lose . I started playing with some of my engineering friends , I 'm an engineer as well , and we could n't have had more fun . Be prepared . The rulebook is pretty extensive and can get complicated once you get into the advanced rule set . We found the basic rules kind of boring and pretty exploitable , so pretty much started with the advanced rules gradually adding concepts the more we played . Of course we found the playtime listed a little bit on the little conservative side . Our games went on a little bit longer . Anyway this game is a lot of fun , so if you 're looking for a new game for your collection I would say definitely give this one a shot . It will probably become your favorite .
5 #### This game I has seen played on a web series called Table Top Sooooo glad that I did this game is ridiculously fun and great for the whole family , my kids and even my wife loved it . So if your looking for a great family game for game night then look no further .. P.S. we do n't even like racing LOL
5 #### I 've only had a chance to run a few races , but this is a fun game for everyone who plays . I 've only played with my wife ( who enjoyed the game too ) , and we look forward to trying it out with 4 or more players ( up to 10 can play , so it makes a great party game ) . It 's also nice that there are additional tracks available for purchase so you can keep the game fresh .
4 #### With equal parts strategy and luck , simple rules for the basic game and a nice set of advanced rules , this game is a great game for everyone .
4 #### Formula D is an excellent tabletop racing game . It is the revision of the older Formula De . At it 's heart this is a ' roll and move ' game . Each player rolls a die and moves their car the requisite number of spaces . Each gear is represented by a die and the higher the gear the more spaces a player can move . While seemingly simplistic this game has a great deal of strategy due to the rules requiring stops in corners , car placement , and the amount of wear your car can take during the course of the race . This game scales extremely well in terms of complexity ( simple and advanced rules ) and number of players ( It supports up to 10 ! ) . The board is also double - sided with a ' street - racing ' ( think ' Fast and Furious ' ) variant . There are also more double - sided boards available which allows for more variety in the race tracks / courses . Highly recommended .
4 #### Pros : Educational value for kids is great , Beginner to advanced game play , Well themed game , 10 PLAYERS . Con : Cheap Plastic Container , High Luck Factor for dice roll Formula D Racing is a fun game . The racing theme fits the game perfectly . It offers both a beginner and advanced game experience . Literally , it comes with different sets of rules depending on how simple to complex you wish to make the game . The luck factor is high in game . The strategy is still good , as it requires you to use your cars resources wisely . And like real competition users must decided when they are will attempt to make their moves forcing others to respond . And honestly , a 10 player board game is unheard of ! I 've only played 8 , and each player does extend the game time , but still a plus to be able to add more players . Educational value for kids on this game would be in counting . It 's simple math , but they have to determine through addition and subtraction how much risk they care to take . My biggest disappointment with this game is the plastic they used for the container . Very cheap plastic . It cracked and tore the first 1 or 2 plays . The rest of the game pieces are quality . Still a great buy , and I would recommend this game .
3 #### obviously a cheap setup , the controller lasted one day before it would connect anymore , cable was no good . when I attempted to solder another cable on , the solder pads melted off of the board and then I gave up on it . the simulator itself is great , lots of models and landscapes can be acquired online , I got a PPM usb device for my professional transmitters because it does n't fly right with anything else I have , waiting for that to arrived , I 'm bummed about the transmitter lasting only one day , especially with NO abuse to it whatsoever , hardly even used it .
1 #### got three of these one broken ! one not ordered by that name and others do not work all the software was not working sent all of them back ! ! only ordered one of these got three ? ? ? ? ? ?
5 #### Works great . Used it with FMS on windows ( XP , Win7 ) and CRRCsim on linux ( debian jessie , crunchbang ) . Also tested with RF3.5 , AF , CV , and Ph3 but the reader is on their own with those . I own both an RF interlink and a DX6i so this controller is paired with my GF 's WinXP laptop so she can practice flying , learning orientation , etc .
1 #### Waited a week and was broken when it arrived ,
3 #### The software that comes with the package is on a small disc and did not work well . I found other sims on the net that worked better , but I have not been able to find one that has a tricopter in it . This is what I really wanted . I hope this help . O.H. Albany , GA
4 #### works well , the cd that comes with it with the program is a bit lacking , I downloaded a different program for flight simulation and that worked much better . The controller feels a bit cheap but works well . Would buy again would not recommend to anyone unless they know how to download and remap controllers to work .
5 #### Good controller for the price . The software sucked compared to Expensive simulators like Real Flight 7.5
1 #### What a total piece of junk . The ones who gave this POS 3 and 4 stars must be employees of the company . The software is better used for a coffe coaster . There are no drivers for this and everything is backwards . You can down load freeware simulators but this control WILL NOT work with it due to there is no adjustment . It really cracked me up when I read others who said this mickey mouse piece of junk works great . If I could select no stars I would .
5 #### This is a great little controller for RC flight sim . It is a little sensitive , but that actually help one to learn not to over control when really flying . My laptop recognized it instantly and it worked perfectly with the Clearview RC Simulator software . The software that comes with it is just an old version of a freeware download . I bought this only for the controller . At this low price it is the very best you can do .
1 #### this is the worst r.c . training program in the hole world . i think its 1985 tech . had to install drivers by hand on windows 7 COMPLETE DISASTER F- it 's this kind of stuff that makes me think about what the hell amazon is thinking . IF i COULD GIVE THIS NEGATIVE STARS IT WOULD BE -5
1 #### this thing doez NOT work .... it sez it needs a thing from microsoft but microsoft sez they do n't have it ...
3 #### The software worked on my computer ; it 's running Windows 7 64 - bit . I do n't really like it that much , so I 'm using the Clearview SE simulator that I found free online . I never found any uses for the 5th and 6th channel which are the knobs which is a bummer . The software that I was using did n't even pick up on the 6th channel as I believe it 's broken ( I bought this as new ) . I kind of wish they made it closer to the Spectrum controllers , but I guess cheap is cheap I suppose . It did help me prepare myself for flying 4 channel airplanes , but nothing comes close to the real thing . It gave me inspiration and the confidence to go ahead and buy the micro Trojan and micro Mustang along with the DX6i remote on eBay . If you want to start flying four channel planes , I recommend starting here first . After here , decide if you want to buy a luxury simulator or use that same amount of money to buy a RTF plane ... Your choice I suppose .
5 #### this is a nice little trainer controller to start a novice out on . But the software is crap and wo n't run on most windows 8 machines . Get a copy of Clearview and it really comes alive . Then once your doing better connect the actual controller you will be using to the pc for a better experience
5 #### This control is well worth purchasing . I have really made a difference on learning to fly helicopters and planes . I am using clearview flight simulator software .
2 #### was a pain to install and graphics poor , only good thing is you can use controller on other sim loads
3 #### I tested this out with Realflight G2 on a windows 7 PC . The device drivers installed automatically . It took A LOT of tweaking the program settings , calibrating , adjusting servo rates ( in program ) etc etc to get it to work right . If you are up for this using whatever RC flight program you had in mind then it 's a great cheap controller . BTW the controller has 2 channels for the sticks . You have to find which one your program wants to see on all controls . Otherwise your ailerons might be your throttle , your rudder your elevator , etc etc ... and it might need reversed in settings . There are no working manual trims . All those are just plastic case molding .
2 #### Wish they would be more specific on the graphic driver needed to run this sim . I would have bought one that was set up for vista .
2 #### Not as good as prior reviews stated it was . Not compatible for some flight games . The controls are sloppy and have a short range of motion compared to others that are similar . Spend more and maybe you can get better quality . It is ok for the price but not good enough for high end users .
2 #### First , mine arrived DOA but it was obvious that this is a toy and not really appropriate for proper training in radio control operation . It 's too small , does n't have trim control and the sticks have none of the feel that an actual controller does . I did n't get to test its accuracy since it was defective but even if it was spot on , there are much better options out there - check out the Dynam 6ch controller - it is life size , has trim control , good feel on the sticks and works well with Clearview SE ( free ) . Do n't even bother to download FSM , it is outdated , no longer supported and not all that good when it works . The upgrade of Clearview is only $ 35 to get all the models and airfields or buy them one at a time to add to the freeware version . Props to Amazon as they immediately issued a return label and promptly credited me back my funds . Notice this is sold by a 3rd party vendor but fulfilled by Amazon - that makes all the difference in the world since the seller has to comply with Amazon 's policies .
2 #### It came quickly and as describe but there are flaws . Software are clunky and none of the helicopter model work for me so I had to download a different software ( HeliSimRC ) . It 's just a totally different feeling training with a computer vs a real RC . I suggest you save some extra money and buy a cheap 4CH RC heli instead of this . You 'll learn quicker from training with an actual RC than with this . For me , this is a waste of money .
5 #### Bought it to train myself , now it 's a fight with the wife , and kids to fly . Great learning tool , and way cheaper to start over than to fix real heli . Does NOT work right out of the box on new computers . Not super computer savvy , so I dug out my old computer with windows XP and it worked great . Box says compatible with windows 7 but there 's a lot of extra steps so I just put it on the other computer in around 2 mins was up and flying . You can do an internet search for the steps , it just was n't that serious to me .
1 #### I bought this toy for my son 's Christmas gift . But it does n't work on Windows vistar . My son was so upset about this useless gift . I want to return this toy . but I need to pay the shipping charge to send back this defect product . I should read all the reviews first before I buy this toy as a Christmas Gift ! ! !
1 #### a simulater replicates what the real thing is ever used a rc controller ? well throttel is on the left pitch yaw , elevator .. on right .. right ? well to tally reveresed on this .. so i m trying build .. instincts on the sticks .. well learn on this when you got 200 or more on a model , crash your cash its backwards ! ! ! i have flown real airplanes have 83 hrs solo . this would kill you in the real world .. now sims are awesome this will waste your model .. because ... the inputs on this .. mirror revers from spektrum .. futuba .. nice game though ... lol forget this # $ % ok get a real one .. ok ?
5 #### If you want to learn to fly a RC plane or helicopter this simulator will help you . If you are on a budget this simulator is for you . You can learn to fly and crash thousands of dollars in planes and helicopter . So when you go to the field to fly you are more confident . My kids pick it up quick and are flying well with the simulator . Remember to read the box and make sure it will work on you computer and this is not a game . It is a flight simulator trainer . I found helpful videos on U Tube
5 #### This was worth it 's weight in gold . It really helps you learn how to fly a plane from a standing still position . Way cheaper than learning this by crashing a real R / C plane !
3 #### This is my first RC flight simulator , I'm running 32bit Vista on a 4 month old Gateway Desktop , it 's setup for multimedia tasking . I have plenty of processing power and memory to spare , and the sim software drove me crazy ! Trying to get it to run right on my vista system was a job , and when it did it looked almost like the old atari games , it do'es not run well on Vista(it 's written for Windows XP),and believe me I tried everything , YouTube , emails , phone calls the internet , the works . Well let me end on a good note , the simulated radio worked fine with just plug & play . I purchased the sim software from another company(Clea - Vie , these two words are missing a letter each.),it 's beautiful . BIGEMANN
5 #### I love it ! Ciel is so cute ! And I was so happy that the box also contains two hands for Sebastian . So , now both Sebastian and Ciel bring joy into my life . Thank you !
5 #### Thanks to the designers for a fun angle on collecting , I am smiling as the new display shelf takes shape . 8)
4 #### I bought Ciel knowing he was a bootleg . He 's good for the price I payed , but obviously a fake . His face is a bit thinner than the real one , making him look a bit less cute . His hair falls of very very easily , and so does his limbs . The extra arms for sebastian do n't match his clothes , since the plastic is too shiny . They also fall off of him very easily . He 's good for the price , but if I had payed any more for him I would be upset . Either way , he 's a cute addition to my shelf .
4 #### Its a fake , its not the real figure . that being said i still really like it . its a cheap price and it is pretty cute and well made . if you are looking for a authentic version look somewhere else tho .
3 #### Unlike the Sebastian Bootleg that Amazon also sells the quality in this one is a bit off . For example on the neck you can really see that it is a bootleg because it has a line running through the middle and the color in the neck is way off . The figure itself is adorable , the only thing that bugs me is the neck . Other than that part if you set it in a way that you ca nt really see it it look completely alright . Same price as the Sebastian bootleg but the Sebastian bootleg is better quality , still this one for the price it does not disappoint . Recommend only if you really do not ind owning a bootleg , for me this was fine because the price is alright and I can just hide the neck , but if you are extremely picky then this is not for you . The box it came with was in bad shape , it was torn and squished , it took about a week to get to my house from China .
4 #### Highly detailed but some of the parts fallen off on arrival
5 #### For the size and price , this is FANTASTIC . Incredibly detailed and accurate with numerous decals and a great paint / camo scheme . Comes with 4 AIM120s on the bottom and 2 fuel tanks , but curiously no AIM9 sidewinders . The model is heavy and feels like majority metal construction . My only small complaint is lack of painted detail inside the cockpit , although the pilot is ( vaguely ) painted . If I could crack open the canopy and paint some more detail I would . Nevertheless , it 's a small complaint when the rest of the model is stunning .
1 #### The painting is of the lamding gear is mess up . Not good .
5 #### My hubby is into military jets and we ordered a few diecast models for him and this one is really well made with lots of details . The wheels do n't roll but otherwise it 's a really good collectible . The attached photo shows the substantial size of this model compared with two Maisto models we also bougght:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Maisto - Fresh - Metal - Tailwinds-1 - 87 - Scale - Die - Cast - United - States - Military - Aircraft - U - S - Navy - Supersonic - Carrier - Capable - Fighter - Attack - Jet - Aircraft - F - A-18E - Super - Hornet - with - Display - Stand / dp / B001DIZGQG / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Maisto Fresh Metal Tailwinds 1:87 Scale Die Cast United States Military Aircraft - U.S. Navy Supersonic Carrier - Capable Fighter / Attack Jet Aircraft F / A-18E Super Hornet with Display Stand</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Maisto - Fresh - Metal - Tailwinds-1 - 87 - Scale - Die - Cast - United - States - Military - Aircraft - U - S - Navy - Supersonic - Carrier - Capable - Fighter - Attack - Jet - Aircraft - F - A-18E - Super - Hornet - with - Display - Stand / dp / B001DIZGQG / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Maisto Fresh Metal Tailwinds 1:87 Scale Die Cast United States Military Aircraft - U.S. Navy Supersonic Carrier - Capable Fighter / Attack Jet Aircraft F / A-18E Super Hornet with Display Stand</a > . In the picture you can see this is so much bigger ! ! The stand is cheaply made and wobbles but the plane model itself is excellent for the size and price .
4 #### Accurate , came in great condition , amazing detail , and overall a fine example of one of military histories true killers ! ! ! 4 out 5 stars because of the plastic components . Nothing was wrong with them , it 's just advertising certain models as diecast when they are not is a little misleading . They should advertise exactly what it is composed of when selling online ! ! ! !
4 #### Metal parts are great but the plastic pieces brake way to easy & it is very disappointing to me but ca n't complain givin the price .
2 #### Very Good model . Problem is how it 's on the stand . Too much weight forward , very difficult to get it to stay off the plane 's nose . I 'll have to add weight to the stand or fasten it to a larger stand base . VERY SAD ! !
1 #### The plane is cute . It is small . It may have worked , but we 'll never know because the controller did not work . Unfortunately this was discovered on Christmas morning when my son received it ! ! So I 've sent it back and ordered another type of helicopter . Hopefully the next one will work . Good luck to you if you order this . Apparently there have been many that have worked ! Just not ours .
5 #### Right outta the box , this is a fun toy for all ages . I purchased 2 of these ( 1 for myself & 1 for my son ) . There is a learning curve for the inexperienced flyer like myself . After a few flights you will get much better at controlling , hovering , and landing ( with fewer crashes ) . * * * A quick tip ... if you find yourself about to lose control , ease off of the controls and let it hover ... it'll save your equipment . ENJOY ! ! ! !
5 #### awesome little flying toy that is very simple and easy to use . great gift for my little nephew to use . he loved it .
4 #### you ca n't have more than 2 running in the same place ! ! !
5 #### Flies well and easy to control . We are flying it in the Denver area at 5000 feet .
3 #### great toy , but unfortunately only lasted for 6 months .
3 #### Kids always want these but they are so fragile . My son played with it a few times before breaking it . I assumed that it would n't last long for his age , so I purchased this cheaper one . It is hard to control though , it hits the ceiling inside . It is for inside use , but unless you have really high ceilings it does n't leave you much room to fly . And then taking it outside you have issues with trees , wind and rooftops . You take your chances .
5 #### Bought this for my god son and it 's sturdy and great for play . He loves it .
5 #### Super fun toy . Stable flight , holds a good charge . No complaints at all for the price . I have crashed this thing so hard into walls and it just keeps flying .
5 #### Had so much fun scaring the crap out of my wife with this , that she batted it out of the air and landed in the dishwater . Never worked quite right after that , but it was worth those moments where my infant daughter pissed herself laughing too hard .
5 #### these little copters are a lot of fun small enough to fly inside , there pretty durable but after a ton of crashes they can break or develop flying problems ... this is our third one as the little one has crashed a few still a lot of fun , not really for outdoors tho as a slight breeze is too much for them and the remote control is IR not radio which means sunlight can affect the flying they last about 10 mins per charge and take an hour to recharge .... I ugraded the batteyr on one unit and found it was only slightly better like 12 mins maybe i would reccomend just sticking w the factory battery
4 #### My sons have bought several of these over the years . They are very fun . But when you are learning to use them , you crash them a lot . And they are not sturdy enough for that repeatedly . They end up buying replacement parts . But that has n't deterred them . I think we have had 4 or so new ones in our house . We have a high ceiling in our living room which makes it especially fun .
3 #### THIS HELICOPTER IS OK ... THEY DO NOT KEEP A CHARGE VERY LONG AND SEEM TO ONLY FLY FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES .. THEY ARE FUN TO FLY BUT IT TAKES SOME SKILL ... I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT FOR CHILDREN .. IT TOOK MY HUSBAND A WHILE TO GET THE HANG OF IT ....
5 #### An indoor helicopter that is easy to control and survives multiple crashes which invariably happen . What 's not to like ? It will leave marks if it hits people , TVs , or walls . Be forewarned ... ;)
5 #### This is our second helicopter . The first was a from Burlington Coat Factory . It worked okay but the control of the helicopter was very difficult . NOW THIS ONE is amazing in comparison . This one will hover in one spot and is easy to control . The up / down control does n't spring back , so you do n't have to fight it the whole time you fly it . I highly recommend this product , and am planning to buy a few more for the whole family .
5 #### Well built metal frame helicopter . The gyroscope makes it very stable and easy to control . No more spinning out of control .
5 #### This Syma Helicopter is great for beginners or people who are n't good at controlling helicopters because air comes out from the bottom and keeps it hovering it also flies very evenly . The air from the bottom also reduces falling damage to the helicopter . I do not recommend this helicopter on windy days outside because its very light and will be blown away easily . I also do n't recommend this near animals because they will go crazy . I suggest this helicopter for people ages 8 and up . The best part about this is that it will almost never break like all those other air hogs helicopters . Over all I give this helicopter 5 out of 5 . Pros : Cons : Easy to Fly Hard to fly outside Even flying Animals go crazy Can reach amazing heights Wo nt break
3 #### was not very happy with the product because it was a Christmas gift and did now work , the hand set did not work .
5 #### This toy works so good we purchased a 2nd one the next day and both have held up very well in our household with 5 children ! We purchased a different brand initially but were irked by how it flew as well as a short in the charger / battery unit . We will definitely stick with this brand for future purchases !
5 #### My son got this for Christmas and he loves it ! It 's the best R / C helicopter he 's ever flown . Very stable and responds well to controls . The USB charging option is very convenient . Would definitely buy again .
5 #### I have eight of these little helicopters . They take a bit of skill to get the hang of , but remote controls can be mastered pretty quickly . They are rated for 14 + so I would not recommend them for younger children . But if you are child - minded like me ( I 'm 62 and an old helicopter pilot ) then you will enjoy them . They recharge direct from the remote control ( has cord inside compartment ) or any USB port with the charger cord included . The little rascals are fun to fly and are pretty tough ( I bounced them off of the wall and ceiling a few times until I got the hang of it ) . Do not fly near someone 's face or around pets as the blades may be plastic , but they are spinning quiet fast . They come in several colors and you can find replacement parts here on Amazon or on Ebay . Ejoy !
5 #### bought as a gift for an 8 year old and she loved it works great and keeps her busy for quite a while .
5 #### My son wanted this for Christmas , but his Christmas budget had already been spent ... so after watching videos and reading the reviews , my husband decided he had to have one . LOL ! He flies it regularly and even lets our 11 year old son fly it now and then .
4 #### this is a gift and so i have not been able to open it up and play . looks awesome and others I know have said it works well . I am jealous of the person I am giving it to
5 #### Product works fine . Flies and handles much better than those small nano quads . Great night flyer due to multiple led 's . Accesories , ( order ala carte ) , are fun and work great . Have not used camera yet .
5 #### I have only used this twice so far I just received it yesterday I am an experienced flyer been plying with these for a long time now this one is really fun I like that u can go to 100 percent witch I do not recemond until u learn the quad a lil bit first it goes threw the wind if it not to bad with no problem at all and for a 100 dollars that 's pretty damn good . the camera needs a lil more info on how to use I do n't have it yet cause u push the function button but some times it goes and some time it does nt
5 #### it looks absolutely fabulous ca n't wait to fly in the dry weather
5 #### Better than I expected for the money . Love to play with it and I 'm 63 years old
5 #### Tuff little helicopter . Great for beginners as well as the skilled .
5 #### For the price , this crawlers very cool to run . My son is very happy with this crawler . lots of aluminum and also lights too . COOL STUFF
5 #### I loved this crawler so much I wrote an article about it on my blog ( starlino dot com ) . One particular modification I made is a conversion to a larger scale by adding more frame parts . It handles well any terrain . The stock ESC runs without a problem using a 3S LiPo and it is waterproof ! I purchased and installed a rear steering kit for even tighter turns . Great for someone who wants to get into RC crawlers and learn something on the way !
4 #### The reviews mentioned this was good for most younger kids . I would agree with that . My 7 yo picked up how to work it really quick but 1 simple crash and the blade popped off . Hoping we can fix it easily . Very small screws in the blades , so make sure you have a tiny screwdriver on hand . It provided 1/2 hour of entertainment . I would n't buy this again until he 's much older . Kind of a waste of money for a kid under 10 , imo
4 #### Works like a charm . Never had any problems with Syma helos .
5 #### We both have a lot of fun flying this around the house .
5 #### Quite suprised with the quality of this RC . At this price point I really expected a toy RC . This has proved to be very capable and have provided me and my family quite a bit of fun . 1st off a little bit of my background , as you can see from the picture I own some legit " brand name " RC 's HPI , Traxxas , Losi ( pictured and others not in the photo . That being said , at this price point this is really a great crawler . I emailed the vendor and added 4 wheel steering ( ridiculously easy and dirt cheap ) . This was bought to basically drag dog toys around to wear my wife 's Pekingese out indoors . It 's been used for quite a bit more than that and has performed very well . I only had one small issue the set screws holding the front and rear hubs onto the axles worked loose . Luckily we found the one that fell out and I removed all 4 and applied some Loctite and tightened . That will never happy again . If your looking for a quality vehicle at a " toy " price point look no further . For some extra fun grab an extra battery or two ( 3800 mah or above ) and a Tenergy universal smart charger and your seriously set up for endless run times and a lot of fun
4 #### This is a really fun vehicle . There are parts available ( very reasonably priced / cheap ) however finding them in stock is the real problem . I want to add the 4 wheel steering conversion but ca n't find the parts I need in stock ( $ 7 . + $ 15 . For the steering servo / cheap ) . So 5 stars Is out of the question . NitroRCX carries almost all the parts you might need but has only half of them in stock . To bad . Tell your grandson 3 - 6 weeks ! It still a bargain , still a blast , easy to work on and fun to drive . Steering knuckles , cheap , buy a half dozen when available . It 's the only part we have broken ( $ 2.50 a pair ! ) or get a couple of pairs of aluminum ones ( not cheap ) . AX10 aluminum knuckles for the Axial AX10 will work . Watch for some on sale , a lot of companies make them . Get a Tenergy Universal Smart Charger ( $ 15 . ) and another battery/5000 mAh for longer run times and have some fun ! ( The Tenergy charger is for NiMH / NiCD only , 1000 - 5000 mah rated ) .
4 #### Great . Grandson loves it and so does his dad . Works just as predicted . No issues .
4 #### Very nice quality helicopters . The only down side is that the battery charge does n't last very long - but it charges fairly quickly too . These are easy to use and are so fun . My family laughed so much when we were learning to fly these things - which brings me to the point that they are very durable ! We have crashed into countless things - the ceiling , the floor , the TV , each other , etc . and both helicopters remained intact . There were several times that I thought - that 's it it 's dead ! But NO they keep going . They are a lot of fun . My kids were 7 and 11 when we first purchased these - fun for all ages ! And the price is quite reasonable !
5 #### WITHSTANDING 6 MONTHS OF 5 YEAR OLD PLAYING ROUGHLY WITH IT . FLIES GOOD . FUN FOR THE PRICE . A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AFTER READING REVIEWS .
5 #### When you place it next to a 1/10 it looks big , and it is . It comes with 2 540 motors and they give you some excellent power , you can clear massive obstacles and clear trees with speed making for a great experience . I found there was no need to raise the suspension because the bigger and really grippy tires give you extra height . It 's powerful enough that you can spin the back wheels . The lights are great , I thought it came with one front light so I was pleasantly surprised to see that it has back and side lights as well . It 's made very well as you would expect from all these products nowadays . The battery moving around was easily remedied by feeding the wires behind the metal plate , adding a small zip lock bag rolled up and adjusting the snaps accordingly . The crawler moves so fast the turning circle is a non issue imo , if you do raise the suspension you really would be able to take this baby anywhere and there is clear indication on the servo that it 's waterproof . Plus it has plenty of ground clearance . I give this crawler 2 thumbs up .
4 #### overall I like . some very small upgrade`s and it is a very fun crawler , it`s worth the price . you should n't be disappointed .
5 #### The best starter rc helicopter . Very stable and very durable .... Syma 107s are the standard you should judge the others with . Well worth the money .
5 #### awesome . my 5 and 7 year old played non stop with this . way better than expected .
5 #### My daughter just love this helicopter , I used it as a training vehicle before I bought her a drone .
5 #### Bought 3 of these and the kids love them . They are the actual syma product and the body and landing gear are solid sturdy metal easy to operate and a super product if you are an rc lover . It has plastic blades for flying that seem like they would break relatively easy if you crashed the helicopter or whacked it or something to the effect they do include an extra tail rotor blade which is great and they sell complete replacement blade kits for 4 - 5 bucks so not a biggie plus you can charge it 2 different ways either from a cord on the controller that charges it from the controller batteries or from an included usb cable right to your computer . No complaints on this product at all
5 #### Worked great ! My 9 year old daughter is really getting the hang of flying it . It is a starter one so that she can upgrade to a chopper with a camera which is on her wish list . My husband liked so much he was tempted to buy another one or possibly two .
5 #### $ 20 buys you a very easy RTF helicopter , a cheaper way to learn the world of RC control , and a winter of enjoyment . Even a great stocking stuffer ! Needs lots of batteries , so make sure you buy a box before it gets unpackaged Christmas morning .
4 #### daughter loved it ! 5 years old and took to it like a pro ...
5 #### It was durable and all the boys loved it ! I even bought another as a birthday present .
3 #### average copter , i have flown better , this one does n't like to stay in one spot . it keeps moving around . its fun , but its not a great copter
4 #### it ' a little diffucult to maneouver at first but the remote control works well and the toy is sturdy and can take a few hits on the ground . My son ejoyed this toy very much and for the price it 's a good toy .
3 #### Got this for my husband because he begged me and he has flown it once , maybe twice in 6 months . This is definitely NOT a good toy if you have small kids in the house or animals that might attack it . It takes a long time to charge and the battery does not last long . I ca n't remember exactly what interferes with it but several times the helicopter stopped responding when other items were on in the house . I think a few of the kids ' toys were the culprit as well as a television remote . On the positive side , it is not a very expensive gift and even with its downfalls would get you at least a hug from the recipient . It is very entertaining to watch someone trying to learn how to fly it . Make sure there are no breakable things around and you could get at least a few laughs out of the experience !
4 #### After trying out several RC helicopters including Airhogs , and other asian brands , the Syma is by far the best and most reliable and controllable . After probably 10 hours of cumulative fight now , the battery does n't hold an amazing charge , but I can still get 10 minutes of solid fly time in each charge . Although it 's gotten banged about in some cases , I 've had no terminal damage and the quality is superb . I 've only had to make minor adjustments to the tail - rotor once . As an entry level RC helo , it could n't be easier to learn . It 's stable to fly and easily maneuverable for beginners and advanced pilots alike .
5 #### This thing is built very very well . The frame is metal along with most of the aircraft . Myself and my daughter crashed this thing for about eight hours straight and it is still going strong . Crazy fun .
5 #### This toy works so good we purchased a 2nd one the next day and both have held up very well in our household with 5 children ! We purchased a different brand initially but were irked by how it flew as well as a short in the charger / battery unit . We will definitely stick with this brand for future purchases !
3 #### Flies well and it seems sturdy enough . I have crashed it down the stairs a few times and it still works . Wish it held a charge for longer than 10 minutes , but I hear all the RC shoppers are like that .
1 #### After reading all the positive reviews and knowing many of these kind of helicopters get terrible reviews I felt this one was the one to buy . My son opened it on his birthday and then charged it being so excited . Never got off the ground ! ! ! So upset for him . Mailed it back that same day . I am still looking for a good one to replace it .
5 #### Lots of support out there as well , well built , fun to set up home challenges especially using fans cleverly ! Worth the money - cripes that 4 coffees .
4 #### As to be expected , it 's a blast to fly . It 's easy , good control and fun . The battery ( maybe 10 minutes of flying time for 45 mins of charge time ) is the only downside . Given the size of the helicopter that is n't a surprise , but it 's still an issue . It does n't have as many lights at some other models , but it 's still great .
5 #### My son loved this present he got for Christmas , and he flew it a lot . One of the propellers did get cracked , but with a little super glue it is still flying .
5 #### Love , love , love this little toy . I 'm forty years old but feel like a kid with this thing . Pros : Durable as heck ... i 've crashed this thing into everything and it still works ; easy to fly with a little practice ; crazy cheap Cons : If only the battery charge lasted longer than a few mintues
5 #### Bought for a as gift for a 6 year old . It keeps him busy and happy for hours . Great price
5 #### You ca n't get a better heli for this price ( $ 22 ) . I suggest starting with this heli and then getting Nano QX when you get better .
5 #### Relatively easy to fly although concise low speed maneuvering is tricky . Can take a substantial amount of abuse without breaking . This is a good starter copter to try out and see if you might want to go for something more expensive . On the downside , you ca n't replace the battery easily . Be prepared for a break as you charge up for the next run . But , the people you are buzzing may appreciate this .
5 #### i m really surprized how awesome this little thing does , have flown inside and outside , its small but that s great to learn with , my first . love it .get the elec . charger with it .i got extra blades to , and have n't needed so far this thing is pretty tough would buy again
4 #### My kids have had this for about 3 months now . No issues expect the helicopter does n't stay charged very long .
5 #### We had an Airhogs copter first . It was super hard to fly and then it broke . This copter is a billion times better . It is much easier to control and way more durable . In fact , my six year old pilots this thing all over the house . Great product .
4 #### To those concerned with getting a knockoff I received an authentic syma product . My only complaint is lack of signal strength on remote causing copter to suddenly drop to the ground other than that it 's a blast .
5 #### He loves it , and crashes it regularly and it 's held up incredibly well ! He 's gotten quite skilled at landing it on various surfaces in the apartment , not my favorite late night activity but it is comical .
5 #### For the price , these things are so much fun . It takes some coordination to fly them , so it is a challenge and fun to fly , but they are not so hard that younger kids can not fly them . They really look real and are very enjoyable .
5 #### I HAVE 2 BLACK ONE 'S BOUGHT THIS GREEN ONE SO WE BOTH CAN FLY AT THE SAME TIME WITH OUT LOSING TRACK OF WHOS WHO ! ! ! THIS IS VERY EASY TOFLY STRONG DURABLE A BLAST TO FLY . SYMA IS HARD TO BEAT IF YOU ORDER FROM AMAZON SOME DEALERS ARE FUNNY . THEY KNOW WHO I MEAN ! ! ! GET ONE TODAY BEFORE THEY FLY AWAY ! ! ! IT 'S BETTER TO FLY HIGH ! ! ! THAN DRINK AND DRIVE ! ! !
5 #### I got this as a for my 30th bday . I always used 380 size motors , so the 540 really shocked me at first ! Its fast ! Also - i did the measurements of the truck before ordering , and its bigger in real life its size is n't a bad thing - easier to work on when needed . Seems to run well over every surface , but you may want to look into larger wheels for long grass . originally i picked this after researching s / c and monster rc trucks when it comes to bashing . My main emphasis was durability and its holding up well . Another reviewer mentioned the weak front bumper and i agree it is a flaw . But it has an easy solution . I ca nt say how it ll do racing ( i just like jumping and bashing ) but it handles very well despite having a single shock per tire suspension . Its extremely tuneable and adjustable for all the pros out there . It will fit 8.4 flat packs for more punch and run time . Long range ( 300ft - ish ) . And i can tell you it is waterproof ! Great setup , a STEAL for 120 plus shippin . Very highly recommend this !
5 #### Faster and larger than we expected . The car works great . It is low to the ground , so do n't expect it to perform like a crawler . But works great on pavement , dirt and even grass . This car is going to need some repairs as you jump it and crash it . But Exceed has all of the parts on their website . So just expect to have do fix some things along the way . It is made to be repairable
2 #### Got this for my son for Christmas the truck is built well . Has held up to lots of abuse . But as kids are it has got broke , finding parts is a nightmare . On Amazon its not clear on the a arm I need , nitrorcx wants 2 buck for the part but 17 bucks to ship . I want to like the truck but parts are a joke . If I could get parts for a good price and easy to get I would give it 5 stars .
5 #### Thank god this was available here , because IKEA has discontinued it and I desperately need an extra in case the one my child loves is ever lost or damaged in a foxident . It 's so soft and cute , possibly the cutest in our vast collection of soft toys . I 'd suggest you not separate the two or you 'll spend eternity looking for the baby fox .
5 #### Very cute . Easy to wash . Easily stuffed into a diaper bag . And my daughter carries it every where .
4 #### I was happy with how the costume looks but it is too expensive , in my opinion . Just like some other reviewers , the material is too thin and you have to wear something under or it is definitely see through . I would n't have paid so much for this costume if I had known how flimsy / thin the material is .
5 #### This costume works great . My 5 year old loves it and it looks very American Indian . Great Costume . Buy it .
5 #### I picked this set of knives up on Woot for $ 13 for my wife a couple years ago . She loves animal print so I thought for that price it was worth a small gag gifts for my wife . Much to my surprise this is actually the best set of knives we own . We are incredibly sharp , cut like a dream and clean very easily . After 2 years of use and no sharpening they still are amazing . Definitely worth the money !
5 #### Graet flyer for beginner and the young ones - cage works and they have lots of fun !
3 #### Love this but very flimsy and piece broke 1st day but still usable
5 #### It 's a $ 40 quadrocopter and it 's great . Really durable and it comes with 2 batteries . Easy charging . Great machine to learn to fly on .
5 #### Just a great concept -- easy to learn , very durable , and is an impressive flier at any price ! You 'll want extra batteries and make sure to shave the nubs off the connectors so that they can be pulled apart easily . With supervision from a person that knows how to fly it , I know a 12 year old can do fine . ( 14 years old recommend by the maker . )
5 #### What more can I say , my grandson loves it . Not too complicated to handle and yet a lot of fun for the pilot . The family reviews were so good that my husband has purchased another one for a godson .
1 #### Ok , this is the 2nd one of these I bought . Sent the first one back because one prop would never stop spinning . This one the headlights stopped working in the first 3 minutes of flight . And no , it was not because of a crash . But speaking of crashing , this unit is nowhere near as stable as the Hubsan X4 . Now , you put THAT one in a protective cage like this and you would really have something . Here , all you have is a cage that protects the flying unit , but the flying unit is not very good to begin with .
4 #### You would have to hit something really hard to break this quadcopter . It 's a lot of fun and great for beginners and the price is right including the two batteries that come with it . That 's a good idea because it only has about 6 - 8 minute flying time on a charge . Here 's a hint to keep you from pulling the battery wires loose from the connector : On the female side , use a fingernail file and file down the little projections on the clip that holds them together . Do n't file too much or it may come apart in flight . Just enough to make it easier to unplug it without pliers . Also : The trim is very sensitive and hard to get set . It will go off in one direction quickly if you do n't get it right . Just do one click at a time and then fly for a few seconds because if you give it multiple clicks at once it will quickly veer off in the other direction . Have fun !
4 #### Had to tinker with my servo which had loosened up too quickly in my opinion , since then have had NO trouble , for the money this is a fantastic entry rc car . Works great with an extended battery and tears up the terrain very well . Tons of fun , especially when I chase my dog with it ! ! !
5 #### Wow , I am impressed ! I bought this for my girlfriend 's son 's 9th birthday . He loves it . So do I ! For the price you are getting way more than you think you will get . This is a nice car and it moves ! I had a Kyosho Optima way back in the day that I used to race and this is right up to speed with that . I m blown away by how good this buggy is . Might be buying one for me now !
5 #### Great car . Rock solid after you swap spindles and change axels to cvds . This is a must when buying his car .
4 #### Actually 4.9 Stars . Better equipped than the Losi Mini 8ight - comes with spur / pinion cover stock and good electronics . Just need to improve the spindle design to survive better . Overall a great car !
4 #### The truck is nice and very stable and powerful with dual motors on each axle but the steering knuckles are plastic and will break with any serious crawling . You can use the ST Racing Concepts STA80004 G Aluminum Steering Knuckles for The Axial AX10 as replacements . We replaced all four knuckles so if we want to add the rear steering servo in the future we wo n't have to deal with broken knuckles on the rear . Front and Rear are the same . One other thing that takes away from 5 stars is that the 3 mm screws are just threaded into the plastic mounting holes cutting their own threads so when you remove the screws sometimes you take out the threads with them . Too bad the factory did not pre thread the holes . So consider a 3 mm Tap and 3 mm helicoil repair kit if you plan on any modifications .
5 #### Positives : Tough , fast , low cost , fun , fun , fun , great choice if you 're at all into RCs and if you 're not ... After a short period of time playing with this mini / micro 1/14 th scale buggie and you likely will be . Negative aspects : strange battery connecter interface . I clipped mine off and replaced it with a Deans , T - type connecter . This allowed me to use many brands of LiPo batterys out of the box which runs much longer , faster and in my opinion doubles the fun .
5 #### Pretty sweet , everything I hoped it would be , quality and attention to detail are great as well .
5 #### Would give 6 stars if allowed . Straight away the unboxing was pleasant . No cruddy packaging here . Let me say this in pure confidence . I already like it more than my 500 $ TRX . 2wd pede . It feels great in my hands . Feels very durable . Listen to this . The suspension far surpasses the TRX vehicle . You push down on this little Tacon and it springs right back . The TRX started sagging the minute it was born . Do n't get me wrong . I have modded my TRX enough to enjoy it a lot . But there in lies the problem . It was already a 500 $ vehicle . Then to put a ton of mods on it to make drive able . Buy this little tacon and you will not regret it . There 's a reason why they have 5 million good reviews .
5 #### This thing is fun . Slow but fun . It climbs everywhere , is water proof ( or at least resistant ) and has a long battery life .
5 #### for rock crawler it a lots fun do n't buy it if you want speed rc it goes real slow but lots of fun
5 #### This is a great entry - level crawler . Plenty of power ( snapped and axle in less than 10 mins lol . I got it bound up . Not the trucks fault . ) Comes with three sets of springs soft , medium , and hard . The battery it comes with last around 15- 20 mins . I bought a 5000mah battery and I have crawled for well 9ver 45 mins with little to no pause . Only 2 things I recommend doing . 1st is to trim back the wheel arches quit abit , the tires get hung at full articulation . 2nd is to change the 4 mm red banana plugs out for tamiya . Opens up a whole new world of battery options with tamiya plugs .
5 #### incredible value I 've been a rc lover for over 20 yrs owned a hobby shop specializing in rc cars and trucks this is comparable to many rc crawlers costing $ 300 or more !
5 #### love the truck the rear diff striped out but customer service with exceed was very helpful and sent me out new parts to repair it
4 #### Good bang for the buck , bought as a christmas gift for my 13 yr old son . Good platform to build on or run as is . The radio quit after 4 runs but that did n't bother me because I already had another to add as an upgrade along with different tires , steering servo and speed control . I left the rest of it stock and it works as well as any high end crawlers costing double or more .
5 #### Ca n't beat the fun you get out of it for the price . I bought a Losi Nightcrawler shortly thereafter , and even though the Losi performs much better .... you can have almost as much fun with this thing . Get some weights for the wheels !
5 #### awesome rc , hobby grade not toy ( walmart or radio shack ) only needs 4 aa batteries . will run along time but is slow but climbs everything . can do a few free mods to improve capability . would consider another one .
5 #### Being I am new to the rc crawling world I wanted something inexpensive . This is a great starter crawler and will handle many upgrades and modifications . I am extremely happy with it . I would recommend this to others .
5 #### One is my son 's truck . The other was used to build my scale truck . $ 130 bucks why not 2.4 gig remote upgrade as things break and make it your own rig . ya sure the rear diff went out on my son 's but not after beating it on trail runs and rock crawling . For a beginer in r / c it is cheap and you can learn lots from it . I 'm not into rock crawling yet but I will buy one again when I build scale trucks ... or start rock crawling .
5 #### I bought this to compete against my friend 's Axial AX10 Ridgecrest build . We both had 500 $ to create the world 's best trail truck . I bought some Hot Bodies " Rover " tires ( the wheels are beadlocks ) , a Novak Terra Claw 35 turn motor , changed the gearing to 18/91 , changed the plugs from tamiya to deans , put on the " soft " springs in the front with 1 height spacer on each side , in the rear Team Associated long green springs with 3 height spacers on the left , 1 on the right for torque twist , Modded the battery tray to take 2s LiPos , got a LiPo cutoff beeper , a Traxxas 2075 servo , and shimmed all of the diffs . The only problem with this car is that the driveshafts take set stews instead of pins to hold them to the diffs , which made them fall of ALL THE TIME . I CA glued them to the diffs and the problem ceased to exist . The ESC is really bogged down with 6 cell NiMh . I have ran this car through water , mud , grass , rocks , trails , trees , and downtown , and it preforms out of it 's league every time . I put $ 250 into this and got a better truck than my friend 's Ridgecrest . His car however did fall 200 feet down a cliff and did n't break or pull out any screws . What a lucky little kid ....... :) The worm gear transmission acts as a drag brake , but sounds like crap so do n't be worried when it makes loud noises !
5 #### this needs to go slow just like you are driving it . take your time you will fine a way to make it or try something else to climb take your time . i use clear plastic straws from any fast food place to cover front and back linkage .
1 #### These do NOT GLOW ! We put them out in direct sunlight from 12 pm -7pm . Hid them at 7 pm . 7:30pm absolutely NO glow for the kids .
1 #### Does not glow at all . Not worth the money .
2 #### Never used them . I thought it came with an easter basket . Waste of money .
1 #### It took too much time to keep in dark for them to glow . Egg was very flimsy quality , and the color without glowing was not a pretty color . Sorry . I ended up throwing them away . You usually do n't use Easter eggs at night when the glowing would be more appropriate .
3 #### You kinda have to charge the eggs for a long time and it kinda dims pretty quickly too . For an actual night egg hunt that could take 15 - 30 mins , the kids might have difficulty finding them after say 10 minutes ? ? However for studio purposes , which is why we bought them , it worked well . Have a look : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD8H_RsooIo
3 #### These were ok . I liked the neon colors even thought they did n't glow for long . Good value for the price . Had to throw out all the eggs with crosses though . Ca n't figure out why pagan holiday eggs would have a Jesus cross on them . Weird . Still worth it in the end , I guess .
2 #### The lights went out pretty quickly for these . By the time we had finished hiding them , they were already dimming noticeably . I think the photos shown might be taken under blacklight , because ours were never that bright even after hours of light exposure . Also , it 's not so obvious from the photos , but these eggs are not plain -- they have a religious cross symbol on each of them . Just keep that in mind , depending on your purposes for them .
5 #### i love the evolutions of eevee and am glad to be able to pick them up :) i recommend this to anyone that loves the evolutions of eevee
1 #### poorly made , and obviously bootleg , it had 3 long white strings coming out of its neck . not to mention the ears and tail are only made from a single piece of fabric . I wish I could get my money back on this .
5 #### well made granddaughter loves it goes with all her collection .
5 #### My girlfriend absolutely loved it . Thanks so much ! Super rare plush for a fair price . Could n't believe I found it for so cheap !
5 #### My favorite of all eevee evolutions had been espeon but recently I ca n't seem to pick a favorite anymore . I bought it and it was just too cute .
5 #### These little plushie are awesome . I got most of them as gifts and stocking suffers , but they are great any time of the year and great for all ages . It was a great buy :]
4 #### This is super cute and looks just like the picture . I ordered Umbreon , Espeon , Leafeon , Jolteon , Glaceon , Flareon , and Eevee . I would have ordered Vaporeon as well , but at the time Vaporeon was not available . I only gave it 4 stars because it 's not the highest quality plush ever ( there are a few loose strings that need to be snipped off and due to the chibi stylization of these particular plushies a few of them are top heavy . Also the red dot on Espeon 's head IS IN FACT glued on , however that is apparent in the picture . ) , but it 's definitely worth the price . Also the shipping took a long time ( about a month ) , but it was FREE and DID arrive on the estimated date . It just takes patience ! If you 're a fan of Pokemon , especially of the Eeveelutions I suggest adding these to your collection . They 're adorable and affordable ! However , if you 're looking for high end , name brand Poke merchandise I suggest you purchase this elsewhere and pay quadruple the price .
5 #### This is the only pokedoll I have any problem with , it 's face just seems a little bit flat .. although it 's still cute , and would be worth buying to get the full set of Eeveelutions .
5 #### i love the espeon i recieved . shipping was fast and it was soooo soft and cuddlely . i named her esper . I was super happy even tho it was a bootleg
1 #### This is a bootleg item , that 's why it 's so cheap . Not that I 'm saying you should n't buy it , but if you 're looking for the legitmate item you 're in the wrong place .
4 #### it 's very cute and stands just a bit taller than the average pokedoll . mine came with a few frayed looking threads in one eye but i think it can be fixed easily . she did not come with a tag so my assumption is that she is a factory reject but she 's still a very cute and nice doll !
5 #### For my kids , they loved it . Very soft and looks just like the pic
5 #### It 's absolutely adorable ! Cute and a good size . The only thing is that it does n't really sit upright in the picture because the head is so big , but that does n't bother me at all .
5 #### cute and soft plushie Came on time and fast shipping 5/5
4 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Pokmon - Pokemon - Plush - Lapars - Doll - Around-15cm-6 - 34 - Blue - Free / dp/9628597256 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Pokmon Pokemon Plush Lapars Doll Around 15 cm 6 " Blue , Free</a>&nbsp;This plush is absolutely cute and super small ! My only problem with it is that it 's got a dirp(doesn't look right ) face comparing to the anime version of Lapras .
4 #### This is a cute plushie of the already adorable Lapras . The main problem is that the head is heavier than the body , which means unless I prop it up against something it falls flat forward on its head . I 'm not sure if this was done intentionally , but I can assure you the lapras I received does not stand up straight like the one in the picture . If you have something that you can prop it up with this should not be a problem , but it is something the consumer should be aware of .
5 #### Very nice plush toy . Quick ship and reasonably priced
4 #### Looks cuter in pic , feet ( flippers ) are a little weird , makes her look like an alien . Wish it could stand up on it 's own like in the picture , but since they have different bases , it 's deceiving . But besides that I like it .
5 #### It 's absolutely adorable . My 3yr old loves it XD fast delivery too . It got here really early
4 #### This Lapras plush is super cute and is great quality . It looks slightly different from the picture , but I think that may be partially due to the way it was packaged and shipped .
4 #### Not as soft as i thought it would be . Still cute . Came a little crooked but easily fixed . For about $ 7 worth it 's price . I recommend it if u want a cheap cute plush , but pokemon plushies get pricey . So if you want a " good " plush its going to be between $ 20 and $ 30 bucks .
5 #### It is nice and soft . Top heavy , so I do n't understand how it 's sitting up in the picture . Once you buy it , it will always flop onto it 's own head rather than stand up . But that just gives it character ! ! ! It 's a cutie , great for anyone who loves lapras ! !
5 #### Kinda cheaply made , but it was cheap . Its super cute though , and my son was head over heels in love with it .
4 #### This came in VERY quickly and was packaged safely in a bag . When I opened it , I notice it looks a bit dopey and the ears are kind of odd , but it gives it a cute charm . This was a gift for my friend so I purchased a Dragonite with it just in case she does n't like the derp appeal . Still worth it !
5 #### It 's a neat gift for any one who watched or played the first games , pokemon r / b / y. The plush is soft and correct . The ears are a little derpy but can be sewn back to match the actual pokemon . It 's very light and the outer material feels nice . Not much to say other than wow . <3
4 #### The ONLY reason I took a star off is because , unlike what is shown in the photo , it WILL NOT sit upright . The head is too big for the body for it to sit upright . It 's an adorable plush , do n't get me wrong . But I 'll be cutting mine open and replacing the lower body stuffing with rice to make it sit up right .
5 #### I love pokemon and Lapars is adorable . Very well made and soft and cuddly . To cute and a perfect gift .
5 #### I 'm an avid pokemon collector of all sorts . Cards . Pokedolls . Games . Etc . Lapras is one of my favorite ice types . It looks like a chibi baby version of it . So cute ! !
3 #### I was really looking forward to this product for my son . It comes with a coloring book and a stylus that looks like a cute chunky crayon . My son was thrilled when he opened it . I told him that he could use the " crayon " with the free app that comes with it and he could n't wait . I searched all over the app store only to finally discover that it was not compatible with his tablet , nor on my other tablet . I was able to get it on my phone though . I tried to use the QR scanner to scan the coloring book page onto my phone so that he could color , but the QR scanner function would not work with the book whatsoever . He did like playing with the app alone though . However , I do n't really like the idea of him playing games on my phone often , especially since I have a fear of him dropping it . He does use the coloring book like a normal coloring book and he uses the stylus pen with his other coloring games on his tablet . I 'm happy that although he could n't use the app on his tablet , at least he can still use the coloring book and stylus crayon in other ways . Disclaimer : I received this magical coloring book plus stylus crayon , complimentary , in exchange for an honest review . All of the opinions expressed here are solely my own . No other compensation was received .
5 #### This cute little package was a lot different than I was expecting ( although I do n't know why , since it clearly states what you get ) . You receive a ( random color ) crayon stylus and a coloring book , and then you download the free app . This is seriously the best coloring app I have ever seen and I absolutely love all of the options it gives you . My almost 3 year old daughter plays with it every single day and it has quickly become one of her favorite apps . She has always loved coloring but this app and stylus has really taken her love of coloring to a new level ! The only issues we 've had with this app is that sometimes it has a bit of delay ( about 3 seconds ) and sometimes my two year old ca nt bring up one of the menu options by herself but neither of those issues is bothersome enough to take off a star . We love this app !
5 #### As a mom with four children , three of them in school using crayons I was sick of seeing crayons all over the house when the kids wanted to color at home . I was very excited about the idea of Painting Lulu . I was provided two samples for review from the company . Getting started is very easy . First you need to download the app if you want to use those features . I like that they have several app market options so all the kids could use the app on their own tablets . When we unlocked out book we were able to scan the pages from the coloring book without any problems at all . My kids had some difficulty with the crayon stylus when getting started and staying in the lines was almost impossible when they started but over time they got a handle of it . Using the stylus to switch the color options was a bit tougher and we just ended up using our fingers . I like the features to share or print the artwork after your child is done and I also like the different coloring instruments that were available for use . Over all it 's a great product for kids , especially since the app helps my kids to play and not make a mess .
2 #### Kept crashing and did n't work like it was supposed to .
5 #### Meet Lulu and Painting with Lulu is a brand new concept where an app goes along with a physical coloring book . I love this because my daughter can play with the same coloring book both at home and while we are on the road and crayons would be too hard to keep up with . The coloring book comes with your child 's very own crayon shaped stylus . It works great with the app , and is very easy for the child to hold . The app is very easy to use it . You can search for a page you want by clicking on the Meet Lulu icon , or you can scan a QR code that is found on each page and the app will take you to that page . Overall , my daughter loves this app , and I ca n't wait to see what comes next for Lulu and her friends .
5 #### I love the eco - friendly theme of this book and the kids love coloring the paper pages and then using the APP on the kindle . ( I still need to add it to the iPad ) We also put it on my iPhone5 and it works there too ! The app for us has been a little glitchy , we ca n't figure out how to print but that might work better on the iPad . The rubber crayon is great for touch screens and the kids love it . My 8 , 6 , and 4 , year old kids loved this coloring book and app . I think this is a great gift for any child and love that when crayons are not possible that the app is a clean alternative where the kids can still color again and again ! We received this as a review item !
5 #### If your child loves to color , Painting Lulu 's 2 - in-1 coloring book is a must ! Painting Lulu gives you more than the traditional coloring book . First you can color on a traditional coloring book and then you can scan the QR Code on the top of the page to continue coloring on an electronic device like an iPad or Kindle . You can also just scan the codes and start from scratch digitally . It comes with a cute stylus that looks just like a crayon .
4 #### Really cute collection ... great gift for collectors and for people who loves anime figures ... beautiful dolls from Hatsune Miku program ... My nephew really love these collection ...
2 #### i should have payed more attention to the pictures , when i ordered these i thought they were going to be the nendoroids from the first picture but they in fact are not ... i realized it after i got them in the mail . The ones you get are those in the second and third pic , they are clearly lower quality the colors are way off on some of them and the details are n't painted on them at all . I should have noticed ( by the price ) that they were n't the originals , but at less than $ 4 a piece ill simply paint the corrections myself . The ones in the first pic currently sell for around $ 25 each . You can compare the quality between the pics yourself , i was disappointed but i do n't think my purchase was a total loss . after i repaint them they 'll still look nice in my collection until i have the money to replace them with originals .
5 #### I purchased these to go on top of a cake for my friends daughters 15th Birthday that I made . They stood up great and are really cute . She thought they were the best gift that night ! They now sit on her shelf with her other collectibles .
4 #### so darn cute , they are really really adorable and the price , my kid loves them , she is a fan of these , voaloid , and no they are not the expensive real ones , but they are a close match , besides , my 12 year old does nt care if they cost 15 or 115 , she loved them
4 #### My girlfriend loved them , though their are some of them that had a slightly off paint job , I do n't think that 's the sellers fault .
5 #### These mini vocaloids are great ! super cute ! ! ! ! Arrived super fast too ! Shipper wrapped each carefully and each little doll is so detailed . Great GIFT and stocking stuffer
1 #### When I received this order I found that I had two Rins instead of having a Len and then they expect me to pay for shipping to return this item when this was their mistake in the first place ! ! ! Because of their mistake I am now stuck with an incomplete Vocaloid set ! Besides from that the box was in terrible condition when I received it and some of the Vocaloid characters are terribly painted to where it looks like they are faded such as Luka 's hair which is more of a lavender than a bright pink and Miko 's hair was blonde instead of brown . Horrible customer service and horrible item ; I will never buy from this company ever again and I recommend everyone to do the same .
5 #### King Features treated younger fans ( as well as fans of all ages ) to the Beatles ' cartoon , which premiered on September 25 , 1965 . I love the Beatle cartoon series . I loved it as a child and love it now and own the cartoons on video . This is an excellent way of introducing new generations to the Beatles . This adorable George figure looks just like the animated version of George . The famous lead guitar is true to its real - life counterpart and I like the fact that this figure comes on a stand . If you are lucky and have all 4 Beatle figures , you can put the stage together . I would not recommend this for children under 10 as this is really a collector 's item . If you keep the packaging with the pictures and comments about each Beatle , that , too will add to the value of your Beatles ' collection . Beatle fans will certainly want these figures and will avidly grab them up and proudly display them . You can play Beatle classics from 1965 ( that was a fertile year for them musically as well as artistically - that was the year their second film " Help ! " was released ) and enjoy some retro fun ! Be sure to get the other Beatles for your collection . You might also want to get " Beatle Toons " by Mitch Axelrod . That is an excellent book about the Beatles ' cartoon .
5 #### Quality construction . A very good value for the money . House folds into a very neat and pretty unit . The Victorian details of the house make it very attractive . If your child loves Hello Kitty , s / he will enjoy this !
5 #### I 'm an organizer and LOVE that they came out with this ! My daughter is 3 and these princess and the pauper dolls are her first barbies . I absolutely love that all 3 barbies ( annelise , erika , and julian / dominick ) and all 4 flower girls fit in the case with elastic bands to keep them in place . There are even small compartments to keep the crowns and extra outfits that can be bought ! It seems to be a sturdy canvas , and it 's just as cute as the dolls themselves . My daughter loves it !
5 #### I bought all four Beatles because as a little kid , I was 8 years old when the Beatles came over to the Colonies . My family was on Vacation and we were at a Sheraton on Van Ness in San Francisco . The day before I saw these bobble head Beatles in downtown SF and my parents would n't let me look at them . As a kid and to this day I have a great memory for directions so I got up before my family and walked from Van Ness all the way down to the Financial district of S.F. only to find that the store was n't open for another 3 hours . I walked all the way back up post street to Van Ness and was back before anyone noticed me missing . Looking back 53 years later , I ca n't imagine how stupid that was , and how dangerous it would be today . As for the figures , I have n't taken them out of the packages yet but they 're great to have hanging on my office wall .
4 #### This is the best helicopter iv'e gotten , it is very stable . But , if it 's in wind it will lose control . I would recommend it for a beginner . It comes with a remote , spare parts , charger , and the helicopter . If the back blade strikes a wall and comes off you can easily repair it by hand . The foam on the landing gear helps with hard landings good . The flight time for me is 4 to 6 min . The charge time is less than an hour . It is a very good RC helicopter .
5 #### I like this tabbing wire as it is easy to use and it gets the job done when I connect wires or reconnect wires that break off their weld . I highly recommend as it is a great price and will do what you want it to do .
5 #### I received this action figure last week , and as I have said in other reviews , I love it . I took Captain Jack out of the box , as I have three action figures in the box . First of all , he is highly detailed , as are the others . He is easy to pose , and his pistol is removable . There is only one thing that is disappointing , and that is , it is NOT Johnny Depp 's voice . Although it is a very good likeness . I still do not know why Johnny 's voice or voice chip can not be in the action figure . Perhaps it is because of copyright issues , or that there is too much back round noise in the POTC movies . But , if that does n't disappoint you too much , then this action figure is a must . One last thing . He is a big action figure . I would not recommend this as a toy . He is quite heavy and bulky . I would imagine that playing with him is a chore . If children do n't care about how heavy he is , then that 's okay . I just collect them to look at and listen to .
5 #### For all the UNO lovers and the Hello Kitty lovers ... here is your chance to have them both !
5 #### If you love pirates , or Johnny Depp as " Jack Sparrow " , you are going to love this . When he talks it is the real Johnny , speaking lines directly from the movie . Everything is beautifully made , from the top of his leather hat , to his leather coat , leather weapon strap , leather belt , down to his leather boots , he is well crafted . He comes loaded with all his weapons(sword and pistol ) , his compass and of course , his bottle of rum . His hair and all his features are wonderfully crafted . His arms and head move , and there is a small switch , well hidden from sight on his back to turn his voice on and off . This is truly a great gift for all pirate lovers of all ages .
5 #### This is classic UNO with a Hello Kitty theme and is a must have for the Hello Kitty fan ! ! If you like UNO and have a little girl that loves Hello Kitty get this to enjoy hours of family fun .... my daughter spent about 3 hours playing Christmas day with all of our guests , and thenactually cleaned them all up by herself and put them in the " collectors item box . " Simply fun ! !
5 #### I am 26 years old now and still have my Battleship game . My brother and I used to play a lot when we were younger and it was a real exciting game of guessing , logic , locating things on a grid and using various strategies . The best part about this game is that you can fold it up into it 's two consoles and then take it on the road with you . We filled many hours in the backseat during roadtrips with this game . It is a pretty easy game to learn and to play which also helps to make it fun at the same time . I would definately recommend this game to anyone even if your child has no interest in ships at all . I did n't and I still do n't but the game is a classic .
5 #### I used to play this game with a pencil and paper , and it 's still a great game . Kids wo n't realise that they 're using strategy and concise logical problem solving , once they have played this a couple of times , and even for todays computer age , this is still very appealing and addictive . With it 's ease of set up , and robust design , it will provide hours and hours of inexpensive fun , and every succesive generation seem to love it ( I even bought one for myself ) . Great for younger kids too ( with a little help ) - and can help demonstrate many basic math puzzles , by making them fun . Oh by the way , the noises are great too !
4 #### Battleship is a classic game that I played for hours on end with my older sister and is just as fun as I remember from my childhood . The general game play revoles around both players placing thier " fleet " on a 10 x 10 grid and then taking turns bombarding the other players fleet , attempting to find and sink all of their ships . The pegs still fall all over the place if you bump the bins hard enough , which makes it important to still play on a stable surface . All in all a good " old school " , no batteries required , enjoyable game . Recommended !
4 #### My 6 year old loves this game , of course he does it 's battleship . Game is made more poorly than I recall ....
5 #### Battleship was one of my favorite games as a child . Now , my son is able to share in that experience . We just picked up the new Battleship game about a week ago , and he loves it ! I also like the changes that have been made to the game . For instance , when I was a child , the game was fairly basic . By that I mean that the containers were plain and there were n't many graphics to give the game a real " military " feel . Now , the game is much more realistic . The bottom part of the playing grid where the ships are placed has waves etched into the surface . In addition , the top part of the playing grid has the look of a submarine periscope . And , the game boxes themselves look like mini laptop computers . The ships included in the game have remained the same over the years ; a battleship , aircraft carrier , submarine , destroyer , and patrol boat . Each player takes turns " shooting " at the other player by calling out grid coordinates , such as B-3 or J-5 . This goes on until one player 's ships are sunk by the other player . This game has seen many versions over the years since I was a child , but it still remains one of my favorite games . I really enjoy playing against my son as he 's become quite good at it in a very short time . If you 're looking for a fun , action - packed game , then " Battleship " is a good choice .
5 #### This game is a super winner w / my teenage son ... and he was pre - teen when he received it ! Loves the secrecy and trying to figure out the strategy of the opposite player .
5 #### Among the classic board games that has become a part of American culture . A child is not a child unless he or she has played battleship . A training in search patterns and comprehension of results that are returned to you . Can you create a more effective and efficient search pattern then your peer . Can you create a ship target pattern that is harder to detect based on the strategy your peer uses . A great game .
5 #### Battleship is a classic game of search and destroy . Players take turns seeking out the placement of another player 's 5 ships hidden from their sight . The first player to sink their opponent 's armada gains the victory . Battleship plays in about 30 minutes . Even though there is a large random aspect to Battleship , the game is tremendously fun to play . The fun for most is trying to " hide " your ships , or place your ships in a unique way as to baffle your opponent . There are some nights where a good , intense strategy game is more fun to play , and there are some nights where you want a fun , yet less intense battle . Battleship is for these gaming nights . While some consider battleship " too random " , I find myself still enjoying the game after 30 years . Great for all ages . My 6 year old loves to play .
3 #### I do n't like this . It 's just finding other people 's ships . I mean , it 's just like the game of memory ! ! ! That game stinks . I do n't like this . ( Sorry if you like this game a lot )
4 #### This game is a classic and it really gets kids thinking about plotting the possibles and probables . They do n't even realise it 's educational as it 's such fun . The design makes it a perfect travel game . A great one to get out when the chorus of " are we there yet ? " , is driving you crazy and playing " eye spy " is making everyone loose the will to live rapidly ! I even get away with playing my knid of music without the children moaning or noticing !
5 #### This game is pretty fun , you do n't have to think too much and the instructions are easy enough as well . I do agree with the one reviewer who saaid that the pegs can be horrible if scattered everywhere . What we do is keep them in seperate plastic bags , and unwrap them before the game starts . It 's a little bit more time - consuming , but that way it keeps them from winding up in a kid or pet 's mouth .
5 #### I loved this game as a kid and recently got back into it when I started playing online . So for Christmas last year it was one thing I asked for . I love it ! Although it can be a quick game sometimes it can take forever ! J but once you get going you can usually figure out which direction to go . I like to play this game with the family - even though it is for only two people we usually can find ways for everyone to play or my mom and I or sister and I will play . But , we all thoroughly enjoy it ! I would recommend this for anyone who likes board games young or old . As this is one you will have a blast with .
4 #### Can you sink your opponent 's ships ? Battleship is easy and hard at the same time . The easy part is guessing where your opponent has placed their ships ; all it requires is your voice ! The hard part is figuring out a successful strategy that will win you the game ... my strategy is to guess every other square , since none of the boats are only one square long . Keeping track of where you have guessed is fun , for some reason . Possibly because I enjoy being organized . The red and white pegs can easily be spilled or lost , so I recommend being careful when using them . Overall , this is a great game ! I recommend it to people who enjoy fun board games that require good strategies .
5 #### Battleship 's timeless appeal makes it a favorite for kids AND adults . Its easy transportability makes it perfect for long car or plane trips , the beach , long waits at the doctor 's office - anyplace you want to take it . Highly recommend
3 #### I remember playing this as a kid and it was fun then , but I do n't think all in all it 's got the classic pure gaming kind of thing going for it . Too much of it is blind luck , unless you consider the ability to outguess your opponents ability to place his ships in some confusing fashion a skill . Not at all like Risk or Stratego , this is n't really a battle game at all , it 's just a random guessing game . Still , it has some enjoyment factor with the younger set and it 's a good child / adult game in that it does n't take much skill to play and the luck factor can give a kid the victory . There is some logic in how you place your ships and some logic in how to attack , so I do give the game an average rating , it can be fun to play .
5 #### My 6 year - old son picked up the rules for this game in less than 5 minutes , but continues to develop his strategy every time we play . It is simultaneously easy and complex , and a great way to get kids to employ reason and logic , while having fun . At the same time , there is a good deal of luck involved , too , making it unpredictable and fun . It is a great way to get kids away from the TV so you can spend some quality time together . I only awarded 4 stars for durability because small pieces are easily lost , as with any similar game , and the plastic casing and hinges can be broken rather easily .
4 #### No issues with quality of this , I did n't find it flimsy or cheap . Yes the color will come off if you scratch it , it 's just paint on a metal surface so this is sort of expected . The only negative I see is this thing is really , really small .
5 #### Bought this to make a ukulele for a friend . The lid did n't line up . But I made it work .
4 #### The kids really like it , but I realized after I bought it that there are only 3 slots for paper money , meaning that some denominations need to be doubled up . But , the kids ( 2 , 6 & 8) really like it and that 's what matters
5 #### Purchased for our granddaughter . She is nine years old but is struggling to learn . We wanted something fun that would keep her interested plus help her to learn as well . It is a nicely made cash register . The money looks like the real money so that is helpful . The cash register is a calculator too . Our granddaughter likes that but I would rather she try to add in her head . That is something we are trying to teach her to do . I had read in the reviews that the drawer comes out rather fast . It does . But since I knew about it previous to purchasing I let our granddaughter know in advance and so we do n't have any problems .
5 #### This was spoked to be a birthday gift for my grandson , but he saw package , got super excited and I as a softie gave it to him early ( his birthday is n't until Nov25 ) . He totally loves it . He carries his hot wheel cars in it everywhere he goes .
5 #### Exactly what I expected . Good size . Looks great . Again , I have n't actually opened it yet as it 's for my almost 5 year old daughters birthday .
3 #### Cute and my toddler loves putting her crayons in it ... but very , very flimsy . Definitely not for using as a real lunch box !
3 #### Cute thing and my son loves it , but it is n't very sturdy . One of my son 's friends accidentally fell on the lunchbox while in the lunch room and completely smooshed it . The friend is a 5 year old girl and pretty petite . We were able to hammer it out so that it still works , but you can definitely still see that it was damaged .
5 #### Made my wife the most popular and interesting person at work . Excellent .
3 #### Lid arrived bent . It was for a birthday and time sensitive , and can be closed with effort , but I was a little sad about it .
5 #### My daughter loves toting around her Curious George tin box packed with her favorite toys . I always have to open it for her because her little hands are n't yet strong enough to flip the latch . It is very sturdy and takes a lot of abuse from a two - year old swinging it around !
4 #### Nice product . My grandson carries his snacks in it .
5 #### 3 Year old loves it and plays with it nonstop . The credit card is fun .
4 #### I planned to keep this for myself , but my grandson is in the " George " stage and his mini cars can be proudly carried around in this lunchbox .
3 #### We love these metal cases , but this one lasted the shortest of any . Lock broke so we had to trash it within weeks . It looked good on the birthday party table though .
4 #### My two year old likes this but I have to operate the latch for him . Also it was a little wonky when opened . Appears square when shut but not when opened
5 #### I got this so I am able to carry snacks on the weekends . We are never home so when I saw this I had to get this . First our toddler loves curious George and second it was just darling . Item looked just like picture . Best part so easy to clean with just a wipe . It 's perfect in size not too big or small . Perfect for on the go .
5 #### great present for son or daughter . It makes a nice keepsake box . My son carries it in the house with his little toys in there .
5 #### This lunchbox is well - made and unique ! How often do you find a Curious George lunchbox ! A great addition to my collection of lunchboxes which I actually use too !
4 #### The metal is a little more thin than I imagined but it is cute . Easily bendable , it can become hard to close , but it can be bent back into position .
1 #### I was excited to get this for my daughter who loves Curious George , but it 's a very flimsy and small lunch box that is n't big enough to hold a substantial lunch , and the metal easily warps . It seems to be meant for display only , and could carry snacks , but does n't hold up to being brought back and forth from school every day and holding a square meal for lunch . Very disappointed !
3 #### were expecting . 1st off let me say this , it 's made in China . It 's smaller than your average lunch box and has no lil ' drink bottle inside either . Also the latch is plastic and although it 's holding i 've got my doubts as to it 's longevity for my grandson . The box itself is however tin and although i like that it 's metal , it 's unbelievable thing metal and poorly hinged with simple folded over tangs or flaps as i 'd call em that link it to the other and that 's for sure not all that secure . As for the pro 's or positives to this lil ' box , it 's Curious George and all kids love or loved his cute lil ' monkey shennanigans at some point and time . The artwork is pretty well done and seemingly durable thus far . The price of course was a plus and sadly i 'm realizing that we 've got what we 've paid for ...
4 #### I like it , but the material it was made can bend easily . My son love it it match with his collection .
2 #### While this is a cute tin box ( and I used it to hold mini - muffins at at baby shower ) , it is n't meant to be used . Would look cute as a decoration in a baby 's room or to hold all those crayon 's for an older child .
5 #### My son is a huge Curious George fan and one of his favorite stories is the one where Curious George Rides a Bike . So , it could n't be a better lunch box for him . He loves it !
1 #### Cheap junk . I expected standard metal lunchbox quality . This is a very thin metal , with a latch that is no match for any child . Ours now holds medicine and bandaids , since it is useless for children .
4 #### Daughter ( 4 ) is a huge Curious George fan so she enjoys carrying this around with " goodies " inside . Strong and cute . Might have to purchase the Curious George jack - in - a - box next .
5 #### Got this for my daughter for Christmas ( 2 year old ) and she loves it . She 's at the age where putting things in to boxes and taking them out can occupy her for some time . She loves putting little treasures in here and taking them all over the place . The size of the box is like that of a metal lunch box . Big enough for a toddler . We have n't had any problems with it and it is quite durable for a play date .
3 #### It 's a cute lunchbox . The figures are actually pushed out of the tin ( like 3D ) and it looks really cute . My 18 month old loves George and he likes it a lot carrying it around the house . It is pretty flimsy and cheaply made , I was hoping for something a bit sturdier but for the price .. not bad .
5 #### Very nice . Great quality . My 7 year Granddaughter plays restaurant and store . Its a really cute cash register and play money
5 #### My daughter loved it and its awesome because she is learning to count money the proper way while having fun !
2 #### Cheaply made . I could probably get one just like this on a claw machine for $ 1 .
5 #### Grandkids absolutely love this . The 4 of them were fighting over who gets to have it next .
5 #### my son wanted one of these and he absolutely loves using it to learn about money . Its a great way to help children understand how money works and ofers them a tool to use for play stores . Has a credit card swipe and pop out cach drawer , Solar led display . Durable and easy to store . Highly recommend !
5 #### This is by far the best cash register ! I bought for my 6 year old and have gifted to others . Looks like real money- great to teach money but most important its an awesome play toy !
5 #### Grand kids love these for playing library and restaurant .
5 #### Ordered it for an office event , good quality doll .
5 #### I love Dilberts Boss , he makes me laugh in the comics with his sarcasm and " charm " and the way he kind of turns a blind eye to Dilberts . This little stuffed figurine is great and sits on my desk when I am working so I can smile . He is well made with no ripping at the seams and he is soft . My daughter even liked the way his feet danced when she played with him . I think this a great gift for a boss or a co - worker who can relate to the daily office grind , plus the price is great too . Overall I really like my Dilbert 's Boss figure and I have nothing negative to add . He 's great ! I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review . I was not paid for this review , this is exactly the way I feel about this item after using it .
5 #### I love the Dilbert comics , and one of my favorites is the pointy - haired boss . So I could n't resist ordering this one . I find it to be well made , with great detailing . The best thing about this doll is that it pretty much captures the comic . The boss has a slightly bemused look on his face . Other details are nice , with separately sewn shoes , tie , shirt , pants , and coat . The coat in particular is very good - it actually has an opening that runs around to each side , just like a real coat when worn open . The overall look is n't that realistic - this is after all , a comic character - but it comes together well . I will be putting this up on my monitor next to my Dogbert . Construction is all polyester except for the two beady eyes , which are plastic . This is manufactured in China . Summary : A must for those who work with a " pointy eared boss " , or a good gift if you know someone who does . Highly recommended . Please note that I received this at a discounted price , so I could review it .
5 #### Ah , Dilbert . The 90s newspaper cartoon character we all fell in love with and look forward to reading about in the Sunday paper . Now you can take Dilbert with you wherever you go ! This doll measures about 15 inches tall and is very nicely put together . The manufacture paid attention to every detail of this character , even down to his tie that always sticks out ! The body is made out of a soft material , like a stuffed animal , while the head is made like a soft squeezable plastic or rubber . This figure would be perfect to add some humor to any office environment , given Dilbert IS workplace based comedy . Whether you keep him nonchalantly on a book shelf for motivation , or give him to your boss as a gift , this doll will be a huge hit with any Dilbert fan ! I received this product at a discounted rate to test in exchange for an honest review . As someone who uses customer reviews to guide my own purchases , I take reviewing products seriously . Please know that my rating of this product was in no way biased . I will be more than happy to try to answer any questions you may have about this product !
5 #### Very nice toy . Kids love playing with the pretend money . I would highly recommend this toy . I bought this for 3 yr old twins .
5 #### This is great-- this was a gift for our 2.5 yr old daughter for Christmas to teach her about money ( the various coins and such ) . She likes using this after she takes her shopping cart around the living room and picks her Melissa and Doug groceries .
5 #### Great for my 7 and 8 year olds when helping them with counting money . Has been a helpful tool .
4 #### I 'm glad I found this card game , we 've loved playing it . As a classic game or is fun to pay with or friends and it is a easy to learn game to pay with another couple .
5 #### keeps the dice from flying off the table .... which the kids love to do intentionally ... lol
5 #### My kids grew up with this game and we still play it now and then as adults . It 's a simple game that both adults and kids can enjoy and lay with one another without the adults having any big advantage -- they may or may not use better strategy ! It 's simple to learn too , so anyone can join in and play competently by the second round . Just in case you really are n't familiar with it --- Each player has a score sheet with a list of combinations of dice that need to be achieved . These are things like full - house , short straight , large straight , four - of - a - kind -- you probably get the idea . On each turn you get three rolls , and you can save some dice and re - roll others . After the 3rd roll you have to put a score in a box , or a zero in a box . The idea is to get the highest score . Five of a kind is a YAHTZEE . There are a couple of different versions of score sheets , as well as an electric one - player version . It is very similar to ' 5 Roll ' .
5 #### I never played this game as a kid , but did watch others play it . We 're an avid card playing family so I thought I 'd get it to see what it was all about . And it 's a great game that the whole family can enjoy . While you do have to score 1000 points to win , the play is so different form other card games that you certainly wo n't feel as though you 're playing a rehash of another game . In fact , you 'll want to play this game over and over . In the educational arena , if stategy is n't enough , you also use mental addition to add 25s , 50s , 75s , and 100s . The first time you read the directions and play it can be a bit confusing , but get through the first game , you 'll catch on quickly and soon become a fan .
4 #### I got YD ( for short ) in the mid 2000s . Back then , you got the gold dice with white dots . From what I 've read , they now have reddish or pink dice , which I would hate . The tray and padded cup add to stepping up the Yahtzee experience . You also get eight chips that you get for scoring more than one Yahtzee . I usually just give them to players if they get any Yahtzee at all . The rules of the basic game remain the same . This deluxe edition will give you a classier and less noisy Yahtzee experience . But if you want the gold dice like I have , try to get editions that were put out in the early to mid 2000s .
5 #### The plastic frame that upgrades this to " deluxe " is n't really necessary or well - made , but otherwise , no complaints at all . Love Yahtzee ! It 's fun for kids from 9 to 99 !
5 #### I have owned this game for as long as I can remember . I have an old set , so I ca n't comment on the durability of the new set . However , I have spent many an hour playing this game and it stands the test of time . It 's fun , competitive , and teaches a few French phrases . It 's easy to learn and fun to play with one or more other players . A winner !
5 #### I recently purchased two Mille Bornes Card Games for the Learning Center where I am employed . ( We have Middle School youth after school for about three hours . ) I am always looking for activities that are both fun and educational for them and these game have become a big hit ! The underlying Math concepts make the game a good mental challenge for them . I had played the game back in the early 70 's and it was as fun as I remembered ... THANKS !
4 #### Lots of fun to play , & you practice your numbers in French while you 're at it .
5 #### I 've always had fun playing this card game as a kid . Children / adults learning French will like it too .
5 #### I think I liked this more than my daughters ; it brought back so many wonderful memories of my own childhood . My girls ( ages 4 and 5 ) got to practice their counting , and can follow the rules pretty easily . The only thing they ca n't seem to catch onto , is thinking ahead and counting out their other " pegs " to see if they can send another players pegs back " home . " So , I have to lay back sometimes and miss my chance to send them home , too ... cause when I was winning all the time , they did n't want to play with me anymore ! Overall a lot of fun , educational enough to help with counting , and the only downside is the little pegs can get lost ... and their is not replacement package , so you 'd have to buy a new game , or make your own peg . We are missing one peg , even though we always put it back in the box ... we somehow lost one peg . So , we keep our players to three , instead of four . Put those pieces in a ziploc bag and you should be fine , as it does n't have quite as many little pieces as most games .
4 #### We bought Hi - Ho Cherry - o and Trouble for my son 's 4th birthday , and while he enjoys both , Trouble is more fun for the adults to play . My son is old enough to push the pop - o - matic as long as he 's perched high enough on his chair . He 's been fantastic about waiting for his turn , and counting out the spaces . In fact , I thought he 'd get mad that he could n't go around the board until he got a " 6 " but he was amazingly patient ! ( Keep in mind a player could miss out on the ENTIRE game if they never roll a six . ) I 'm glad we bought it .
5 #### " I sat hunkered over the board . Five years old , and a " Trouble " champion . My brother stared me down . At eight years old , he knew how to intimidate . My glass of chocolate milk quivered in my nervous hands ... " --me ... circa 1971 or 1972 The sheer delight of a simple game will be satisfying as you see your children pop on the plastic bubble to ' toss the dice . ' And you 'll smile as you know those dice wo n't be easily lost . Milton Bradley were smart to use such a creative device without losing an ounce of fun . Easy to learn , keeps a child 's attention , and just plain good ' ol fun . My brother usually beat me . But I went at the game as intensely as Michael Jordan plays basketball . I fully recommend " Trouble . " Anthony Trendl
5 #### I used to play this game as a kid and it was just how I remembered it . Love it and in good condition .
5 #### This was a gift , quality was as expected and the recipient liked it .
5 #### My family plays this at least once a week , and we all still love each other , so there you go ! ! Great classic game :-)
5 #### Great product . My youngest grandson ( 3 ) loves to play with this at my home and I decided to get this for him . My older grandson ( 8) likes to play and do math for school on his cash register . Real calculator . Money looks fairly close to real money , so he can identify the coins and bills . Great hands - on resource .
5 #### This is as close to the " old " version of the Trouble game as you can get by purchasing new . It is heavier duty than the cheaper version . The little pegs are fully formed and not just partial making it more fun to play . It is hard to describe the ways in which this game board feels better than the newer , flimsier one currently for sale at most places . If you have played trouble with the older version of the game you expect a little bit of substance and weight to the game board . If that is the case I suggest that you buy this one and not the less expensive one which really has a cheaper fell to it . This one is nicer and sturdier . We play this as a family often and the slightly sturdier board just feels better to the touch .
5 #### Yes even though this is a very simplified version of the old classic- it held up ( and it still working ) after my 11 yr old Daughter and Husband played it for HOURS together on Xmas ! They love playing and get super competitive and POUND on that middle thing and its still working . haha .
5 #### love it play it all the time with my grand children
5 #### I bought this for my sons so we could do a family game night . They both enjoy it a lot and it is easy enough for my four year old to play . It came in perfect condition with all of its pieces .
5 #### Good present to the kids star know about spend money
5 #### Good fun game . Get ready to use your brain .
3 #### It 's a shame how cheaply these games are made now . I expect the dice popper to crack before it 's a year old as well as the game board . The game board is too light weight and the thin plastic pegs easily fall out of the spaces .
2 #### This is just a peice of plastic that you pop onto a piece of cardboard . Not the quality of the game I had as a kid . Junk .
5 #### Had to replace a broken one . Still play this game , still love it ! ! ! This one is my favorite version and the only one I will buy .
1 #### This is such a cheap version of what I had growing up . The board is just a piece of cardboard snapped in to the back of the plastic top . The bubble to pop seems like its going to get stuck every time . I would not purchase again .
2 #### Classic game .... however the " push " part is SO STIFF that neither me or my 5 year old granddaughter can push it down to pop the dice . Very disappointed .
4 #### We really wanted the original game and glad we found it . The bubble is pretty hard to push for our seven year old . Hopefully , that will get better with use .
5 #### Classic game of Trouble that I grew up playing . Glad to be able to share it with my children .
4 #### We love playing games a family . Both my husband and I grew up playing by different rules . The games official rules say you ay only take a from your start when rolling a six . This made the game too long for our young ( 5,4 and 2 yr . old 's ) children . It 's a classic game and great for the whole family . Overall it 's a great game , we just had to alter the rules for our youngsters to stay engaged .
5 #### Comes with tons of play paper and coin money . Keypad is essentially a solar 4 function calculator with an open button for the drawer . Works great .
5 #### My daughter played this game over an hr ! She loves it more than I thought she would :)
5 #### The kids love playing the game . It is a fun game as well as educational .
3 #### Wished it made noise when you press the buttons and if it came with a scanner but overall it 's great for kids to learn about money !
5 #### My kids were excited ... the only complaint i have is that the drawer is a little forceful when it opens , so sometimes coins come flying out when it opens . Kids love it though .
5 #### This was the BEST gift for our almost-3 year old . He LOVES it and I 'm thankful it will serve as a powerful resource for learning about money and numbers and counting in the years to come . Currently he loves to play " Chick - fil - A " and take our orders and tell us how much it costs . We then give him our money ( or the debit card ) and he puts it in the cash register . This is literally his favorite toy right now and I know it will last a long time because of the high quality . Learning Resources offers such wonderful , educational toys .
5 #### My 5 yr old has been asking for this all year . We finally got it for him and he loves it ! ! ! !
5 #### My girls loved the junior version of this game and now they love the regular version of this game . They play it all the time . They enjoy the challenge and find it fun . I know it is like brain food for their minds , contemplating patterns and strategy to help the car escape . This game is probably equally good for seniors trying to keep the brain sharp and stave off dementia . This was a great Christmas gift and was reported to friends and relatives as possibly the favorite of all the Christmas gifts this year . ( Of course , to be fair , our children are accustomed to a diet of books , brain games , music , socks , nightgowns and other * boring * things for Christmas . ) Nevertheless , this item is a hit for all kids who come to our house and I highly recommend this game . For entertainment or education !
3 #### Board is flimsy . I am disappointed with this product . I thought it would be sturdier .
4 #### An affordable version of the classic game , but you get what you pay for - the board is a little flimsier than I expected . Everything works well , but I did n't expect a thin cardboard layer I 'd have to attach myself . I hope the little rubber feet do n't fall out .
5 #### Got this game for my son for Christmas . We played It couple times a ready today . This used to be one if my favorite board games when I was little . My 5 year old was plying as well with my 7 year old , but my 5 year old lost interest after a while . Move that the dice is attached to the board , so you wo n't loose it . It 's pretty easy and simple game .
5 #### Fun board game for the whole family ! We play it a lot
5 #### My 7yr old son received this for Christmas - but my husband got hooked on it first .... and then our 5yr old .... so it 's been a great family game . It 's small enough to pack in my messenger bag and whip out at restaurants , etc when we have time to kill . Very fun , challenging , and addicting ! !
5 #### We all played this game for hours while at a friend 's house on vacation , so had to get it for our own coffee table . It 's great that it has so many cards to work out ... it will take a long time to conquer this one ! Super fun !
5 #### Bought for my 8 year old but mom and dad have fun playing too !
5 #### I bought this game to add to our homeschool classroom . I felt we were missing something . I have 2 boys on the autism spectrum . How do I teach patience , to try something new , to accept failure and try again ? What do I do about fear of failing ? What do I do with a perfectionist who is afraid to try ? How do I teach to master something takes much trial and error ? How do I teach to lengthen attention span ? This series of games does just that . The games starts very simple and to master it takes lots of practice and many mistakes . We had many meltdowns in the beginning . The games teach you to think a certain way and starting at the beginning and working your way through you start to figure it out . The games for us just did n't entertain they helped me teach valuable life skills . We own so many of this companies games for this very reason . Each game has its own unique thinking skill niche . My favorite thing it teaches after we finish each series I ask was it hard ? The answer is always yes . Then I follow up were you able to do it ? My kids are learning that doing things that are hard is possible with patience . I thank Think Fun for this skill and their wonderful games .
5 #### We had this for YEARS and REALLY loved it ! ! ! If you want a great toy cash register , do n't hesitate to order this one today ! And , believe me , you 're children wo n't be the ONLY ONES playing with it ! ! ! We actually borrowed this from our children to use during our yardsale . It worked fabulous ! ! ! Need to use real money for yardsales though . Haha ! What are you waiting for ? ? ? If you want the best cash resister for your children , order this one . You will NOT regret it ! ! ! :-)
3 #### Kid did not play with it much . some learning toys are just for parents to feel good about buying educational stuff for their kids .
4 #### The drawer opens with so much force , and the coins fly out ! Its not exactly a Ca Ching sound , but a clanging banging sound . Plus the drawer does nt open far enough for little hands to remove the bills easily . When first powered on , nothing worked , so checked the battery , took out , put back in and tightened the battery cover . Then it seemed to work ok . Where do we find these batteries ? Not easily found . Could nt give 5 stars because of the way the drawer opens with force where the coins fly out , and the Ca Ching sound is n't really there ... more like a banging clanging sound .
5 #### 9 year old granddaughter loves anything to do with math . This was a very good choice . She plays with it for hours and her dad finds it fun to play along as well .
5 #### 20 Years later and I am still buying the same product . Kids have hours of fun ! I highly recommend it !
5 #### My kids love the game and I love the storage bag that keeps it all together
3 #### Game is the same as my childhood . The quality of the board SUCKS .
5 #### A classic ! Every home with children needs to have this game . There is n't much I can say that has n't already been said . Great deal and find on Amazon !
4 #### Works like it is supposed to but is a little cheaper than I thought it would be . The bottom of the game is not covered in plastic so the cardboard that makes up the inside and colored part of the game is open to everything , which could cause problems . For example , if you were to accidently set the game down on some water the cardboard would absorb the water and ruin the game . So while you get everything you need and all the pieces work fine , it is ultimately cheaper than I had expected it to be .
5 #### Who does n't love trouble ? A big place for this game , as a parent of small children , is that the dice is encased in the dice popper . This means no diving under the table to grab dice that are flying everywhere , no grabbing for dice from the next small person in line , no losing the dice . It 's a simple , fun and easy game for families to play together . Even young kids ( 4 + ) can play on their own , and parents can enjoy it as well .
5 #### kids like trouble . then give them trouble . do nt make them cry though
4 #### This game is for the next future student of the month . I know they will learn from the challenges . I might have to get this for myself .
4 #### This game spared me from hours and hours of boredom at my mom 's workplace . It 's a good game for those who enjoy thinking alone .
5 #### This game is great for kids and adults of all ages . I had the original one and passed that one along and got the updated version which is identical but now comes with a bag to put all the vehicles in which just made it even better in my opinion . Great problem solving game and fun for everyone ! !
5 #### We have dozens of games in our house , but this one is a favorite . My 6 year - old son picked up the rules in about 5 minutes , but continues to develop his strategy every time we play . It is simultaneously simple and complex , and a great way to get kids to employ reason and logic , while having fun . This is now one of his two favorite games ( the other being Othello , which I also highly recommend ) . We play it often , and it is a great way to get him away from the TV so we can spend some quality time together . Sometimes I win ! I only awarded 4 stars for durability because small pieces are easily lost , as with any similar game .
5 #### We recently started playing this game and my 5 year old loves it . It is a simple game and one through which one can learn a lot . We played with an older set until recently when we bought the new design ( featured on this page ) . I have several complaints about this new and improved design : It has a storage compartment , but it is not so well designed . With only half of the pieces in the storage compartment , its lid takes a while to close . The key pegs fit too tightly into the holes and the pegs are harder to put in and take out than the older ( and more simple and plain ) set . But , this set does come with over 100 pegs , which is very convenient . Despite my complaints , this game is worth getting for what one gets out of it : it is not just fun -- it is an intelligent game of logic and deductive reasoning .
4 #### Mastermind is an easy - to - play mystery peg game . One player places pegs of given colors in a secret " compartment " , while the other tries to guess it . They get clues after each guess ; the other player reveals how many were the right color and how many were also in the right spot . It 's a little tricky at first , and if the person who sets the pattern makes a mistake , it can be frustrating . This is limited as a family game because it only involves two players . Ultimately , this is best for two people who enjoy mind problems .
2 #### Just basically a calculator with a drawer that opens
5 #### This was one of the Christmas presents I gave my daughter and she was hooked on it . It makes noise but not in any annoying sense . Very mild noise and think this is one of the best gifts to give kids ages 4 to 6 if you 're truly teaching them how to count and add with decimals .
2 #### not like the sturdy game of old , very flimsy
5 #### Bought this game as a birthday gift for my nephew . This game has always been a family favorite of ours . A great change from video games .
5 #### Granddaughter loved it - bought this and several other games when they we re the deal of the day . Same game I remember as a child .
4 #### 5 almost 6 year old likes to play this game .
4 #### Kids really like playing this game . Only good for about an hour , then they are bored with it .
5 #### Favorite game for the family ! Perfect for ages 4 - 6
5 #### My kids are 6 and 10 and they both LOVE this game . Even I enjoy it . My 10 - year - old 's occupational therapist introduced us to it as a way to help her learn to overcome frustration and solve puzzles . It has been a wild success . Both of my girls will sit and stare at the pieces and move them around and move them back until they get the solution . Particularly nice in my opinion is that the solutions are on the back of the cards , so if you do get really stumped , you can look at the answer . In our house , if you look at the answer , you have to start over and figure it out on your own after solving with the answer . I 've found it helps with memory and perseverance . I highly recommend this game for kids and adults . There are three expansion packs you can also buy and you probably will need them as your kids will breeze through the first forty cards if they 're anything like mine .
5 #### My 6 year twins are really enjoying this game . I love that it is a solo player . Comes in a cute travel bag too .
5 #### This is amazing ! It is a birthday gift . I tested it out and I know for sure my kiddo with absolutely love this .
5 #### This is an excellent cash register ! ! It is n't a small piece of junk like most . The money that comes with it is life sized and very realistic also . My daughter loves it ! We wanted a larger cash register for her and we could n't find any until this one . It is a lot bigger so older kids can play with it also !
4 #### Got rid of a competitors as my 5 year old noticed that it would only add single digits and did not mult and divide correctly . This should be fun to use as she is always selling something at home . Will deal with the drawer issue over making sure the math works
5 #### Great gift for my children 4- 10 years . More geared to my younger kids . Calculator is a nice addition . Glad it came with the money .
5 #### I gave this as a Christmas gift to a 6yr . old girl . We played it right away and it was a lot of fun .
5 #### Classic movie . Always a favorite with kids ( my daughter 's 6 and she wants to play all the time ) .
4 #### This game is trouble ( see what I did there ) the bubble is pretty stiff , I hope it loosens up the more we play . My 3 year old can not depress it on her own .
5 #### I played " Mindtrap " for the first time last weekend . What a mind - bending blast ! The game includes a set of cards with different situations that include problems to solve , situations to figure out , and questions to ponder . You ( and any number of partners ) have the chance to come up with your best shot at providing an answer to questions in an effort to beat the opposing team . There is a movement in education that promotes the development of something called " critical thinking . " This game is an excellent source of examples of critical thinking exercises . Here are a few to try on for size : " A moonshiner always gets his grain from the same supplier . After the moonshine is done he gives 10 % of the stuff to his grain supplier . At the end of one such exchange the moonshiner ended up with exactly 1 liter of moonshine . How much did the grain supplier get ? " Here 's another one to ponder ... " How many months have 28 days ? " After an evening with this game you will readily admit that things are not always as they appear to be . There 's a whole box of these kinds of engaging questions . If you enjoy a good brain - cramp , this game is definitely for you . Top - notch interactive entertainment for adults and teens . 5 stars ! Alan Holyoak
5 #### just as cute in person as in the picture .... She is going to love it .... Another grandma hit .... yahoo ....
5 #### A year later , this cash register still works and has held up to constant play by 5 kids . While some of the money has been lost along the way , the coins and bills they still have are in great condition . Would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a cash register for their kids .
5 #### What a fun game ! It was worth it to pay extra for this one that comes with the bag for it , as well as the drawer underneath to hold the cards .
5 #### Fun ! Fun ! Fun ! Game we played this game Christmas Day my 5 year old granddaughter learned it so fast , it was so much fun .
3 #### It works but is cheaply made . Not like the originals . When u pop dice all the pegs pop out . They do n't fit snug like they used to . Definitely bummed by this buy ...
4 #### This is such a fun game . The entire family loves it ! It really gives our girl 's mind a good workout .
5 #### Fun game for everyone in our family . Our youngest is 6 and plays the game as does our 13 year old . The adults in the house play , too . It has various levels of play so everyone can be challenged .
5 #### My 8 - year old loves this game . Cheaper here than buying at Walmart . A little flimsy , but it plays the same .
2 #### Flimsy game , with an unprotected cardboard top that easily tears and wrinkles . The old game was much more durable , though my kids liked some of the new twists in this version .
4 #### All of the pieces do not fit in the container .
5 #### It 's nice to find a game that does n't require any technology but yet captivates kids ' attention . Among all the purchases for an under 10 year old group , this seemed to be the most popular . They also find ways to complicate the codes and have a blast playing it . All pieces of this game is well - made and I will be purchasing more for other little ones in the future . Great toy for snowed in days !
1 #### Seriously ? I remember seeing Mindtrap in stores when I was younger , and always wanting to get it because of the cool art . I bought this game at a garage sale for a few bucks , and thank goodness I did . The questions on these cards fall into one of three categories : so easy it 's silly , so ridiculous that there 's no way you could get the single right answer that is printed on the back of the card , or silly math involving oddball fractional answers . I guess if you were to play this game alone , it might make for a few good logic questions , but otherwise , it 's no fun whatsoever .
4 #### Such a good game . Played this as a child and loved it . And now I play it with my daughter . Really gets you thinking .
5 #### This game is not a conventional trivia game . Like most board games , you advance around the board while answering questions requiring you to think critically . Some people term this method of analysis as ' lateral thinking ' . The answers to some questions may or may not be entirely obvious to you . Some questions require step by step logic , others require higher order thinking , others require truth value logic . You will be surprised at your abilities ( or lack thereof , of your opponents ) and you will be entertained . This game will be favored by those with the ability for abstract thinking versus concrete thinking . I personally like to read the questions and answer them myself . To have an alternative pathway of thinking , makes you a more effective problem solver - in your daily activities , your work and in life .
5 #### Love this game , and it came right on time
5 #### This is a fun and progressively challenging solitary game for my five year old son . He says , " It 's great ! "
5 #### Fun way to play the game with kids ( or by yourself ) . Yes , now many apps like this but sometimes just fun to have something physical to hold and interact with your child while playing and solving together . Comes with a travel bag too , so very handy to take with you or just store .
2 #### As with most games , the new generation has build quality problems which distract from gameplay .
5 #### Great classic game from my childhood that my kids also love !
1 #### This is such a piece of junk ! I ca n't believe Hasbro would make something so inferior ! Thin plastic barely sits flat . Cheap paper graphics that sits under plastic . The bubble is smaller than original and the dice can barely tumble around . Box is thin like cereal box . A disposable game that wo n't last long . I wish people would return just to get the point across !
4 #### Nice but the round plastic the dice is in already has a crack during the first use .
5 #### Bought as a gift and the person loved it and played nonstop on Christmas
5 #### This was one of my favorite games when I was younger . It really taught me the process of logical deductive reasoning . That turned into a love for logic puzzles and helping me breeze through college logic class . Finally , a career in computer programming . Doing what you love is the best .
2 #### I really like this game . Its a great way to teach logic . This version of Mastermind could be much improved . The tray is not large enough to store all of the pegs . The piece that covers the secret code is just in the way . The tiny red and white pieces that you use to signal whether the player has guessed the correct color or placement of the pegs must be placed into tiny holes in a strange square configuration . My elderly dad has trouble getting those pieces into the holes due to his eyesight . I can think of a much better way to design this game .
5 #### This is the most fantastic collection of riddles ever assembled . I 'm not sure if I 've ever played the game as such - which , basically , when you answer one correctly , you move a piece around the board . I usually just read them with my friends , often while drinking , to have some fun . You meet a great cast of characters - Shadow , Sid Shady , Sam Sham - who are routinely getting killed in bizarre ways , then returning to life in the next card . HIGHLY recommended for people who like riddles .
5 #### Easy to use and fun for grandchildren ! 5 yr . old !
5 #### This is a fun brainteaser , and guess what - it does n't take batteries ! I also like the handy little bag it can travel in .
5 #### great and challenging game . small enough to take with you without taking up any space .
5 #### Fun entertaining game for the family and friends . Very challenging , my husband is a Mr. know it all and said he could start off on expert and beat the Rush Hour lol , well after 35 minutes he quit lol . We love this game !
3 #### I love the game . I played it as a child so many years ago . Now I 've taught my 8 - year - old and she loves it . The plastic pieces and box it comes in though are cheap crap . I ended up dumping all the pieces into small zipper - seal baggies because the onboard storage solution just sucks . It does n't contain anything properly and the pieces are all falling out loosely into the box . Which , by the way , has a plastic window in it . So you ca n't really stack this with the rest of your games . But hey , if you need Mastermind to scratch that itch , this is what you get . A necessary evil , one could say .
4 #### I expected that the " cars " would be able to " drive " around , instead of having to pick each one up and place it where I want to put it . I 'm kind of disappointed at that . I do n't even think it would be possible to make it that way , to be honest !
5 #### This game is so fun ! It 's just like the cellphone game Unblock Me , but a real game . It comes with a little mesh bag , has a special secure compartment for the cards , and fits easily on a lap so it 's a great travel game .
5 #### A great game for the kids to play solo . Have bought many as gifts .
5 #### Just a classic game that , IMO , every kid should have . It teaches logic skills and spatial reasoning . It also scales up as you grow up to do harder and harder puzzles . I used to play this growing up all the time , and then I bought one for my 6 - year old daughter , and she 's playing it all the time as well now . The fact that it 's all self - contained too ( the cards fit nicely underneath the puzzle ) is just an added bonus . I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a kids near the age of 5 who 's ready to do some solo logic puzzles .
5 #### could not do better . Its perfect and fun for all of us
5 #### Kids love and play using for many imagination games . Many ages use and enjoy
5 #### I really like this cash register . My daughter had been wanting one for a long time so I searched out many options and some were super fancy with many different functions , but I love the simplicity of this . My daughter does n't yet understand the differences in currency so this will be a toy we can grow with , but she has learned that items cost money and has practiced counting and identifying numbers . She has it set up near her play kitchen for playing restaurant and she loves the credit card that comes with it .
1 #### This arrived twice with a bad drawer . Waste of money .
4 #### Its cute . Money looks very real especially the coins . ONLY thing that is annoying is that when you hit the OPEN button the cash drawer slams outward and the money tends to fly out .
5 #### Nice old style trouble . I m so glad i was able to find the old one .
1 #### Be advised that this is not the classic one . You will receive the new version . There is a seller that does sell the classic version .
5 #### I bought this for my son , and my husband and I ended up enjoying a few challenges with it too . It can be surprisingly difficult to figure out the puzzles as you get to the more challenging levels . Great brain exercise game , good for traveling , good for quiet time , and I 'd say anyone film about ages 5 - 99 could enjoy this if you like a puzzle and challenge to solve . Love that it comes with a mesh storage bag to keep the pieces together .
5 #### Excellent strategy game . Adults & kids in our family love it . I did n't consider my 8 year old son 's colorblindness when I gave him the game , but vehicles are different enough that he can still play .
5 #### Fun game for one on one time with my kids . It uses brains to figure out how to solve the problem . Only problem is the design flaw of having too many spare peices without room to store it . ( We use a baggies to keep them from getting lost . )
5 #### I love this game , it is fun , teaches logic , and just enjoyable for the family .
5 #### This game was around when I was young and it 's still a blast to play . Kids LOVE the popper and the game is very easy to learn .
3 #### Disappointing that the cardboard bottom is n't up to par as the old sturdy version . The bubble is hard to pop for little children ( watched them play it & they had to use their body weight while pressing down with both hands ) . With the bottom as it is you have to make sure the board is on a hard surface or it will bend .
5 #### Great game . It keeps my daughter thinking . We have had it for a long time and she still enjoys playing with it regularly . I would highly recommend it .
5 #### Super addictive game . My kids ' friends come over , see it and start playing and do n't want to quit .
3 #### I have the original mastermind board and over the years it is missing some of the little pieces here and there . I decided it was time for an upgrade . I ca n't say I 'm ecstatic with this new board . The pieces are not as high of quality and they took out black and white and have pink and purple instead . The holding tray to put the pegs was a nice idea , but it 's not big enough for all the pegs and if you put the big pegs and the little pegs in , you have to sort them each and every time you want to play the game . Overall I 'm disappointed that the quality is n't nearly as good . If I could get new pegs for the old board I would .
3 #### Still a great game but this board is n't as nice as the one from when we were kids
5 #### such a great game - i love that both players have to do important thinking and are so engaged in the game . great for logic building skills and fun too !
3 #### You can put your figure on a field only if you have six on a dice . It can take 10 - 15 minutes which is really annoying .
4 #### So , we spent our Christmas vacation visitng a hospitalized relative . This game is great because you can play it on a squishy surface ( hospital bed ) with no problem . The die is contained , the pieces are pegs with slots . This is a portable " Sorry " game . I recommend it .
5 #### bought it for my five year old and he loves it . at first i thought i would just introduce him to the game on a PC , but glad that I bought this non - electronic version . totally worth it .
5 #### 4 yr old loved it , but of course did n't capture attention very long
5 #### the idea for this game is genius . definitely helps with logic and persistence my son is four and love this game - its even fun / challenging for adults good activity to do with the kiddos
1 #### This is what happens when a company decides that they can make much more money by re - making a very popular game as cheaply as possible ( made in china ) and then charging more for it . I ordered the game that is pictured and was willing to pay the $ 20 price tag because my grandkids have one and love it . What I received from School Specialty was " the new and improved " cheaply made version that sells at Walmart for $ 6 . Stay away from this Hasbro disaster .
5 #### not only a great game helps kids count also . everyone should love this game most of us grew up with it
5 #### Perfect game to take along camping or on trips . Beats watch8ng tv all night in hotel or tent with notes kids .
5 #### interesting game ; appealing because it is challenging but quick to play . Good for ages 8 through adult .
5 #### A Christmas gift for a 5 - year - old , so at this time I am not qualified to speak of it 's durability . However , I do know it is a great game and it arrived from Amazon quickly and in perfect shape . Update -- in playing this game , we have found it to be quite difficult for young children to " pop " the dice bubble . Their hands just are not strong enough to do the job , which is somewhat disappointing to them . I am still very happy to have purchased it .
1 #### False advertising ! They charge you for the good sturdy version of the game and then send you the crappy one you can buy from Wal - mart for $ 5 ! !
2 #### Make sure you verify which version you will receive before you place your order . I received the newer version of the game that is VERY CHEAPLY made . I searched to find the older one that 's pictured .
5 #### We all LOVE this game ! ! As soon as we took it out of the box , my kids were hooked . They played for an hour and were disappointed when they had to quit . There is a great range of difficulty ... from VERY easy , to challenging but doable for older kids / adults . So glad we bought his one ! !
4 #### Fun challenge , grand kids play with it often , either alone or together , and at different levels of difficulty .
5 #### Fun game . I think I enjoy it more than my kids , but they are still little ... and it does n't have a screen .
5 #### I have an 8 and a 6 year old , and they both love this game !
5 #### I bought this for my brother for his 63th birthday . He is now 66 and still plays with it often . I is challenging and fun at the same time .
2 #### I just received this in the mail , and am so disappointed with the quality . I know it 's not very expensive , but it could n't have cost more than $ 3.00 to make . The box does not look like the picture here -- it is white , generic - looking and is paper thin and flimsy , and I 'm sure the game itself is cheap looking too . The box top does not lift off like you would think . It is a Christmas present for my son , and he 'll probably be fine with it , but what happened to the days when board games came in sturdy cardboard boxes that would last for years ? Is there a specific company that still produces board games of quality material ?
5 #### Received this game very quickly and it was in good shape . We had losts of fun and my granddaughter loved sending me back to the start .
5 #### This game works great with kids , although I 'll admit I 've had plenty of fun playing with my own age group . It 's all luck with the only strategy coming from which piece you want to move . But I 've still had plenty of fun , although it can get frustrating not being able to roll a 6 ( which you can try and fix with house rules ) . My suggestion is to make sure you have all the pieces kept in a plastic bag because they are very easy to lose , especially if kids are playing . I have n't had any trouble with the bubble ( excuse the pun ) , and it works just fine . You always have the option of using a different die , but the best part of the game is popping that bubble ! The best feeling is when you get sweet revenge by bumping back a player to start . I would get the game it 's heaps of fun !
1 #### The version received can be found in Walmart right now for about $ 7.77 . Even without a discounted price , the game is only about $ 10.00 . I paid the almost $ 17.00 in hopes of receiving the actual one and got this off - brand version instead . At least that 's what I call it . If this version is supposed to be an upgrade from the original , I must not know what upgrade really means . This ones is cheaply made and not nearly as nice or as decorative as the original . I am very disappointed , especially since they had the audacity to keep the original picture of the board game up . Also for an extra note , when I purchased this I do not recall the other pictures that I see now visible when I first found this seller . Makes me wonder , because this version of Trouble is not worth $ 17 or so . It does n't even sell for that much at Toys R Us without a discount . Highly disappointed . I would not recommend this to anyone that has played the original version of Trouble . You will not be pleased .
5 #### This is a great classic game that I loved as a child and now my son plays . The game goes on for a bit which makes it fun and it 's not babyish . A lot of games get boring pretty quickly , but not trouble .
5 #### I am a mom of a 3 year old and I grew up playing this game and I want to teach him how to play this fun game . It arrived before delivery date so I was excited to get it early !
3 #### Clearly made as cheaply as possible . The pegs fit , but are n't always perfect . Overall , you 're much better served to find an older version , of if you know anyone that has a wood shop , they could make you one much nicer .
5 #### Great for 2 people looking to be able to play a game .
5 #### An interesting game of logic . It is a fun game for older children and adults . If you are looking for a nice two - person game , this one is easy to learn and challenging . Good for someone who enjoys Sudoku or Ken Ken games . It employs deductive reasoning to make educated guesses based upon experimentation .
4 #### The game is a good exercise in logic for my 9 - year - old granddaughter and we have fun playing it . The marker pegs are so tiny that even her small hands have difficulty picking them up so I may have to buy a better version .
3 #### I thought that I was going to be getting a new game but when I received it the box was all crushed and the bubble in the middle is cracked . I was going to give this as a Christmas present but after seeing the condition of it I think that I may not .
5 #### I played Trouble when I was little and I bought some for my classroom . Love the game and the competition and strategy .
4 #### I got it late so couldn t use it that week with the grandkids . Min education value ... But excellent interaction skills learning . When being bumped back or bumping someone else back it teaches them abilities to roll with the punches . We play without bumping with the 3 - 5 yr old group and with the bumping over that So the game is inexpensive , as simple as candyland and traches a unique value
4 #### We bought this for my 5 - year - old son . He played it at summer camp and asked us to get it for him . It was one of my childhood favorites and we 've enjoyed playing with him . The pop - o - matic die roller is fun and keeps the die contained so we do n't waste time chasing it around the floor . Also , the conical pieces fit into the spaces , so they stay in placeeven when we play on the couch . It 's a great family game if you have small kids . Obviously , it 's a choking hazard for children under 3 , but for kindergardeners , it 's perfect . My only complaint is the cheapness of the box . It 's not very sturdy for storage .
5 #### My son ( 4 ) LOVES this game ! We play at least 5 games a week . It 's great for school prep , numbers / counting / taking turns / etc . seller was quick , item was as described . Thank you !
4 #### A gift for my 10 year old granddaughter who is into Brain teaser games . This was a good addition to her other games . She got past the beginner puzzles quickly , but as it got more difficult , she was inspired & determined to solve the puzzles . Should provide fun hours of solving the puzzles & boosting brain power ! ! Good tactile game for the brain ! !
5 #### This is just a fantastic rattle , I can not say enough good things about it . My son was a preemie and only 4 pounds when he came home and although he was small and this rattle on the larger side , miraculously within a month he was grasping this rattle . It really helped to develop his hand dexterity / hand eye coordination as well as develop his overall senses from very early on . He just loved this rattle and would stare at it in facination as well as shake it as he grew and became stronger . It remained his favorite " shake / noise maker " for quite a while . I highly recommend this rattle , it is just a wonderul first toy for fun and developement and very interesting to little babes !
3 #### This is a cool game to play . Beef up the board / case and it 's a five star . Like many things these days , it 's made as cheap as consumers will tolerate .
5 #### Loved as a teen , played constantly , gave as a gift to pre - teen boys
5 #### Kids and wife all love this game . We had a more simple " kids " version of the game but it was getting too easy for my 7 and 10 year old ( and my wife ;) ... they all immediately loved this full version of the game and have played it several times in the first week we have had it .
2 #### We purchased this as part of our classic Christmas - it 's very cheaply put together . The bubble pops , the pieces fit in their slot ... but it 's flimsy ; even the box it is stored in is flimsy and not like other board game boxes . Would not buy another - rather look for a vintage/ better made one .
5 #### Fun game , well packaged . My kids love playing this game . Safe family fun . Pegs are small , do n't recommend for small children who still put things in their mouth .
5 #### Perfect game to play with my 5 year old . Easy enough for my son to understand and who does n't love pushing down the bubble to " roll " the dice ? It is just as I remembered playing when I was a little kid ! ! It is a staple on our family game nights ! !
5 #### This game is a classic ! I had to get it for my children so they could experience the same joys I had as a child playing it . This game is fun for all ages . I would highly recommend it to anyone !
5 #### Everyone in the family enjoys playing this game of course unless you ca n't get anyone home . Fun for kids of all ages including mom & dad !
5 #### I 've had trouble finding logic games that my kids like . They tend to get frustrated with the puzzles before solving them , so I was torn between getting puzzles too easy for them so they can build up some confidence and puzzles that provide a challenge . Well now I think I just was n't getting the right kind of puzzles . Both of my kids seem frustrated with the " fill the pieces in " kind of puzzles ( Trucky for example ) . I would n't have purchased this , but my 8 year old son had played this at a Children 's Museum a few times and before long , that was the first place he wanted to go when we arrived . I finally decided to purchase it for him but I was torn between this one and the Junior version since we have a 4 year old as well . I 'm glad we got the regular version , though . It 's at the perfect level for my 8 year old , and he sets up simple puzzles for my 4 year old . I even like to play , the expert level of puzzles are challenging for me , so everyone in the family is happy . The pieces are plastic , but a great quality and I do n't worry about it breaking or cracking . I am so glad they have expansion packs for Rush Hour and I plan on picking them up on my next order .
5 #### I loved it as a kid and it is great playing it with my grandson . A real classic that you ca n't go wrong with .
5 #### I ca n't tell you how many of these I have bought over the years for grandkid 's . Love this game . A two year old can play this along with older kids and have fun .
2 #### I returned it because it cost like $ 13 or $ 14 , and it was put together so very cheaply . Can hardly push down the bubblmy 4 yr old g'son could not with 2 hands ! Needs to be revised .
5 #### Fun game for adults and older kids ! Makes your brain work to solve them . Good for connecting neurons and preventing Alzheimer 's and dementia !
5 #### Loved this game in my youth . My daughter loves playing this game .
2 #### The storage area does n't close well . I have to put a plastic bag around the whole board before storing it . I do n't like the new peg colors . Great idea to revamp the board . Redesign it and I will buy it . Terrific game .
3 #### The tray that holds the pieces is n't big enough . I had to store them in a separate container . Also the piece the blocks the masterminds puzzle is flimsy and did n't stay on well .
5 #### I remember this game from my childhood so I wanted to share it with my own kids ! Everything came as expected . Lots of colored pieces and red and white pegs . The only cons are that the colors of the pegs are very close ( red and pink look almost the same color and green and blue are also difficult to tell apart ) we just use them universally ... does n't truly effect the play of the game . The pegs also do not snap into place so a slight bump , or a dog stepping on the game board , causes them to fall out easily . We really only had an issue though when we played on the carpeted floor . Overall it 's the same game I played growing up , and the above issues are minor .
5 #### I think my husband and i play this more than the kids . We think it 's fun . We have to do real simply codes for our kids but itshe a good thinking game .
4 #### Still a great classic board game . I deleted one star because the game board is not as well built as it used to be .
5 #### I enjoyed this as a kid and wanted my grandsons to enjoy it too . They did ! We play and I remember the good old days when kids played with each other and laughed face to face ? It was a bargain !
5 #### used to play this when I was a kid so I had to pick it up for my daughter , she has not stopped playing it , beats tv on a rainy day :-)
5 #### We love his game . My son loves this game and I love this game . You can literally take this with you anywhere , and occupy yourself for hours . They do have an app now for this game , but I still enjoy playing the material one . Once you master all of the levels , then you can go back and try to complete each level in less steps . It really does require a lot of visual - spacial planning and thinking . You have to rearrange the cars in your mind . If you 're looking for a fun game for children and adults alike , especially one that exercises your brain , then this is a home run . It 's one of our favorites . It also encourages solitary play , which is a very important skill for kids . I highly recommend this .
5 #### Excellent logic game . I purchased it for my 7 year old thinking there was a good chance it would be too hard for him , but he 's really gotten into it . It 's a challenge for him , but he can solve each puzzle quickly enough so that he does n't get frustrated . And he LOVES solving new levels . My 4 year old is also able to play this game . It 's obviously harder for her , but this is a great game that really can be used by people of all ages . It 's been wonderful to see how much progress the kids made ... it took a long time for them to solve the first puzzles , but they have clearly learned skills that allow them to figure out harder levels faster . I often pick this up and play with it myself . There 's something really relaxing about sliding those little cars around and finally getting the little red one free .
5 #### Our 4 year old daughter loves this game and it keeps her busy for hours . She has completed almost every puzzle but I love how it is forcing her to think critically and is keeping her dedicated at the task .
5 #### 7 year old loves it . Educational and fun solitaire game . Great for quiet time .
5 #### Challenging and fun for kids and adults . People who know Rush Hour are always glad to see it , and people who have not seen it before are pleasantly surprised and then excited about such a simple but great game .
5 #### Our little one is just under three months old now and is getting more and more interested in this rattle . The ribbed rods are perfect for her to grab with her little hands , and the large openings allow her to safely put her whole arm through the toy to " wear " it . She 's fascinated by the bright colors and sharp rattling sound that the beads make - I can distract her from fussing by shaking it in front of her eyes . She 's also starting to mouth the toy and even though it 's hard plastic it does n't seem to bother her in the least . All in all , this is a great value for $ 10 !
5 #### what stimulation this rattle offers . our munchkin loves shaking it and watching all of the colored balls move from one end to the other . we take it everywhere , great rattle !
5 #### My son got this as a gift when he was 3 months old . He has always liked to look at it . But lately he likes to hold it , shake it , put in his mouth , pound it against other things , ect . He is definatly picky when it comes to toys ( he will only reach for or play with certain ones ) and he loves this one .
5 #### Great game . My daughter and I play this a good bit .
4 #### This is a fun game and simple for kids to play . Our only criticism is that it requires a little bit of strength to push the plastic dome to pop the dice . Our 4 year old struggles with it and it makes an obnoxious noise every time you pop it . We would actually recommend the game SORRY as a better choice but we like variety for our family game night and the kids like this one too .
5 #### This game was a gift for my 5yr old . love it . It is fun for the family . It also helps with counting and on how to wait your turn . To be a good player and a good loser .
5 #### Out of all the Christmas gifts my 5 - year old son received , this one got played with the most ! Trouble in the morning ! Trouble in the afternoon ! Trouble in the evening and right into the night . A lot of yelling and screaming of both excitement and frustration ! Hour after hour of noise and that popping sound the dice makes . I could n't take it anymore . I finally had to put my foot down ! Grown adults carrying on like that ! They finally quit and eventually the kids got to play ! Highly recommended ! This is one game where the youngest kid is on a level playing field with the adults . Very easy to learn and anybody can win !
5 #### This was a challenging game , but we all loved it .
5 #### For Christmas my daughter 's 5th grade teacher requested in - classroom games that can be used when they have indoor recess . So we got this game for the classroom set . My daughter reports that the class members like it a lot ! And that they are always arguing over who gets to play with it ! It makes them think , and problem solve in a fun way .
5 #### fun game for kids that like puzzles / legos / that kind of thing .
5 #### We had fun with this also . Just like " back in the day " ! The quality was great and it was shipped quickly .
4 #### My son , now almost 6 months old , loves this rattle . I think the bright colors are wonderful and the fact that he can see the little balls inside that are making the rattling noise is supposed to be good for his cognitive development . When he was younger , it was great because even before he could really grab the rattle in his tiny hand , he could stick his arm through the middle of this toy and shake it up and down to make noise . HOWEVER , I think my husband and I may be taking this toy away from him soon , because we 're afraid he 's going to hurt himself . He shakes this rattle around with such enthusiasm , he keeps smacking himself -- and we know from the times when he smacks us with it that it hurts !
5 #### One of my favorite things about this toy is the pattern that the colored " legs " of the triangle are laid out in . When turned slightly differently from the picture , you get the 3 primary colors on the top , and the secondary colors that they make when blended together on the bottom . Very nice way to teach colors and color mixing . The baby loves to shake and rattle this all the time . Easy to sanitize after a long day in the park as well !
5 #### We have three girls , now 3 , 2 , and 1 who have all used the TWO of these rattles that we have . After the rattle stage is over , we have seen the " braclet stage " where they walk around with their arm through the openings . Then the two year olds have the " puzzle " stage where they try moving the colored balls inside around to get them all into one sphere or spread them all out . I 'm genuinely surprised at how long they have played with these and how durable they are . All of the Lamaze products we have purchased have been great fun and great quality .
5 #### I 'd only ever played this game on a computer but thought I would give this a chance with my kids . The cards are great and challenge the mind . I love that my kids can try new configurations to see if they work . Great learning game for spacial skills and problem solving .
5 #### Fun game for ONE ! Reminds me of a long ago skill of putting ten tiles in order .
5 #### Since we call our grandson , Trouble , this is an appropriate game for him . I loved it as a kid and I know he will too .
3 #### The pieces are hard to fit in . The container does not close properly . We have this game in the travel version and wanted a larger version so that the pieces can be manipulated better . But to our dismay they are n't any easier to handle .
4 #### The good quality , bright colors , loud rattle all make this a good toy for your baby to play with . My daughter started playing with this at about two and a half - three months old and at nine months old she still picks it up and shakes it around . It 's a great toy for when she 's sitting in her swing or high chair ( although now she has discovered the art of throwing objects across the room ! lol ) Good toy to teach babies hand to eye coordination . Very good quality and it has a good grip on it to make it easy for babies to pick up and hold on to . Recommended .
5 #### This is a life saver when we go out to dinner . Our daughter hates booster seats , but usually she keep herself entertained if you give her this toy while at a reataurant , eventhough she does bang it quite a bit . This is a good buy , my daughter has played with this toy since she was about 3 months old and she is 9 months now .... I do believe we gotton back every penny that was spent on it due to the way it entertains our daughter .
4 #### My six - month - old really likes this rattle . It 's bright colors captivate him , and he really likes looking at the different size balls inside the rattle . Further , I like the multi - dimentional property of the rattle . He can hold onto it with both hands and examine it carefully . And it serves as a good chew toy as well , in spite of the hard plastic . Further , older kids who come to visit us love this rattle as well . The ten year olds like to make all of the balls land in one sphere or see if they can seperate the balls by color . It seems that the interest in this particular rattle is endless .
2 #### This is n't the same as I remember as as child . The board is a flimsy plastic and the popper is kind of sad .
4 #### As someone prone to bouts of nostalgia , I was taken back a few years when I recently played this again . And it is still fun , I have to admit , even though it was about 25 or 30 some odd years in between play sessions of Trouble . The pop - a - matic feature is still as addicting as it was when I first discovered it as a young girl . The whole premise revolves around the concept of luck , as all classic race games do , but that does not lessen its enjoyment if all you want to do is sit down with others and leave your worries behind . Because of its simplicity , my kids had no problems grasping it after literally just looking at it . I recommend you pick it up again , even if it has been a while .
5 #### Fun puzzle game for at home or in the car on a trip .
5 #### Love this classic game ! Great for kids to use their puzzle solving skills !
4 #### Updated version of the game I played as a kid . Kind of a classic . The board here is a little less compact than the original board we used in the vintage set and it 's a little light weight ( cheap ) feeling . It has a compartment to store the peices but amazingly they do n't all fit . We have to store them in plastic bags , which we have affixed to the bottom of the set . I guess I do n't understand how that happened . ( re)Designing this game was n't rocket science . Anyway , it 's a pretty basic game . Not that hard to win every time as an adult , but it appeals to all ages . Knocking a star off because the storage compartment does n't conveniently hold the pieces and because the overall design and build quality of the board is n't as good as it used to be .
5 #### My kids play with it and love it and they do n't get bored . It is fun , it gets them to build up their problem solving skills . I have promised them to get another Thinkfun game if they finish all 40 cards .
5 #### Amazing game and not just for the little ones ! I often play it with my daughter and I believe this to be a great game for seniors as it exercises their mental abilities .
5 #### I bought this for my 7 year old nephew . He loves it . It is a quiet activity that challenges him . To u could play with friends or alone . It is also nice because the cards go in a drawer under the board and it comes with a mesh nag that holds everything .
3 #### If you are going to purchase this toy please be aware that it is not really washable . I clean all toys before I give them to my daughter as they invariably end up in her mouth . When I tried to wash this rattle ( with a soapy washcloth ) the insides immediately became waterlogged and there is then no way to dry the toy other than to shake it as much as possible ( messy ) then leave it in the sun to dry ( takes ages and leaves water marks ) . In terms of play value , my daughter seems to like the toy but does keep smacking herself in the head with it !
4 #### My grandchildren love games and were very excited to receive this classic game . It is a bit frustrating getting into " trouble " but it teaches them patience as well as good sportsmanship . Board games are wonderful family activities .
5 #### I told our family to get my kids games as they 're getting to the age when games are fun and they 're responsible enough to play them on their own . I 've played the game Trouble since I was a kid , so I was happy that we got this one . The game is still exactly the same as I remember it and even though I really , really suck at it , my six year old son loves to play it . It helps him learn to count when moving his piece . The biggest downside to this particular product is the packaging . The box opens with a side flap , the kind that tucks into the box , and is very thin . My daughter stepped on the box Christmas morning and the box never did regain it 's nice shape after that . A firmer box that came in two pieces and fit into each other like games typically come in would work much better , especially since the game pieces fall out so easily when you have a mashed box . It wish it had come with some kind of sealable plastic container to hold the game pieces since the box is so flimsy .
4 #### My husband and I play this game often with our nearly 3 & 5 year old daughters . The 3 year old gets bored with it fast and moves on to something else , but my nearly 5 year old can easily play the game all the way through . It 's a nice way to spend some family time together while helping my daughter with counting skills and taking turns . Yeah she gets mad if she gets sent home and has to start over , but being able to lose is also another skill she needs to learn . I do n't let my kids play with this game without parental supervison . The pieces are small and could be easily lost . And also the quality of this game is not like I remember it being when I was a kid . If it 's played with roughly it will probably break .
5 #### This is just like the old version of the trouble game , so if you liked it then you will like it now . Simple game for younger kids , but older kids can play too .
4 #### More portable than original since the markers are stored in the covered bin . Cons - Bin does not keep the markers separated well . Bin needs a latch to keep it closed . I tape it down when bringing it anywhere .
1 #### great game just a bit cheap plastic not too comfortable to store the little pins which can get lost very fast
5 #### My son received this for his birthday three days ago . After a quick lesson on how to play , he 's been wanting to play all the time . He has a little trouble with the bubble , and I have to remind him which direction to move , but he 'll get it . All in all , it 's a lot of fun . He loves it and that makes me happy with it .
3 #### I remember liking " Trouble " when I was a kid , now that I 'm an adult , it is really boring . I played this with my kids recently , and the game started out " fun " , but eventually started to drag on . There is n't much strategy needed , and does n't require much thought to play . Pop bubble , move out a piece if you can , or see if you can land on your opponents piece . I started to skip good moves just to try and make the game move along faster ! We eventually all decided to end the game and move on with life .
3 #### The game just is n't that much fun for anyone over 6 . All you do is pop the dice and move your pieces . I used it to enforce counting for my kids , but it bored me to tears . It has the same concept as " Sorry , " but that one is just more fun with the same counting benefits . As for the popper not working , ours was always fine and my 4 - year - old can push it just fine .
3 #### This is not the Trouble you might remember from childhood . " Chinky " is the word that comes to mind - the bottom is a piece of flimsy cardboard , similar to what is used in cereal boxes . Very disappointing ! I 'd rather spend a bit more and get a quality product than get this garbage . What a shame .
5 #### Our 6 year old loves this game . We play it almost every day . The pegs do come out too easily if accidentally bumped and the container can be hard to shut , but it 's a great game otherwise .
5 #### Christmas gift for a child and she love it .
5 #### We Love this game . Had it for years and it is still a staple in the camping box
4 #### My daughter Loves this cash register . Wish it functioned more realistically though , it 's simply a calculator . It would be great if you entered the total , hit a tender amount , then could give change , but she does n't mind .
5 #### My 7 y / o loves it ! A neighbor has one and he just needed one so I splurged since I saw the math practice in it . It is solar - powered ( we used a flashlight until he discovered the battery compartment ( 1.5 button cell ) . Woukd have been great with a paper tape so he can see the calculation . Annoyed at whoever does pricing - Amazon or Seller ? I 've bought many items at a great price and sometimes when I go back later there is an increase but today was so quick ? ! ? Within hours the price went up +30 %
5 #### My daughter adores this rattle . It is the first toy she grabbed and held onto . It 's colorful handles attract her and the beads move from one sphere to the next . As soon as it 's in her grip , the sphere is in her mouth . She 'll gum this toy all day if I let her . I have n't had any problems with it hurting her gums as some of the other reviewers did . However , she does occasionally knock herself in the head with it . The manufacturer is n't at fault for that .... it 's just babies ' developing hand - eye coordination . It 's very light , despite it 's appearance and she never gets hurt . She 's been interested in it since she was 3 months old and her attention has n't waned yet . Lamaze comes through with another winner !
5 #### this game has been great fun for our family - kids through grandparents .
5 #### Fun game ! Multiple level challenges for various ages and skill levels . Comes with own bag for storage . Good quality pieces and game board . Would recommend . Good kid gift idea !
5 #### Perfect gift for kids ! They can do it alone or with friends . Adults get involved too .
5 #### great game for kids and adults .... makes you think and strategize ....
5 #### Great game and quality . Will hold up through the times
5 #### Mastermind is a code breaking game . It 's quick and easy to learn but can be difficult to win . I had this game as a kid and bought it for my kids . We have had it over a year now and they still play it , unlike many other games I have purchased . How to play : One person sets up the code ( code master ) using colored pegs . The other person ( code breaker ) needs to break the code in less than 10 tries to win . The code master lets the code breaker know if she / he has the correct colored pegs in the correct order each round . The code breaker has 10 chances to break the code . If the code breaker figures it out he / she gets a point , if not the code master gets the point . Then players switch sides and scores can be kept on the board for most wins . This board is constructed of plastic as well as the pegs . States it is for ages 8 and up . This is pretty accurate as I think it may be a little difficult for younger kids to have this much strategy . I do n't think there is an age where someone outgrows the game . Keep in mind , this game has a ton of small pieces that can be lost or put in the mouth . This is something to keep in mind if purchasing for a gift .
5 #### One of the best strategy games of all times ! I still have my family 's from the 70s in the original packaging and bought this as a gift . I hope they love it as much as we did .
5 #### I played this game as a kid and now introduced it to my 8 year old . We play a simplified version of it where you choose 4 different peg colors to make the code ( the game gets harder if you choose multiple colors that are the same ) . He got the idea of it rather quickly and asks to play it with me more than his other games . This game is a winner in our household !
5 #### Such a fun and educational game . Everyone from my three year old to my husband love this . What a great game to improve spacial reasoning . I love the different levels and still have n't tackled them all ! Before my son was old enough to play , he enjoyed just taking the pieces off and trying to fit them all back on . I also love to have single player games that are n't electronic .
5 #### Very fun game - perfect for developing logic and brain function . Easy to travel with too .
5 #### I had a blast playing this game with a four - year - old child . It was great to teach her the rules and watch her count carefully as she moved her little pegs from space to space . Granted this game is for 5 years old and up , we did have a great time . I agree with the recommended age range , but if you are patient , many 4 year old children will enjoy this thoroughly . The only thing I was questioning was the sturdiness of the popper . We were sitting on the carpet playing the game . That may have been the problem . I would recommend placing the gameboard on a flat surface , such as a kitchen table or coffee table , to make it easier to pop the popper . Between 5 to 8 years old is probably a good age range for this game .
5 #### Just like we used to play , new vamped up colors , new pegs to move , but the same classic game . We have lost the little rubber feet pegs that are inserted into the bottom of the game board . But even without them , the game works great .
3 #### My two boys received this game as a gift a few days ago , and I was rather happy about that because I was thinking of buying this game for them myself . Well , it proved to be too much of a logical leap from the simple board games my young boys have played to date to this beginning level strategy game . Your milage may vary on this point , but two aspects of this game that did n't help were : First , the " Pop - o - matic " takes considerable force to operate . My five year old had to put his full 50 lb body weight onto it just to get it to work , and it was difficult for my old son to operate too . Second , the " have to roll a six to get to start " rule is stupid . You just wait forever to get to even start to play . We changed the rule so you can start with either a six or a one , and that helped a little bit . Sadly , my kids lost interest after about 10 minutes . So , another unloved game in the game pile .
5 #### This game is a family favorite and was a HIT , as a Christmas gift . During our Christmas vacation , we spent much time ( taking turns and trading off ) playing . It continues to be a favorite . It is only a 2 player game , but in this large family we still enjoy playing it , as each game only takes 15 - 20 minutes , sometimes less ! Enjoy the code breaking ! It is pleasantly and surprisingly fun !
5 #### Our whole family LOVES his game ! ! HOURS of brain building fun !
3 #### Not made as well as it was in the 1980 's . The grandkids still have fun with it but it could be made better
1 #### Yes ... the educaton value is there , so is the durability , but what most of the reviewers are neglecting to tell you is that this toy can hurt your child ! ! Is made of a hard plastic . My son grabbed a hold of it and swung it wildly , stirking himself in the face . He also go his arm caught in the toy on more than one occasion . I took it off of him and packed it away with some baby clothes . It resurfaced when the clothes were open when my daughter was born , but I made sure she did n't get a hold of this .
3 #### The information for this rattle suggests it is for age 3 months and on . My baby is quite large for her age , but this rattle is still a bit heavy for her at 3 months . Its also a bit bulky . Its pyramid like shape extends out about 5 inches each of its sides . Not the best for traveling with . I think this rattle is more appropriate for 5 or 6 month old babies and up ... not 3 .
4 #### I worried that this rattle might be too big for my four month old son , but he loves it . It 's easy for him to grab , hang on to , and mouth . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because sometimes he gets angry because his arm slips through the middle of the rattle ( like a braclet ) and he ca n't get it off . Other than that , a great toy for infants learning to use their hands and mouths .
3 #### Bought this for our 7 yr old grand daughter . She was happily surprised when she got it because she 's been asking for one but this one is nothing more than a calculator . The card beeps . This did not keep her attention long at all . Now our 4 yr grand daughter is a different story . She loved it ! Hope this helps .
4 #### Great cash register ! Well made & sturdy ! The only con being that the drawer comes out with so much force that the coins sometimes come flying out ! Even so ... I'd still recommend it !
5 #### I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas 2006 . She was ( still is ) 5 years old . She enjoyed playing the game . I think this game is good for teaching competition , numbers , and good sportsmanship . The only thing my granddaughter had trouble with is the bubble in the center . Hard to push . Mom had to help . That 's why the 4 . I am not sure how that part is going to turn out .
5 #### Great classic game , classic fun ! It is as fun as I remember . The whole family plays it and it does help with improving counting skills . The only downside is that our youngest daughter has a breakdown every time she has to bring a piece home . She is 2 ! The worst part is that the box is really cheap feeling and looking ... it is n't even a normal game box . It is one where you open one side and slide the game out . WHO DOES that to a board game ? ? Seriously , this game has been around for so long , does n't it warrant a tin collector 's case .
5 #### I bought this game for my granddaughter on her birthday and I 'm glad I did . It is a simple game and easy for children to play . The object is to get all four of your pegs around the board and home before anyone else . Beware however ! If someone lands on you back home you go . This game helps children recognize numbers and teaches them to be a good sport . The dice popper can be a little difficult at times but other than that this is a great game to play together and have some fun with each other .
5 #### I remember playing this at my friend 's house when I was a kid , and forgot how much fun we used to have ! Bought it for my kids , and we love it . It 's really a game for the whole family . I do n't think my young children could have really handled moving the pieces correctly around the board by themselves before they turned 5 , and the counting reinforces early math skills . Unlike other games they 've played ( Candyland , Chutes & Ladders , Hi Ho Cherry - O ) , this game is dependent upon strategy as much as chance . Perfect for kindergartners and up !
5 #### I think the recommended age for this product of 5 years and up is a little off . My son loves this game . He has been playing it since he was 3 . The die in the bubble has numbers on it instead of dots which help kids recognize them . This has improved my sons counting abilities and number recognition . He loves smashing mom and dad 's pieces and sending us back to our start positions . He comprehends the concept of the game perfectly and begs us to play with him all the time . My daughter is nearly 3 , but does n't quite understand the game . She loves to play with us but putting the pieces on her fingers ( they fit perfectly ! ) and pushing the bubble . Soon , she will get more into it and will be able to play with us for real . This game has increased family time in our house and countless hours of fun . Any household with preschool children must have this game !
5 #### Bought this game for my 7 year old . He loves it and it can still be challenging for adults as well . Rare for kid friendly games . teaches patience and logic . Fantastic game . It is also small enough to travel with us and it 's playable in the car / train / bus / plane . Fun for all ages .
5 #### This is a great game that helps build logic and deduction skills in those who play it . I have purchased it for all my grandchildren ( ages 7 - 10 ) and love playing it with them . It 's fun to watch them be delighted when they finally crack the code .
3 #### I used to love this game growing up so I got it for my daughter for Christmas . The game itself is great , one person creates a code , the other tries to crack it . That 's the same as it was . What 's not the same however , is the quality - shocker ! It 's very flimsy , cheap plastic and the little do n't stay in the holes very well . Also , there is a red compartment that is supposed to keep track of the pieces , but it does n't latch or anything so it is pretty much worthless . My daughter loved the game though , so it was a decent enough purchase , it just could 've been manufactured so much better .
4 #### This game is more difficult than it looks . I liked it but me and my 10 year old could not figure it out without looking at the answer . I thought is was just a puzzle , but you have to place the trucks to match different cards and then try to solve the puzzle ( by getting the red car out ) . There are a ton of card so many different puzzles to solve ( if you can solve one I 'd be impressed ) . It is nice for kids to play games and not be stuck in computers all the time but this game caused more frustration because we could never solve it . I think if we accomplished something we would keep trying more but it made us frustrated instead .
5 #### Oh , this game is so fun and addictive . It 's easy to set up for my grade -schoolers and would n't you know , they sit there for hours trying to figure out how to let the little red car out of a jam . I love educational games that keep their attention like this one does .
5 #### Love this game ! My six year old grandson loves puzzles of all kinds . Rush Hour is perfect for him . I watched him play and was amazed at the problem solving involved . He has only done the beginning level . I would guess that the intermediate level may be a bit hard for him . That is the beauty of the game . It will be fun for a long time . I must admit that after he went home , I played the game that evening . It is challenging and I have only done the beginning level . Wonderful game !
4 #### We really like it I just wish the cars did n't slide off as easily from the tracks .
5 #### Bought this for my goddaughter for her Christmas present . I bought another one for myself . Love this game . Even comes with it 's own bag to store the pieces in . If you finish the deck , there 's more decks : Rush Hour 2 , 3 , and 4 . I do n't own an iPad so this came in handy for my flights visiting my fiance in London ( U.K. ) flying from Hawaii . This fit fine in my backpack . If it does n't fit in your backpack , you can always use a carabiner and attach it to the Rush Hour game bag and attach it to one of the handles on your backpack .
5 #### This is a great game that is good for children of all ages . I can remember playing this when I was about 4 years old , and I would gladly play it now , over 25 years later . It is simple for children to understand , yet the randomness of the die keeps anyone from having a real advantage and anyone can win . A great family game !
3 #### My 8 yr old loves playing this game as it is simple but fun . As others have said , waiting to get a 6 to start can get really frustrating . The popper is definitely tough to push , even for my 8 yr old and sometimes for me . You feel like it if you push too hard it might just crack . Since the game does not cost much and is even cheaper if you get it during the B1G1F promos , it still is a big disappointment as a parent . I 'd like to have a sturdier box that actually had a lid instead of a flimsy one that only opens on the side . The playing board is a single piece of clear plastic that you place the thin cardboard colored piece under and it is held in place by the 4 rubber feet . As another reviewer said , I 'd rather pay more money and have a better quality game and box . Nonetheless , my son likes to play it as it does n't require a lot of thinking . It has some educational value in helping younger kids learn to count . However , we tend to like Sorry more than Trouble as it has a little more variety and you do n't get stuck for too long waiting to play .
5 #### My 12 year old daughter has been playing this with everyone who will play . I was happy to play a game with her that I used as a kid .
5 #### I love this game ! ! ! My kids love it .... an old classic .
5 #### this was a present for our 8 year old grandson who loves to come over and challenge our skills using our game . Now he can challenge his friends .
5 #### I do n't know why my daughter loves this rattle so much but she does . It 's bright and colourful , the shape makes it really easy to grab and hold on to , the texture on the rattle makes it interesting to touch and chew on , the balls inside make a great noise . All these things contribute to a really great rattle . It can be shaken , chewed on , thrown , and grabbed . My daugther played with is more than any other rattle she was given when was a newborn and still grabs it now for a bit of a " shake and chew " session at 1 year old . A good quality and fun rattle for your baby .
5 #### Really fun and educational . I would definitely recommend this game .
4 #### I brought this for my elderly father . I thought it would be a nice item to keep his mind sharp . He seems to enjoy it but my nephews play with it more then he does . It is well made . When my son gets older I am sure he will enjoy playing this puzzle game with grandpa .
4 #### Children of all ages ( 6 and up ) have enjoyed this game that I have given several times . It is challenging for adults , too . Each card sets up the vehicles in different configurations . The player has to find a way to get the red car out of rush hour traffic jams and to the exit space , by moving the vehicles around . It requires patience , concentration , motor coordination , and spatial reasoning in varied degrees of difficulty . There are other versions by ThinkFun .
3 #### Love the game , but there are 2 major flaws : 1 . My son has some color blindness . This has never caused an issue playing games , but he ca n't decipher the color differences on a few of these odd colors of pegs . This creates errors or him having to ask a question showing what is right & wrong . 2 . The storage compartment is lousy . It does n't latch & often wo n't even fully close . We accidentally spilled a bunch of the smaller pegs putting the game away in the closet . It 's now held shut by a heavy rubber band . The game itself is fun , and is good with thinking & strategy . Had I know the issues above , we would have preferred the old version .
4 #### Overall I am happy with this item . I love the logic skills it teaches kids . The product design is not great though because all the pieces do n't fit in the holder and the lid does n't shut securely . We kept the box it came in and keep all the pieces in there so they do n't get lost .
4 #### Love the game from when I was younger , still built ok but can use more attention to the housing that covers the coded colors from the players view ( not too smooth does n't quite lock in right ... perhaps mine was defective ? ) The game itself is one of my favorites and a true classic , if you never had thus game its worth buying especially if you think you are smart and can figure things out ( buy when they go on sale about $ 10 range )
5 #### Trouble has become a classic game in the tradition of Monopoly , Clue , Chutes and Ladders , to name a few . The concept is simple , depressing the dome tosses the die contained within it ( this part is always a favorite for the young ones ) . You then move the number of spaces shown on the die encircling the game board attempting to get your 4 pegs home first . The game does not drag on for hours . It is a fast play . Long enough to be fun , not boring or time consuming for children and the adults who play with them . This is always a favorite during " game time " . The hours of entertainment and enjoyment you will receive from this game make it well worth the money ! For families who enjoy games , this is a must have . Rosemary
5 #### We love this game . One player creates a pattern ( code ) and the other solves it . My children are 5 and 8 ... both of them enjoy it and are able to play . My husband and I also like to play this . It 's challenging no matter what age you are , but simple enough to understand . Winning game for me
5 #### My 9 y.o . granddaughter beats me every time but she 's very patiently hoping that I 'll master it one day , but then she beats her brother and nanny too . Really good brain game as it intuitively uses mental algorithms , which she 's not even aware of doing .
5 #### 10 year old daughter and I loved playing this game . My husband even challenged me a few times so really it can be great for adults too . We had a blast !
4 #### Mastermind is a fun game ( though it can get frustrating to the guesser , and for those new to the game ) , and this is a fine edition .
3 #### 7 year old grandson played with this one time . Did n't care for it . He was bored . I feel it was over priced for a plastic one person game . Not happy .
5 #### I LOVE this game ! My grandpa kept this in his game room when I was younger so I just had to buy it for myself .
5 #### This is a nice quality set . A fun game for all ages , with many different layouts and levels of difficulty .
5 #### Still a great game . Like I remember . Well made and nice design .
5 #### I love playing this with my 10 year old . Gets our minds working . Highly recommend !
1 #### The board size is needlessly too large . Despite the large size , the build in storage for the pegs is too small and poorly designed . It lacks a storage box or bag making it messy . Does not stack among our other games . The packaging is quite large suggesting there may have been a storage container hidden inside , but no such luck . Regret this purchase .
5 #### Bought this for an 8 - year - old and he has enjoyed solving the puzzle . At first he got frustrated but with a little help from an adult he figured it out . Helps teach patience and problem solving .
4 #### Great solo toy but also one you can play with your kid . The puzzles are well - scaffolded .
5 #### We have had this game for many years . It is a great game for older kids through adults . It 's good to have some single player games in your collection . I like it enough to have also purchased it as a gift .
5 #### This is a really cool puzzle game good for all ages . Makes you plan your moves and it feels really good when you succeed .
5 #### My grandson loves to maneuver cars and trucks around to get out of tight situations so this game has really got his interest .
5 #### Great toy . Kids love it and can spend hours playing .
5 #### all 3 of my kids ( age 6 , 9 and 12 ) love this game . Very fun , makes them think and even though it is made for 1 player , I like listening to them strategize together !
5 #### I saw this years ago an thought it promoted incredible visual spatial and critical thinking skills . I recently have it as a gift , and he loved it . He plays with it everyday .
5 #### Arrived on time . My kids love this game and are giving it to a friend for Christmas .
5 #### I loved this game as a kid , and now my grand - niece loves it as well . This is good for building thinking and problem - solving skills .
4 #### I love love love this game . My daughter is only 5 , so she 's a bit young for real strategizing , but I swear I can see her brain developing every time we play . And it 's fun , too ! There are two things I do n't love : 1 ) there are a billion tiny pieces . I would think that by now there would be some sort of version where you could push a button and it would change colors , instead of having to put tiny pegs into tiny holes . 2 ) The little piece that covers the secret code is hard to maneuver around , and easy to pull off - if we lose that , we 're going to be in trouble , and we probably WILL lose it , because my daughter takes it off to create her code , then puts it back on to hide it , so it 's constantly on and off . That said , I think this is one of the best games out there for developmental purposes . I love it .
5 #### This game rocks ! Our only complaint with this game is that it 's tight to fit all of the pieces in , and the storage bag is n't big enough if you get additional sets of cards .
5 #### Great game for me or my children to play solo or work together to solve a more complicated puzzle . It works our brains harder than anticipated .
4 #### I bit cheaper than the original I remember as a kid . In any case , it has been lots of fun playing this game with my son .
5 #### A classic , I can play this game everyday , no problem !
5 #### nice game ... kids liked it ... convenient to shop for it this way ...
5 #### I ca n't wait to play this game with my daughter of age 8 . It is an Easter present .
5 #### My 6 - year - old daughter and I love to play this game . She loves being the code maker and is also coming along as the code breaker . A great game for school age kids and adults .
5 #### My doctor recommended this game as a rehabilitative tool after I suffered a brain injury . It is a really fun game , and now everyone in the family , including my 4 year old grandson , gets in on the action when this comes out .
5 #### This strategic set 's instructional decks allow people of all ages to quickly learn and play the game .
5 #### Fun game .... but product could be made better ....... not pulled out much since they can get it on the ipad as an app .
5 #### A quick , easy one person game . My 6 year old grandchildren both really like it and will each play with it for quite a while by themselves . Also enjoyable for adults to pass a little time . Easy to understand , and makes the kids feel really smart when they get the red car out of the traffic jam !
5 #### this is a great " game " especially if you want to play alone . Makes you think !
5 #### What a great game ! My grandfather introduced me to this in the 70 's . I am now introducing it to my friends . If you think this is easy , you are completely wrong . I forgot the strategy I learned to beat the game , but it came back to me in an instant . I love it and am glad I found it again .
3 #### well , it gets the job done , no question 'bout that . what i do n't like ... just a couple of things ... the material feels like , fragile , like somewhat cheap ... also , there a compartment for the colored pins which wo n't fit 'em -_-
4 #### My kids are enjoying this as I did at their ages .
2 #### There 's nothing wrong with the actual product itself , it 's just that I really do n't like that faulty new design . The old one was much better and stayed put ... with this one , you can easily knock over the board , the pegs ca n't fit in the peg holder so they spill everywhere and the part that blocks the code is pretty flimsy . I wish they had n't changed the design of the game so much . THE GAME ITSELF IS ENGAGING AND FUN , JUST HATE THE DESIGN OF THE NEW BOARD .
5 #### Have enjoyed this game since I was a kid . Bought it for my daughter and son in law , hope they enjoy it as much as I do .
5 #### I have a 6 year old that really enjoyed this game . Not for all kids , as it takes some amount of attention to be interested in it , but if your kids likes puzzles and games , they likely will enjoy this .
5 #### Challenging for ALL ages . My 10 , 13 and 40 something husband LOVE this . I leave it on the coffee table , set it up and the challenge is on ! The pieces are a good size , it has a storage compartment for the cards and a handy drawstring pouch to store it all in !
5 #### This is one incredible game , which keeps you interested for hours ! You will really really enjoy this game , because you will never get tired of it ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### This is a fun strategy and puzzle game for all ages . The goal is to get the little red car off the board by moving the other cars to make room for the road . My grandkids ( age 6 - 8) continue to be entertained by this game and the storage pouch that the game comes with is perfect for taking it along on trips . Most of the time , we all end up sitting there , trying to find the way for the red car to get out . And if you keep moving the cars - eventually you get there . The game set comes with cards that show you the starting positions , and they come in different levels - beginning , intermediate , advanced and experts . So you can work your way up and learn as you go . I love the educational value of this game and am glad we got it .
5 #### Gift for my niece . She was very pleased = finds it to be fun . Arrived as expected .
5 #### Bought for my 10 year old nephew , he loved it along with the family . We played it nonstop for about two hours . I am glad I did not pay attention to all the reviews . It is definitely for an older child ( 3rd and up ) , if you get aggravated when putting the game away and the pegs not staying in their designated spot , then put them in plastic bags until the next game . It 's a simple , very focused game that I love as a first time player and my nephew loved being the code maker .
5 #### new design , same play . classic game for two players . the parts compartment does n't really fit ALL the pieces very well , but maybe they 're taking in to account that SOME of them will inevitably get lost ( like pieces always do ) . We just use a Ziploc bag to store our pieces in and keep the whole thing in the box so it fits nicely on a bookshelf . This is NOT the travel - sized version .
5 #### Bought this for my grandchildren and they loved it from the very beginning . Since it 's hard to capture their attention nowadays , I consider this a big hit .
5 #### This is a great game to teach spatial problem solving skills for children . It is much like those slide puzzles where you are trying to move a piece out of pattern and it is modular as different cards set up different problems .
5 #### This is not a game for all kids . I bought it and tried it out myself to see if my grandson who was going to be 9 would like . After trying it , I knew it would not be for him . He would not have enjoyed the necessity to analyze and come up with the appropriate solution without getting frustrated . However I have other grandchildren and immediately knew which one of my grandchildren ( she will be 9 in June ) would not only love the challenge but enjoy the analytical aspect of this game . I also saw the aspect of other 's being pulled into the game by making suggestions . I give this a 5 star rating but consider the personality and interests of the child . This will be a very beneficial game for some kids but could also turn another kid off completely if they got frustrated . The nice part of this game is the beginner to advanced levels of play . The size of the game and nice bag for the small parts and best of all , when all else fails a step by step guide to the correct solution is on the back off each card . As an adult of the same type as my granddaughter , I found it challenging and captivating . A game you could walk away from and come back to later for a fresh take and hopefully a solve . Fun Fun Fun for the right kid .
5 #### I got this game for my Grandson for Christmas . He loves it and plays with it all the time . Very happy .
5 #### my 7 year old loved it ! It great cuz you need to think !
5 #### I got this the first time about 45 years ago and played it for hours and hours with my brothers . The game has n't changed much except its now in a cheesy plastic case that I seem to fumble around a lot for the pegs , and do n't remember doing that at age 12 - 13 , but whatever . Its fun , it makes you think , and its a one on one game . Now --I love the fact that you are so engrossed in the game and solving the " puzzle " that you have to talk to one another . You have to focus on each other and no tv , phone , computer , or other distractions . Just you and your partner . I love it .
5 #### We loved playing this game because it seems too simple but the higher level puzzles are quite tough and require some good brain exercise . We also enjoyed creating our own puzzles using the game pieces .
5 #### We love this game . its great and portable for taking to doctors offices and other long appointments and a lot of fun to play . My 10 year old and I take turns doing puzzles and have a lot of fun together .
5 #### This game is excellent for problem solving . I had a party and all the guests were taking turns playing with this . Love the bag for the pieces and the compartment for the cards . Excellent take - along toy . Highly recommend .
5 #### This was an impulse buy for me one day when it went on a lightening deal . I gave it to my 11 year old and she loved it . My 9 year old has taken to it as well . Now they the Rush Hour game Apps downloaded onto their tablets and play all the time . It 's great problem solving , and really makes them think ! !
5 #### I play it with my daughters , 7 & 9 years old . They learn from it , we enjoy it very much . Worth buying if you like logic .
4 #### Mastermind is a fabulous game of logic , and I adore it . I took off one star for this game set , because the peg compartment has two spaces , one for the guess pegs , and one for the answer pegs , with a short divider . If you put the pegs in the compartment in their areas , the lid wo n't close . We found if we just scooped some guess pegs over the divider into the answer pegs compartment , the lid would close , but it defeats the purpose of a separator slightly . Otherwise , I really like the nice , rounded shape of the game board .
3 #### I had played this game with friends in high school , and I wanted my kid sister to experience the same game I had come to enjoy . I ordered this from Amazon after seeing how much it 's been updated . This is the tried and true Mastermind , but this version is n't the best . The pegs are round , making them hard to grab for larger fingers , and the shield is too short , making it difficult to place the pegs in where you want . My kid sister , who was 7 at the time , even had a hard time . Also , while the traditional Mastermind had four pegs , we found that we flew through games too quickly . I ended up replacing this with Ultimate Mastermind , and I heartily recommend that one over the standard release .
5 #### This game has been around for quite awhile but it is a winner ! The object of the game is to move the red car out of the traffic jam . Each card tells you how to place all of the cars . You have to systematically move the cars back and forth to allow cars to move around to create a path , sometime a square at a time , for the red car to get out ! This is great for home and the classroom . This game can also be used during indoor recess . It is a quick game .
5 #### We are really enjoying this game . Looked at deluxe but chose this instead because of the card drawer and deluxe reviews complaining about chipped paint . The cars in this set are a heavy plastic and will withstand a lot . Whole family has played this together while cooking dinner , we 've also run off with it individually and had a good time playing with it alone .
4 #### This is a fun game , but we 've all seen games like it before . The object is to move the pieces so the red car can get out . It really is n't a unique game , but it is challenging and somewhat fun .
5 #### This is a great game . We got it a few years ago . I recommend this for the whole family , ALL AGES 7 and up . Some of the very complex puzzles are VERY , VERY hard , but all the better for figuring out the series of moves needed . Very fun .
5 #### I have 6 kids ranging in ages 7 to 15 and they all absolutely love this game . It 's the only non - electronic game they fight over :) The board is very sturdy and seems to be made well .
4 #### The whole family has enjoyed playing this so far ( age 5 , age 7 , age 30ish , age 40ish ) . I like that there are different levels of play . It will take us awhile to get through all the cards .
5 #### This held the grandkids ' attention ( 5 - 10 ) for almost an hour . The setup cards are numbered sequentially from easiest to hardest and what they learn about 1 solution carries over to the next . Even though it 's one player only .... they worked together to find the solutions . The parents all wanted one for Christmas ! Love it !
5 #### Was looking for a game for our 5 year old who loves puzzles , and could travel well . Turns out the whole family enjoys this ! Fun game , with varying levels .
5 #### This is a really interesting and classic game . We bought it for our 8 - year - old son and it 's fun for all of us to play .
5 #### Got this game to play over Skype with my 10 year old . I am deployed to Alaska and Skype is pixalated , the peices are large enough that we can both see the other persons game . ( We have two copies only for skype , only one is required ) . It is callenging and gives us something to talk about when everything else was said yesterday . Just as fun to play with my 10 year old now as it was with my sister in the 1980 's .
4 #### A smaller edition , more like the editions of the past . It is smaller , color scheme easy on the eyes and has storage for the parts . Can be kept cleen as it is plastic .
5 #### Perfect game . My 6 year old is able to do half the challenges ( he finished rush hour jr . in a week ) . I bought the extra decks for never - ended problem solving challenges for the whole family .
5 #### This is a great game ! I highly recommend this game , it is great for kids ( and adults ) ages 5 and up .
4 #### We love playing this game as a family . We make it into a tourmanent . The only downfall is the cover that covers the master peg colors comes off easily , also on the side where the colored pegs and the smaller white and red pegs are get mixed up very easily . There needs to be more of a sepatation
5 #### I got hooked on this when I went to a game store in SF . It 's addictive . As in , " This & * % $ # ! @ game is n't going to get the best of me ! ! ! ! " And with me , it usually takes a while ... haha A lot of fun . I enjoy the app as well .
5 #### Fun and entertaining ! My four year old loves this game and is entertained for a while . Portable comes with its own cloth bag and a little pull out drawer for the cards . Definitely recommend the one that comes with a bag or make your own helps a lot !
5 #### I had already purchased this at Christmas time for another child . My grandson liked saw this and decided he wanted the same thing . That really made things simple for me . So as of Christmas morning , I already knew what my grandson wanted for his birthday . Excellent ' toy ' by the way .
4 #### My now adult sons owned this game during their childhood which I still have in tact and in great condition . My granddaughters ages 9 and 7 learned how to play the game at camp last summer , so I ordered this one for them to have at home . It is still a great game but not the quality of the one that was purchased over 30 years ago .
5 #### We can highly recommend Mastermind for young teens ; our grandson has had a blast playing it with his buddies . They have a nice compartment for the pegs , a great plus , and the whole game is compact ; great price too !
5 #### Bought this for my kids because they grew out of the Jr. version . My sister and I played this ALL the time when we were young . Great game . My kids love it .
5 #### My kids love this game . My 4 year old son is obsessed with it and has no problem doing it . I highly recommend .
5 #### I bought this for my 6 - year old , even though the age recommendations were higher . She 's very bright , and this definitely makes her use logic " if I move this here , then this will happen .... " As a mom with 2 degrees in mathematics , I love , love , love this game . It 's learning without feeling like you are learning . And , it is something we can do together . I 'll admit - I have done many of the cards after she 's gone to bed . This is absolutely one of the best purchases I have made . one note - there are lots of little pieces , and it could have been made just a bit sturdier , but I like the travel bag to put everything in when done playing .
5 #### Love this game ! Not everyone is good at it . My son and I are , but my husband and daughter ... not so much ! I had this when I was a kid and you just never get tired of it because you can make so many combinations and such . I love it . The box is super flimsy , but the game is great !
4 #### A little more ergonomically made since I was a kid , but still the same ol' game ! Love it ! Wish my 8 year old son loved it just as much , but it 's not electronic , of course .
4 #### I played many hours of Mastermind when I was younger , and I thought it was time to share this with a new generation . My daughter and my nieces ( ages 12 - 15 ) immediately got hooked . The best part of mastermind is that adults and kids can play together and everyone can enjoy ! It is rare for modern games to satisfy players of all ages equally , but Mastermind does ! The only reason I gave this particular version four stars instead of five is that the storage sections on this board seem a bit small to store all the pegs , and the lids do n't really close all the way and snap down . It 's not a big problem when playing , but it makes things more tricky when storing it . Smaller pegs or larger storage area that would close all the way would have made this a five - star perfect game !
5 #### My husband recieved this for Christmas and really enjoys the challenges . I think they are 40 levels ( we are up to 13 ) and have found those beyond 10 to be a little challenge . Our 5 year old can do the beginner levels with a little guidance ... and it is fun for her and her 3 year old brother just to set the board up trying to match the images on the card .
3 #### There are electronic apps of this same game and I kind of regret getting this game because it would be just as well to let my kids play this on an app instead . We brought it in the car and it was tough to keep the pieces in place ....
3 #### The game itself is a great game . The red / white pegs to say what you got right are very small and slightly difficult to put in . The code that you put in is sometimes hard to get in behind the blocker . Despite those two things the game is a lot of fun and definitely worth getting .
5 #### My 9 year old niece loves ThinkFun products , including Rush Hour . She and my nephew played with this for hours over Christmas . Great for young thinkers !
5 #### My son has had a great time figuring out this game and doing different configurations . Perfect for him and his sister at ages 6 and 4 .
5 #### I did n't see anyone actually play this came . The children were very excited to receive this game however . All enjoyed .
5 #### I purchased this for my nephew who is 6 . He was instantly enthralled with trying to find a way out for the red car ! I watched , and I too got caught up in this game . My son is 12 and he now wants one ! I recommend this ! Do n't be swayed by the 8 and up necessarily .
5 #### This is one of those solitare games where you move the pieces to get one out . You get a deck of cards with a picture of each set up . You place the pieces like the picture and then play the game . There are several levels of play so you wo n't use all of the pieces like at the begining level . It is made of a hard plastic and comes with a nice bag for storage . If you like to get away from your electronic devies this as a lot of fun . BUT they also have a version for your iPhone :-)
5 #### Everyone loves this game ! My daughter said there is even an app for it ( ? ) I 'm glad I bought it . My 7 year old can do the beginner cards with no problem !
5 #### I love this game and bought it for a 9yo boy who is very good at math , I figured it would be a good non - plugged in / electronic game for him to play that would work on logic skills . His mom says he 's been enjoying it !
5 #### Enjoyed by my 6 and 9 - year old son and daughter ( and their parents ! ) , this is a great , portable game to exercise thinking and problem - solving skills . It 's the low - tech version of Professor Layton 's parking lot maze , but it offers a variety of puzzling challenges .
5 #### This is a great family game . Young children can play this game as well as adults . My son who is four loves this game . It is a traditional game with a new look . Some of them are a little bit difficult in that the matches might have different backgrounds or be a silghtly different view of the same item . It makes you think . We have enjoyed the books and now we enjoy the game . The pictures on the game look like they come right from the book . I particularly like that this game will grow with my children . There are riddle cards that you can use in one type of game . And directions for other games as well . Enjoy .
5 #### My 5 year old son loves this game . It says you have to be 8 years or up to play , but we explained the rules to him and he understood . It is challenging and fun !
4 #### I am almost 30 years old and I got this game for my boyfriend and I to play . I used to have this game when I was little and loved it . I like the new colors in this one . The only bad thing is that the big pegs do n't all fit in the storage compartment that is attached to it ! How crazy is that ? ! So , we just keep them in a separate container and it 's not a big deal to me , but it 's something you might want to be aware of before you buy .
5 #### Great game for problem solving . It is fun but also challenging . It has several different levels of play so kids of all levels can play .
5 #### I purchased this for our son who loves to build things . I figured that he could use this to make up structures to go along with his angry birds game .
5 #### I 'm very happy with this game ! High quality cars perfectly slides on a big board . Challenges are amazing - from easiest to very hard ones . Highly recommended :)
5 #### This game is a lot of fun . All ages have had a great time playing this one . It really makes you think and is addictive .
5 #### This was a gift for our 7yo for Christmas , who is a math whiz and logic nut . It was the perfect gift . It engages his little brain in a different logic puzzle every time we play . If you play to 30 , like the instructions say ( a codemaker gets 1 point for every guess the codebreaker takes ) , he beats me every time . He is better at logic ! He always solves in fewer guesses than I do . This is a very fun game , and an excellent exercise in logical thinking and analysis for children ages 8 and up ( or 7 and up if they 're a math and logic nut like mine ! )
5 #### As a teenager , a friend and I had a blast playing this . So I decided to buy it for my children for Christmas . They LOVED it ! What a great hit this was ! Thanks for carrying a great old game !
5 #### I 'm retired and was given this to fuss with ... maybe to stay mentally active ? It 's fun and facinating ... buy the extra decks as I did . I now give these as gifts to young and old . And it 's good at table , chair , and in bed . Get it .
5 #### The only thing I can think to improve this toy is to make the cars and trucks a little heavier so they do n't thither easily . But what an amazing thinking toy ! It is not just a toy that you buy , play for a while , and store forever . It has a great repeat playability . Toys that do n't encourage you to think is a waste of money ; not this . The puzzles are very challenging ; even with the beginner cards , I got stuck for a while on number 7 or 8 before passing to the next level . Both of my sons are enjoying this , especially my 7 - year - old son who has mild autism . He is now tackling the advance levels . Worth the money . Just be careful not to lose a piece .
4 #### Great game with lots of variations for many ages .
3 #### My little ones like this . It does n't have much replay value as once they know where all the " riddle " items are they wo n't change ... :) I thought the riddles were going to be that . I wanted critical thinking . They are just mainly telling the kids to find things on the cards instead of making them think about what really they are looking for ... not sure if that makes sense ... :) It is good for the memory game though .
4 #### Bought this off recommendations of others . wanted something similar to the Picturekas 1 & 2 . Good game , but seems a little advanced for my 5 year old grand - daughter . She 'll get the hang of it , she does like playing it , and more so if she 's winning .
3 #### For a young child this may hold more intrigue , but as an adult , once you have done all the riddle cards ( solitaire or in a group game ) you tend to remember where everything is , taking away the fun challenge . With new riddles I could enjoy this game daily . The memory game ( all cards face down ) is a challenge every time . Not the greatest game out there , but worth the price for occasional fun . A card game like Spot It is a somewhat similar concept and more fun to us on a regular basis .
4 #### I have always loved this game . I used to play Mastermind for hours with my siblings . Now , I have shared this game with my kids . We got this new version since my original game has been long lost . This version seems to have some design flaws though . The storage compartment is difficult to close and is always getting pegs stuck in the tiny holes on the side . I have given up using it and store the pieces in a separate bag . Also , it is hard for adult fingers to put pegs into the code maker section . Otherwise , it is a terrific game .
5 #### This classic game has been around for decades , but it still provides good old - fashioned fun . No lights , no sound effects , just one player trying to stump another . One player hides a combination of four colored pegs in a particular order and the second player tries to guess it . The first player provides feedback about the guess and the first uses deductive reasoning to attempt to guess the pattern of pegs before they run out of guesses . This is a great game to play with children and allows parents to teach their children about the use of deductive logic . I adore games that provide fun while allowing children to learn while they go .
4 #### Quick to learn , fairly quick to play , and fun , so kind of an ideal casual game . On the negative side , the pieces seem kind of flimsy ; better weighting would definitely help . Perhaps they 'll make a collectors edition with cast iron pieces ! ( not likely ) Also , believe it or not , the game can be a little loud . I 've noticed that when my wife is playing it in the living room while I 'm watching TV it can be more than a little distracting . The sound of hollow plastic moving on plastic I guess !
5 #### We bought this game for our 10 years old boy , and everybody in the house love it ! My husband and I play with it all the time with the kids , and it is an excellent choice to play in restaurants while waiting for the food ! A 5yo neighbor went to our house to visit , and he loves the game so we gave him one as a Xmas present . It is challenging , entertaining and fun ! Think fun toys are an excellent choice to get kids to think and play at the same time , and get them away from electronics , which is good for them sometimes !
5 #### I was sold on this because of the crazy good reviews on it , so I ordered it . And they are spot on ! It is fun ! It makes the mind work ! After playing it some myslef , my children ages 11,and 7 tried to play . I knew it would be too hard ... HA ! They enjoy it and do well at it ! I like that it offers critical thinking development in a fun way . I also like the single player aspect ... something hard to find in quality kids games sometimes . The board is quality and it comes with a handy storage bag and a very nice slot for storing the cards . That makes it easy to take on a trip or to the doctors office . This game also is wonderful because it is fun for older adults and younger children ( I would say for younger than or about age 7 to go ahead and purchase them the Jr. version ) . A fantastic gift for any age !
4 #### This was a gift and the little girl we got it for loved it per her mother . Great family game .
5 #### Other reviewers have explained the concept enough that it does n't need repeating again . This is an addictive game / puzzle . You pull out your card , set it up , and start to get your little red car off the grid ; and you find that you have think about it and work at it and practice and try different solutions before you can solve the problem . Some people can look at these types of puzzles and figure it out in their head . Others , like me , need the tactile experience of just trying and trying until you get it right . This gives you the opportunity to try solutions . The easy puzzles may be too easy for some but are just right for our children . The harder puzzles are too hard for them but are a just right challenge for my husband and father . Several things that I like : There is a place to store the cards . They wo n't get lost while you are working on a different puzzle . There is the opportunity to buy other cards to go with this puzzle so once you have solved all the ones that your going to solve out of the ones that came with the orginal set ; you can buy more cards for still more fun . There is a wide range of difficulties so that everyone in the family , except the very youngest , can try their hand at it . Enjoy .
5 #### This game is really a lot of fun . It is perfect for road trips or playing with your spouse on the couch . I am 24 and I still get a kick out of it . Makes a great gift too . I got it for my MIL to " test " her aging abilities !
5 #### My daughter received this as a birthday gift and we love it . It is a single player game , which is great for when she wants to play , but has nobody to play with . It 's also great for taking in the car on trips . It is great for developing the mathematical / problem solving part of the brain ! I even enjoy playing it myself . We have since bought 2 more as gifts .
5 #### Rush Hour is by far the most clever puzzle game I 've ever played - totally addictive and a fantastic brain workout , both for my adult mind and for kids as young as 4 ! As a teacher I used this game with great success to encourage my students to exercise planning and sequencing skills , I love the way the 40 challenges build in difficulty , allowing players to progress at their own pace while building confidence . I recently discovered the Rush Hour app for both iOS AND Android - this has 2,500 brand new challenges and a move - tracking feature , so you can bet I will be hooked for months to come !
2 #### The game concept is good , and I 'd heard it was very fun , but this version is made on the cheap . Extremely lightweight and flimsy , the base does n't feel like it would survive an accidental drop . I might get an older copy that is more substantial , but I do not recommend this game .
3 #### This is a really fun game , although I would n't start it on kids under age 8 without some adult help . I love to play Mastermind , and my ( older ) son and I have great fun with it . This version , however , is terrible . They 've given us a storage component that is divided into two pieces , but if you put all the pegs in one compartment , the door wo n't close . The smaller of the two compartments is supposed to be for the smaller pegs , but there is no way to keep them divided - they are all over each other in seconds . AND you do n't really get enough of the smaller pegs . Those that we do have include some that are broken . If you buy this anyway , I recommend placing all the larger pegs in one plastic bag , and all the smaller pegs in another small plastic bag , then shoving them into the box . The box is , oddly , taken up by a large piece of cardboard for no apparent reason - thereby deleting half the storage space for the game . I wo n't buy from this company again - but I sure do have fun with the game . I 'm off to buy replacement parts - if I can find them - so that we 'll have enough smaller pegs ....
2 #### Mastermind the game is a good game , but Pressman makes the worst quality components of any game manufacturer , and this game is no exception . The box is really flimsy and the colored pegs do not fit in the plastic container . Better to find an electronic version since it works better as a 1 player game .
5 #### This game is very versatile in changing game play to be appropriate for different ages . I ordered this game as a gift for my 5 yr old son . He plays this game all the time at a friend 's house . He loves it and gets it out of the game cabinet every chance he gets . The pieces are quite small , so I would n't have ordered it for anyone younger than him , but there is no reading required , so with adult supervision , any child can play . This game encourages logical and analytical thinking . With the smallest children , it is a study in recognizing their colors . With older players , you can really challenge each other .
4 #### Very cool toy ! My 3 year old loves it . Just wish this came in different colors .
5 #### My kids love playing with this register ! I purchased it along with the Melissa and Doug ice cream set and the kids will play with it for a long time . My kids are tough on their toys and this is holding up really well . I love how they love to play with it and are learning valuable skills as well .
5 #### Niece loves it . Looks like in the photo . As others mentioned , it 's odd to have 3 slots for bills when 4 denominations are provided . Since this is play money , it probably would 've been a better idea to shrink the bills so they could fit 4 across the width of the cash register . The solar panel seems to work fine even indoors ( indirect light ) .
4 #### We bought this to keep our grandkids entertained at our lakehouse on days we could n't be outside . Our five year old granddaughter was not interested but our seven year old grandson was hooked . He played for long stretches and advanced through the " levels " quickly . The adults like it too and grabbed it everytime he walked away .
5 #### I got this for my son two Christmas ' ago . Boy , does he LOVE it . He has mastered all the cards , but still goes back to the game . It will really keep your child busy . He was 6 when I purchased it and now at 8 years old it is one of his favorites . My 6 year old is next to get it . Absolute loved game . A must have for a childs collection . You ca n't go wrong with this one .
5 #### Rush to buy this amazing skillful game it is amazing for your brain very good for kids 8 plus their is also a yonger version Rush hour Jr. For ages 7 plus .
4 #### Got this for my 8 - 1/2 year old daughter and she played it quite a bit while on vacation . Now I ca nt stop playing ( there 's also an Iphone app ) . Hours of fun and strategic thinking !
1 #### I had Mastermind as a child and loved it . For our wedding , we registered for this - the new version . The box is CHEAP - it will fall apart very easily . It is also way too big for what is included inside . The plastic board is also cheap , and the wall between the two types of pegs does not keep the pegs from mixing , so you end up picking the different pegs out of the other slot - time consuming ! Plus , the trays are so poorly constructed that it is almost impossible to close the lid without getting pegs stuck so that it ca n't close . They should have just used the same construction as the old sets , and they 'd have been much better off .
4 #### We love Mastermind and graduated from Mastermind Jr. It 's a thinking game and it 's great because it only requires 2 people . Good game to play with a kid at the pool or anytime . Adults like this game as much as the kids .
5 #### We bought Rush Hour Jr. for christmas for my 6 and 5 year olds . They loved it and were on the most advanced level really quickly . Even my 4 year old could do it . We just got Rush Hour and it 's even better . I do n't know that there is much reason to get the Jr. My 4 year old was able to solve her first card ( on the regulard version ) right away , so there is plenty for kids to do on this one . I love it as well . The advanced cards are pretty challenging . I think it 's a great educational toy that is good for children and adults .
5 #### My only complaint is that I should have ordered at least two . My kids argue whose turn it is and/or become impatient waiting for their turn . Since the turns can be long , the impatience is understandable . My kids are 4 , 7 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 18 , and 21 . EVERYONE LOVES THIS GAME ! ! ! The 4 yr old loves to set up the cars . It 's great for her in developing matching and spatial relationships between objects . Then she moves the cars anyway she wants to win . I 'm definitely ordering the railroad and safari rush hours for my family . Great game !
5 #### I love this game ! I was introduced to it years ago , when I started my first job as a speech - language pathologist . It was included in my materials . The awesomeness is that it is highly interesting to a wide age range , and can be adapted . For instance , the younger kids ( preschool to 1st grade ) can have fun just putting the pieces in to match the puzzle cards . The older kids love trying to figure the puzzles out - and when they ca n't , it becomes a following directions exercise ! ! Even giving the directions is problem solving , because they are coded : " QD2 " means they move the car labelled Q down 2 spaces . I use this frequently as a reward in therapy , and bought one for my own kids too . It is a pretty good fine motor game too , as the plastic cars are light and do knock over fairly easily for the careless fingers . My only con ... some of the plastic pieces do n't match the colors on the puzzle cards very well .
5 #### The object of this game is to drive the red car between the cars and off the road . The card you choose will tell you how to set up the game . The other cars need to be moved to let the red car out . My children , ages 9 , 12 , and 14 love this game . I even enjoy playing it . It is challenging and you really have to think to get the red car out .
5 #### We do n't have TV or Video game in our home . So we bought this for my 4yrs old daugther who is excellent with puzzles , slide puzzles and games . I was a bit worried that it might be too hard for her but we have older kids too so we chose this instead of rush hour Jr. My daughter loves it and it is really fun . She and her siblings(7 , 8yrs ) do this at home , in the car . I love little travel pouch so all these little pieces can go in there . I love think fun product .
4 #### We got this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas & although she is admittedly smart , the game does n't seem as much of a challenge for her . The same holds true for any adult player . It has n't taken more than six lines to solve any given puzzle . However , my 7 year old loves it and is a bit more challenged , but will probably conquer the strategy pretty soon . Still , a classic game with classic , good family fun . I would buy it again and it was more appropriately priced at $ [ ... ] . The only drawback we 've seen is that the colors of the pegs were kind of " off " , as in not classic colors and they do n't all fit in their storage area so they fall out when trying to store away .
5 #### I had Mastermind as a child and it really helps you hone in you deductive skills . I still play it to this day . Just keep it out of the reach of small children when storing as it contains small pegs .
5 #### I bought this game for my 6yo for Christmas . She 's played it twice and as we speak , she 's working on card 24 ! Sure , at this rate this game will not last too long , but sure makes me feel proud ! ! And when she 's done , I can put the game away and pull it out in couple of months and start all over again . I do n't think I would buy this for a teenager . It wo n't take them that long to get all 40 levels done . BTW , I have n't had all that much time to play myself , but the higher numbers are sure challenging , so it 's fun for parents too .
5 #### Rush Hour is one of those great solitaire games that is fun for all ages . The object is set up the car , and trucks on a board according to a layout on a card . Then you have to slide the cars / trucks into the remaining spaces to allow for a clear path for the red car to exit out the side opening . Some only take 5 or 6 moves and others take 15 - 20 moves . It takes strategy to plan out which pieces need to be moved out of the way to allow for a clear exit . The cars / trucks can not be picked up and moved , they need to slide on the tracks which make the moves limited . The answer to each set up is on the back of each individual card . This comes with a set of cards from beginner level to advanced . One set of cards can be stored in the base of the set but the cars / trucks need a bag to keep them from getting lost . More card sets can be purchased to keep the fun going and each card set comes with an additional vehicle --&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Think - Fun - Rush - Hour-2 / dp / B00000JW9S / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Think Fun Rush Hour 2</a>,<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Rush - Hour-3 / dp / B00000JW9V / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Rush Hour 3</a>,<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Rush - Hour-4 / dp / B00004TDMM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Rush Hour 4</a > . My kids love playing ( ages 6 and 11 ) and I love playing as an adult .
5 #### There is a reason this game has stood the test of time . this game is very fun and very stimulating . we got this game for our 5 year old 's birthday . He 's a little young to play with no help , but it 's very easy to give hints or adjust for ability in this game and he is learning great deductive reasoning skills . And what kid does n't love to " crack a code " or make up a code themselves ? ! I wish that it was easier to get the pieces in the pockets to fold it up , but that is my only complaint .
4 #### I love the logic of this game and could n't wait to share it with my husband . Unfortunately it is not as fun for him because he has very large hands and fingers which make it impossible for him to position the pegs in the holes . This is a huge dissapointment for both of us .
5 #### Ah , it 's so nice when , as parents , our kids start getting into games that we can play that do n't drive US nutty ( Candyland , Hi Ho Cherrio , etc ) . Here 's a game that I can play with my 7 and 9 year olds but I have played with my husband as well . The premise of the game is simple ; the codemaker selects 4 colored pegs to be hidden in a pattern , the codebreaker tries to guess the code . When I play this game with my kids I can really see the proverbial wheels turning in their heads . At first we played this game in pairs so an adult could help guide the codebreaker in logical thinking and the codebreaker in how to give the correct feedback as to how the codebreaker is doing . My 7 year old can usually break the code ; if she 's really having a tough time with it and is getting horribly confused then she might get frustrated , but I see that as being a good thing to learn how to cope with . Princesses are not quitters ! In those cases I ( as codemaker ) might ask leading questions to help her get her thinking back on track . Anyway , this game is just as much fun when played adult vs adult ; it 's not just a kid 's game . Obviously when played vs. an adult you get the competetive juices flowing in a way you might not with your younger kids . A 5 star game , totally low tech but lots of fun .
5 #### Bought this for my daughter 's 9 yr old birthday , she absolutely loves it . At first , I was teaching her on the easier ones , after a week when we reached Expert level , she is better than me now . It 's a simple fun game everyone ( young or old , boy or girl ) loves , wonderful brain exercise ; and with other ThinkFun games , it 's stored in a pouch and played by one person , very convenient . We also have Brick by Brick and Chocolate Fix , both my daugher and I like Rush Hour the best .
5 #### As i review , i ca n't offer much more of an opinion than any of the other reviewers . All of it is true . I can add this though . My 4 yo . and 5 yo . are fighting over this . And i am sending them to bed early so i can play ........ if you are just ' thinking ' about it ...... don't have to . It 's a sure winner .......
4 #### I bought this game to play with my husband on our couple 's game night . It is not as challenging as I thought it would be . We have guessed the code within 7 or 8 tries every time we 've played . Nevertheless , we have fun playing it and it 's a great change from some of the other games we play .
5 #### This is an excellent toy , it makes you think while you 're having fun ! I keep it in the living room all the time .
5 #### This game is simple to explain , fun to play for all ages , adaptable to multiple skill levels and designed well -- what more could you ask . Opening the box you 'll find a set of plastic cars of varying length , a deck of 40 cards that give layouts for the cars that vary from fairly simple to dastardly . Once you set up the miniatures as depicted , the player 's task is to move the cars until a path is cleared for the target car to escape the gridlock . The game is well designed -- it includes a tray to hold the cards and a bag for the cars when not in use ; also , a card holder lets you display the current puzzle . Very nicely done !
5 #### Our family loves this game ! We got hooked on it at piano lessons . The teacher had it sitting on the table so while we were waiting ( 4 students ) we all took turns trying it ! That was almost 10 years ago ! Still the kids love it and want it in their own homes ! This game rocks !
5 #### It 's fun for ages 4 through 42 + . ;-) My kids loved setting it up for me to play when they were young ; now they 're playing it themselves .
5 #### My daughter has ADHD as well as learning disabilities . Her occupational therapist recommended this game and used it in her sessions . Even at 9 years old , she was somehow able to go through all the levels of the game ( something which most adults ca n't do ) . I would have NEVER thought my ADHD child would love this game . I knew I did but she is n't someone who sits down and concentrates on anything . I do n't know what makes this game special but it certainly accesses a part of her brain that other things do n't . Whether you or your child can go through all the levels , this game is worth the money . It teaches planning skills , critical thinking skills , spacial skills AND it is fun . I think this is my best toy purchase EVER ! It is not something that could be played in the car though -- too many pieces . But it does have a travel bag so you can use it at your destination !
4 #### We purchased this for my 5 yr . old son and he loves it , in fact I love it . It 's a great educational toy without being obviously educationally . The only thing I wish is that was built better . It 's cheap quality , but the game itself is good .
5 #### This game is very appealing to boys because it has cars , but also very educational because it is puzzles to solve which uses reasoning ! My son ( 5)has the JR . version and really likes it ! It also comes with a storage bag that I love and its easy to take with you .
5 #### This is fun to play on your own or compete against others . It 's easy to take on trips and is good for building problem solving skills .
5 #### It seems silly to pile more praise on a " toy " that has received so much positive feedback ; this puzzle / game / toy deserves all of it though . My son has had this for a couple of years now and it has been a constant source of entertainment . He pulls it out and it stays out for a week or more before going back on the shelf , and everyone in the family takes a turn at it . It is a great solitary game , though we have begun to add a timer ( a sand filled hour glass works perfectly ) just to take it up a notch .
5 #### It 's easier for adults , but working through the puzzles is still fun . My children 4 and 7 both love it too . They like working out the puzzles , but also like setting them up for other people ( double fun ) . So far no one has come into our house and without being sucked into a couple of rounds .
5 #### I was never interested in this game and passed it by for years , as it reminded me of those sliding number puzzles I had decades ago where you mix up the numbers and try to get them back in order . I finally broke down and purchased it at Barnes and Noble when I had a gift card burning a hole in my pocket , and realized what an interesting game it really is . It 's great for visual and strategic thinking , and it comes with a number of cards , each providing a different challenge . And , for whatever reason , it is really quite fun to slide the plastic cars around on the board . My kids ( 6 and 8) love it too .
5 #### My husband and I gave this game to our daughter for Christmas . When she first unwrapped the present she looked uninterested . Later that day she pulled it out and asked what it was about . We got it out and tried it out . Instantly she was hooked as was I. This game is really a great game , but it is also a wonderful educational product . It truly teaches thinking skills and as a homeschool parent I can truly appreciate that . I highly recommend this for anyone regardless of where or how your children are schooled ! ! ! !
5 #### This ' game ' will most likely be a winner with anyone 5 or beyond who likes solving puzzles . I originally purchased Rush Hour as a gift for my 5 year old son who loves puzzles . However , it was so much fun that I found myself pulling the game out while my son was asleep and driving solo . Since that time several of my relatives have joined in on the fun during family visits . So this Christmas we purchased additional copies of the game to give as gifts to family members who asked for it . While the packaging is poor , the game surely soars .
5 #### I have given the " Rush Hour " game , and its affiliated versions , " Rush Hour Junior " and " Safari Rush Hour " to several kids for birthdays etc . It has always been a huge hit . Give one set to your own kid , because you will have fun playing it yourself . Fun , but uses the little gray cells . What more could you want ? Happy Reader
5 #### Lots of fun for playing store ! Grandchild(4 years old ) a bit small to figure out the way it words and not yet grasping the math , but hoping as she gets older she uses it more . :)
5 #### The object is to get the red car out of a traffic jam in this easy - to - learn , but tricky puzzle . There are four difficulty levels , from beginner to expert , and would suit anyone willing to try it . Trucks and cars must be pushed out of the way to get the red car out . It 's unlikely that you 'll find this too easy ; the expert ones are really tough . If you 're stuck , look on the back of the card to see the solution . In summary , I think this is a good and fun way to flex your mental muscles .
5 #### My 3 year old grandson loves playing bank and shopping with this set . He has learned all the coin and currency names .
5 #### Purchased as a gift for a 4 year old boy , he loved it .
5 #### Second time I bought this and this time it was for a Christmas gift . The beeping when the credit card is swiped is a cute bonus . Adults will want to play with this too !
5 #### Very nice quality and get for all ages . A great learning tool .
5 #### This was a Christmas gift and our LO loved it . Has a nice amount of play money and the credit card and slot just put it over the top . He loves to grocery shop and play cashier whenever he can . As an added bonus we are now starting to count money and this set works perfectly for explaining and showing coins .
5 #### Grandson loved receiving this in his Easter Basket . He loves to play grocer or shopping
5 #### This is a fun play cash register . Comes with plenty of play money .
4 #### My daughter loved it , but the sound that was supposed to work when the credit card is slid through did n't hardly work .
5 #### My preschoolers love this . We are practices strategies for taking turns :) Well made and educational .
5 #### This is another great toy by learning resources . I bought this for my daughter when she was 2 . Now 3 she still plays with it daily . She loves punching the numbers in , but her favorite part is the open button that ejects the spring loaded drawer . I put the coins away until she is older , because I fear she will choke on them . She loves the paper money and the pretend credit card . I can see her and my son playing with this toy for at least 10 more years . It is very durable . She has dropped it many times and it has n't skipped a beat . The plastic is high quality . I would definitely buy this product again . Note there is another one that looks exactly the same but it has a scale by the same company .
1 #### It 's just a big calculator nothing else . I thought it would say the numbers when you punched a number or the scanner tool would beep to pretend to scan and it makes no sound
5 #### I was surprised this was so well made . Not only did my son start " selling " individual items but the began using the + & = keys , so learning addition .
4 #### Both my kids really like this cash register . The only draw back is the drawer opens really fast and a lot of the change flies out and on to the floor . Other than that , it 's cute , and fun !
5 #### This game is very fun . Not too hard to learn . This particular edition is very good . It 's the one we grew up with .
5 #### Ca nt go wrong with Stratego to burn time . My favorite board game and takes skill to selectively place your pieces and conquer your opponent
5 #### Our daughtet got this for her 3rd birthday and loves it .
5 #### Christmas gift for grandson . who is 5 years old . Learning about money and playing grocery store !
4 #### Great educational toy . Kids love it . All my toddlers enjoy playing with this .
3 #### I bought this as an introduction to strategy games for my six - year - old year son . As others have said , this is different than the Stratego of the 1980 's . The old pieces were etched with the soldier 's profile and number ; the new pieces have stickers . I no longer have the old version to compare it to , but the new pieces seem cheaply made . The board is okay and has decent artwork . The biggest difference is that all the numbers have been reversed . My first thought was why do I have so many Marshalls ? How am I going to clear the enemy bombs with only two 8 's ? The changes in numbers and the build quality do not make this an unplayable game by any means . If I 'd never played Stratego before I would n't have noticed the numbering difference ( my son certainly did n't care ) . So that change is just nostalgia kicking in and I wo n't knock the game down for that . I will knock it for the build quality . Stratego , for me , is a four - star game , but due to the quality of the pieces in this edition three stars seems fair . My now eight year - old - son and I have moved on to more complex Eurogames , but we still play a round of Stratego every once in a while . For about a year , this was our go - to game and we enjoyed many hours of gameplay .
5 #### Same game that I remember from my youth ! Was able to ship to APO and share with my unit , catching some Soldiers up on strategy more than just sending your higher ranks to the slaughter ( no one beat me though ) . Excellent condition on arrival .
5 #### kids love it ! it teaches how to use a calculator the way the keyboard functions sequence . Great fun !
5 #### 5 year old grandson loves this cash register . He is learning addition and multiplication using it .
5 #### My 4 and 6 year old play with this all the time . Even now 3 months later .
3 #### The register keys never made sounds and the ring when it opened was so muffled you could barely hear it . I even tried new batteries , still did n't work .
5 #### All the children were arguing over who would get to play with it first .
5 #### Very nice . The notepad got destroyed right off the bat , but that 's my kids for you . It 's also slightly larger than we thought . But good quality and solid .
5 #### What I like about this game is that it 's got the same kind of strategy and logical thinking that chess takes , but adds an unpredictable dimension by allowing the players to set up their pieces differently at the start of each game with the rank of pieces hidden from the opponent . Like chess or other two player games based upon moves only , this one is n't as fun when the skill level difference is too great as there is no getting lucky with dice or other random events . However , it can still be a fun adult / child game and helps build memorization skills . This is a fun game and I recommend it .
5 #### Love this register , makes noise , dings open , has look alike credit cards , coins and dollar bills . We had the dollar bills laminated and it would be nice if they would come this way because we all know how kids wrinkle and tear paper . But we love this register for having a make believe grocery store .
5 #### perfect for a pretend Kitchen setup and a little grocery store for your child .
4 #### Very nice . Good learning toy . Only problem is that when you open the drawer it comes out so quickly the money flies out of the drawer .
5 #### My six year old daughter love it . That 's all that matters .
5 #### If you love strategy games this is the best thing after chess . And this game , unlike chess , is easy to learn ( Altough it will take time to master ) . This is one of the best two player games you can find . Once you start you will not want to put this game away . All you have to do is setup your army in a way that you can protect your flag while trying to capture your oponent 's . Higher ranking soldiers capture weaker ones . It 's that simple . Once you master this game you will want to try the four player Stratego . And if you really like a challenge you must get the Fantasy Stratego . There is also the Star Wars version ... Well I will not bore anymore . Just buy this game , you will not be sorry .
5 #### If you love strategy games , then you must love Stratego . It is all about strategy . You prepare your battle field , army , bombs & flag then when the game starts you have to strategize when to attack , defend or retreat ! Chess is a very classic game that I love ... it is very classic . If Chess is the game of the early ages , Stratego is the game of the 20th century . If you are a professional Chess player you 'd become a professional Stratego player as well . [ ... ] Play this game with smart & challenging players and you 'd have the time of your life .
5 #### This cash register is terrific . My four year old grandson loves it . It has money ; dollars and change . It is a little computer . The drawer swings out . What 's not to like ? I had purchased another one for him for Christmas from another company through Amazon , and it was broken when it arrived . I sent it back and got a full refund . But I noticed the money was in Euros , which is nice for countries who use Euros , but would have been confusing to an American child . At any rate , we LOVE the new one and would highly recommend it .
4 #### I read several reviews before buying . Not sure why I agonized so much over a play cash register , but nonetheless ... this is what I expected after reading them . It only has 3 drawers for money but not really a deal breaker . Both the paper and coin money that come with it are decent for play . It 's nice that it is a calculator , and I have not had any of the problems that some people have with it being solar powered . As long as a light is on in the room , it works just fine . And yes , the drawer does come flying out but again - not a deal breaker , it 's just a toy cash register . My son likes it and plays with it , so that 's what really matters with a toy , right ?
5 #### Stratego is a war game , but involves hidden ranks , unlike most others . The goal is to get the flag . Both players set up their army of 40 pieces , hidden from their opponent 's view . Players move , battles being one by the higher ranking man . There are bombs , which can only be diffused by miners . Spies can defeat marshalls . There are 12 ranks / things in all . The set up allows for several strategies . You can create a decoy flag , put your higher ranking men in front , whatever . This game is unpredictable because of the various strategies and easy to learn . I suggest this for anyone who likes strategy board games .
5 #### Grandson loves his cash register . Plays with it a lot .
5 #### Our son saw this in one the preschools we visited and really wanted one ! I was so happy to find it on Amazon . he got right into it and loves to say " my friends all call me calculator * * * ( I left his name out ) . It is a great learning tool for all sorts of pretend play and practical application . Money makes begins to mean something real to a 4 year old , and it is just great as a teaching math tool as well if your child wants to know more . This cash register is also very very sturdy and really does take a lot of use .
3 #### I m normally a fan of all learning resource products and this was the first one to disappoint me . When you push the buttons it sounds like a tiny mouse squeak . And when you open the drawer it come flying out . I think it would be nice to have enough dollar slots to seperate all denominations of the included bills . My kids love it- but I expected a bit more for the price .
4 #### 5yr old and 8yr old daughter love playing store w this - good quality
5 #### The first one we got that was a gift did n't work so that was pretty disappointing . Amazon shipped another one out , and I had to return the one that did n't work . So he is a happy little boy now .
5 #### 7 year old daughter loves it . Exactly as described .
5 #### Best cash register I 've seen for kids . " Real " money . Calculator works . Well made . Has a small pad ( size of regular post - it notes ) which is cool too .
5 #### One of the better cash registers out there for kiddos . The sounds could be louder but I 'm just glad it does n't look and act like a toddlers toy .
5 #### it is very nice toy my grandchildren love it
3 #### It 's cute but thought it would have more options and make sounds .
4 #### The kids really enjoy playing with the register but it could use a few more features to keep their interest .
5 #### Realistic and cute looking register with tone and money . Kids will love it . Pros : Realistic looking money . Great sounds . Great feel of money and register . Lightweight . Cons : Not enough slots for bills , but hey it 's a kid register so its got ta be small , and the currency has to stay true to size .
5 #### My granddaughter loves this toy . She got it for the holidays . Good learning tool .
5 #### My child loves it . For a few weeks lol
5 #### This was given to Toys for Tots last Saturday .
5 #### My two and four year old love this ! The play money is kind of irritating because it never seems to stay with the register , but his is a great tool to teach social interactions and math . It 's well built and seems like it will last awhile .
4 #### granddaughter really likes the " real " money sized bills & coins notepad & credit card are sort of wasted area of cash register for her overall nice toy that gets a lot of use
4 #### It feels a little bit cheap , but not nearly as cheap as the other kids cash registers we 've had . This one is a bit more heavy duty , and the fact that it comes with all the play money is a huge plus . It does n't quite beep loud enough when you press the keys , but other than that it works exactly like you 'd expect . You press a key to open the drawer and it pops open very nicely !
5 #### I purchased this intending to use it for homeschooling . We have n't really used it in an academic sense , but the ability to do so is there . Our son can add and subtract money quite well , so it wo n't be used in that way for him and he was n't terribly interested in doing it anyway . Our daughter , though , who is 2.5 absolutely loves this thing and she and he ( 8 now ) play with it ALL the time . I had to put it up because coins were everywhere . I will take it out every other week or so when it can be a little supervised ( they clean up the mess , but we do n't need it easily accessible on days where the mess all over the rest of the house is larger than normal . This is a great toy for academic or play pursuits ! Would buy again ! Oh , and it came with a shopping basket , apron , name tag , and a bunch of play food boxes and store signage . Really a great set !
1 #### Biggest disappointment in a toy i have ever seen . First of the quality of this thing is atrocious . The solar powered calculator is really weak , you need a good lighted room for the calculator to work . Another flaw especially your place is a bit on the darker side . The plastic is such horrible quality that its not even close to be worth the price they are selling this for ... it should be 5 bucks at most , not even . Rip off quality at a rip off price . Such a huge waste of a purchase .
5 #### We purchased this to go with the pretend grocery store that we are building for our son . We liked the price , that it is a real working calculator , and that it has won awards . He is going to have so much fun playing and learning with it . It arrived on time .
3 #### Worth 20 bucks and not a penny more , just because this one , and the red one like it , are not even half the quality they were just a few years ago . Now they are cheap and flimsy . Like the Presidency .
3 #### My 8 year old daughter loves this cash register and uses it daily . It 's both educational and fun ! However , there is an issue that I feel other parents should be aware of and that is the fact that the cash drawer opens too fast or with too much force . This along with jagged corners can be unsafe and potentially cause harm . As evidenced by the scratch that my daughter received on her right inner forearm during her first day of play with this item . When the drawer opened the top right corner of the drawer caught her inner arm . After applying some Barbie band - aids and shedding a few tears she is very aware of this issue and keeps her arms out of the way when the drawer opens . Although she loves it and wants to continue to play with it I 'm definitely going to make sure it 's put away when my preschool aged nieces / nephews visit .
5 #### I have three little girls and they LOVE to play with their food and grocery carts ; pretend play cook and shop . We already had one register of a different brand that was a lot more complicated ; honestly I prefer this simpler one . It just has a calculator , no math games , no weird songs or noises ; but it makes an awesome " cha - ching " sound when the money drawer is opened ! It comes with an array of realistic cash and change , which is super fun . The money is just paper and plastic ; I have a laminator so I just laminated the cash and it has a bit of an issue fitting in the drawers if you are not careful to cut the laminator plastic along the edge . Still , it works and it should last a long time now . :) It also comes with a cute little credit card , which if my previous register proved ... will be quickly lost . It just does n't have the same appeal to the kids as the money ! Overall I am super happy . It 's basic but solid and comes with the money , which is nice . I definitely recommend it !
5 #### Realistic money . My grandson loves to ring up purchases and he 's learning to count money . Very happy with my purchase !
4 #### This is a great device for using and learning about money . I really like it a lot . We are using this to replace a much inferior cash register for the little girl . She is 7 so she likes a calculator and things that open when she pushes the button . What I like about it is that she is able to use it like a bank . Regular money fits in here . She collected her allowance today and put it right in there . She has several banks but this is the first one she has used to put money in . She even looked all over her room to find money .
5 #### My daughter used this all summer as a calculator and money storage place for her lemonade stand sales
5 #### DS loves this cash register . It makes quiet sounds and the play money looks realistic .
3 #### Bought it for girl scouts and let me 6 and 3 year - olds play with it . Lasted less than 48 hours before they broke the drawer . :( they were n't overly rough . It just seemed flimsy .
2 #### Awesome idea for pretend play but the buttons get stuck making it very difficult for my 7 year old to open the register .
5 #### I 'm a teacher at a preschool and I bought this toy cash register for the children in my classroom . First , it came with play money which is great but that quickly got ripped , which is fine because the children enjoyed making their own play money . I love that it has sounds and is easy for the children to use . It also incorporates a little math which is nice . Overall a great buy !
5 #### My child love this toy and wants to play with it every day ! It 's a great way to learn about money and math !
5 #### My granddaughter loves this ! She plays store at Gramma 's house all the time !
5 #### I bought this for my five year old niece 's birthday . She really enjoys it . Her mother likes it because it makes learning basic math skills fun .
5 #### This register came highly recommended and at the time it was being offered for a really good price . I took a chance and ordered it and it has been a great purchase for us . My kids and granddaughter love to play shop or restaurant and cash my purchases or meal out . The register works like a basic calculator and although my granddaughter has n't quite got the concept - she still finds great joy in playing with it . It seems to be built well and looks like it will lend itself to years of fun .
5 #### Purchased this as a gift for my niece , but my son has the red version and we love it so I knew it would be a good buy ! I am always happy with the quick prime shipping and my niece is 3 and LOVES collecting monies so this was an exciting gift to give her ! She wanted to open it right away and was so happy when she opened it . It is a register that can grow with a kid too , the number keys work as a real calculator and the money is very realistic looking ( especially compared to other fake money sets I have seen ) . This register is a great size , the drawer pops out flinging change everywhere which my son thinks is hilarious :) Overall great find and buy . I have had one mom that was over with her son for a playdate go to Amazon and buy this after seeing it at my house and I have liked it enough to buy it for my niece as well . Needless to say we are a fan of this register !
4 #### My 6y / o is having a blast w it . It 's thick plastic so it 's durable enough to survive his and his 2y / o rough housing . My son plays store and can now give correct change
3 #### For the price I paid ( right at $ 35 - around Christmas ) I do n't think it 's worth the money . It 's basically a large calculator that beeps when you ' swipe ' the card . Also the little notepad is cute , but once it runs out there is just an empty spot . My biggest issue is the drawer slams when it opens causing all the toy change to fly everywhere . This happens every . single . time . The toy money itself is fantastic and realistic but , when the drawer opens it flies all over the place . My daughter still enjoys playing with it ( six months later ) . But , she has asked me numerous times to fix the drawer . And I have no idea how you would even do that . Bottom line : cute , toy money is awesome , drawer is super annoying .
5 #### grand daughter loves it , she is six years old this keeps her going . only thing she says grandpa can you help me fill up the drawers with any loose change . smart girl .
3 #### Great product for toddlers but a little over priced .
5 #### I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter because she likes playing grocery store . She 's too young to understand the full concept but I think she 'll be able to play with this for a long time .
5 #### It works so well I might let my daughter play with it !
5 #### My kids , 7,4 , and almost 2 love love love this ! They have set up many a shop around the house and my 7 year old and I have used the money while doing her math homework . Great for imaginative play , math practice , number recognition , fine motor skills , and a touch of real life ( stuff costs money ! ) .
5 #### my son loved it . quite sturdy and useful for small kids . he specially liked the open button.one suggestion since this toy is used by small kids currency notes could be made from plastic or more sturdy material . Excellent toy .
5 #### This cash register is a fun thing for my Grandkids to play with . They love it . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### This register works great and keeps my 6 year old busy for hours . She loves playing store . Money looks pretty real too , which is important because she 's learning to count money .
5 #### Huge hit . Nice size . Feels real . My son loved it .
5 #### We have had one of these for a few years and my 5 and 2.5 year olds love it . We just purchased another as a gift for a 3 - year - old and he is over the moon . The kids love playing with the calculator and sorting the coins . Their favorite part is the " open " button that opens the drawer ! This is a well - made cash register toy and ours has survived quite a lot of hard play .
5 #### Bought for grandson - Hasn't opened yet but I know he will love it . He 's really into calculators .
4 #### My daughter absolutely loves this . It 's really helping us practice counting money and reinforcing what she 's learning in 1st grade . We love to play store with it and take turns being the customer and cashier . The dollars are a little hard to separate at first because they are so flat ( just like new dollar bills ! ) .... but a little wrinkling of them solved the problem quickly . The coins are very realistic and true to size like real coins . The only downfall I can really see is that it does n't take a standard AA or AAA battery . It takes a 1.5 volt coin type batter . It does auto shut off after a little bit of time though which would save on battery usage . It 's the only reason why I dropped the stars by 1 . I have oodles of AA and AAA batteries but of course .. not the coin batteries ! Otherwise , this little cash register is super !
5 #### My kids love this register . It really adds , and the money is fun . Very pleased with this toy .
5 #### Great way to teach young kids to use calculator and count money .
4 #### My five year old daughter loves this cash register .
5 #### My 5 year old can count money as good as i. Good price
5 #### GREAT EDUATION TOOL HELPS CHILDREN WITH MATH AND HELPS TO START A FOUNDATION OF MONEY MANGEMENT
5 #### This Learning Resources play cash register is such a great way to teach my kids about money ! Once the novelty of opening and closing the drawer wore off , we were able to begin discussing how to count money and which denominations were worth more . My 6 year old has known how to identify certain coins for a while , but she is now understanding how many pennies it takes to make a dollar , etc . Not only can she count the money , she can also count back change ! My 3 year old loves playing with his sister , and she loves being his teacher . I could have never predicted how many hours they would each spend playing with this toy . The cash register is plastic , with a functioning solar powered calculator . It makes a ka - ching noise when the money drawer opens , and has paper bills , plastic coins , and a pretend credit card . My kids have been pretty gentle with this toy ( more so than other toys ) , but is has taken a couple accidental falls from higher surfaces such as our cat stand ( do nt ask ) without incurring any damage . Not only has this toy been academically stimulating to my children , it has encouraged pretend play and social interaction . My 3 year old incorporates Batman into every play scenario in house , and Batman proudly guards the money in this register ! My children are enjoying this so much that I m going to buy some additional play money to use with it .
4 #### Great toy . My daughter loves it . She 's a bit young for the math component since she 's in pre - k , but it 's very entertaining and I look forward to her getting more out of it as she becomes more proficient in math .
5 #### Who knew this toy register would also be a helpful tool for learning lower school math ! We put real money in it so it would help our kid learn the difference between the change coins . We pretend to hold Shopkins sales , so she totals the purchases and gives change ! ! ! Play - based learning is a WIN - WIN ! ! ! !
5 #### I teach Kindergarten . My students have been begging me for a cash register forever . I recommend this one . The buttons make a slight beeping noise ( but not enough to annoy the teacher , lol ) so it sounds real . The card " slides " but no actually sound is made . It 's just a plain slot . The money is a good replica of the real thing and the coins are nice too . It has held up so far . It also comes with a small notepad . My students have enjoyed it . I would buy it again . It 's sturdy .
5 #### First one had a defective solar display but our replacement was awesome . The calculator works . Teaches older kids to count money . The younger have a ball playing store .
5 #### This toy has been a favorite in our house for a long time now . It can be used in so many ways that I would recommend it to anyone ! My kids use it when they play restaurant , store , library ( to check out books ) The money is great for teaching about counting and money . I see this being in our playroom for many years , And it is made really well so I know it will last too !
4 #### The kids have fun with it and it works great , but I received a pink version instead of the color as shown in the photo .
3 #### This register seems to be good quality , however I do n't like that there are n't enough slots for the different types of bills . You have to double up on two different types of bills in order to fit them in and that can be confusing to a child . Also , they make another version with a scanner and it actually tells you how much a product is and then has the kids do the math on the calculator . I think it 's worth the extra investment . My oldest is five , so this might just be more fitting for an older child who already understands more about money and arithmetic .
5 #### Both my 2 and 4 year old still play with this quite often and its been about 2 years now since we purchased this and its still going strong .
5 #### My granddaughter loves this . I bought this for her 4th birthday . She likes to play store .
5 #### Amazing quality cash register . My Son has played with this toy for well over a year now . He especially loves the money and coins that come with it . Definitely a very high quality toy and would recommend it to anyone .
5 #### One of the best register toys I 've ever bough . Great quality , money / coins are good quality too .
2 #### This is a cute cash register for kids and the money is realistic looking . We are disappointed however that it arrived in a non- working condition . The included battery for the beep sounds was present , but the beeps did n't work when pressing keys . We replaced the battery and still no beeps . The calculator function works on solar power so it was fine . Disappointed because the grandkids would of liked the beeping sounds like a real cash register . We are not returning because it 's too much of a hassle for a 30 $ toy .
5 #### Two years and still works great ! My 6 and 3 year old love playing with this cash register . It has enough " realistic " features without over - doing it .
3 #### This is technically a very nice little cash register with a built in solar - powered calculator . The concept of money , customer service and math are all utilized and it 's a great product for those purposes . Love the product for that reason . 2 big complaints : 1 . The solar - powered calculator is extremely annoying overall . My daughter can only see the digits on the calculator if she 's got it under a light or in the window . It will totally stop working otherwise and she gets upset . There is a battery in the unit but no idea what it 's for since it wo n't work when it 's not in direct line of a light source . 2 . The cash drawer flies open every time , causing the money to fly out everywhere . And it would be nice if the unit could make some kind of noise when you swipe the credit card . But whatever . Overall , good product , but could use some tweaks .
5 #### My children used the old fashioned version of this toy growing up . Now I 've given my Grandson this toy and he enjoys playing with it as much as his parents did with the old fashioned one . Great toy and I 'm glad there is a ' Modern ' version now .
1 #### Arrived in pink . Would of loved to give as a Xmas gift . Just sent it back .
2 #### I ordered this red / blue register for Christmas . It looked just like the register they use in my grand daughter 's preschool The box clearly showed what I ordered however on Christmas morning a pink register was removed from that box and I was looking forward to the " cha - ching " sound when opening cash drawer . I want to exchange it for the one I actually ordered but my 5 year old grand daughter does n't want me to take it from her
5 #### All grandkids love this . We bought this based on reviews . Spouse liked it , but I was skeptical . Reviews were correct . All the kids have loved it so far . All kids are 5 and under . I imagine that when they are learning to count money it will be helpful too .
2 #### This product did not ring or make any sounds . I returned this item .
5 #### Purchased as a gift for my grand - daughter and I 'm sure she will love it .
3 #### I bought this for my 9 year old . His dream is to own a restaurant when he gets older and he loves to play restaurant at home . This adds to the fun and I 'm trying to show him I support his dream . In addition , this helps him to learn how to manage money because he has a few bills in his wallet and has to spend them to pay for the food when we play . He 's also learning how quick money goes when it 's spent and how to count it to make sure he 's not ripped off by getting the wrong change back or the other way around . This register has So many benefits . I gave 3 stars though because it does n't come with alot of coins nor bills . Plus , it only works in a really really bright light or our blinds and curtains have to be open for in order for the calculator to work . I 've owned solar power calculators before and they work just fine in our house lighting . I 'm not sure why this register does n't .
4 #### I enjoy playing Taboo and always get a few laughs out of it , but a half hour is plenty . I find party games like Cranium , Balderdash and Rigamarole are far better at keeping a group 's attention and interest .
4 #### It was a gift , but I know the little girl is happy
5 #### This is quality . Works great . Ca n't wait to give to my granddaughter for Christmas . I am giving her the Melissa and Doug Snacks and Sweet Food Cart . A great teaching tool also .
5 #### Works well . My grandson has me buying stuff from him all the time . LOL !
1 #### Broken when I opened it ... " Open " button is jammed after 5 minutes out of the box . Disappointing present for my 3 year old !
5 #### I just bought this game recently and could n't stop playing it from the minute I started ! Let me tell you about Taboo : 1 . It kills time ! 2 . Sooooooooooooo much FUN ... that sometimes you lose time laughing instead of helping your team :-) 3 . It gets those small minded people very annoyed , mad and angry when they lose or fail ... which I enjoy :-) 4 . You lose control ... 5 . Very challenging if played between good teams . 6 . Once you start you can never stop playing it . To me this game beats Pictionary , Charades and many others ...
5 #### This game is easy to learn and a great party game . The rules are basically to try to get your team to say a word without using the five restricted words . I suppose you score per word , but we never keep score . As a nonexistent example , there might be a card with " breakfast " as the word and " food " , " pancake " , " morning " , " eat " , and " waffle " on it . It 's entertaining watching someone try to explain a word without being able to use one that they really want to . I recommend this for any family or group of friends .
5 #### This game is a fast moving game where you have to make your parter guess this word without you using the Taboo words . The educational value is the thinking on words but not using the Taboo words which at times could be hard . I recommend you buy this game . Really fun .
5 #### I was totally hooked after the first time I played this game . It really makes you think on your feet as you try to get your teammates to guess the highlighted word on your card without saying the other printed " taboo " words . After a few turns , I caught on to the idea of describing the actual word or putting it in a reference that my teammates would understand . It was hysterical hooking up with close friends or family who could figure out what I was trying to get at with odd clues that no one else quite understood . I told my Mother about this game and she was excited to learn and we bought it for a party . Some of the guests were apprehensive about playing at first , but after watching the rest of us , they all wanted to join in . This is a great game to play with 4 or more people with guaranteed laughs . As far as the buzzer goes ... it is a bit annoying , but the guys especially enjoyed using it when time ran out or a taboo word was said . I think it added to the laughs and the fun of the game . After playing a few times , you become accustomed to the particular word set , so I recommend the booster sets as well as the newer edition of the game . PLEASE BUY THIS . I GUARANTEE YOU WILL HAVE FUN !
5 #### Bought this when my son was in kindergarten learning about different coins and their values . Both my kids love playing grocery store and happily use this along with their shopping cart and kitchen . Money is very life - like and sound effects and credit card an added bonus . Would definitely recommend . I love Learning Resources products !
5 #### Awesome gift for a 4 - 5 year old boy or girl . It provides with a lot of pretend playtime while it teaches basic concepts !
4 #### Candy Land promises a world of bright colors , joyous fun , and sweet delights . But what is this cotton candy fantasy world really teaching your children ? From the moment the deck is shuffled , the winners and losers of Candy Land are pre - ordained . Lulled by the empty promises of sugary rewards , children across the world learn to mindlessly accept their fate and happily play out the cards that they are delt . Moving from color to color , the populous of Candy Land are completely subjegated to their inevitable journey . No amount of desire , planning , or work , can alter the game 's outcome . The lack of dice or a spinner guarantees that luck does n't even come into play in the saccharine world of Candy Land . A recent study conducted on Gamblers Anonymous members by the Developmental Psychology department at a leading Nevada Universtiy indicates that the favorite childhood game of lifelong gambling addicts was Candy Land . Is this really the message you want to give to your children ? Allow your children to choose their own fate ! ! ! Resist the sweet temptations of Candy Land ! ! !
5 #### Like many other people , I too played this game as a child and have great memories of teaching my younger brother and little cousins how to play . It incorporates learning the colors and taking turns . This newer version however incorporates more of a story with actual characters to it which was not in my version ( I am a child of the 70 's ) and I found that part to be unnecessary and a bit confusing . This tends to be a good game for 4 - 5 year olds and I would definately consider it to be a rite of passage that any child learn to appreciate this game .
5 #### Fun , educational toy . Works great . My daughter loves it . Comes with pretend money and a credit card .
5 #### As I type this review , my kids ( young adults ) and their grandparents are playing Pit . The grandparents introduced us to this game and we often play at their house . When I saw this DELUXE version of Pit , that comes with a bell , I just had to get it for them ! A simple game to learn , ALL ages can enjoy this game together . 7 year olds could play this game and the adults do n't necessarily have an advantage over the kids , which makes it fun for everyone . Be ready to be LOUD - right now I can hear shouts of " Three , three , three " and laughter and I 'm not even on the same floor as the Pit - Players ! I read in another review that this game was introduced in 1904 . Obviously , this is a game that has staying power ! Is n't it great that even with modern technology which allowed me to purchase this game online , we can enjoy games that were invented decades ago ! Turn off the TV , and spend time with your family playing games . Go make some memories ! ...
4 #### As expected , kids enjoy this , money is hard to keep tabs on , but if you teach your kids to keep it all together , they most likely will play with it longer .
5 #### Great learning toy for children from 3 - 10 , in my opinion . Kids love playing store , and this register allows for some good creative , as well as educational , play .
5 #### Great toy ! I do n't like to spend this much money on a toy , but , the kids have been asking for a cash register for a long time . I am impressed that this toy is still working like it is supposed to , even after it has been thrown , dropped , fought over , spilled on .... This is definitely a boy - proof toy ( well at least for the first month ) . I appreciate that it came with pretend money but that was scattered quickly .
4 #### Nice ! Only complaint is that the money drawer pops out pretty fast and spills the money . We 've learned to block it a little bit .
3 #### The concept of paper and coin money is something unfamiliar to my grandchildren , so consequently , they use credit cards when playing store .
5 #### Wow ! What can I say ? This is a great play register for playing as well as learning to count money . It came in mint condition , is sturdy and everything works as expected . The coin money that came with it are clear , you can tell a dime from a penny easily . The paper money , $ 1 , $ 5 , $ 10 and $ 20 are printed well and came secured separately . I am more than pleased with this item and am looking forward to assisting my child with counting money and having fun at the same time .
5 #### The money looks so real ! Sometimes when I find a random bill sitting out I get excited and consider pocketing it . The sounds it makes are responsible they will not drive you crazy like other cash register products I have had before .
3 #### I bought this register because of the high reviews on it , however when I received it , the drawer was stuck and stopped working after the 1st use . Since it came damaged , I was able to return it and have my money refunded . My son really wants another one but I have not replaced it because I 'm afraid of the same thing happening again :(
5 #### My 3yo and even 1yo like to play this . It 's a fun game , I hope it does n't get old too fast .
5 #### This is a wonderful board game to play with your children and grandchildren
5 #### Classic game I played when I was a child and now I am playing it with my two daughters . Highly recommend .
5 #### Really nice for kids who love to count money !
5 #### This thing is sturdy . My kids have not treated it gently and it works great . I like how the receipts are just post it notes , making it easy to find refills . The buttons are nice and big and we enjoy the sound it makes when opened . The money is cute and real sized . This product is better than the cheap junk grocery sets you find . I 'm using it now to keep track of " mom bucks . " A reward system for kids . Totally recommend !
2 #### Got as a Christmas gift . Broke less than 6 months later . Was very fun for the kids while it worked , but it just locked up and you ca n't open the drawer or run the calculator . Poor quality ! ! !
4 #### PROS : * Easy - to - read , large buttons & LCD display * Extremely durable ; ours has taken several spills without so much as a scratch * Satisfying bell " ding " when drawer opens * Long - lasting battery * Right number of calculator functions not too many as to be overwhelming for younger children CONS : * Paper pad does n't stay put * Credit card does n't do anything * Fake currency could be on thicker paper , and accurately sized ( my children wanted to use their real allowance money but it did not fit ) * Primary colors are overwhelming ... wish this was also available in neutral ( or metallic ? ) colors for those of us teaching easily overstimulated children ( I did look at wooden registers before purchasing this one , but decided against them because they were , if anything , more childish , with no calculators ) PRO TIP : * Tape on a post - it note pad when the note pad runs out , and attach a pen / pencil ( if using a pen on a cord , like those at banks , make sure the cord does not pose a strangulation hazard )
4 #### My kids like to play ' store ' , and this is a nice little register . The play money is full - sized , and the coins have a good heft to them . The credit card slot actually beeps , which my kids like , although they try to ' swipe ' it through instead of sliding it and stopping . The register opens with a satisfying ' ding ' . My only complaint is that the calculator and the register do n't seem to have any logic in common - it 's just a calculator . It would be nice if the screen would interact with the register , such as saying ' approved ' when the credit card is used , or ' thank you ' when you open the drawer , or if it had a bit of register logic , like making change - although you can mock that last one up with the calculator pretty easily . However , that 's a minor quibble , and it does n't really detract from the fun my kids are having with it .
2 #### This was great when we first got it . I was excited about the solar to power instead of lots of batteries . However , 4 months later , it 's not working at all . The drawer opens but the display is dead . I 've changed the small watch battery and even set it outside in the sun for a few hours thinking that maybe the light in the house was n't strong enough . Nope . Maybe mine was a defective unit but it certainly was n't abused or even played with to an exceptionally high degree in the 4 months that we had it .
5 #### This cash register is great ! It was a little larger than we expected and appears to be sturdy . It runs on solar power like most calculators so it does n't need batteries . The play money is the most realistic play money I have ever seen . Our kids are having a lot of fun with it . After considering several different cash registers I am very happy that I picked this one .
5 #### Love that this childhood favorite can now be gifted to my children . The colors are bright , the play character pieces are perfect for small hands . This is perfect learning game .
5 #### This was one of two toys given as a set to our youngest for her third birthday -- the other was a shopping cart . Her and my son have had a great time with these toys . Though this is not the most attractive looking cash register on the market , it works WELL . It comes with a credit card and with fake money that look real . The door opens nicely when the Open button is pushed . The cash register calculator works . My son , who is 6 , enjoys using the calculator to play with for numbers . He 'll often add large numbers together just to see the results when they playing shopping together . It also came with a pad of paper which my children went through in about two days . Not sure why they included the pad of paper which was mostly useless . Either way , this toy has been a pleasure for me . The children play with it gently too , which is a rarity for toys in our house .
5 #### This game is so fun with a lot of players ! ! ! This is nice quality that replaced my old worn out set ! ! !
5 #### Love this game . I love that this game came with the bear and bull cards . Also , the bell . I ve loved to play this game since I was little . So fun to play this with my own children now .
5 #### Bought for grandson . He loved it to pieces . Nice quality product .
5 #### Bought two of these for my 4 year old granddaughters . They love them ! Great concept having the solar charge , no batteries needed . Just enough play money included too .
4 #### Bought this game and enjoyed it for a while , but it can get a bit boring after 5 or so games in a row . After 5 games , we pack it away until tomorrow . The rules are simple and requires some speed in being able to slam a slamwich when the proper sequence of cards appear .
5 #### Like playing " Spoons " with playing cards ? Or any other fast paced playing card games ? This is the game you want . Everytime I play this game with someone who 's never played it , but loves fast paced card games , I immediately know how they 'll feel about this game . And it 's always been right . Just getting for it to be loud .
5 #### Bought this game for my kids for Christmas . They love it and have played it a lot since then . I even joined in on the fun .
1 #### This is solar powered and only works when I 'm using it outside in the sun it does not work inside of my house . I did not buy this to use outside .
5 #### This is one of the those toys that you can get played with on and off for years . Little ones like the sounds and pushing the buttons . As they get older they pretend to play store and can work on number recognition . Just put the money away if you have little ones around as they might eat the coins or rip the dollars .
3 #### Gifted my Nephew with this and he is a happy little cashier !
4 #### Very fun for my kids ! Since the calculator is solar it does require more light then a regular calculator . This has been dropped many times and is still in great shape !
5 #### I always loved this game as a child and now can play it with my three year old daughter . It took a while for her to get the objective of the game and how to play , but now it is one of her favorites too !
5 #### I played this game as a child and it is still lots of fun today . Games are quick and fast pace and my 10 and 8 - year old enjoy !
5 #### My 3 yr . old son luvs this so much . It 's real worth more ! The coins and paper money are great quality . LUV the credit card ! Great value for a great product ! Arrived super fast !
5 #### We use this in a play therapy setting . This cash register is perfect ! We looked at a variety of different machines for MONTHS before landing on this one . This one meets all the basic needs of payment , allowing for more creativity as to in which imaginative environment a child could use it ; whether it be the grocery store , a clothing store , a pet store , the post office , or whatever else they can think up ! Because it focuses on being a general cash register , it is open for interpretation during play . The money and coins that come with it look great and there is enough money to get started playing right away !
5 #### My 6 yr . old daughter enjoys playing with the cash register . She also loves the little notepad that is on it . Great birthday gift .... especially because she is learning about money and how to add and subtract .
5 #### Loved it as a kid ; my grandkids love it too !
5 #### I was happy to give this to my daughter because I remember it so well my childhood . It came in great condition , great quality . She loves it and it 's a great way for her learn direction and to be a humble winner and to gracefully take a loss ! :-)
5 #### GREAT FUN COUNTING AND RUNNING AROUND THE CANDY HOUSES FOR MY FOUR YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER FOR HER BIRTHDAY AS A FIRST GIFT , GREAT IDEA FOR LEARNING COLORS TOO .
5 #### Some versions of Candyland have a spinner but mine had cards when I was a kid . This one has cards so I like that . I also like the cute gingerbread pieces . They have more detailed features , like they 're more 3D.
5 #### This game is so much fun ! Three generations played it together and we had a wonderful time . Will be buying more for others to enjoy . The game can be set up in a couple of minutes and the game goes fast . We played it many times Christmas day when other electronic games were available .
5 #### My 4 year old got these for his birthday with the idea that he could grow into them . While he is not building complex structures out of them , once we showed him how the gears work he has spent hours simple gear contraptions and is facsinated by the concept of gears . With a little adult help , he can build pretty much anything . I really like the idea that there is n't a " correct " structure that these are supposed to make . My son also plays with lego for beginners but usually gets frustrated if his does n't turn out exactly like the picture . Gears are great building toys for encouraging creativity and teaching the concept of gears .
5 #### My 6 year old daughter loves this . Nice and sturdy and does n't require batteries !
5 #### This game is a riot . The more people playing the better . I ca nt wait until I have another opportunity to play .
4 #### be careful of the cards folding or dog - earing , as this is a fast - paced game .
5 #### We played this at Thanksgiving with multiple generations of family and friends . It is easy for all ages to play . Do you know what would make it even easier to play for older and younger people ? Color coding the commodities . The cards are all grey and to sort them , you have to rely on the words . Colors would be better . The bell is superfluous . But fun to ring !
5 #### This game is non stop fun for large parties . Beware as it can be noisy and sounds like a real market ! I love it !
4 #### So , this was purchased as a gift for my 4 year old for Christmas . She enjoyed playing it and was very happy with the purchase . It came in pristine condition as was to be expected from a new purchase . I only took a star off because Hasbro seems to have altered the game board from what it was 20 something years ago when my sisters and I played with it . Same idea , same game play , just lacks nostalgia ( which has no impact on the kids , just us parents ) . Also , I do n't remember having so many double pieces as it has now , so the game goes by pretty fast .
5 #### Now what kid does n't love a great game of candy land a game that even boys will like .
5 #### Great card game for the whole family . Fast paced and easy to learn . Great for all ages .
5 #### This card game is so fun and addictive . It 's great for kids ( my 7 year old loves it ) and for adults !
5 #### I bought one for a granddaughter for Christmas and then had to buy one for another granddaughter for her birthday . They love it !
5 #### Great educational toy ! All the kids enjoy playing with this . It is a great math " helper " and the kids have fun making calculations and learning about money . Sturdy toy , colorful , good quality !
5 #### High quality and very realistic . just as expected from learning resources .
3 #### Register came scuffed and scratched , you get what you pay for ... there is 4 different bills and three slots .
4 #### Fun game with a lot of people . Very quick .
5 #### This is a Christmas gift for my grandson . I m pretty excited about it , as I have great memories of his mother playing with it . This is more like the original version , I do n't care for some of the ones they 're coming out with .
3 #### Arrived ok as far as I know - it 's for Christmas and not opened yet . I did pay too much - which is rather unusual for Amazon purchase ..... not happy for that reason ...
5 #### The three year old grandson loves this . Getting the concept of following the path and not jumping to the castle is next . LOL
2 #### I like the idea of this game , bought it for my 7yo son . We played this once a couple months ago ( he got it for Xmas ) and have n't played it since . Kind of a lot of rules and the cards only stack up one way ( they 're shaped like a piece of bread so if you turn them 180 degrees they do n't stack nice ) . Not a fan .
3 #### good game for younger kids , but they got bored quickly . We played it a handful of times after Christmas , but they have n't touched it since .
5 #### We 've all played it , kids all love it . If there are little ones around , candy land is a must . Easy to understand for the little ones , fun for everyone . Never hesitate to keep the classics around .
5 #### My preschooler loves this game ... Even when she gets a card that sends her back to the beginning of the game ... The fact she gets a card with a candy picture made her day .
5 #### Works great ! Use with real money or play money that 's " real " in size .... It is a real adding machine to help teach your child how to really add ... My daughter plays with her son as if they are " shopping " and then they go check out ... He has his own money to pay for his stuff he buys ... He enjoys shopping and paying for his stuff , counting out his own money ... If he does n't have enough , he has to " pick " which item to put back . Add , Subtract .... He 's only 5 ....
4 #### This register is very simple - no bells and whistles , which I like . My daughter loves to play store or library or many other things with it . She 's 3 now , so just punches buttons - but I can see that as she gets older this will grow with her . I also love that there are no batteries required !
5 #### Gift for my 3 - year - old granddaughter - she loves it and the adults think it 's the real thing ! The play money that came with it fooled EVERYONE ! !
5 #### Great game , for both groups and family . The only issue , is that these cards wear really quickly since the game involves quickly passing from one person to another .
5 #### We play this all the time ! It 's great for all ages and so easy to learn !
5 #### Super excited to get this edition , seeing as those token pieces are heavy duty plastic and not the flimsy cardboard ones you find at Wal - Mart .
5 #### My 5 year old loves playing it . We play every evening it became part of daily routine . Even adults will enjoy this game
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with this classic . The quality is still top notch .
5 #### Candy Land is the perfect game for little ones who ca n't really use logic or strategy yet , but still want to be able to play a board game . They only need to know their colors and they 're set to go . My grandchildren love playing Candy Land when they come visit . I just bought one to give as a Christmas gift for two younger grandchildren , so they can play it at home , too . It 's definitely a hit in our family .
5 #### Perfect for a 3 year old + . We play grocery store all the time . It works really well and to my surprise the numbers and calculator actually work ... I might even borrow it for a garage sale ....
5 #### This game is so much fun for all ages . One of our family favorites :-) Great transaction !
5 #### My kids think this is quite fun . The cards are regular card size , just shaped like a sandwich . We watched a youtube review where the guy had oversized cards , these are not .
4 #### The package arrived extremely quickly ! ! Kids were thrilled to open it up and play right away . Product just as described .
5 #### So worth it ! My kid loves this . And we enjoy playing it with him !
5 #### My daughter loves card games , I think she 'll really enjoy this .
5 #### Excellent game . Easy to grasp the basics but every hand is different dynamics . Good for families and even young children will grasp the basics pretty quickly .
5 #### Arrived in great condition , and I am excited to play it .
5 #### Good for my son . Both he and his elder sister love it .
1 #### Well this is a cute toy and we did really like it until it broke ! We got it for Christmas and it lasted 2 months before the beeping noise when you press the key pad , and the screen stopped working . And trust me when I say- that was with VERY limited use . We only have 1 child who is 3 and he had so many other toys that this one did n't get much attention right away . He was very upset when it stopped working . and to top it off , we could n't find a place to replace any batteries because it works on solar power like the older calculators do . Disappointed ! Would NOT recommend . Especially for the price !
5 #### Great cash register . My three year old loves it . The drawer does pop out a little too hard when you hit the " open " button , causing the coins to get thrown out of the drawer , but he 's three ... so there was little chance they 'd stay in there anyway . He loves playing store with his older brother .
5 #### FUN game . Buy the one with the bell or buy a bell to use .
5 #### This game is so much fun for young and old ! It has quickly become a holiday tradition to play this after dinners as a large group . We all get loud and laugh and have so much fun ! Everyone has been asking where we got it and they want it too .
5 #### All time classic game . This package arrived in great condition .
5 #### My 3 year olds first board game . She loves it . We have a lot of fun playing it .
5 #### My grandson 's first board game - he loves it ! !
5 #### I 've spent hours playing store with my little boy on this register . It 's held up very well and has a real working calculator on it . I 've always been very pleased with Learning Resources products .
5 #### This cash register is wonderful ! Simple enough for my 3 - year - old to love , but detailed enough for my older children to enjoy , too !
5 #### Love this game . Reminds me of the game spoons a little . We have laughed and laughed . Great family game .
4 #### This is a game I heard my sister - in - law talk about , so I bought it for my family . We enjoy it . It 's very easy to play , so the smaller kids can enjoy it too .
5 #### My grandson loves games , and especially card games . I know , we are going to have fun , playing this one . Perfect Transaction . Recommend Highly ! Thank you
4 #### My girls enjoy playing this game . It is very easy to play . However , it 's not interesting enough for the parents playing game with kids .
5 #### My daughter is now 16 and this is still one of her favorites - we 've been playing it since she was 5 or so . Super fun ; we laugh and scream and have a great time ! !
4 #### I 've been playing this game with my 2 and 4 year old kids . They both really like it , and grasped the concept quickly . I adapted the game for younger players by leaving out the muncher cards . Also we say the name of each card out loud as we lay it down so that I can use my voice inflection to cue them that it is time to slap ( ... tomato ... hot dog ... bacon ... Bacon ! ) My 2 year old loves to slap the sandwich thieves and say , " stop thief ! " She is too young to recognize the sandwich patterns to slap , but still has a lot of fun playing . My 4 year old , after playing a few times , has learned to slap the doubles ( 2 of the same cards in a row ) and is just starting to recognize the sandwiches ( 3 cards : 2 of the same with something different in the middle ) . He has also become quicker at recognizing and slapping so that he can do it first . I like that we can play this at a relatively slow pace now when the kids are young , but that it will grow with them as they get smarter and faster . My kids like to build silly sandwiches and hit the deck !
5 #### This game is really great . The rules are a little tough , but my niece and nephew ( 7 and 5 ) picked it up rather quickly and it was a fun family game .
5 #### Great game for all ages once you get the hang of it . Much needed eye hand coordination and concentration to see the pair and 3 card sequences of to make a sandwich . And watch out for the stop their ! They 'll get you
4 #### Classic , simple game to start your kids on . I would give it 5 stars , but my child wants to play this game ALL OF THE TIME , even though we have many other games to play !
5 #### My son loves this game . Probably his favorite of all his board games .
5 #### My 4 year old twins and 6 year old daughter love this game .
5 #### my 4 years old son enjoys playing with this cashier, .. he also started to learn maths with this game .
5 #### It only took one game for this to become a family favorite ! ! A MUST HAVE for every home ! LOVE , LOVE , LOVE it !
5 #### If you never played this game it 's time you did ! I use to play this as a child my mother had this game . Even though the cards have changed fun this game is still an energetic fun game ! Everyone loves to play this game and it get asked for lending out a lot . If you are looking for a game that is energetic fun and gets everyone involved you wo n't have a dull moment with this great game !
2 #### The game is kind of cute but the shape of the cards makes holding them in your hand awkward and uncomfortable . It 's even worse for little hands .
5 #### Awesome game for me 5 year old . It 's fun for me too ! ! Our three year old likes to slap the theif cards even if he is n't playing . It 's an engaging fame for kids and parents to play together , a good first card game for little kids
1 #### My kids LOVE games but this one was tossed in the trash within a few months . My sons and I did n't like it and my daughters incorporated the pieces into their kitchen as play food .
5 #### Great fun for children . This is a game that is fast action , and loud . It is good for all ages ! !
5 #### Just like I remember as a kid .. easy to play and fun . I have a 4 year old and a 9 year old- Everybody enjoys it and it does n't take too long to play . It has the character description stories inside the box which my daughter loved . For those who are n't familiar with the rules , it 's as simple as drawing a card , moving your game piece and racing your opponents to the end of the trail to the castle . It comes with a deck of cards which consist of colored squares and pictures , four game pieces , the board and instructions .
5 #### Great product ! My kids love that it holds " real " money . It will in fact hold real money , but the play money looks like real money . It works great every time , and a wide variety of ages can play with it . My youngest is 3 and she loves it as does my oldest , who is almost 9 . The other kids in the family are excited to come over and play store as well . This worked perfectly for introducing money in our homeschool curriculum as well . I wish there were add on packs to replace the money and cc , but other than that , there 's no complaints !
1 #### When this item arrived it looked like it had been used . I was skeptical but did n't want to hassle with a return . I liked the idea that the cash register worked as a calculator , giving my preschoolers an opportunity to interact with numbers and math in a real way during their play . The digital display is so faint that sometimes you ca n't even see the numbers on the screen . The credit card slide beeps when you run the card into it , but it is barely audible . I was immensely disappointed in these things , but kept the cash register so the students could still open and close the door , pretend , and handle the play money . Now after just a few months the " open " button is no longer working . This item had awesome reviews and I have n't found any of the key features to be worthwhile . This was n't worth the money and I even got it on sale . I shoul dhave sent it back !
5 #### This is a pretty good cash register .... play money and coins are included . My 3 and 4 yr old grandchildren both love to play with this when they are here . It 's definitely a hit . Seems sturdy and well made as well .
5 #### My 7 year old loves to play store and this is perfect . He loves it .
5 #### Great learning tool . The bills are a tad hard to get out of the register but we love this toy
5 #### My children love this . Great for learning money values
4 #### Fun game . My kids like it a lot . Easy to learn and modify for all ages .
2 #### Not nearly as fun as the other Gamewright games . We own about 7 different ones . Confusing directions .
5 #### fun and silly game . we play it often with our 6 yr old .
4 #### I 'm surprised this game is rated 6 + . Very similar to the war card game . My 4 year old caught on right away The Slamwich instructions are easy to follow , the graphics are clear . My 7 and 4 year old can play it without me .
4 #### Great gift for my 6 year old granddaughter . She loves it and its something we can do together .
5 #### a classic game for young players - still as much fun as it always was . BIG hit !
5 #### Got these for family Christmas gifts . I have played and it 's such a fun game for a group !
5 #### Childhood game that I grew up with and loved . Now we are getting it to teach the next generation how to love this wild and crazy game ! ! !
5 #### Register works well . The door opens with force just like a real register . The play money is convincing and fun to play with . My child loves it .
5 #### My sister absolutely ADORES it . It comes with money and a credit cards and when my sister sees it she goes crazy and every night we pretend we 're buying stuff from her and she has tons of fun .
2 #### I do n't know why companies always feel the need to redesign things . The graphics on this game are really ugly . I purchased one about 8 years ago which had much cuter graphics . A classic game but this version is NOT
5 #### Gave this game to my fiancs younger sister and she loves it ! ! ! This game is relatively easy for younger children to comprehend and teaches great sportsmanship .
5 #### The game is so fun and easy to play with adults and older kids . We played it on Thanksgiving and while it gets kind of loud - we all had a blast ! I really like this game because it 's easy to play with kids that want to play games that are nt ' baby games . But so many games are starting to have adult themes . This was fun .
5 #### Grandkids will love this game . It is loud and easy to play even for the younger ones . Glad to see it was still around to play .
5 #### Great for children to learn the value of money . Recommend it to anyone
5 #### My 9 year old daughter just loved this at Christmas . Quality build , great money and coins . She loves playing store and asked for a register for Christmas . Do n't be fooled by Age guidelines , it 's perfect for anyone who wants to play store . Color is more of a dark brown than RED . Glad I followed the other reviewers and picked this one .
5 #### I love playing with my friends . I think they love playing too .
3 #### It 's ok but there is so much going on ... on the board it makes it hard for younger players to follow the colors or directions .
5 #### What fun it is for the whole family ! Even my four - year - old enjoys playing ! Fast and easy games making it good for short concentrations .
5 #### It 's cand land and a classic what more do you want .
5 #### My grandkids love this game . It 's fun and interesting . Does n't take forever to play so it 's perfect for the shorter attention spans .
5 #### Kids love it . Its like an advanced version of slap jack .
3 #### Fun game . Easy to play . Good for helping kids with attention focusing issues .
5 #### I bought this as game for pre - schoolers and their parents to play on their long U.S.-Australia trip and it was a slam dunk based on reports . It passed the tiny hands - air travel tests -- sturdy , easy - to - handle playing pieces , simple rules with enough complexity for repeat games and to engage parents ( or an older child ) , and easy to clear away back into its package . Ca n't say more ; that was more than enough , and it 's maintained its useful position in the toy chest when neighborhood pals come to play .
3 #### Bought this game for my 5 year old and they do n't really like to play it- Seems boring and not enough interaction
4 #### Very loud , fast - paced game ! The first few rounds were enjoyable but after a while , it got a bit repetitive . It 's the best if played with 4 + players as it makes the game more difficult . Will play again .
5 #### Every time I play , my voice is hoarse by the end of the game . It is super fun ! !
5 #### Christmas gift for my 7 year old daughter and five year old son . They love it . Great for teaching them math skills .
5 #### very nice cash register , hard plastic good for little ones
5 #### I absolutely love this game . It was super easy to teach my son to play and he gets excited every time .
5 #### fantastic fun ! exactly what you need for a group of people
5 #### Super fun and super fast game . I really enjoy it . Best played with at least 5 or 6 players . Cards are a bit fragile but the game is so fast that you may not have time enough to check who has the folded or broken card .
5 #### I love that my little kids can even play this so the whole family is able to enjoy game night together .
4 #### We 're slamwiching nightly and loving it . Adaptable for younger players ( we take the munchers out of the deck ... for now ... ) Great fun and easy to get the hang of ...
5 #### Fun twist on"slapjack " ! Our family had enjoyed this fun game for years and we just bought one for our cousins . One of the best things about this game is that even the smallest child can play . Beware : best idea to remove jewelry and clip fingernails before playing :)
5 #### A fun game . Bought it for a 6 year old to play with his friends . Easy to play .
5 #### All ages will love this game . Be quick ! Loads of laughs for everyone .
5 #### it 's a cool game , we play it all the time , perfect to take to the beach ! It 's similar to the war game . We also imagine what the sandwich would taste if it really had lettuce , jelly , onion and egg on it :)
5 #### I liked this game so much , I purchased a second one to give as a gift to a friend 's child .
4 #### Gift for 2 year old grandson . He 's a little too young for it right now , but he 'll grow into it soon .
5 #### This game is fun & can get a little wild with everyone shouting over each other . We play it a lot .
5 #### Family having a ball with this game . . . grandsons , ages 8 and 9 , love it !
5 #### Got this for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loved it . Works great and it 's educational . Good quality . Works like a solar calculator , no batteries to buy or replace . It kept her interest for about an hour as well as her sister who is 8 .
5 #### This is a great product ! I purchased for my daughter 's play grocery store and she has had hours of fun with it . My kids range from 4 - 7 and all 3 enjoy this . The older one can count out money , the middle one likes to calculate on the cash register and the youngest likes to ring people up and learn about coins and cash . Highly recommend this very fun toy .
5 #### We love this game ! Due to the variations possible , it never stops being fun for our family .
5 #### Holy moly this game makes the neighbors think you are crazy !
5 #### We play this often . Easy to transport . Easy to teach . Tons of fun and chaos !
5 #### Kids love it , great classic family game ! Plus they work on colors , order , and counting .
5 #### Who does n't love Candy Land ? Getting my 3 year old to start learning how to play board games
5 #### This is great little game for the kids . A nice take on Slap Jack that makes them think a little before just slapping any old thing .
2 #### Does my 4 year old like it ? Yes . Which is why it gets two stars . The game goes on FOREVER ! I 'm not sure why there are not more complaints about this . The game could last 30 minutes , easily without some creative losing by an adult . I am all for a longer game , but that is not what I look for in a card game for kids . A strategy game , sure . This one is being hidden on the top shelf of the game closet .
5 #### I chose this as a gift for some children from our church . We used this game with our grandchildren and taught it to the kids from church . The boys really enjoyed it so much that I just had to get them their own set . While lots of fun , it teaches observation . alertness , memory and the need to move quickly . So much fun ! !
2 #### After recently purchasing Sleeping Queens and LOVING it , adults and kids included , I started looking into other card - based games , which are perfect for travel . I bought this one based on reviews and because I thought perhaps my 4 - year old daugther could easily join in as well , and hid it to be a surprise for a recent vacation . We played it once . It NEVER ends . Like literally , once you get down to two people , I can not see any way this game ever ends . And that sucks . Really , my daughter and I were the last two left , and ended up playing for 20 minutes after everyone else had left , eventually deciding to end and eat ice cream . Such a boring game in general , and it goes on and on and on . Get Sleeping Queens .
5 #### We love this game . Pros : It 's a fast paced card trading game . Everyone goes at the same time and you trade of cards trying to get a complete set . Cons : You have to be a little aware of snarky teenagers that might collect one of every tradable item and snickers while everyone frantically tries to trade their cards .
5 #### great game helps teach kids there colors aslo counting if they want to their next spot is alot of funteaches them to follow directions
5 #### An all - time favorite , we had to replace our old game because it had been played so often . This is just like the old board and movers ... superb !
5 #### It was a birthday present for my nephew . My sister said they play at least 3 times a day . He loves it so much .
5 #### Tons and tons of fun ! ! My kids ( 4 and 2 ) love to " sell " things and play with the money . They are obviously too young to accurately play with this toy , but they still love playing store . And I love the fact that they can grow into this toy and use it for many years to come .
4 #### this game is crazy and chaotic and fun . the goal is to get of the cards of the same category , trading to find the last cards . Its really fast paced and is extremely fun . each game should nt last longer than 5min . its really fun go buy it .
5 #### If you do n't have this game but like playing with friends and family you need to add this to your game arsenal . It is so fun !
5 #### A favorite game from our 4 - H days . An easy game for entire family and large groups up to 8 .
3 #### It 's okay , but I would have preferred the vintage version . This one has so many colors and things going on .
5 #### My kids love this game just as I did as a kid .
5 #### It 's Candy Land ! Still a favorite . No more to be said .
5 #### Great game and love the idea of the bell . Wish they would put extra bulls and bears in the deck because they always get torn , bent or scuffed within just a few games .
5 #### I had never heard of this game until my in laws told me to buy it . The ENTIRE family had a riot playing on thanksgiving . It 's an easy game to explain and easy for all ages to catch on and play . It definitely gets loud ! ! ! You 'll laugh your butt off !
5 #### Great family game . We have 3 kids - age 17 , 15 , 10 - and we all love to play this on family night !
4 #### This is a fun game that my son 7 year old son enjoys ! It is fast paced and has a little competition to it ! GameWright has some really great games . We really like this game but also love the card games ... Rat A Tat Cat and Sleeping Queens made by the same company . This company makes super fun card games for the whole family to enjoy !
4 #### I have zero idea how to play this game ( that , or my son keeps changing the rules ) , but my six year old loves this game ! Cards are durable . Wish the case was more durable , but a rubber band will do .
5 #### This is just the right complexity for my 6 year old . She understood how to play very quickly but the game itself is interesting enough to hold her attention . We play every night .
5 #### This game is enjoyable for all ages . It is pretty silly . It is not a mental challenge , but that is why it can span all age groups . We get a little silly and loud with this one . Slapping cards and yelling things like , " Stop Thief " ! Good laugh !
5 #### Some lucky Student of the Moth is gon na love this iconic game !
5 #### My granddaughter loves this game . It is the same as I had as a child in the 60 's , only the art on it is a little different .
5 #### My favorite childhood game . I purchased for my niece for Christmas . Ca n't wait to play with her
5 #### Kids love this classic board game . Was priced very attractive and shipped quickly .
5 #### Can Candy Land be anything but 5 stars ? :)
5 #### Beautiful well - made toy . My children love , and they will have fun for years to come with it .
5 #### This a great game for families , young and old alike . It is an old school game that I played more than 30 years ago , but it is still a lot of fun and can keep a 13 , 11 and 5 year old all engaged . Fast - paced good old fashioned family fun that is simple to learn but does n't get boring . Unplug and try it for your family game night .
5 #### High energy , action packed game . My family has played this for decades , so did their parents , and now our younger family and kids will too . Its simple too , just trading with each other for " suits " , but everyone will be on the edge of their seat .
5 #### This game arrived quickly and in perfect condition the game is like I remember as a kid there is nothing wrong with it I absolutely love it it 's a beautiful board !
5 #### My 3 year old gets the rules and can follow them ! We get to play a board game together , so she does n't feel left out and it is interesting enough for us to enjoy playing with her and seeing her get into the game .
5 #### I love candyland and as much as I miss the little cardboard people , the gingerbread men will hold up much better to long term use .
5 #### My 3 year old niece loved this . She received it at Christmas and it was one of the most played with gifts by both her and her 4 and 6 year old cousins as well .
5 #### My daughter loves this cash register and so do I. I was looking for a register that had money close to the size of real money . This one is it ! We have had so much fun playing store , and it 's helping my daughter learn to make change , ect . Math lessons in disguise !
5 #### Very solid- I ca n't see it being easily broken . I love that it is solar powered and that there is a working calculator in it . My kids , ages 6 and 3 , love it an it gets lots of use in their grocery store .
5 #### We love this game . So much fun shouting out 2 2 or 1 1 . We have friends over and the game always gets loud !
4 #### We 've had this game for quite a long time . It has held up over the years and makes for some fun game play . It is best played with a younger child ( we 've done it ages 4 to maybe 8) . Each sandwich shaped card has a food item picture . Players take turns turning over their Slamwich cards one at a time . If two cards are the same in a row , the first player to slap the pile gets all the cards in the current pile and adds them to the bottom of their pile . Or if there is one card separating the match , you can do the same thing . There are also thieves that require a loud , " Stop thief " and a slap . There are muncher cards too but we 've never been able to work that into our game , they seem to make it more awkward to play . So the game continues until only one player has all the cards . It is fun seeing some of the combinations of pictures ( peppers with jelly side - by - side ) and it is fun for the kids to slap the table . It takes moments to learn and can be played for just 5 minutes or longer if you want to drag it out or play again . k
5 #### What a wonderful introduction to the stock market for the kids . It is a great product and we love it and spend a lot of family game nights with this game . Every one enjoys even those who do not dabble in the stock market . This game is extremely helpful in teaching kids to talk and develop interpersonal skills . they learn to make deals with the other players .
5 #### A fun family game . It is very fast paced , and we laugh are rear ends off every single time we play this game . You want fun with a bit of noise and a great time , this is the game for you .
1 #### My full video review can be found here http://www.gameboygeek.com/#!pit-deluxe/ckdt
5 #### Classic game . My son wo n't play it with me , he prefers today 's electronics . I play it by myself in the dark and cry . Buy it . It rocks .
5 #### Candy Land is the perfect classic game for the whole family . This game is basic enough for small children and as an adult it is still fun and exciting . It has brought back so many fun memories for me . I am so happy that I can share this fun game with my children . No skill is required and because it 's all about matching colors it 's a very simple game . There is a reason it has been around for so long . Also , the pieces are large enough they are n't a choking hazard . My 5yr old and I played and my 8mnth old just chewed on the pieces we were not using . It was a win win for all 3 of us !
5 #### Love this classic game . It will make a great gift for the kids !
5 #### great addition to family game night although a bit diffrent from the one i had as a kid
5 #### Classic Candyland ! I always loved playing this game when I was a kid and my son does now too !
1 #### I returned this cash register sadly , all the keys when touched made a terrible annoying sound , and it was one of the cheaper cash registers but you could see why .
5 #### Better than expeced ! its a good size toy ( maybe about a foot wide if i were to guess from memory ) comes with paper bills , a plastic credit card and plastic coins . works like a calculator and the open button makes the droor pop out and make a great cash register ding sound . ( does nt sound cheap or look cheap )
5 #### Great well made item ! Very functional super learning tool , and amazing and great for pretend ! .. A 5 star toy cash register ! .. :)
5 #### A fun party game that I wish I would have discovered sooner !
5 #### My mom was saying she used to play this as a kid . I got it for her to bring back some memories . Oh my goodness this is such a fun game ! We all got together to play with my mom , and it was such a blast . Easy for your kids to join in , but still fun for adults .
5 #### Such a simple and fun game . It is always hard to find games that EVERYBODY can play at the holidays or family gatherings . This one is so simple and you really get into it . I have yet to meet somebody who did n't thoroughly enjoy it ! I think the fact that the game goes so fast as opposed to say Monopoly , is a big selling point but even the most reluctant participant will want in once they hear one round of this game go off ... all the yelling and passing cards back and forth is too much fun to pass on .
1 #### I bought this game for my 7 year old son who is crazy for card games , but this was too much . It 's a little complicated at first but my 10 year old started to catch on to the rules and enjoyed it . I would n't recommend it for a child under the age of 9 - 10 .
1 #### I bought this game because the box looked cute and it had won two awards . What a waste of money it was ! It is essentially a game of war - you scream and slam your hand on top of the pile if the cards happen to be flipped over in a certain combination ( two of the same next to each other ( " a double decker " ) or two of the same cards on either side of a different card ( " a slamwich " ) . There is absolutely no educational value to this game , it 's just a game that will have your kids yelling and arguing about who won a particular slam .
3 #### Does not look anything like the happy , bright colored board of my childhood . Too busy . I guess Hasbro tried to make it not so girly ? Looks like a path to a scary castle and not Candyland .
5 #### Loved this game as a kid and ca n't wait to give it to my kids fro Christmas and enjoy it with them !
5 #### Great game for young kids . Just long enough to hold their attention .
5 #### santa surprised our son with this and it 's his favorite new toy . it 's fun , fairly realistic in nature , makes a bell sound , and the calculator part actually works .
5 #### We bought this game when it was on a lightening deal . Our family had never played it before , and usually we only buy games if we 've played with with friends or family , but I 'm so glad I bought it ! My husband and I played this with his parents one night , and we had a blast ! It was hard to keep our voices down with our kiddos sleeping . The premise of this game is pretty simple to learn ( " corner the market " by collecting all the cards of a certain commodity ) , fun to play , and games go by quickly ; perfect for family game night or parties !
5 #### so glad i was able to find this game , so much fun
5 #### Our family and friends found this to be a FUN game .
4 #### Who does n't love a good game of Candy Land , this board is an updated version maybe even 3rd or 4th generation . Still fun , but seems to be missing some of the old school flare . I still have bought 2 of these in quick succession for gifts .
5 #### Game from my daughters childhood . Now its my granddaughters time ! Never stop making it !
5 #### Kids love it . I enjoy playing along with them .
5 #### I ordered this for a childhood game night . What 's not to love about Candy Land ? It 's great ! The board and cards are colorful and game play is fun for kids and adults .
5 #### My granddaughters love this cash register ! The plastic / paper money is printed as real money , so makes a great learning skill too !
3 #### Different color from what is pictured . Drawer pops out too fast . At least it does n't talk .
4 #### This was my son 's favorite present from Santa this year . It 's basically just a calculator , and it has an open / close button for the register . The money looks so unbelievably real ! It comes with coins and a little plastic credit card too . The only thing I did n't like about this toy is that there are n't enough slots for the various increments of paper money . The paper money comes is $ 1 , $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 and $ 100 , but there are only three slots ! ! ( My anal retentive personality could n't handle that ... ) The coins are pennies , nickels , dimes and quarters .
3 #### This cash register is much larger than I thought it would be . Nice money that is included . Wish it had been smaller .
5 #### WE LOVE THIS GAME ! A family favorite for sure ! The shouting is always hilarious - especially when someone corners a market
4 #### I have a five year old son and a ten year old daughter . It 's hard to find games that both kids enjoy equally . We played this with the simpler variation suggested ( not using the Muncher cards ) , and it was a hit with all of us . It is a game of speed and reaction , so it 's no surprise that the 10 - year - old beat her old mom and her young brother , but my son thought it was so much fun to watch , that he was laughing hysterically the whole time . He did n't win very much , but apparently watching mom and sister have a slapping contest made the game a lot of fun for him .
5 #### Fun game ! Gets old pretty quick unless you have a bunch of people playing .
5 #### This one has been around sense I was a little kid . That 's because it is fun , bright colors and runs on imagination . It 's fun to score a hit with the little ones .
5 #### My son got this for his fifth birthday and loves it . It comes with the stack of cards , four candy men and the board . We 've had a lot of fun playing as a family . It came in great condition with no damage .
5 #### Great colors , forward , great everything . I would buy it again .
5 #### Classic . kids never grow tied ... especially with the trash talking that comes with winning lol
3 #### A little disappointed although I suspect it 's my fault for not reading the description carefully . I thought this had a little spinner like I 've seen in other ones but it came with the miniature color cards instead . They end up everywhere and get lost or bent . The game also has a bizarre smell of vomit . Kind of gross .
4 #### Great cash register but be aware that the toy coins are quite small . My 4 year old was upset that I had to put them up so younger siblings would n't have access .
4 #### Really love that this is solar powered ! The money is realistic enough to teach with for sure . The only downside so far is the beep is really wimpy - you can barely hear it .
5 #### Grandkids play with this all the time ! fun and educational !
5 #### My kids : 6 and 2 - year old and I LOVE this educational toy . We play together and it is great . I highly recommend this item .
5 #### Classic Chutes and Ladders . Is n't going to last 20 years like the original version , but it 's got fun graphics and kids always love playing this . It 's a favorite in my 1st grade classroom .
5 #### great game for the little ones to learn taking turns , counting , etc . , while having fun
5 #### great classic , good for family night with the littles
5 #### Our loud family gets even louder playing this game ! A real adrenaline rush , but warn the neighbors that it 's not an argument but a game !
5 #### Great , thanks ! Just what I needed . Easy purchase . Seller was super awesome and worked with me . Shipping DYNOMITE !
5 #### I grew up playing and loving this game and could n't wait to share that with my daughter . Now , she loves it just as much as I do .
4 #### The board is not like the classic set up and there is a lot going on in which can be a bit distracting and overwhelming for some young players .
5 #### It 's just like when we were kids ! Great game for the price and our daughter loves it !
5 #### Great for family night , easy for younger children to catch on to
5 #### Played this game in college some 40 years ago - it was a blast then and it 's a blast now ! Really fun .
1 #### I would give it less if it was possible . Bought this for my son for Christmas and the " solar power " is a joke ! It does n't work ! If you hold it in the window sill tipped to the sun it will work but otherwise it 's useless ! My son likes the drawer and pretending to be a grocery store so he wo n't let me return it but I 'm really unhappy the adding function does n't work . Basically it 's just a place to put the pretend money . Thank goodness the drawer at least opens and closes or it would be in the trash . VERY DISAPPOINTED .
5 #### My kids 4 and 5 really like this little thing . It makes a little ' ding ' when the register opens and the little credit card is just cute . It was worth the money , for sure .
5 #### Nice and sturdy . Buttons are firm . Cash drawer easy to open and close , no jamming or wiggling . Compared to most registers this is the best for educational and long term use . It does n't have the cheap bling like scanners or microphones . Built to last and be realistic for learning skills . I did purchase extra money to start beginner learning with extra $ 1 's .
5 #### It comes with it 's own fake money . It 's great , my grandson is going to love it !
5 #### On of our family 's favorite games ! Lots of fast action and laughs .
3 #### i really do n't like the new board . It is Really Really busy . If you have an introverted kid , go with the classic version . I 'm giving this one away and buying the older version .
5 #### This has turned out to be the family favorite . We play at least once every day and my 4yr old ca n't get enough .
4 #### Original style of the game but much cheaper made than original . Plastic pieces , thinner cardboard board . Otherwise , a good game which recalls great memories .
2 #### Definitely not the same quality as when I was a kid . The people are very flimsy , thin cardboard , and the spinner broke after one use .
1 #### The game was in worse condition than described by seller , the game pieces were falling apart as well as the box . The game itself was easy enough for my 5 year to understand but its hard to figure out where the chutes and ladders begin and end .
5 #### Even after reading all of the positive reviews , this cash register exceeded my expectations ! The size is very realistic ; the buttons are large and easy for a little one to push . Everything about the design is brilliant . I love that it is solar powered and does n't require batteries . This educator / mama is very happy with this purchase !
5 #### played this one when i was a kid . my kids love it
5 #### Candy land is a classic ! My 7 year old loves it . It was delivered quickly and is one of the favorites in my house .
5 #### Great board game . Had lots of fun playing with my students .
2 #### Nowhere near as good as original . The art on the board is highly distracting , the spaces where the chutes / ladders start and end are overlapping making it tricky to tell what space you are in . Besides the poor graphic design , the message each " ladder / chute " tells a child is terrible ! ! If you are carrying dishes ( to a child is a helpful idea ) ends up in a broken mess at the bottom of the chute . If you are reading books at the top of the slide ( also a great thing for a child ) you are bored at the bottom of the chute . The scenarios go on like this . My 3 1/2 yr old was perplexed by the scenarios and stopped playing after reaching space 21 . She normally LOVES games ( Busytown , Busy Airport , Mystery Garden , Dominoes , Sneaky Snaky Squirrel , Racoon Rumpus , Hoppy Floppy Bunny , Deep Dark Woods ... )
5 #### My 3 year old has fun playing these game .
3 #### The newer games have so many different designs and pictures it causes more challenges for the students learning and it becomes confusing - sticking to the classic games
5 #### I am a teacher and have used this toy many years in my preschool classes . I expect my grandbaby y to love it and get years of use from it .
5 #### The all - time favorite pastime for me and grandkids , especially on a rainy day . I like that the kids will put down the tablets and sit and interact in a board game of fun .
5 #### My granddaughter loved this game . She played it with her Dad and had a great time .
4 #### Fun game but one person can make it impossible for everyone to win by holding one of everything ( unless you put in bull card )
5 #### great game for my 3 and 5 year old to enjoy
5 #### This is a great classic game ! Loads of fun to play with my three grandchildren aged three through seven . This game involves a little skill and a lot of luck so it evens the playing field over the ages . The game is simple , so the seven year old can explain it perfectly , yet it also can teach the three year old about numbers ! It 's hard to find a board game that appeals to the " gamer " boys , but this one held their attention well . It 's also hard to find a game that all three grandchildren can play with me , but again this " Chutes and Ladders " game fit the bill perfectly !
5 #### This is so much fun . The money is so fun and close enough to real money that we are able to work on identifying money . It even has ridges on quarter and dime . The debit card he loves , when we play store he keeps saying he will use his debit card to pay , so cute . The digital readout is very dim so that 's not very good but still an awesome product .
5 #### Solored powered ! I love it . My kids and their friends always play with this . I bought it for 2/3 year olds , but 10 years play with it as well ! ! Calculator is nice too ! Although not necessary , I eliminated the money , it looks fantastic . I have to double check coins on the floor if they 're real or not . :)
5 #### My two year old like this product and the money seems pretty durable .
5 #### Good quality version of this game , and my family loves ringing the bell to win . Easy enough to teach aunts and uncles after a nice Thanksgiving dinner .
1 #### The board is so flimsy that if ( or I should say " when " ) it gets bumped , the pieces move around and it 's difficult to remember where they were . The pieces are too large for the squares they sit on , and the graphics are confusing . I did not enjoy playing with the kids at all . Maybe the " classic " game offered here on Amazon is better .
4 #### Chutes and Ladders is a classic game from my childhood . Even though its been nearly 30 years since I was the appropriate age for the game , little has changed . This oldie but goodie has provided my little one with hours of board game fun and lessons on being a good winner or loser . The only disappointment is that like with many toys , the quality of craftsmanship is declining , but overall worth the price .
4 #### Great product quality , kids love it . I personally like the feel and graphics of the original / classic better , which is why I do not believe this was worthy of the full 5 - star .
4 #### This is a cute and fun game , and you really ca n't go wrong with it . It 's a classic for a reason ! It not only teaches counting , but it also teaches good / bad behavior through the pictures , and of course , " up " and " down " for the really young players . My only semi - complaint about the game is the fact that the pieces are so big . It 's really hard for me to play with all 3 of my children at once . It becomes too confusing and crowded for them , and they become frustrated . For us , it 's a better game to just play with 2 players at a time , so it 's a great game for some one on one time with each of my children(which I ca n't complain about ) .
4 #### A fun classic . Not much too it , and not much has changed over the years . One of the easiest board games , great to play with kids just getting into board games . If kids know colors , they can play . Fun .
5 #### Great classic kids game . My niece loves the game . It 's great for multiple players so everyone can play .
3 #### Where has the classic Candy Land game gone from my 90 's childhood ? The prince is now a buff stud , and many of the other characters look totally different . It 's busy , busy board crowded with color . Out of the options I could find on Amazon , this was really one of the only finds .
5 #### My granddaughter loved playing this at my house last summer so I sent her one for Christmas . She 's thrilled . She is 3 1/2 and able to follow the rules and really enjoy the game . The colors are bright and appealing . The game is easy and while not challenging for adults it is fun to play with her and watch her having so much fun ! As a former Kindergarten/1st grade teacher I see strong learning opportunities with tracking , color matching , and sequencing . All are really important to learning to read .
4 #### Simple , but good one ! The only thing I 'm not happy about is that it reminds the kid of candies and he asks for something like he sees on the pictures .
5 #### Bought this for my sister for Christmas . We use to play it when we were younger and she was so excited to get it , memories .
5 #### This game is a riot ! Pit is a commodities trading game where players attempt to corner the market by trading until they get all of a particular commodity . When you 've got all of a particular commodity , you ring the bell . The game can get rowdy , but when everyone is yelling at once , there is a certain trading floor atmosphere that develops . We were snowed in with nothing better to do and played Pit for hours .
5 #### Nicely made board game . The updated pictures on the board are great . They teach toddlers the difference between good and bad .
5 #### This is an updated version of a game from years - gone - by . Its great that its Made in the USA . . . and at the current price of under ten bucks , its affordable . Its fun and easy to play . I like the new , updated version which is more modern and colorful than the original . Its for two four players . Great for both kids and adults to play together . Great for learning numbers from one to one - hundred . It also does nt take a lot of time to play , so kids do n't get bored .
4 #### There 's no strategy in this game , it 's all just luck , which means young kids are free to focus on the important part : counting .
5 #### This classic game is still a kids favorite . We played a couple of times tonight with my daughter . Even at 10 she was laughing and really getting into it . I 'm not sure how long it will hold her attention at this age but she especially got a big laugh when Daddy and I got sent back nearly to the beginning . VERY easy to play . Minimal of pieces to get lost or broken . Even if the little tokens get lost you can use nearly any small object as a game piece . If you have more than 4 kids that want to play at the same time It 's also good to know this . The game tokens , pawns ... whatever you want to call them are a little bigger , assumedly to accommodate smaller players and have easily recognisable cartoon children on them . Fun for the whole family but possibly older kids might get bored with it sooner . For me , I just enjoyed seeing my child laughing and having family time that did n't involve TV , computers , cell phones or tablets .
3 #### Chutes and Ladders is appropriate for ages 3 - 7 and 2 to 4 people can play at a time . This game includes : game board , spinner with arrow , 4 pawns with plastic stands and instructions . Chutes and Ladders has been popular for many years . As another reviewer pointed out this is not exactly the game from your childhood . The board is busier and smaller , The squares are smaller also . Sometimes a company attempts to improve something that does n't need improving .
1 #### Chutes and Ladders is an awesome game . A childhood classic that our toddler 's grandparents even played . My issue with this version is nothing more than the quality of the board . The game is meant for 3 year olds . The board ripped after the first use while folding it to put back in the box . I would rather pay more and have a quality board . We ended up playing my in - laws 30 year old version instead .
4 #### There 's nothing really " new " here except that this is a bit more of a " touchy feely " version of Chutes and Ladders ( known originally in Britain as Snakes and Ladders ) . What do I mean about touchy feely - well you land on " good deeds " to move forward and then if you do something not so nice you get sent down a chute . It 's annoying to me that nothing is sacred any more . We played this as kids and just had fun . We did n't have to do good deeds and yet I have done so all my life without the assistance of touchy feely games as a kid .....
5 #### I remember this game fondly from my childhood , and it 's one of the few preschool games that I do n't dislike as an adult . My children ages 9 down to 4 all enjoyed playing a couple games together . The youngest had help in counting and moving his piece , and the next youngest had to be occasionally reminded to look and make sure they were going in the right direction ( numbers getting bigger ) , but it was a good time for all . The board is nice sturdy cardboard , as are the pieces . And the board is much more bright and cheery than what I remember from my childhood .
3 #### It 's a fun game but this is pretty cheaply made . What happened ? It 's a piece of thin cardboard . It should be better made for little hands as my daughter ripped it first use trying to put it away .
4 #### The colors are not the same . The blue looks black so it looks sort of dull . Was expecting it to be more colorful . Seems like it is constructed heavy duty and will last .
5 #### My daughter loves this and uses it in her pretend reasuarant .
3 #### Although this is a cute register , it 's definitely not as great as I thought it would be . First of all , the cash register drawer opens with such force that many of the coins end up falling out . Also , there are n't enough slots for the $ 1 , 5 , 10 , and $ 20 bills . Kinda silly if you ask me . But if you 're looking for a simple register that does the job , this would be it . Looking back , I would 've opted for the registers that have scanners and other bells and whistles .
5 #### Loved playing with my grandkids brought back memories . Thank you
5 #### It was a gift . The kids just loved it .
5 #### Great game . It is fun and it helped with teaching my young kids how to count and learn colors while having FUN !
5 #### Always a great game for young kids to learn to follow rules , work with others while having a good time .
5 #### classic board game that 's fun for the whole family
5 #### Classic that my 3 year old grandson loves to play
5 #### Classic game and some improvements through the years . Great first game .
5 #### Just as I remember from being a kid . And an easy game to play with little kids .
5 #### SUCH a fun game ... my kiddos and I LOVE it ....
5 #### We bought this as a Christmas at Thanksgiving gift . When my granddaughters opened it they were a bit disappointed as they did n't recognize it or know anything about it . I remember it from when I was a child ... it 's really old .... lol . It only took one game before they were hooked and that is the only game they wanted to play all weekend . After all these years it is still a hit ! !
5 #### This is sooo much fun . Even young children can play . I remember this game from years ago , so I was glad to find it . Make sure you by the one with the bell .
5 #### We absolutely loved this game . Will buy it for other members of the family too .
5 #### My 1st grader loves loves playing school and she lovessss this cash register ! I bought extra stuff to go along with it and she pretends to scan items and give me a total & scan a credit card . It 's wonderful ! :)
5 #### This is awesome ! We use it all the time . My little gal likes to put real money inside . You have to be careful not to fill it up too much or the drawer will get stuck , but that 's obvious . The beeping noises from the buttons are n't obnoxious and we love the little credit card too , which triggers a button that beeps when you slide it . The little pad of paper is pretty useless for little ones but I can see it being a fun part of the routine for older kids , especially when you tie it into the real grocery store receipt you receive .
5 #### Very fun to play . My son and nephew love this board game . I have a blast playing against them as well , and I 'm 28 .
4 #### Super light game , fun for an opener , people of all ages like ringing the bell !
5 #### Solid and love it , all the coin , monies and the credit card , really like that . It did just fall down 16 steps of stairs and is still working .
5 #### Bought for my 4 year old for Christmas and he loves it . We okay store all the time and it 's a great tool to teach him about money and addition .
5 #### Kids love it , provides hours of entertainment . Held up well to their rough play
5 #### Bought it for my grandaughter . This is a very sturdy product . Well made , well put together , and performs as advertised . My grandaughter saw they were using this product in her class room . We have had other cash register toys , but they were not as well made , and parts tended to break . I can not say anything negative about this . Arrived quickly , performed as advertised . Would buy again , recommend .
5 #### This was a gift for my grandchildren . They have enjoyed it !
5 #### It 's the standard candyland game . Not sure there is much else to know about this .
5 #### Another game for the pre - school / kindergarten set - as classic as it gets
5 #### This game has withstood the test of time . A great beginner game .
5 #### good ! It is one of our most simple games . No need to think , you just spin and make as many steps as you got . You do n't wanna play it many times in a row , but it 's nice ! 5 stars .
5 #### Bought this for the toy drive at work and did not want to enter ANY store a week before Christmas . The 2 Day Prime shipping saved the day !
5 #### We love this game ! The bell is a great addition to the classic game . Worth it .
5 #### Fun game for a group of people to play ! Very competitive and lots of interaction .
3 #### Pit is a great game especially for groups of around 6 people . I wo n't tell you the rules or the premise behind the game but suffice to say it is fun , fast paced , and will get a lot of laughs . It is also a very easy game to learn , set up , and play . It consists of a stack of cards and a bell ... pretty darn simple . My complaint is the quality of the cards . After a few rounds of the game , several of the cards began to " dog ear , " on the corners making the cards a little cumbersome in your hand . I do n't know why they could not simply include high quality cards . A regular deck of cards is much higher quality . Like I said above , the game is CARDS AND A BELL ! Ca n't you spend a few more cents and give quality cards with the game ? The game is all about exchanging cards to other players , sliding them across the table , etc . at a fast pace . Does it not make sense to include cards that can hold up to that type of play ? My concern is that I will probably only get a dozen or two full games out of it before many of the cards are too damaged to use . Put , Pit is fun and a great group game ... therefore 3 stars . This game is a Grade A idea with Grade D quality .
5 #### my niece requested this gift , plays all the time
4 #### My five year old granddaughter loves this toy . I 'm not crazy about the small plastic coins because her two year old brother puts them in his mouth !
5 #### Fun game we play with our 3 year old grand daughter !
4 #### Bought for my kids Christmas , I hope they like it !
5 #### Just as much fun as I remembered , but updated with more modern graphic designs . The game itself is still 100 % exactly the same , it just has been updated to appeal to the younger generation .
4 #### It 's crazy to think this game is over 100 years old and it 's great to see it can still hold up after all this time . The game just sort of lost steam for us as we got in a position where we just seemed to lose ground for a bit . Scores would fluctuate so big and often that if someone did gain , they would suddenly lose as we continued . I 'd like to give this another go with some more people .
5 #### Oh my goodness this game is awesome ! You should give it a chance .
5 #### Great game just as it was when I was young :)
1 #### Remember the old Candy Land from your childhood ? Well this is n't it ! It has no cards and the board is completely different . Did not have fun was not what I expected .
4 #### I loved Candyland as a kid . It is not the version I would prefer but it works and we enjoy it .
5 #### My son LOVES this game and is four years old .
5 #### It is great for my needs . I teach English to children who can not read and so games like this are useful .
5 #### we use it everyday to learn about money , love this cash register .
5 #### My granddaughters love this ! They like to play tea - party , and pretend they are taking our orders . Then they take our pretend credit cards and swipe across the cash register . It also comes with play money - coins and bills . The calculator is solar - powered , and works on indoor lighting power . No Batteries !
5 #### Kids at daycare love this cash register . It 's quite modern . Kids play with it non - stop .
5 #### A Christmas gift and has not y opened yet .
5 #### I had never played this game until this past Christmas and it is a lot of fun . This game gets people moving and yelling that you never thought would raise their voice in a group setting . Definitely need to get a bell for this one , it 's a lot more fun .
5 #### Bought as a gift , but it 's a classic . What 's not to love .
3 #### This is the same game as i grew up with , but like many other things as well the quality is no where near the same as it was in my childhood .
5 #### Bought this for my son 's third birthday but opened it up early to give it a try , check it out . It 's all perfect , and I 'm hoping my son will catch on , on just how to play soon .
4 #### " Two ! two ! two ! ! ! " " three ! ! three ! ! three ! ! " It 's very easy to learn this and leads to some very lively , very entertaining game sessions with the family . It do n't think it really teaches much abotu commodity training , but it 's a fun game nevertheless .
4 #### Within minutes of playing the first round my 10yr old daughter says , " Dad , I LOVE this game ! " Well that set the tone for this chaotic , screaming match for our family of six . Each set ( standard vs. deluxe ) from the screenshots seems to have different artwork and/or commodities , with the deluxe being a nicer set in my opinion . I 'm happy we went with the deluxe version for double - the $ 8 price of the standard , as everyone wants to ring the bell . It 's a game that can be taught within 30 - seconds to anyone new ... whether they are a table top gamer or not . I did n't give it five stars because it 's still growing on me how such a simple game can be fun for more than fifteen minutes . But so far it has been .
5 #### ths is the # 1 game in our house now . very addictive and brings back memories of child hood . almost any one can play
5 #### This was a childhood favorite of mine and I 'm glad I could share this with my grandson .
5 #### My 5 year old brother loved it so much that we played it twice after we got it . It was simple enough for him to get the rules but also not super super easy to win ( I kept getting sent back with the picture cards in the first game and him in the second ) . My first time playing Candy Land as well . He also liked the story that goes along with the game and made up stories and dialogue as we passed by the different characters and sections of the board .
5 #### Love playing this with my 4 year old . It is just as I remember playing when I was little .
4 #### We love this register . Very real like . I only gave it 4 stars bc I wish the dollar bills would have been made to last . I laminated them to make them last longer and not get ripped to pieces . Did the job but was very time consuming .
5 #### best cash register on the market . Great quality and long lasting product . great service
5 #### My students in my class and I loved this product !
5 #### We love playing pit together with our international friends . It is a fun game to play when folks do not have a lot of language in common . I also gave this as a gift to an international student and it has been used and enjoyed ! Be aware , thought , that this is a loud game ! So it is not a good choice when you want to have quiet interaction . But if you do n't mind shouting , some rowdiness and hysterical laughter , this is your game . All in all a great group game !
5 #### The " old " board game that never goes out of style . Perfect for young children to learn their colors and counting .
4 #### Not the sturdy game I had for years as a kid . Maybe should have looked for a vintage version . But that 's progress and I 'm old . My kid loves it anyway .
3 #### not the same quality made as when I was a kid , but then nothing is
5 #### This is a fun game for young kids . Thanks
5 #### This has been getting a lot of use . It was a good deal and a favorite . for of us as children that w can share with the kids in our lives .
5 #### Great game for family game night ! ! Fun for all ages and easy enough for a 3 year old to play .
5 #### Great game and the kids love it . Keeps them entertained .
5 #### An interesting old school commodities card game . I did n't think I would enjoy it , but I was quickly sucked in !
5 #### We grew up with the Pit game in our family . Used to play it so much the cards were wearing down . Looked for a new version to replace and luckily they still make it . It is an awesome group game that gets loud and rowdy if you like that type . Our family has enjoyed it for years .
4 #### Bought this for Christmas for family . 2 adults , an 11 year old and an 8 year old can play with no problems . A really fun game that does n't require keeping track of a lot of things , so good for kids , but still involves enough strategy to be fun for adults as well . Only took 1 star because bell does n't work that well . It really is n't necessary for game play , though .
5 #### A good toy to teach kids the concept of money . My 4 - year old likes it .
4 #### Got this to go with my kids play food so they could shop . It 's a working calculator and the drawer pops open with a ding . We laminated the money to make it more sturdy .
5 #### Got this for my grandson for Christmas . He is in pre - K and " money " is one of the subjects covered this year . He loved the cash register and playing " let 's go shopping " with his mother . The calculator display was a great idea .
5 #### This was a gift for my grandson who is having fun with this tried and true game for kids .
4 #### Just like when we were kids . Only difference is there is a spinner instead of dice .
1 #### This is a terrible remake of a classic game . The board is much smaller and the chutes and ladders graphics are so oversized that they cover the individual squares . The pieces are so big compared to the smaller squares that they are easily accidentally moved to another square , and you easily lose your place . The graphics are so awful that this game was actually WORK to play . This was one of my favorite games as a kid , and the new one is so poorly designed as to be unusable . Fans of this game , do n't waste your money !
4 #### Snake and ladders is the " soccer " of board games . Played by everyone around the world ; Rich , poor , war zones , villages , you name it . Some of the snakes in the original snake and ladder were even scary . To remove the ' fear component ' and for uniform appeal , they replaced snakes with Chutes . In the process killed the snakes completely and the fun partially . Chutes and ladders lacks the punch of having a snake bite . The board is fairly large , coins of decent size . The quality is fair enough for one growing child and pretty cheap .

4 #### Great game , but the bell that came with it is n't as good as the older versions of the game . Pity
5 #### Love this game - it 's loud , fun and works with a large number of people . Not many games seem to be made for large groups now a days . It can bring together any number of generations of people . Many times we have arguments over who hit the bell first . Bell worked well . I can only imagine that it would n't work well after all our hitting !
4 #### Fun quick game 20 minutes playtime . Fun , though exhausting ! Very easy to learn . Intuitive , Fast , fast , fast ! There 's a lot of yelling . Fun .
5 #### My son is turning three next month and knows his colors . I 'm so excited to play this with him !
2 #### Meh , we bought a Candy Land about 10 years ago and it was pretty torn up , so I bought this . I like the vertical board better , but the characters are not so great . The pirate looks really evil , the lady is barely dressed . This is for kids ? Come on !
5 #### needed a new one for my classroom , love it !
3 #### It 's a neat toy , but my toddler has very little interest . He 'll just open and close it over and over again . I mainly use it as a calculator . My son tried to eat the coins . So the only thing that 's in it are the bills .
5 #### Purchased this to teach my small son about handling money and reinforcing basic simple math lessons . Nice large buttons and includes a real built in calculator . Nice easy to read display , bills and coins . The bills are large and easy to read for small children and the coins are plastic with decent realism . I was not too happy with the included fake credit card but overall the register is perfect to teach children how basic American currency is broken down . For the $ 20 I paid , pretty happy and fairly fun for my son to run his " toy store " .
5 #### My daughter is still too young to do math , but I hope this will be great as she ages and starts learning more math . The calculator is a real one , which is so nice . The note pad does n't stay on , but this is n't a big deal to me . The money crumples easily , but it 's just paper , so this is to be expected . Also , it 's the same size as normal money , so you could potentially use real money if you wanted .
5 #### Bought one for my classroom but when my granddaughter sawit , she took it and fell in love with the toy at first sight . I had to buy the second one . Educative , fun and entertained .
5 #### I got his for my son when he was about two and a half . He loves playing with money . I wanted a basic cash register . Something that looked real , with real size coins . He does n't play with this every day because I hide it since it makes such a mess ! But he loves being the cashier and making me " purchase " food from his store . When you push the button to open the drawer the can coins fly out , so you have to watch out for rogue coins launching under the couch . i took the note pad away , because my toddler is n't accurate enough to simply " write " on the notepad and not on part of the cash register . The number buttons are a glorified calculator . My son is too young to utilize that feature , besides being able to push the numbers and hear the little beep they make . This is a great toy for a child who is interested in money , and buttons and a credit card .
4 #### All original .. Great price .. For easter :)
5 #### Excellent game . Hours and hours of fun with my 4 year old , plus lots of math involved for her !
4 #### Love board games for kids .. and , they like them to .. play more board games . thanks Hasbro
5 #### I love games that are more of an all play . Have played the original and this just is a bit more up scale .
5 #### This was one of my children 's favorite games to play when they were growing up . I indoctrinated my 3 Grandchildren when they were visiting and they had so much fun thought they should have their own game copy .
5 #### My 4 year olds favorite game ! He will even play by himself . Over time the cardboard pieces get bent at the bottom from sticking them into their little stands . Wish the player pieces were all plastic or something
3 #### This game is pretty fun . It does n't hold my 5 year olds attention for more than one game though .
5 #### What can I say about a classic game . kids love it every time i get it .
3 #### Iconic game , had when i was a child and wanted to share with my 4.5 year old . Unfortunately the squares are so close together or rather small that it 's hard for her to count each separately and not be skipping around . Could just be her age , but i would not buy this version again . I picked it up because it was under $ 7 bucks and liked the deal , so it 's still fun to play , just a little tough for this age .
5 #### It is Great ! ! My 3 years old daughter love it . Although the postal fee is expensive , it worth ! ! Coz I got it in LD ^.^
5 #### My son loves his cash register ! We got this to go along with the Melissa and Doug Market Stand , and we have had so much fun with it already . When we are a little older this will be a great learning tool as well .
5 #### This Christmas present has become a favorite at our house . My kids regularly get it out to play various versions of store . At the same time it 's been useful in Math class to help teach money skills ( it comes with a nice supply of fairly realistic looking play money ) and it 's also been in use as a calculator . The little notepad that came with it was used up quickly , but they 've enjoyed the cash register without it .
4 #### This is the original Candy Land game . Had a hard time finding the original version locally .
4 #### I really wanted the classic candy land game that I had growing up ... with plumpy , grandma nut , princess lolly and queen frosting . Alas , I do n't know these new characters ' destination on the board . It 's okay and my kids like it , but I 'm really going to miss plumpy , as it was always so funny when anyone got plumpy and just quaint when you got grandma nut .
5 #### We were introduced to this game by a family member . Bought it to take to a reunion on the other side of the family and had a blast playing it with everyone . Fun for the adults and easy enough for the kids to join in as well .
5 #### great game for our family game nights with our two boys !
5 #### Easy game , Perfect for three and four year olds learning to count . My four yr old and I play it daily !
5 #### ca n't beat chutes and ladders ! helping my daughter to count !
5 #### My 4 year old loves to play this . It is helping her with her counting the high numbers and mastering direction as well . Love that this game only has minimal pieces to keep in the box .
5 #### My daughter in law says the kids love it and it works great . Better quality than the first kind they had which they broke .
5 #### I bought this item for my niece 's birthday and she loves it ! She 's seven and I think just the right age to start with this item . It is such a great and fun way to learn about money . How to give change , how to manage money , etc . We play " store " and put prices on the items right in the room we are in . It 's fun!!!!It 's Also good for a few years . Well made and very durable . It takes credit cards , Too ! ! ! !
4 #### My 2 yr old loves this toy which my brother got him for Christmas . I just wish it had a scanner , but we have one of those on a grocery card so he pretends just fine . The pad of paper and pencil get lost quick . We do keep the money and the credit card in a bag for him , then take it out when he wants to play . That keeps us from losing the pieces .
5 #### I do n't care who you are , you will have fun playing this game . Even the most reserved people will yell their heads off playing Pit . I played this game with a group that included an 8th Grader and an Attorney . No one could stop yelling and laughing . This is a great party game !
5 #### Our 5- and 6 - year - old grandnephews loved getting this for Christmas . By evenings end , they had a third game going .
5 #### Very good for age five and up . Use the alternate rules for young players . We all love the bright clear colors .
3 #### This game has all the ease of the original Candyland , but instead of a simple board , it 's now visual overload . There 's no negative space and it 's just awash with color . I would 've rather got the original .
5 #### Good old Candy Land is always a good game for Child 's first game .
5 #### Classic " old " board game that never gets tiring or out of style .
5 #### This is just what we were looking for . Nice weight to it , just enough buttons for a 2 year old . I would encourage to purchase extra coins those were the first to get lost .
4 #### My parents got this for my 3 year old son for Christmas . My son loves to play store and this makes it that much easier to play . It comes with money but I wish there were more of the big bills . There 's plenty of change . The other thing I do n't like is that there are only 3 drawers for dollar bills but there are more than 3 bills so we are stuck grouping 10 's , 20 's , and 50 's in one drawer which makes it a little hard . My son also really loves the included paper pad and the credit card . It makes a beeping when scanning . The buttons work really well for adding and math but we are n't quite to that yet since my son is only 3 . The cash drawer " dings " when it opens and there is an off button as well for the cash register . The numbers are also easy to read . My son enjoys it . We just bought more money for it . Also , there is NOT a scanner for objects with this version but there is a version that costs a little bit more just for a scanner . This works just fine .
4 #### This is a great toy for younger kids ( my 4 year old likes to push the buttons ) and for older kids ( my 6 year old likes to count the money ) . Was just a little disappointed that there was n't a spot in the drawer for all the different kinds of bills - had to mix some of them together .
5 #### My granddaughter really loved this machine . It served as a cash register as well as a calculator and she loved the play credit card and swipe for it and the play money . will teach her how to count money as she gets older
1 #### I do n't remember buying this product so it 's very hard to rate something you do n't remember . I do n't know what else to say .
4 #### Arrived with display window crooked . Other than that , it 's a great toy . Would 've liked four bill slots since there are four kinds of bills . Calculator works and beeps when you press each button . Mechanical bell rings when you open it like a real old - fashioned cash register . Drawer occasionally gets stuck for no reason . Love the solar - powered feature so I do n't have to change batteries . Plastic coins are textured and fairly realistic . The bills are made of regular computer - type paper and rip when handled too roughly . ( Not as tough as real money , naturally ) . This gift was a real winner for my four kids of different ages and encouraged good play . The credit card does n't get played with much ( just gets lost ) .
5 #### We purchased this for our 3 and 1/2 year old , knowing it would get years and years of use . Right now , many of the features are above his pay grade , but he will learn as he grows . The money is fantastic , they made great efforts to make it look like the " real " stuff . I would give one warning , when you pop the open button , the tray ( till ) comes out a bit fast . Best to have your hand there to slow it down a bit .
3 #### The younger players tend to get bored and it 's hard for them to count in a row , back and forth the whole way up the board . We honestly have n't played it as much as any of our other games for this reason . I have children who are 3 and 5 . The 5 year old is starting to understand going back and forth . It was easier for me to move their pieces for them , which was n't fun for them .
5 #### 5 yr old loves it - so do his parents .
4 #### Fun games to play with kids from 5 years old . My son and his friends have a lot of fun . Easy and fun to play ...
4 #### Not the same sturdy game I had for years as a kid . But it 's fine . Brings back memories .
3 #### Candyland is a classic for good reason . The board is an appealing candy paradise . This game is a great introduction for children to the world of board games . they learn how to take turn and win ( and lose ! ) graciously . The reason i gave this game only 3 stars is because it does n't require much thinking skills other than color recognition . Players win by luck only and not by strategy .
5 #### Wonderful game ! Fun for all ages . Be prepared for loudness and assertion ! We had so much playing we accidentally ripped a card in half ! The bell is the best !
5 #### My family has played Pit for as long as I can remember . My problem is this : whenever I bring it to someone else 's home to play , they love the game so much I end up giving the game to them . I have to keep purchasing this same game over and over again . Guess that 's a good review , eh ?
5 #### The toddlers who can count their moves will love this familiar childhood game . It is the next step up after becoming comfortable with the ' Candy Land ' game . This game takes longer to complete than Candy Land , perhaps 15 minutes or more , so there could be a few weeks before the child will pick this game over Candy Land . However , the child will find this game attractive and will come back to it . The player pieces are a little larger than preferred , so you could consider substituting smaller player pieces to facilitate having two or three players on the same zone .
5 #### I loved this game as a child , and my 3 1/2 year - old loves it too !
4 #### It is a great game . I am a little disappointed in the way the characters are made . I guess I am a lot old fashion and liked the one I got for Christmas 50 years ago ! Much better made !
5 #### Kids love playing with this along with the Melissa & Doug grocery store / lemonade stand . Would highly recommend both the this as well as the stand . Coins may be a problem with little ones .
5 #### I chose this as my toddler 's register for the grocery set I want to complete for her . She loved receiving it and I love that it 's so realistic . There 's play money that looks very realistic and a cute credit card . Cute for general play now , but will be great when teaching her to count money and other math ! I like that it 's solar powered too . Probably not really recommended for 2 year olds , but I think as long as it 's supervised play , she 'll be fine with it .
5 #### I bought this because it was on sale one day , and put it into my son 's playroom . I thought it would be good to learn about counting and practice shopping . I had no idea it would be such a hit . He never asked for one , but was so excited when it was in his room . When we have play dates we have both boys and girls who flock to it to play store . So I can definitely recommend it . It is built well , it holds up to being dropped on the floor , the money is cute . And kids seem to love it .
4 #### If your kids enjoy playing store or accountant , or just love math ... this is a great toy . Most ages will love this toy !
4 #### This was a very helpful toy to help teach my granddaughter about money . She enjoyed playing grocery store with it .
5 #### It is great ! Very much same as the real register and the money is also similar to the real one .
5 #### I had forgotten to write a review for this purchase . My daughter loved it back in the days . Now I have no idea where it is . Original Candy Land .
4 #### Classic fun board game . This is more of a travel size . Kind of flimsy because of board folding . Comes with a spinner vs. cards . Might be good for super young toddlers , but we prefer the bigger board and cards . This might be good for travel , but will sit on the shelf as a backup to the larger , sturdier board Candy Land game with cards .
5 #### I used to love it and now my kids do !
3 #### The game board is very visually cluttered compared to the version we played as kids . A number of the arrows are obscured by the chutes , which means that littler kids ca n't really anticipate where they are going next .
1 #### was looking for the original chutes and ladders for my 4 year old , and this is not it . feel a bit duped by the seller , as i was led to believe by the post that this was actually the original one .
5 #### It was brand new as stated and received very quickly . i Love it ! This is a regular at Game Night !
5 #### I 've loved playing pit for years and have introduced it to many people over the years . It is a super fun game . As far as the deluxe in the title , meh . The bell does n't seem quite as quality or solid as the one I already owned . But , it is a bell that everyone loves smashing when they open and corner the market . Buy it for the game and not the bell .
4 #### This is a game of trade and shows what early markets might have been like . It is easy to play and play moves fast . It is a nice game for groups to play and because it is simple to play , adding the bear and bull do add some more challenge , it is easy to teach thus making it a good party game . The bell makes it easy to tell when you have nine of a kind , rather than trying to shout over everyone else . This game can be loud or quiet depending on how you play . Holding up fingers to signify the number of cards you are trading or saying the number . As it gets close to the end of the game and people are getting closer to having nine the volume goes up . This is a good game for family fun or for a party . Good for younger as well as older players .
5 #### This game is so loud , intense , addictive , and fun . U will not be able to play just one round of the game and the feeling of finally being able to ring the bell and finally claim points is the reason why u need to keep playing until u win . Buy this game ! ! ! !
5 #### I love playing games and puzzles with my 4 year old . When he has trouble on the potty we pull out our portable desk and play a game or puzzle . I ask him to select and he always chooses Chutes and Ladders . It took him awhile to get the counting down while he moved the marker but now it is no problem . He loves the ladders and even the excitement of me ( usually ) going down the ladder . I think it is important to teach a 4 year old turn taking , following rules , being a respectful winner etc ... and we practice all of these with this Chutes and Ladders game . Love it !
5 #### All time favorite . I keep it so that I always have a game in our home that younger children can play and enjoy ! It 's a classic !
4 #### Christmas present for 2 & 5 year old . They love to play it . Not as gawdy as some newer versions , but not quite as old fashioned as original .
5 #### It 's a board game for crying out loud , the kids loved it .
4 #### I purchase this for my son on Amazon after having found no luck at the big box stores . The Candylands they had were the hyper intense , ADHD - ish boards . The graphics were overstimulating and it was a bit too much . I needed something more dialed down , and luckily , Amazon sold an older version that fits the bill . I loved this game as a kid and wanted him to like it as much as I did when I was his age , and that 's exactly what happened .
5 #### Takes no batteries ! Nice big buttons . Comes with a good amount of play paper money and change . Drawer is easy to operate and open .
5 #### This was a Christmas present for my great grand daughter . She loves these toys and this one will be a good teacher . Well made .
5 #### Given as a gift and our granddaughter likes them . Nice non - choking size and solid !
3 #### I like these blocks but the quality could be better . The ink is smeared on a lot of the letters and the box was cracked on both the top and bottom were cracked when I received it .
5 #### This game has been around forever and is a wonderful little first board game for the preschooler ! I am a firm believer in the power of family game night and this has been a favorite in my household since my children were small . It 's also a great way to help develop social skills , learning to take turns , eye hand coordination and manual dexterity !
5 #### I have to tell you what has transformed this game for us . Instead of using the spinner , we use 2 dice . On your turn , you get to roll both dice , and choose which one you want to use for your piece . This has made the game SO MUCH more fun . If you 've played it before , you know the game can be painfully slow , and painfully frustrating as you work your way slowly up the squares , only to hit a major slide and lose 20 or more spaces . WIth our method , the game zooms by and there is still an element of " bad luck " . Occasionally your two options will both end up on slides , or as in my case , I rolled two of the same number and ended up on the biggest slide down on the game board . But instead of being frustrating , it was funny , because the pace of the game is so much faster that I did n't feel defeated . ( As proof of the speed , my 5 year old son and I played 6 times in a row this morning , which would never happen using the spinner ! ) I highly recommend this game using the dice alternative ! ( FYI , we do the same twist for Candy Land - kids get to turn over 2 cards and choose the better alternative , while adults only get to turn 1 card over and take our fate , whatever it is . )
5 #### This is a Christmas gift to replace an old chutes and ladders game other siblings had and needed replaced due to condition .
5 #### Glad to see this classic game is still around to enjoy . My 4 year old will LOVE it . I do .
5 #### Chutes and ladders is an old standby game , but still lots of fun for our younger folk . I purchased this game for our vacation rental so it will be used frequently , I 'm sure . Shipping was tough - the box arrived smashed to smithereens and the game box suffered damage , but all the pieces were intact and with lots of packing tape , the box looks like a box again .
4 #### My daughter loves this game as much as I did when I was her age . It 's a great starter game for a 3 year old and allows some independence in playing since the rules are fairly simple and easy to follow . A family favorite !
5 #### Great quality ! The only downside is that the corners of the blocks are VERY sharp . It 'd be great if the manufacturer could sand down the corners . My 1 year old son loves to walk around with a block in each hand and I 'm scared for him to fall on one .
5 #### the blocks are large , colorful , and kids of all ages lover them .
5 #### Our little man loves this cash register . He puts real money in it as well . We are playing / working on early math skills & it makes it a lot of fun .
5 #### This is the second register I have purchased and given as a gift . It is timeless and the kids love playing with it . The older ones are now using it as a bank with real money and the youngest use theirs to play store . It is pretty much indestructible from what I can see . Recommend it for kids 4 - 11 .
2 #### The frosty fairy has been remade since we were children . She looks like an over sexualized Bratz Doll now . Very disappointing . Other than that , the game was fine .
5 #### This is the perfect first game for boys or girls because it does n't require counting .
5 #### I bought this for my 3 year old daughter . It 's brought back many memories ! My daughter loves playing this with me and her siblings .
5 #### Kids love it . So simple and so entertaining at the same time .
5 #### This game is a classic ! I had to get it for my children so they could experience the same joys I had as a child playing it . This game is fun for all ages . I would highly recommend it to anyone !
3 #### Only one face of the block is what I would call finished . You can see that if you zoom in on the picture .
3 #### Fun , fast playing game yet the cards could be improved by making each type a different color . Suggested age is 7 + yet my 3 - year - old grasps the concept well . If only the cards were color coded . It is a pain sorting a stack of cards with boring / similar images all printed in black and white . Instead , we play Pit using colorful UNO cards ( bright colors ) and simply ignore the symbols . All you really need are the game instructions which you can find on the company 's website .
5 #### For anyone looking for a fun and different type of game , I would highly recommend this product . It is fun for a variety of ages . It is quite a loud game , so plan your playing location accordingly and have fun !
5 #### 4 year old Granddaughter loved it ! We play a different " store " each time she visits ! Credit card it a nice addition .
5 #### This toy is great for toddlers . It has a large digital readout and they can slide the credit card or open the drawer for access to the play money . It will be very useful once my grandkids start math . Sturdy as well .
5 #### Bought this for a really good sale price in the after Christmas sale ! Have had this for kids before and it is a good toy to keep them occupied for awhile .
5 #### My 5 year old grandchild loves this . The currency looks , feels real and coins sound real . A hundred times better than Momopoly money and cheap plastic weightless coins . The calculator will keep this toy relevant and will keep children 's interest as they learn math skills for years to come . This is a good choice for multiple ability levels and ages .
5 #### I love how no batteries needed . my son loves the play money and credit card . we played grocery store yesterday and he was the cashier . that was fun . then I used the small tablet it comes with wrote out a small amount check I needed cashed . he took check and I told him I wanted small bills . so he had to count out the bills and I had him use the calcuator just make sure he was giving me correct amount . It was fun to see him learning .
5 #### My daughter loves this game ! She had been jealous that her friends were getting board games for their birthdays , so Santa brought her this one for Christmas . She has played it countless times already and has had no problems following the directions or becoming inattentive . Good value for the price too !
5 #### We play this a lot even though our children are slowly aging out of it . Great for them to play with younger siblings and cousins .
5 #### Arrived as described . Newer design than when i was a kid , but same concept .
2 #### The images on this game board are shrunken down so small it 's difficult to look at ! They should have used a larger board or simpler graphics .
3 #### I the board is overly busy . There are to many bright graphics and the squares on the path are to small for the game pieces . I find it to disturbing to play . You eyes needed a place too rest on the board . Ask any designer . Too much input just disturbs the brain .
5 #### I played Candy Land when I was a child , and my children grew - up loving this game . Through the years , we enjoyed the Original , we have purchased the Disney version , and we added this to the collection . We find it a fun - filled , entertaining family game . When I was a Foster Mom , I always had this game available , and young children loved this game . Even children over 10 had fun with it . It 's an old - time favorite in my family , passed down from generation - to - generation . A simple , easy to play , colorful game that I 've seen lots of children enjoy through the years . My daughter & I still play the 3 different versions we have , and the laughs are worth every moment . Fun - filled , colorful , entertaining , and good price . Highly recommended !
3 #### I like candy land , but the old version . Go with one from the 80s/90s .
2 #### I ordered this for my young children , reflecting nostalgically on my own childhood during which I would sit in front of this game board and play with the pieces for what seemed like hours . I was hoping for the same experience for them . Unfortunately they 've remade the game where it now reflects that chaotic scenes in children 's television programming . The game board is smaller , super crowded , and way too busy . It was difficult to even follow the colored road ! I felt overstimulated just glancing at the board . It was really disappointing .
5 #### This is a great game . We have played it as family numerous times and we 've played it with friends . It is easy to learn and so much fun to play .
5 #### My family and friends loved this game and played till we started to lose our voices ! Takes only a minute or two to explain the rules . When we have visitors from abroad it 's tough to find a game that they can participate in . Pit is perfect . Great for those who use Sign Language as well .
2 #### I do n't understand why , but this game has changed since I was a kid . The concept and game play is the same , but the board is terribly laid out . My young children can not figure out which direction to go , and frankly , I have to look very carefully in order to help her . The game takes a long time to play , and often we get confused about direction and such , because the board is so busy and cluttered . I think Chutes and Ladders could use another revamp . I wish it was easier to play , like the version I remember from my own childhood .
5 #### My girls love this game , even my youngest daughter . They love going up the ladders , but sliding down the chutes ( slides ) even more ! This is a classic game for good reason .
5 #### We always started of playing Candyland as the first board game and soon thereafter moved to Chutes and Ladders . The Chutes and Ladders game does require some basic counting skills and introduces your children to numbers so it is a learning game as well as fun . Flipping the spinner gives you the number of the spaces you have to move so this is where the counting comes in but it only uses single digits . If you land on a ladder you get to go up it and advance more quickly and possibly skip several levels of the game . If you land on a chute ( slide ) you can go down just as fast as you went up . Since flipping the spinner gives you the number of moves , and it is random , children have the same chance to win as adults . This is why they enjoy the game . Your children learn how to read numbers , count , take turns and see whether they go up the ladder for doing good deeds or slide down for doing bad ones . This is a fun game but it can take some time to play if everyone is unlucky enough to land on a lot of chutes . Good family time together to enjoy each other 's company .
4 #### This is a nice game to learn counting but whenever my son lands on a chute and slides down , he gets upset . He does n't like the naughty part where he has to slide down but he likes the part where he lands on the ladder and do a good deed to climb up . This game kind of enforces the concepts of rewards for good deeds and consequences for bad deeds .
5 #### Great quality wooden block set . Bought for three year old granddaughter . She 's very pleased but her Poppa is a bit annoyed with me because our 20 month grandson thinks they make grand missles . I must say I did n't think of that , but What an Arm on that boy ! ! ! !
5 #### The are very well - made and super heavy - duty . My daughter loves playing with them , stacking them , and learning her letters with them . The colors are great for learning , too . I love the wooden box it comes in for easy storage as well . Just be careful when your toddler chucks one of these at your face , as my husband found out ! :)
5 #### My 2 year old and I play with this a lot and have so much fun . He likes to pretend he 's at the airport ticket counter or grocery store . It comes with a lot of play money so I put most of it away for later . This is a fun , educational toy that will last for years . Every kid that comes to our house loves playing with this . It is not loud and annoying like most kids ' toys . It beeps and sounds realistic .
5 #### Great price , ran my solar power so non need to worry about batteries . Good price and learning tool . Lots of fun with fast delivery .
5 #### This is one of the most exciding games my family and I have ever played . Better get some ear plugs because it gets loud .
5 #### My kids love candyland . I mean ... REALLY ? Who would n't love a game with lollipops , gingerbread men , and a rainbow bridge ! I realized tho , that I accidently purchases two .... so i will just give the second one away .
4 #### Fun game to play with my young son . He enjoyed playing it with his little cousin so when I saw it on sale I picked one up . Just like I remember it as a kid . A very simple way to teach kids to play a game by the rules and easy for the little ones to understand .
2 #### It 's so busy you can barely find the road . I like the old candyland and bought it on ebay .
5 #### We love the game . I remember playing this when I was a kid and playing it with my oldest . I 'm so glad to play again now that I have little ones again .
4 #### This is a fun game , but as others have mentioned , it is easy for your piece to shift off your space , and cause you to forget where you were , and the grid has numbers that are a bit too small , making room for the illustrations . My 3.5 year old loves Candy Land , but slightly less enamored with this so far . I think it will turn out to be a good introduction to math tool in coming months . I suggest Hasbro refresh this game , with larger spaces and bigger numbers .
5 #### Just finished putting this together and very pleased w how sturdy and well built it is . We had a plastic craftsman workbench and our little boy would pull on the front and tip it over on him . This is much heavier and he ca n't even come close to tipping it over . Very easy to follow instructions and well packaged . Very pleased !
5 #### These are the size you remember from childhood , unlike some of the others which are very tiny . I plan to use them to make a decoration for the baby 's room , but they are fine to let a child play with .
5 #### We 've had these for about a year . My 3 year old granddaughter still plays with them and spells words . The almost 2 years old loves to stack them and then knock them down . They are solid as is the box the blocks go in .
5 #### Like many other parents , I love that this is one toy I do n't need batteries for ! It is sturdy , has a cute credit card and enough money to satisfy my two boys , ages 5 and 2 . A great purchase !
5 #### Had a similar model to this cash register years ago for my older son . He beat it up pretty bad but it was duable and stood the test of a rough toddler . My sons preschool also had the same one . Flash forward 7 years later and I have a 4 year old that I bought this one for . He loves it so far and I know that it will be one of the more fun and durable toys he has for years to come .
5 #### I purchased this for my son for Christmas . He loves playing with the money , the coins especially . The set up is pretty simple , it has a calculator , on / off buttons and an open button . The money looks fairly realistic - the coins more so than the bills , and the trays can accommodate real currency as well . This is a great cash register for a child to pretend with .
5 #### This was a gift for a 5 year old boy and 3 year old girl to share . They both LOVE it ! ! It 's an excellent teaching tool for my five year old to learn monetary values and using a calculator . My 3 year old is learning sorting and counting . It 's a great toy for children to play and interact together . I love that no batteries are required , and it 's appropriately gender neutral , so my son and daughter both pretend play multiple scenarios with it . ( Grocery store , Restaurant , Shoe Store , Carnival ) Caution - the small plastic coins are definitely potential choking hazards for babies and pets .
5 #### she put all her boxes together and set up a store right away selling her other toys she got for Xmas!!LOL ! ! !
5 #### I played this game all the time when I was a kid . It was one of me and my sister 's favorites , so I got it for my daughters . It is a very simple game so that even my almost-3 - year - old can grasp the concept pretty well . It also teaches numbers , taking turns , and that there are consequences for your actions . If your game piece lands on a picture of you doing something bad , you get punished by going back toward the beginning , and if you land on a good deed , you go up toward the end . This is a great game for all ages , and the younger children have just as much chance of winning as anyone else , which is a plus .
5 #### the characters are diffrent looking them when we were kids . and maybe it just me but the game board seems smaller . over all though its still a lot of fun this is my 4 year olds favorite game !
5 #### This game brings back so many good memories from my childhood . I bought this to play with my 6 and 4.5 year old and they absolutely love it . I have been trying to get them away from the electronics and have more family time with them and this was definitely a WIN ! The board is very good quality for the price , we have n't had any problems with it and have been playing for a long time now several nights a week . I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun board game .
5 #### My 2 and 4 year old love this game . It teaches colors and counting ( we count out the number of squares me move and one versus two colors on a card ) . My kids like playing with the gingerbread figures even without the game .
4 #### The kids love this game ! It 's a big hit .
5 #### I loved this game as a kid with the orange bell ! This new version is just as great . Great for lots of people to play and easy to learn . This is one of our favorites !
3 #### My kids like playing with the drawers and money . The play money is easy to rip . not a fantastic toy but it serves it 's purpose as a cash register for toddlers
5 #### This was an instant hit with my boys who are 4 and 5 . I love that the money looks real and you can really start teaching them how to add and subtract with it . The calculator feature is great but in a world where everyone uses credit cards and calculators , I want to teach the boys how to calculate in their heads .
5 #### Bought this when my grandkids started to learn about money in school . Helped to add to process by being fun . The price was a little high , but the cash reg was well made .
5 #### what a surprise this was to learn math and play at the same time ............ so excited about this it was n't even ask for thank you
5 #### This is a newer register than the 10 + year old one I had I was allowing my granddaughters to use and she will be so very happy when I allow her to open this new one . She loves the sound of the card scanning and the opening of the register and the handling of the money and it is going to be a tremendous resource in teaching her about money and counting !
1 #### There are three items * SOMEONE should warn parents about before they buy them . This is one of them . I only wish someone had told ME years ago ... Yes , this game is cute and easy to play . Yes , it 's famous . And yes , it 's probably educational . But be warned - it is THE most boring game in the universe . After ten minutes you will find yourself in a stupor . You 'll look at the board and begin trying to calculate how much time it will take for the game to END . Soon you 'll feel the urge to throw your chair through the window ... not the loving - family - ambience you were expecting . AND EVERY TIME YOU THINK THE GAME IS JUST ABOUT OVER , YOUR KID FALLS DOWN A CHUTE AND HAS TO START OVER ALMOST AT THE BEGINNING . You will find yourself lying to your children , telling them a " 2 " means " Move 4 " , and secretly scribbling over the chutes at midnight with a fat - tipped indelible black marker while spouting gibberish and drooling . Let your kids play this at pre - school . Give it to the grandparents . JUST DO NOT ALLOW THIS GAME IN YOUR HOUSE IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY . * the other two are Candy Land and the book " The Little Engine That Could "
5 #### I am so happy I bought this game . I never had one as a kid but I played last night for the first time with my daughter , 5 and my son , 3 and we had so much fun together . Although we get very busy we are going to start having several game nights a week . The game was interesting enough to hold my 3 year olds attention to the end which does n't happen often , they got to practice their counting and I got to explain ethics and morals . The " rules " were very easy to catch on to and their were lots of giggles and laughter ! Do n't wait any longer to add this to your game room :)
5 #### I enjoyed this game as a child and now we enjoy playing it with our son . He turned 3 recently and loves it ! ! He already knows his numbers ( he has played with number flash cards for months ) so this aspect of the board was no problem . I do agree that it is a little confusing as to which way to go but it 's not that bad . My husband told our son that the chutes are silly so now he says " ahhhh ! " when he has to go down one and really enjoys that part . I really do n't think games go that long - no big deal with the time factor to us . I do agree that the artwork stinks ! I also think the big headed kids are n't great . I have 2 older boards ( one from the early 70 's and the other from mid 70 's ) and my son does prefer playing on those . The pictures are much more straight forward and easier to understand . All in all though this is a classic game that is lots of fun . We have explained to our son what the consequences mean and it 's so cute when he lands on a ladder- " I mowed the lawn;now I get to go the circus ! " It 's great to pretend you 're a big kid , is n't it ? I did email the manufacturer to complain about the bad graphics but other than that , we are satisfied !
3 #### Its chutes and ladders , it should be simple fun . You spin the spinner move your spaces , hit a ladder , go up , hit a chute , come down . There are a lot of fun pictures on the game board , however , it makes it hard to see the numbers , or the directional arrows . As this game is supposed to be for the super young this becomes a big frustration . The standee pieces are cardboard which is fine but after playing a few games the bottoms or our characters are fraying . They made it cheap to be affordable , so you get what you pay for here .
5 #### This was a favorite game for my children ( they are now adults ) . This version seemed to be more complicated than the earlier version . But we played this with my 3 year old grand daughter , and she had so much fun , I 'm giving it 5 stars .
4 #### The board is much busier than it used to be , but it 's still a fun game for young kids !
5 #### So excited to play this game on family game night with our two kids !
4 #### It is a fun old classic game for very young children .
4 #### This game is a classic that I played when I was little . Our original game held up for years . I do n't see today 's version holding up for too long . It 's the same thing of they do n't make them like they used to . However , it 's still a great game and my boys both enjoy playing . I do too .
3 #### This is a fine counting game for young kids . I have to echo what others have said though and say that it really should have more arrows on the path for kids to follow . And the cardboard pieces are a serious design flaw . I really do n't mind the cheap pieces , it 's not like this game is very expensive , but they do n't fit in the box unless you take them apart first . The cardboard will fray and you will be lucky if the game makes it to a second child . The board is too busy as well . Simple ladders and slides would be fine . Instead , the designers seem to be attempting to teach lessons by having " good " deeds go forward and " bad " deeds go back . But they do n't make sense and some are not appropriate for the age the game is intended . One of the " good " deeds shows a kid bandaging a dog 's leg . Who thinks a young kid should be touching an injured animal ? Another shows a kid mowing the lawn . Should a 4 - year - old be anywhere near a lawnmower ? Yes , I know these are just silly illustrations , but they 're so unnecessary . You might spend most of the game explaining the pictures instead of playing the game .
3 #### I am not sure if there are different versions of this game , but my daughter got this for a gift , and while it is fun to play , it can be confusing at times . The board needs to have less pictures on , and more arrows pointing to which direction you are going . For little ones who like to play this , it is sometimes easy to forget which direction you are going and end up going the wrong way ! ( lol ! I have done it myself ) . The board seems a bit too " busy " , and the numbers are very small , with only a small arrow at the beginning of each line . The only other negative I have is that the game pieces are a cheap cardboard that must be put together before each play ( otherwise if you do n't take them apart they wo n't fit into the box ) . This means that the cardboard will eventually become frayed at the bottom where you stick the pieces into the plastic bases . They really should be one solid plastic piece . So I give the game designers 0 stars , and the 3 stars are for game concept and overall fun factor .
2 #### I bought this for my son as a first game , and I 've played it with him , as well as his younger sister , who is now 4 years old . I cringe every time they want to play this game . The board is so busy looking , and the slides cover squares that you need to count as you land on or pass by . It 's confusing to kids about which way they 're to go on the board ( first they go left , then they go up , then they go right , etc . ) I constantly have to help them count squares that are covered over by the slides , et al , tell them which direction to go , etc . This is not one of the best counting games out there . Try Hi Ho Cherry - O. MUCH better game !
5 #### Gave this to my 4 year old , he loves it and calls it his Money Box . The drawer gets stuck if the coins get jammed , but so far I have n't had any issues with this toy .
5 #### good quality register ... kids love it and play with it often .. just bought the cafe tent for them to open a shop .
5 #### Let you know after my great grandson gets to play with it he lives in another state so may be awhile
5 #### My son loved using this in preschool . He learned a lot about money and using a calculator . Now that he is in Kindergarten , he will surely love to get this for Christmas to continue on with the play !
3 #### This arrived not in a separate box but in the product package . The package is all beat up and torn . I am not sure if it will work and hopefully the little girl it is intended for will not be disappointed in the packaging . If it does not work it will be sent back after Christmas ! ! Looks like it would be a good learning tool and recommended for this purpose by school .
5 #### This is my kids favorit game , and my favorit to play with them . It goes fast and you can stop at any time . You do n't have to sit around wating for your turn and you do n't have to remind your kids that it is there turn . Every one plays at the same time . It can get a little loud with all the shouting . It is a realy easy concept to understand . My 6 year old can play it just fine . It is best to play with at least four people . I love the fact that this game is almost 100 years old . You know it must be good if it 's still around .
4 #### The best thing about this game are the graphics . Unlike many other games out there the illustrations are really adorable and astheticlly pleasing . But , like many games out there , the age grading is incorrect . The box says clearly the game is for pre - schoolers , but my 4 year old son ca n't possibly follow the track by himself . My 1st grade daughter is really getting a lot out of it though . Following the track to 100 is much easier for her and slightly educational as well . It 's fun to play together , but Mom has to be there with the kids to help . Since I purchased the game to have something fun to do as a family , I have no problem sitting there showing my son how to count and where to put his game piece . If you want something for your pre - school age child to do independantly , then look elsewhere .
2 #### I know this is a " classic " but in this version my almost 5 year old son ( and myself actually ) have trouble following the track . You move from left to right and then when you get to the end of the row you move up one space and then move right to left then on the next row you do the opposite again . The spaces are numbered but it is hard to read and my son obviously can not follow the higher numbers . So you end up going one way and then you slide down and you have to go the other way . It is frustrating for us because we end up getting confused and having to redo the turn because we went the wrong way . The " water color " pictures are nice but it is sometimes hard to tell where you are supposed to be . Candyland is much clearer in this sense and my son has a lot of fun with that one .
3 #### This is close to the classic snakes & ladders we played as children , but it is not very durable . The playing pieces are little folded cardboard characters that fit into plastic stands . The spinner does not work well . We replaced ours with a die . ( I keep extra dice on hand for games like that ) . My son ( age 4 ) can count to 100 , but sometimes he still gets confused as to which way to go and occasionally wants to " climb " a ladder when his spot crosses halfway instead of at the bottom . Classic ? Yes . Durable ? No . Fun ? Not very . Candy land is much better and if you 've got the cash , Balloon Lagoon is a blast .
5 #### This is a great " first board game " for kids , who will probably enjoy it from ages 3 - 5 or so . Extremely simple to play , players take turns spinning the spinner and moving the number of squares indicated . Kids get excited by the unpredictable ups and downs . I award it 5 stars for educational value because it teaches counting , taking turns , and fair play ( when these are reinforced by an adult playing along ) .
5 #### my daughter is 3 and she learned it quickly and loves this game !
1 #### not a good product , it has very basic functions and this kind of features are available in 10 $ registers at toysrus ... very expensive and not worth the bucks . secondly the quality of material is very poor .
5 #### This is a cute product ! I love the fact that it fits real money . Great for my 7 year old daughter who loves to play store or restaurant ! Working on counting change . Simple but nice
5 #### My grandkids love playing store ... this is very easy and uncompleted for them to use ... they love calculating and giving change out .
5 #### Very cute , works well . Nothing wrong . Charges great in the sun light , well made not cheap would recommend to you
5 #### Bought for my 18 month old . Perfect size for her , bigger then the " normal " block sets . We love the bright colors and the different fonts on each size .
5 #### I really like Chutes and Ladders for its educational value . It teaches children how to count to 100 and how to take turns . The pictures on the board also show the difference between cause and effect ( ie : you break a dish you have to sweep it up ) . It is also no so very long although if you get caught up in some parts of the board it can drag on a bit . Still a very fun gave to play . Simple , no reading required . A few problems though . It would be very nice if it was in a plastic case , that way I would n't have to keep taping the boxes which always seem to get broken . Also , the maekers used for keeping your place are in two pieces . It consists of a card with a boy / girl on it and a plastic piece to hold it up . I wish it were all one piece so that they would n't fall apart all the time when you go to move your marker . That 's all though . I still gave this game 5 stars because these problems that I have named are small compared to the fun that a family can have playing a game together ! ! ! !
4 #### I had this as a child , so I naturally bought it for my own kids . While they did enjoy playing it -- and still enjoy playing it , and playing it , and playing it -- I could n't help but think that the board really needed to be updated for the practices and standards in today 's schools . Still , it was as enjoyable as it was years ago .
4 #### I was interested in which games were popular in a particular decade , but of course " Chutes & Ladders " has remained popular for so long because it relates to young children , not the children of a particular decade . I would certainly go along with the consensus that " Candy Land " is the first board game you buy your kids and " Chutes & Ladders " is the second . This game has three strong qualities which recommend it to small children . The first is simplicity , so that the child can easily understand it and start playing immediately . The second is luck , so that the child has a fair chance against older siblings , babysitters , parents , grandparents and the family cat . The third is repetition , so that the child can grasp the basic structure of such games and be prepared for those board games that are rites of passage down the road as they mature . As an added bonus , " Chutes & Ladders " certainly helps young children learn their numbers .
5 #### my 5 year old loves this i always let her win
5 #### My toddler loves playing the game . The board is kind of cluttered and distracting but he likes it .
5 #### Just like the when I was a kid ... will have fun with the Grandkids .
5 #### C'm on , are you kidding ? What kid does n't love Candyland ? It 's a classic .
5 #### the classic game for preschoolers . the board is colorful and the game teaches so much : how to wait your turn , counting , color recognition , and also gives the opportunity to talk about important things ... like ICE CREAM , CINNAMON BUNS , AND LICORICE ... to name a few . HAHA ! ! Great game and i was so excited when my grandson was old enough for me to purchase and play it with him . Lots of fun .
5 #### Purchased for my grandchildren . Every bit as fun as I remember from when I was a child !
5 #### I love playing PIT . It is perfect for 4 to 8 players . Loud and fast , everyone gets into the game because it is so easy to learn . I get people to play this game as often as possible ! It 's so much fun !
5 #### These are bigger than some of the other letter blocks out there . My sons ( 4 & 2 ) are obsessed with letters and loves these .
4 #### These blocks are nice , wish they were a little larger that 's all ..
5 #### Our granddaughter loves to play store , so I was assigned a cash register as her gift . After spending a lot of time trying to sort out all of the models made by Learning Resources , I chose this one . It is solar - powered , so you do n't have to worry about battery life . It does n't talk , so there 's no annoying voice . I did n't want any other auxiliary gadgets like a scanner or scale that would break . This cash register does have a credit card slot and it dings when you open up the drawer . Nice large buttons and calculator screen , life - size money drawer . The plastic feels substantial rather than flimsy . I was very pleased when I opened the box ( the moment of truth when you 've bought something online , sight - unseen ) .
5 #### My daughter loves this cash register . She loves using the credit card feature and how the buttons make noise . I also have one in my classroom and my kindergartners love it ! Amazon 's price is much better then the educational catalogs I 've seen it in .
4 #### My 2 yr old likes the beeping sound of the calculator and opening and closing drawer . My 5 year old enjoys organizing the money in the drawer as she learns the names of the bills and coins . She also tries to teach herself some addition on the calculator . She also likes being a storekeeper / cashier as Mom shops in her supermarket . Although the calculator is not battery operated , rather with solar energy , this is not true for the beeping sound that the calculator makes which my kids enjoyed the most . They pressed it a lot the very first day and the battery died that day . It 's also not so easy to find that kind of battery . Other than that , we all still enjoy this toy very much !
3 #### I bought it as a gift , but when opened i feel the quality is not what I expected but the kid loves it so no complains per se .
5 #### Purchased for our 2 year old grand daughter . This will be a favorite for years to come as she grows in understanding it 's multiple concepts & uses !
5 #### Gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas . She absolutely loves it . As soon as she would finish a game , she would ask someone else to play .
5 #### My kids love candy land , especially the 3 and 6 year old . It 's easy to play and they love it !
3 #### You do n't get the one in the pic , it 's a girly version unlike the original .
1 #### This is not the classic version of the game as pictured . I do not need inappropriate looking fairies on a kid 's game . Disappointed , and returning .
5 #### I love to give old fashion toys and this was a gift for our 18 month old grand son . He and I had great fun building up the blocks and then he would knock them down and laugh !
4 #### The only reason these do n't get 5 is because of the packaging ! The box they came in completely horrible fell apart as opening and the heavy duty plastic piece that slides in ontop was broken and sharp and glass upon arrival . Otherwise they r awesome ! ! !
5 #### These are only " large " by current standards but are the size of the blocks I played with as a child . My 2 year old LOVES them and carry 's them around the house . Great blocks , very solid , and a real size for children .
5 #### Annoyed that I was giving this a gift and that it came so well packed but the box was still dented in all of the corners - which is really too bad since this was a gift . Love that the calculator works . Love that this can grow with the child . The parent of the child that I gave this to seemed less than thrilled since their kid is so connected with their personal ipad and kindel at age 4 ... but I really felt like this was a great gift that I would love for my child to receive . Hope the kid likes it ...
5 #### My kids use this register a lot . They love to play store with each other and even with us . They reinforce addition and subtraction when they play . They also learned about money , as in the coins and paper currency . I also bought the play wallet and some more play money . The ONLY bad thing about the register , is that it does the addition and subtraction for them plus when they pay be " credit card " they are n't learning math !
5 #### I had a second - hand one for my child that we like a lot . So when I needed to buy a pretend cash register for the Family Play Space at the library where I work , I chose the same one . I knew it was well - made , my child plays with it often , and I could remove the battery so it would n't make noise in the library . It still chimes when the drawer is opened , but no beeping with the press of every number . Even without the battery , the solar calculator still shows the numbers as they are added . I ca n't put out the coins for kids to play with , since they are a choking hazard , but the kids at the library love it anyway . It is played with almost constantly all the hours the library is open !
5 #### Great game . I remember playing it as a kid and bought it on Amazon to give my niece as a present . She is 3 and LOVES it . Rules are simple so even a toddler can play .
5 #### It is a classic - and good for little ones . I just wish it would come with a card holder with place for cards on one side and discarded cards on the other . They slip and slide all over the place and there is n't a good central place to set them .
4 #### I miss the old board :( a lot going on on this one . Hard for little kids ( age : 3 - 4 ) to see which way the path goes .
5 #### NO SMELL AT ALL . These are perfect and my son loves them .
5 #### Phenomenal quality . GOOD wood . SOLID blocks . My 2year old absolutely loves them . Her hardest play with them ca n't dent them . She threw one at the wall and left a dent in the drywall , but there was n't a scratch on the block . The designs are painted on some sides , and carved into others . They 're well balanced as well , and stack HIGH . Very colorful . Would purchase again in a heartbeat !
5 #### Another Christmas Gift for a Great Grandbaby . Mom is a teacher and I am sure they are just what she ordered .
5 #### my 4 year old grand daughter loves it . she already knows the faces on the denominations . I think it will be fun for years to come and she can teach her younger brother
5 #### This is a great little cash register . It is very basic and easy to use . The one downside is I think the change is a little too small for young kids to play with . All the kids love to take turns playing with it .
4 #### My GD , who is 3 wanted a cash register so I of course get right on Amazon and order one . Maybe I should have waited . She wrinkled up the paper money , put it back in the drawer and jammed it after about only 30 mins . of play . I think it might be more appropriate for an older child maybe 5 - 6 .. or maybe mine just is n't ready yet . I do n't know . All it is a nice set and has the bells and whistles enough to be like a real one .
5 #### Very fun family game , my sons favorite ... i must say I quite enjoy playing also . :) they take it everywhere we go to pass time when waiting or visiting .
4 #### The board is upside down if you 're sitting at a particular angle . They should have stuck with the old format . Also , it 's too busy visually .
5 #### The children loved this game . We will see how long it keeps their attention .
5 #### I loved this game as a child and recently purchased it for my nephew . Not quite the same board as the one from the 80 's , but it 's still colorful and full of candyland characters ( some of which are new ) .
1 #### The reason for giving one star is because the manufacture is misleading the customer 's with wrong description . As per the description , " The Big Blocks ABC Alphabet Blocks are painted with letters , numbers and objects " . Well that 's not true . In the box it 's ONLY colored ABC alphabets . There are no numbers and objects . MISLEADING . And the product does smell paint .
5 #### I am always seeking toys that encourage imaginative play with more than one child . This has been one of the best toys we own for several reasons . First , my two children , ages 2 and 5 , can find a middle ground with this and have a blast together ! With no fighting ! They will spend over an hour simply play shopping games which leads into more thoughtful games . Second , it is a great tool to teach about money . Not just how to use money , but some of the deeper lessons of money . It may sound silly , but , every day I ask my son " What would you do with all your money ? " The answer has changed from " Buying every toy on Earth " to more thoughtful statements of possibly helping someone . Finally , I also appreciate that it 's solar powered despite being plastic junk . It is durable and all around a great item .
5 #### This cash register was the ideal gift for my 5yr old son . it really had helped him recognize how money works . and he learns simple math skills at the same time
5 #### A little advanced for my 2 yo who lost all the money inside the register , but she loves playing with it , almost daily in her pretend play .
4 #### My guys love to play with it but I got it too soon for them . The biggest issue has been the paper money . It wrinkles and tears very easily . By the time , they can really play with it and somewhat understand , that paper money will be history . Love that it is solar powered though !
5 #### Bought these for part of an art project . They 're exactly what I needed .
2 #### These are the only wooden block we could find in such a large size . I 'm kind of disappointed in them . The paint is stamped on pretty messy , so on some the raised letter does n't line up with the paint quite right . The paint easily chips off of the textured sides . Also , several of the blocks have huge cracks in the wood that go down an entire side of the block , nearly cutting it in half . This makes them hard to stack and also makes me worry about splintering in the future . I would not buy these again or recommend them .
4 #### my daughter loves these ! they are still a bit big for her , since she 's just barely 6 months old , but she enjoys gnawing on them and knocking them down . Stepping on them in the dark is on par with legos though , so be careful .
5 #### It 's Candy Land ! ! Need I say more ? ! Ok .. I will .. We absolutely love this game . Unlike all of the other versions out there this one is the one closest to the one from when we were younger . Our son loves it . It 's great to add to those family game nights !
4 #### This game has been great fun for myself and my almost four year old . My two year old also enjoys it , though she does n't get color concepts yet . I 'm going to assume it 's good for her to participate , though . My only disappointment is that they have removed the character , Plumpy , from the board . I do n't really know WHY I 'm disappointed though , as my dad used to always send me back to Plumpy and laugh hysterically , making me cry every time . Oh , the nostalgia .
5 #### Our granddaughter got two cash registers for Christmas and this one was far superior . It has all the elements to teach children about money and how to play store .
4 #### This would be better with 4 slots for bills , since the set comes with 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 dollar bills . otherwise very fun toy !
5 #### Gift for my 4 year old grandson , still a little to young for this game .
5 #### Receive item expeditiously and was a Christmas present . My sister loved it .
5 #### A great gift , my granddaughter 's dad is Korean and they love them .
5 #### This is an updated version of the game . If you do n't like the new graphics , you can get the older version by buying the 65th anniversary edition . I went ahead and bought that one , and it 's great . All the old graphics I love , and now I can play it with my grandson .
4 #### Updated version of a classic , game is the same but the board is redrawn . Not exactly an improvement but the game is still fun and easy for young children
5 #### Great game helps with color recognition and turn taking .
4 #### Cute but prefer original , the game board is pretty busy , hard to focus on path .
5 #### I bought this for my 4 yr . old grandson . He is a little young but he loves it . If it will last for a few years , he will learn a lot from it
5 #### We had taken our Gransons on a mini vacation and in the hotel room they had a copy of the Candy Land game . It was fun having a game that we could all play without worrying about age . It was also fun watching their faces when they beat Grandma and Papa . The graphics on the board are much brighter and " fun " compared to the version we had for our son . All of this without using a computer or having to go on line .
5 #### I simply can not think of a better beginning board game for your toddler . They will love the bright colors as well as the speed and simplicity of play . This familiar game sets up simply and teaches basic concepts of rules , turn taking , and paying attention . The game plays out in perhaps 5 minutes and therefore is quicker and easier to play than ' Chutes and Ladders ' . Also , the child does not have to count as required in ' Chutes and Ladders ' . Both games are excellent , but start with ' Candy Land ' if you have any doubt of the toddlers ability to count and stay attentive for perhaps 15 minutes as necessary for ' Chutes and Ladders ' .
5 #### Great learning toy . Makes a great gift . Has nice pictures on blocks for baby to look at . Nice box to store them in . Would recommend it .
2 #### We got these as a gift for my one year old 's birthday . These smell SO STRONGLY of chemicals ! Since they 're made in China I 'm rather concerned about my child to putting these in her mouth .
4 #### the first day out of the box , it had a very powerful paint odor . it no longer gives me a head ache , but i do recommend anyone buying this to air it out outside for a bit .
5 #### Bought this for my almost 3 - year old granddaughter , who has as fun dumping them out , stacking them , and putting them back into the storage box . Comes with a plastic " cover " that holds the blocks in the cube for storage .
5 #### My 11 - month old has had them for about a month now and he loves them ! I stack them up , he knocks them over , and we both laugh . The quality is great , too
5 #### I bought these LARGE Size Wooden blocks because are easy to handle by toddlers and do not pose a choking hazard . The wooden Storage box is a real bonus . My little grandsons will enjoy these for years to come .
5 #### Lots of laughs when we play operation , it brings back a lot of fun memories .
5 #### My 2 year old daughter is obsessed with doctors so I was n't at all surprised when she asked for this operation game .. She loves it but mentioned that the buzzer scares her when it vibrates so I removed the battery .. it is just as much fun for us both .
5 #### We bought the cash register for my daughter for her birthday , which is still a couple months away . Therefore , we are unsure of the durability of the product . I did take it out of the box when it arrived to check it out . It does come with play money including both paper and coins . It is solar powered and actually does math . It comes with a credit / debit card that can be swiped . The thing I like best about the cash register is that my daughter will be able to use it for many years . It is usable for a 3 year old and will still be much fun for an 8 year old . It seems to be the educational toy I was looking for that will grow with my daughter .
5 #### We bought this for our daughter 's 6th birthday . It was one of her favorite gifts and we play with it nearly everyday . She likes to play restaurant , spa and have her own shop to sell different items like toys and books . Some of our favorite things about the cash register : - it has solar powered battery - it makes a pleasant beep sound when you slide the pretend credit card - it comes with money and coins - it has a notepad to make notes or use it to give receipts ( a regular size notepad , so you can replace it when the paper is gone ) I love that this cash register is simple but still has a lot of functionality . It 's easy to use and enhances both our playtime and our homeschool learning experience . For even more fun , I purchased a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Kikkerland - Classic - Stationery - Bell - SC03 / dp / B001QTSSGM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Kikkerland Classic Stationery Bell ( SC03)</a>&nbsp;to go with the cash register so that customers can ring the bell . It was a huge hit and the bell makes a pleasant sound .
5 #### She uses it for her pretend business . It 's good quality , easy to use , and the kids all think its fun !
5 #### Fantastic blocks ! These things are a great size ! I 'm looking forward to my daughter playing with them and really working with the letters . Very clear , very bright , excellent purchase
4 #### I thought they would be alittle bigger than they actually were but my son is going to love these when he opens them on Christmas morning . I love the wooden blocks . I had them as a kid I am glad I found them . They shipped real quick also .
1 #### Small little set not what I expected . Found a much nicer larger set at one of the big dollar chains . A waste and not a good gift . Looks cheap
2 #### These Larger Size Blocks are a Nice Size But LACKING QUALITY CONTROL . The Paint is Missing on A lot of the blocks & they are giving off a Bad Chemical Smell on top of that . I Would Not Let Kids Play with these right away , AIR THEM OUT FIRST . I Bought these for my photography with kids and hoped to add another two sets to my Prop box But I Will Not Be Buying Any More . I hope I did n't just waste my money , these are made in China too . I Hope this feedback Helps . Truly Gerard
4 #### My grandson really likes to play with the blocks . The blocks have great color and a great variety of subjects and colors on the blocks .
4 #### My little grandson loves this game and often wants to play it again and again . It 's easy for beginners as they only need to count the number of color spaces to move . The board is very colorful and the short cut paths well marked - but I still need to help him with which direction his piece moves after a short - cut . I must admit that I find two games about my max as it gets a bit tedious . ( I 'm looking forward to when he gets old enough for dominoes and backgammon . )
3 #### The game is the classic version . But the quality is not great . The cards are printed very off center and some even have color where there should n't be color .
5 #### Classic fun for the whole family ... our niece and nephew love it !
4 #### My 6 year old granddaughter is enjoying this game .
5 #### My grandson always wanted one of these . He has a great time with it .
5 #### This is a great toy , the play money looks real enough to be used as a teaching tool . My kids age six and four beg to play with this one and its getting my 4 yr . old boy interested in math .
5 #### I love that it is solar powered and that they can learn to use money as well as play " store " .
4 #### great for the grandkids , we got it for them for here to have to play when they come to visit and they love it ... so much fun and helps learn the use of money and change ! !
5 #### I bought one of the cash registers , primarily for my oldest granddaughter , as she is obsessed with money . She played with it nonstop the first day she saw it . When it was time to go home , I knew she would be upset at leaving the cash register at my house , so I sent it home with her and bought a second one for my house . It has provided hours of playtime for my grandchildren . They love hitting the " open " button and watching the drawer slide open . It comes with a substantial number of coins and play bills so multiple children can enjoy playing . The cash register is sturdy with large keys for little fingers . I think this is a toy they will use for quite some time .
5 #### I bought these as a prop for my photo shoots , maternity or infant pictures . They are very detailed and larger than normal , perfect for grandparents and/or photos .
5 #### It took me a while to find blocks in this size , most I found online were only 1 inch in size , not as much fun as these classic blocks . My 3 year old loves making walls , and staris , and houses and " zoos " with them . My 1 year old is learning to stack with them , and loves the box they came in and putting the blocks back in it . Great simple toy that helps kids use their imagination to create something . Have not seen any chipping or fading paint ... and these block have been thrown across the room .
5 #### I had Candyland as a child . I think it was one of my very first board games . To me , this was n't only a fun game , it was my dream land . Remember when you were a child and you would walk into a candy store , wide eyed and amazed . That 's how I felt when I played Candyland as a child . So when I saw this again years later , nostalgic memories came flooding back and I had to get it for my kids . The pictures have changed a little . The gingerbread men do n't feel as sturdy but we are still so happy we got it . Its a very fun family game for the little ones . All of the spaces are color coded and match the cards , so kids can feel independent while playing . If you have lil ones and looking for a family game , this is perfect .
3 #### I miss the old 1984 version . Not sure why they added so many more characters . I also hate that it 's not Queen Frostine but " Princess Frostine " and they made her all " sexy " looking .
5 #### This book might be unhealthy for those interested in farm to fork foods . However , the kids love this game , and it is an all - time favorite as gifts .
3 #### Bought this for a gift . My grandaughter likes it !
3 #### A classic game that never goes out of fashion . Bought for my Grand - Daughter who enjoys it all the time . Good purchase !
5 #### I bought this for my five - year - old son to help prepare him for Kindergarten . We have so much fun playing store with it and at the same time he has learned how to identify all of the coins and paper play money that comes with it . He is learning how to count in increments too . I 'm thrilled . As he gets older I 'm planning on using it to teach him how to count back change and do more advanced / complicated increment counting .
5 #### Love this toy . My kids love it and I love it . They can play and have fun or we can use it to learn counting and other math skills . All the buttons are fully functional so you can actually use it as a calculator in a pinch !
3 #### My daughter , she loves these blocks . I have discovered that i hate these blocks . I was in the process of picking them up and stepped back over one , and it put a hole the size of a dime in my foot . So we 've put them up till she s a bit older , I wish they were a bit bigger , but i can deal with the size , its the sharp edges that i dislike . So we love these blocks , in the closet where big people wo n't step on them , at least for another year i think . Oh , and my daughter got them for a first birthday present , and the size worked perfectly well with her .
5 #### Someone gave these blocks to one of my children about 5 years ago . I liked them because they are much larger than most of the wooden blocks in stores . Fast forward a few years and 5 kids later , they are still great blocks . All 5 of my kids play with them at least once a day . The kids stack the blocks , build forts out of them , spell messages to each other , teach their baby brother about all the colors and letters on the blocks ... the list goes on . And the blocks still look great too ! No paint chips or fading . Really great , high quality product . I 'm buying a set for my nephew this Christmas .
5 #### Bought this item to use for my maternity pictures . The blocks were just what we were needing . They were small enough so we could spell out my new bundle of joy 's name and they had cute pictures on them . I am sure they will get good use for my little guy . I thought they were just as described and did not look cheap but just what wooden blocks should look like .
5 #### Great classic game and kids played it over Christmas . It was a big hit !
4 #### So far the game works fine . It has all the pieces , and the buzzer and light works well . I was glad there was a classic version available , but I did n't remember the ice cream cone in the head . I looked it up and saw that the ice cream came along in 2004 ; that 's pretty late to be " classic . " I wish it was exactly like the one I had as a kid . I wonder why companies keep making " classic " and " retro " editions of games and toys but including changes that make the game or toy not the way it was . It 's still better than playing on one of the new boards , but the fake parts in the classic / retro games are sad reminders that we may never again play the same games we played as kids . Dear Milton Bradley , Please stop with the ridiculous Star Wars and Frozen and every - Disney - movie versions of all of our old games . We want the REAL versions of the games .
5 #### Love this classic version of the game . It 's pretty much exactly like what I had when I was a kid .
5 #### This version of the game is just as pretty as the original . I 've seen a few " modern " ones with images that seem geared toward an older group , sort of like those Bratz dolls , but this is n't one of those . My three year old loves it and has a great time playing each time we bring it out .
5 #### Candyland is such a great first game for any girl or boy . My kids started to play it at 4 years old and enjoyed it all the way up to 8 years old . Now they play more of Spot it ! , UNO , Monopoly , and Yahtzee .
1 #### Please see the reviews of this game from the other sellers on Amazon . Most buyers call it a piece of junk . Also check prices of the various sellers . http://www.amazon.com/Candy-Land-Kingdom-Sweets-Board/dp/B00000DMF5/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1409928779&sr=1-1&keywords=candy+land
5 #### Who does n't love candy land ? I like this version as the board only folds down once . Other game board we have that fold down twice to half this size always seem to fall apart . Also , my 3 - year old loves the little gingerbread boy game pieces . Great price and a great first game . We play it at least once a day .
4 #### It would be cool if the register made sounds when you pushed the buttons and slid the credit card . Also , there should be more than 3 slots for money - right now it only has room for $ 1 , $ 5 , and $ 10 . The money that comes with the set is also pretty cheap , so I bought another better set here on Amazon .
3 #### My daughter loved playing with these blocks . They 're good to stack , or put in and out of the box . My only issue is that they are very sharp if you happen to step on one and sliced my foot open . But just sitting down playing with them was totally fine .
1 #### These blocks arrived looking like they had been slightly used . I thought , okay , no big deal , but then the paint begain chipping off more . Cheap blocks . It 's what I get for the price payed .
3 #### These are a LOT smaller than I thought they would be . They are only about 1 inch by 1 inch . My son likes them , but quickly gets bored . Because they are so small , they are not very easy for a baby to stack and play with . The upside is that they are small enough that he can easily grab and hold them .
1 #### I 'm not sure how these blocks got any positive reviews . Most important to me ... all the blocks with the pic of an elephant are misspelled and read " elerhant " . The pictures over all are not great . The grapes look like cherries ... have you ever seen candy apple red grapes ? The apples look like red pumpkins . Some of the blocks have pictures but the corresponding letter has been replaced by a symbol and other letters ... confusing to a child trying to learn . Additionally , the quality of these blocks is not great as the paint was already scratched off on a few when they arrived and the wood is frayed on some . They have a strong odor ( kind of like clay ) . Lastly , they are quite small as others warned although the size is clearly written in the description . I expect to see a set like this at a dollar store and would not recommend .
3 #### These blocks were overall everything that was stated in the listing . I maybe should have looked at the finer print because the blocks were much smaller than I was expecting . I would not recommend these for any kids younger than 3 yrs , as my 22 month old daughter is still at an age where she could hurt herself or someone else with the blocks . The corners are sort of on the sharper , pointier side , and I would rather they were not quite that sharp . The price is not bad but I do know you can find some better choices at some of the chain stores for about the same price , $ 10 , give or take a few dollars .
1 #### The blatant sexualization of the female characters pictured inside the board , which are not shown in the pictures , is very disappointing . Shame on me for not reading the reviews before the purchase .
5 #### It 's Candyland ! We wee looking for the original game & could n't find it local .
5 #### What 's there to say ? It 's a classic ! Love this game .
5 #### My 4 - yr - od daughter got this for Christmas and I noticed the older kids kept wanting a turn ! It " cha - ching 's ! " when you open the drawer , the money is very life - like , and the little card is sturdy . I love that it shuts off on it 's own and is n't one more toy requiring batteries . It 's a sturdy little machine that I am sure we will have for many years to come !
4 #### This is a good option if you are on a budget but get the one with the coin slot if you can . A lot more fun for the kids .
5 #### This Cash Register actually works ! The only drawback is there are only 3 places for bills . So , you have to put the $ 20 's and $ 10 's in the same place , the $ 5 's in one , and the $ 1 's in the other . Then you have the spaces for the change . It comes with the play money ! It also comes with the pretend credit card . My little girl enjoys getting on the real phone and telling people to hold on and pretending to ring people up and then going back and when the person asks if she was playing , she tells them , " NO , I was working ! " It really adds , subtracts , multiplies , and divides ! Has a little paper pad for them write little notes .
5 #### we love it . good value for wooden blocks . nice sized blocks . my 14 month old has no problem holding them and stacking them .
4 #### I like that these blocks have a nice wooden box to stack them in when play is over . But could do without the plexiglass lid . My son loves to dump them out then load them into his train or stack them . They are colorful . But I have noticed that the paint and or wood is chipping on some of them . That worries me a bit as I do n't want them to become to sharp or give splinters . Other than that , the blocks work well .
5 #### My daughter plays wtih this and builds towers , very entertained . The simplicity allows her own imagination to let loose , without all the bells and whistles to do it for her . Every kid needs a good set of blocks , and as she gets older she can learn her letters , shapes , animals , and numbers with them .
5 #### ' twas birthday time too young for socks so we bought our girl these awesome blocks She got the gift on the right day and promptly then began to play We 'd searched the stores we 'd trekked the aisles we 'd looked and looked for miles and miles But on this site we found this thing that made our little grandchild sing .
3 #### I thought it was supposed to buzz as well as vibrate when you hit the side . But it just has a weird vibration and is n't as sensitive as it should be ( as I remember ) .
3 #### The instructions included in our game skip a sequence so we had to go on line to find the proper way to play this game . It is fun but this game has been around for many years and they should have the instructions figured out by now .
5 #### Grandchildren and their parents were so excited when this gift was opened up . They plan to play the game asap .
5 #### Perfect game for kids to play during game night . It teaches patience for preschoolers in a fun way . It also makes me nostalgic of my own childhood . Love this game !
5 #### Hours of entertainment and great for learning colors and learning to count .
5 #### Ordered this for our 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas . Exactly as described and was very impressed with the quality . Received it quckly . Would definitely recommend to anyone .
4 #### This was a Christmas gift for my 3 year old . It 's a cool toy - the money is fairly realistic and the buttons are easy to press . The screen could be a bit bigger as it 's can be a bit tough to see ( it 's great toddler height , but not so much for bigger people kneeling next to them ) I do wish there was something more for the drawer than just an open button . Something akin to the older generations where you entered an amount and hit the button to open it . The credit card is a nice touch .
4 #### I got this to give to a family for Christmas . When my daughter was young we enjoyed it .
4 #### This game has not changed much in 25 years which is good . It is a simple game that younger children can understand and enjoy playing .
5 #### I gave this 5 stars because this IS a truly classic game for many past generations and for many future generations to come ! As a grandparents we both remember playing it as children . I purchased this for our granddaughter who is too young for it at the present time however , we KNOW she 'll love it as much as we did and our children did growing up . Absolutely recommend it for ALL children !
5 #### My four year old loves this game . It 's worked well as a ' first board game ' for her . She loves playing it .
4 #### Little ones , 3 and up love to play board games . This one is very easy to play and still gives them the interaction with other players as they learn to get alone and play together .
5 #### This is a great educational toy that will teach our daughter about american currency . We love to play " shopping " with her mini shopping cart and play foods and other items from around the house . This will be a great addition to that game .
3 #### I received the one pictured her - with the " Brain Freeze " item . I liked it , however the buzzer in mine does n't work . So although I really dig the fact that this is as " old school " cool and fun as I remember from my childhood , I wish my buzzer worked . It 'd be more " proof " to my little kids when they touch the sides , and have to " let the specialist take over " ! All - in - all , it is a fun game , requires 2x AA batteries , and is a true " blast from your past " game .
4 #### Good one . My grand - daughters love it . They are 6 and 9 yrs old .
2 #### This game is sadistic . I 'm fairly sure that is does more to desensitize players to death than to actually inspire us become surgeons when we grow up . The buzzer haunts my dream at night . That said , if it needs to exist then it should be the classic version without any " new " or " updated " pieces .
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with this classic game ! Fun for both children and adults ! Who does n't love the anticipation of possibly getting shocked ... especially when you know it does n't hurt ? !
3 #### This is the version with the cards , like the game was originally made with . The only issues I have are that the updated game board makes the game longer than so the littlest players lose interest before the end and the smaller squares are a bit difficult for the younger crowd to actually aim and get their piece on . If I could find an old game board somewhere , I would use it until the kid is a bit older with better fine motor skills .
5 #### I remember this game from being a kid , and I purchased this one for Children 's Hospital LA . Still as cute as ever !
5 #### Thank you for putting out a quality product for such a good price . As for me and my company we will use you again .
5 #### Game has been around for a long time and I was very satisfied with my purchase . Highly ecommend this game .
5 #### We play this with our 3 - year old . We opted for this one instead of the one you can buy in stores , because the new one comes with a spinner instead of cards . How are you supposed to get the jump - ahead spots with a spinner that only has the colors on it ? And no double colors ? Craziness . Anyway , this one is the classic version with the cards and everything . Fun for the little ones .
5 #### This was a Christmas gift for a 3 year old . She spent a lot of time selling us things all afternoon . Very well constructed . She loves old credit cards . This was perfect . Very fine product .
5 #### Do n't even think of buying a different cash register . This one is perfect ! I love that it 's solar powered and does n't eat up batteries . Well made , worth every cent . Great present !
5 #### I specifically got on amazon today just to write a review for this purchase ! This cash register is awesome ! My daughter received this as a Xmas gift this year & she has been playing with ever since . I love the fact that it is solar powered , no need for batteries . The noises it makes , the play money , the look of the register , all looks real . This is a must have for any grocery store and I promise your kids will love it .
4 #### box and all seem much more flimsy ... but the game is still great fun for the kidos ..
3 #### This is an old game & my 5 year old grandson does n't like it
4 #### I miss the original Candy Land . This one is changed up and looks eerily like Candy Crush . Hmm ... But my kid does n't know any better and thinks its pretty fun so I guess its all good .
5 #### I just gave Candy Land to my grandson . His mom & I played it with him and it was a toss - up as to who had the most fun ! I played Candy Land 60 years ago when I was 5 , and my daughter - in - law played it when she was little , too . The board is a bit more crowded than the original , but we all had a great time with it . It helps with color recognition , counting , and learning to take turns .
5 #### You have to love a toy that does not require batteries and works right out of the box ! Operates just like a solar calculator and comes with the play money .
4 #### This cash register is a good toy to re - enact a store . My kids loves it , and the credit card slot is a fun extra ( after all most stores uses credit cards ! ) . Useful to teach kids about money , but it is even better as simple toy , opening and closing the drawer to take money seems to be the most fun part after all .
5 #### She first saw this at her preschool and wanted one for herself at home . She uses it a lot in her dramatic play . It is well constructed and the money is helpful in teaching her about currency .
2 #### 7 yr old is not impressed . First time playing it , one of the pieces slid inside the hole to where it was impossible to even touch it without the buzzer going off . Buzzer going off vibrated the board and moved more pieces out of reach . I 'm amazed because I remember loving this game but kiddo refuses to try it again . " That one 's no fun . Let 's give it away . "
5 #### It 's exactly what I was expecting ! I loved this version as a kid , so it is nice having the same version for my kids . They love playing it !
5 #### Awesome . I love seeing the kids play a game I grew up with . I forgot how tiny the parts are so watch if toddlers are in the area .
3 #### This game is nothing like the one I had when I was younger . The board , cards , and pieces are made cheap , the characters are all different than before and are just plain average looking , nothing exciting here .
5 #### If you never played this game with your kids . What are you waiting for ? This is the go to game when the kids are at my house .
5 #### This was for my grandson . It was shipped early and was everything that was advertised . Excellent and educational toy . He should have years of fun playing with it .
5 #### Bought this cash register in 2009 for my granddaughter . She 's 6 now & still playing w/ this & I 'm sure will continue to do so for quite some time . I love that this is a toy that is not only fun but educational as well . It teaches children to understand different denominations of paper money as well as coins , counting , making change , hand - eye coordination , role play , etc . We 've used this cash register to play Grocery store , Xmas shopping at the Mall , Pet shop , & on & on . This is a toy that will provide yrs of fun , yet educational , play value for your child .
1 #### My son loved this toy , but we returned it as the digital display never functioned properly and displayed only gibberish rather than numbers . Sure , I got my money back , but did not appreciate the hassle . Also , the drawer opens so forcefully that money flies out every time ... my son needs no help making messes . Looking at other brands as I 'm very hesitant to buy this product again .
5 #### I purchased this register well over 2 years ago here on Amazon . My girls still play with it on a regular basis . It is sturdy and works well . Ours has even fallen quite a few times and it has n't broken . Some reviewers say it is cheaply made , I do n't agree at all . It is very nicely made , the colors are bright , the calculator works fine and all the number buttons work very well . I give it 5 stars because it is educational , durable , pretty and fun . My girls use it to play grocery store , to play pretend shopping and they also use the money that comes with the register to play other games .
5 #### My 3 and 6 year old both love this . My 6 year old can count the money and use the register , my 3 year old loves swiping the credit card , opening the drawers and playing with the coins . The only minor complaint and this is for toy in this range is that I wish they made the bills out of something like tyvek or material so they do n't get torn ... as the included ones are paper . On the upside you could purchase a million dollars worth of paper play money cheaply if it does get destroyed .
2 #### It was cheap- the quality the look . I did n't like it and sent it back right away . It was n't what I was imagining to complete the grocery store I wanted for them .
5 #### Had this game as a child , bought it for my 8 year old son for Christmas . He , his sisters , cousins and friends love playing this game ! !
3 #### My 3 yo could n't find a square to move her piece since the board was so busy . Cards were thrown everywhere . We gave it away . She 's now 4 and she gets it . It is rated for too young of a child . Try the newer ed9ition with the spinner .
5 #### Bought for grandchildren visits . Had one for our children when they were younger and liked so well that knew grandchildren would love it as well .
5 #### So much fun ..... love to play ! A lot of fun for kids and fir their families . It is awesome to play this game with my grand child .
3 #### The commercial makes it look so exciting , and kids WILL have fun with this game . However , be prepared to have an adult to supervise , the construction of the trap , and direct gameplay ( which can be frustratingly long for younger children ) . Sadly , this game wo n't stand up to too much punishment , many small and often vital pieces are easily broken rendering the whole game useless . Having been around for so long it 's getting pretty stale as well , and offers zip in the way of education - except taking turns , and fair play . Not for younger kids , and probably OK for the 7 - 10 range , but they probably want a computer ! It 's probably time the makers of this game visited the year 2000
5 #### This is a sturdy cash register toy . My daughter has lots of fun playing with this cash register and it is very educational for her to learn addition and subtraction on money concept . She has lots of fun to count the coins and play pretends . The solar power works immediately . My kid loves the sound it generated when the drawer pop open .
2 #### We bought this for our 3 year old daughter after reading the positive reviews . Sadly , within a few hours of having this cash register , the drawer would not stay closed . We try to close it , and it latches for a couple of seconds , then springs open on its own . If we had been more proactive , we would have returned this for another brand .
5 #### Just like we had when we were kids . My nephew loved it .
5 #### Same as it was when we were kids :-)
5 #### My 4 yr old lovesssssss this game . He begs me to play it with him all day ! You can start your kids on this game at age 2 . It encourages learning counting and colors . Great game !
5 #### this may be the new version , but it really is a nice game and fun to play . My 3 yr old son loves playing it and it is nice and sterdy board game and the game pieces are so cute ...
5 #### We gave this game to our three year old son on Christmas Eve along with Spill the Beans . This was much more popular and we played for almost an hour before he got bored .
5 #### My son loves it . Every time it 's in the playroom , he plays with it . It has a card ( any thing that size works ) and it makes a beep when swiped . It comes with money , too . The buttons work as a calculator , and it dings when the drawer opens . The battery lasted about a year , and it 's easy to replace . Like it better than other registers I looked at .
1 #### To describe this toy in brief I 'd have to say all it is is a large calculator that makes a " ding " noise when it opens . I purchased it for my 6 year old so she can practice math through productive play but for what I spent ( $ 33 ) I was better off purchasing her fake money from the 99cent store and a large calculator , I would 've save a good amount of bucks and it would ve been the same effect . The dollar bills and coins do not look realistic as advertised and it is not solar powered it uses a cell battery . So much for reading reviews ! If it did n't cost dam near as much as I paid for it to send it back I would ve sent it back as soon as I opened it and tried it out . It did n't captivate her amusement but for 30min . There are better options out there . DON'T BUY THIS TOY FOR MORE THAN $ 10 As for durability it is sturdy . The plastic is very thick .
5 #### I purchased this for my son on his third birthday . I was really surprised at how sturdy and well made it was . It is solar powered so the calculator will always work . You will need batteries however for the cash register to make the " ching " noise as it opens and closes and for the beeping noise with the credit card . The batteries were already included which was nice . It came with plenty of play money and coins and a credit card . It is a great eduactional toy which kids as young as my son all the way to much older kids will enjoy playing with . I highly recommend this cash register . It is a great buy !
5 #### Classic , i had this as a child . I love playing it with my son !
4 #### Fun game with little kids but the design has changed over the years and the kids liked the old one better as I did but they have fun with it . Does not have as many ex . lolly pop or rainbow ways to slide down and all the charcters are smaller and everything more compact not as easy for little ones 4 - 6 to use .
5 #### I was a little surprised that this was n't my childhood Candy Land- they 'd changed the board and action pieces and switched around some of the characters- no more Grandma Nut- but all in all , this will be my son 's " classic " and it 's easy enough for an almost three year old that he learned the rules and how to play in just one sitting .
4 #### I 'm sure I 'm a purist but I found the new board to be visually cluttered . My son loves it , though , and it 's a classic . There is no doubt that this remains one of the most boring games for adults to play ( I 'll admit to slipping a double orange out of the pile to end my misery on occasion ) but it does help the little ones learn how to take turns , increases familiarity with colors and teaches good sportsmanship ( as long as he does n't catch me cheating ! ! )
5 #### I loved this game as a kid and am enjoying watching my daughter love playing it too . She is still very young so she is getting used to rules and how games work . But she is grasping ideas quickly . She loves candy and sweets ( just like her mommy ) so I think it helps her not get so bored with it . :)
5 #### I grew up with this game many , many years ago . We got it for our grandniece - she loves it . A time honored game that will forever go on .
3 #### Bought this for my son 's 4th bday . He likes to play with one at school that looks more like an old time stand up register . Basically this one is a large solar calculator with a cash drawer . We thought he 'd go nuts over it , but its clearly " that gift " that is n't getting played with . Maybe he will in the future .
5 #### Great first game for a child . My 4 year old grandchild loves it . She giggles when she moves the gingerbread man forward .
5 #### Its not exactly the same as the Candy Land from when I was a kid but my 4 year old loves it all the same .
4 #### 1 star because I want you parents to understand the game CAN actually hurt ( no harm ) the kids sensitive young nerves in the hands ; but actually hurts . Let them know beforehand . Santa does n't want to hurt for Christmas
5 #### Excellent game to play with my grandson . It is relatively fast moving and a short game ( around 15 - 20 minutes ) so he never gets bored or distracted during the game . It was simple enough for him to understand it when he was 3 , we still enjoy it now that he is 4 .
5 #### The four - year - old that I purchased it for put all other toys away - organized her coin and bills and began to play store . Loved it !
1 #### If you notice most 5 star reviews are dated pre 2006 . It seems the board has been changed since then . I bought this for my son and was expecting the classic candy land game ... I was very surprised to see the changes that have been made . This version is very busy ... which causes it to lose a lot of it 's charm ( and give me a headache ) . This game is meant for toddlers ... the board should n't be a chaotic mess . Not a good update in my opinion . If something is n't broke , do n't try to " fix " it .
5 #### The grand kids love this game and for that I am grateful . The Candy Land game is very for kids .
5 #### There is a reason nearly every child owns or has at least played Candy Land at least once . Its a classic . It 's easy to learn & small children can join in the fun because they do n't need to know how to count or read . If they can identify colors , they can play . We had a Candy Lane game for our first grandchild . She lives 2 hours away . She enjoyed the game so much , we let her take it home . This game is going to remain at Nana 's house so all of the grandchildren , as well as Nana :) can enjoy the game .
5 #### Son loves the game and loves to invite his friends over to the house to play . Maybe not in a year or two - he 's getting into sports , but for rainy days it is great to have this for him to stay occupied inside !
5 #### Oh this horrid game ! My son loves it ... It teaches basic color and counting skills . We are working on strategy and how NOT to cheat . But I am sure it will come along . The game board is a bit noisy with colors and pictures and the trail is a little tight but other than that it is a very cute game .
4 #### I love that my son loves this just as much as I did . The board looks a bit different but the game is just as fun as I remember .
5 #### Delivered timely & accurately described ! Not as nice as the original but still looks & works great .
4 #### This is pretty much the Operation I remember . Or at least as close as it 's going to get . Avoid the other version with the horrible reviews . The only drawback to this game is that the board 's " chambers " for the pieces are a bit too deep on the sides , so the pieces can hide almost out of sight . The walls should have been closer to the actual room needed for each piece .
5 #### A Christmas gift for my grandson . He is 13 .
3 #### Complicated rules for younger kids ! My grandson just plays with the trap ! He likes setting it up and taking it down and trapping the mice !
5 #### This is a great game ! The plastic pieces are a little flimsy but the contraption functions perfectly to trap the mice in a multiplayer game . My grandchildren and I enjoyed playing this game .
5 #### I gave this to my seven - year - old grandson for Christmas . He enjoys putting the game together and the little mice in the game .
5 #### If you played this years ago as a child you can rest assured it is the same today ! My original version was lost many moons ago and so we purchased this for our 7 year old 's birthday . What a blast from the past ! There are 12 body parts to remove and one ( ankle bone to the knee bone ) to connect . Yes , Sam 's nose still buzzes and goes red if you touch the metal with your " operating " tool ! 2AA batteries ( required ) are NOT provided . The body parts come all attached on one piece of plastic so you will need to remove these before play can commence . I would also recommend a ziplock bag to keep the money and doctor / specialist cards in as there is no compartment in the game . The playing board measures approximately 8 3/4 " x 15 " . We purchased this at full price . We were not required to write a review but chose to do so . Thanks , Liz
5 #### This game never gets old . It is the classic game we all grew up on . As I get older seems like this game gets harder . The kids always love it .
5 #### I purchased this as a Christmas gift . It is for my grandson . A great game that has been around for sooooo many years ! Everyone I know always loved to play Candy Land !
5 #### Who does nt love a good game of Candy Land . I m excited to share this item with family . Who 's up for family game night !
5 #### Not the same game I grew up with ( pictures on the game board ) but it 's beautiful and tons of fun !
5 #### Exactly as you remember from your childhood . Fun family game . My kids are 6 , 8 , and 10 and all enjoy it .
3 #### Pieces do not work or fit together properly , which is the main point of the game play .... very disappointing for my children ! ! They do n't make it like when I was a child ! !
4 #### It seems like a lot of assembly time is required to even play the game . Then stuffing it back in the box when you are done is a challenge . Knocking off one star for that . The game itself is fun and our family of four with kids 8 and 10 have a good time trying to steal each others cheese and trap the other mice . If only set up and clean up where easier .
5 #### A classic . The whole family loves it , 4 and 7 year old .
5 #### Great classic game ! ! You ca nt go wrong with game ! ! I 'm in my 30 's and I still enjoy playing it with family .
5 #### My 5 yr old and his 83 yr old grandmama love this game !
4 #### got this for my little sister she loves it
5 #### This product rates high with me . It has been one of the kids ' favorite toys . We 've had it since my daughter was 3 , and she 's now 5 . Her 2 year sister is now getting into it too . It has fun sounds , credit card slot , receipt pad and large drawer to hold money . We 've never had a problem with is durability - its been great quality .
3 #### The fun of this game is to assemble and observe how it works the system to catch mice . play with the dice and the Board is very boring .
5 #### Has the actual " game " like cards and money but my kids do n't play with those at all , haha . It 's the version I remember as a kid from the 80s . I do n't like that the box has the Shrek / Minion version on the side since my son asks for that one all the time but from what I read , those are a disappointment to those of us who grew up with this game .
5 #### my son got the new version and it was horrible . no cards to draw or money to earn , you just took turns and like all the stupid " everyone has to get a trophy " mentality , every person succeeds on the first try becasue the cavity is so large nothing could set off the buzzer . BUT THIS CLASSIC VERSION IS GREAT it has all the original pieces to remove ( no stupid cell phone or toxic fart ) and it truly requires patience , thought and dexterity - you know - what a game is supposed to do - challenge you - please do n't get the newer versions . unless you have an IQ of 7 , you;l hate that you spent any money on it - it 's not even a game - but the classic is :)
5 #### Bought for my 4 & 6 year old girls to replace another version of Operation that is inappropriately gross for kids . They like the challenge and are entertained . I like that it is clean and helps to develop their fine motor skills .
5 #### Loved it as a kid . Your kids will love it to .
5 #### Spent lots of time playing this game with grandchildren . A fun activity to occupy a rainy afternoon when an indoor activity is required ..
5 #### My 3 year old loves this game , we play it over and over and we do this before she goes to sleep at night . It teaches her to count , to lose , to wait for her turn .... I love it .
5 #### I purchased this for when my niece spends time with me in the summer ! We had a great time and enjoyed it very much ! Would recommend this to anyone with children , looking for a child safe , fun and entertaining game !
1 #### I could n't wait to buy Candy Land for my daughter . I loved Candy Land when I was younger & I remember being jealous of the newer , cooler versions that came out after " my time " . I could n't wait to open this box ... but I was very disappointed when I opened the box . The game board is TOO busy ! It 's jam - packed with colors , characters , candy , scenery , etc . It 's hard to even see what 's going on ! It 's overwhelming . & honestly , it 's ugly ! we are considering buying a used version of this game that is not so ugly . this board game is over - designed & poorly designed . it 's sad what has happened to this game ... they should have left it well enough alone a few versions ago ...
5 #### This is another great and classic family game for the younger children . My toddler loves to play this game - she is a huge board game fan . It 's easy for her to understand and gives her the independence and pride of knowing that she can play with minimal assistance and direction . Well made and good quality .
4 #### i bought this toy for my 3 1/2 year old son and he loves it . He thinks he is playing but he is also learning math and about money . I had to take away the change , since we have also have a small one in the house , but the paper money is just as fun to play with . The only thing that I would change is the paper money . I wish it was laminated so that our younger son could n't rip it or crinkle it up . My younger son crinkled up the money and when my older son put it in the register it got stuck behind the drawer and we had to take it apart to get the money so the drawer would shut . other than that , it is huge fun in our house .
5 #### Purchased for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter - best $ 35 I ever spent ! She plays " store " all day long with it . Only design flaw is that the cash drawer shoots out at a mile a minute , spilling the change . But she 's learned to hold it with her hand and all 's well . Highly recommended .
1 #### Waste of money / difficult to put together/ direction in Spanish/ put back in box did n't play/ Cheap pieces
5 #### Great for family night , easy for younger children to catch on to
5 #### Buy this version ! This is like the game we had as kids ( well , as close as it gets today . )
5 #### Ohh my the days of growing up in the 90"s i remember playing this game with my father and grandfather hours of fun .
1 #### I ordered this game for a Candyland themed birthday party I am throwing simply because the picture showed it would be the 1997 version . But that is not what I received ! ! ! I looked all over for the 1997 version because that 's the version I grew up with and that is the game board I was basing my entire party off of . I received the newest released version and I HATE it . I am so mad at the false advertisement that I have considered returning the game and just not having the game at the party , but our guests have requested we have the game so I am keeping it . Definitely going in a garage sale after the party .
5 #### I bought this for my two granddaughters , ages 4 and 6 . They loved it and have fun playing it together .
4 #### This is a great basic game for kids who are not reading yet . No bells or whistles but perfectly fun to play as a family .
5 #### I purchased this for my 11 year old daughter . She really wanted the original game . It can be challenging , but that 's the point of the game .
5 #### Finally , the real thing . My kids got the newer version that did n't have the cards , and was so simple . I could n't figure out ( remember ) the purpose of the game . This one is challenging and it is a game rather than a task .
5 #### Had this game as a kid and wanted to get it for my kids . They love it . A little complicated for the 3 year old but my 7 year old loves it . Fun family game .
5 #### AN OLD GAME BUT A CLASSIC ! Wish Hasbro would re - issue this instead of the one they have going around now ! It 's just not the same ! All the pieces seem to be here , and besides some show of age it looks in perfect condition ! Very excited to have this classic game back !
2 #### It does n't work . There should be a 3rd hand on the pipes . The Amazon photo ( took a screen shot ) shows an extra hand . This is critical to keep the helping hand moving sideways . If you can get the helping hand to hit the platform thingy it will work . I have added a photo of what was in the box and a photo of what is on Amazon 's website . Otherwise game pieces seem sturdy and workable .
2 #### Cheaply made junk . Yep was hoping for mouse trap that would be fun for hours for my kids instead got plastic junk ! ! ! They do n't make toys like they use too . Arrived fast as promised
5 #### My 3 and 4 year old both love this game . It 's easy for them to play because you just match colors ; the cards do n't have word ; just one or two blocks of solid color . They both have a blast going through the game .
3 #### Loved Candyland as a kid , and was so glad to be able to buy it for my own daughter . Unfortunately , I really do not like the graphics they use now compared to the original . Otherwise , the game is still classic fun and enjoyable for the kids .
5 #### Candy Land is the classic ' first game ' for toddlers - ? We ALL love to play it with little ones .
5 #### I last played this over thirty years ago . Bought this for my son . Simplistic concept , but easy enough for a 3 year to grasp - which I guess is the whole point . Included in the rules is way of playing the game by drawing two cards each turn then allowing the player to choose which card to play . A simple method of introducing decision - making . The game - board is approximately 18"x24 " in size . Initially , the board seemed rather small , however , I suppose the smaller size makes it easier for a child to reach across the entire board . Very colorful as always , although the subject matter of the game seems to increase the craving for sweets afterwards .
5 #### My little princess loves playing this game and my son likes it too , a fun game to play for family night and on those rainny days when the little one ca n't go outside to play .
1 #### There 's a piece missing even though it said all the pieces were included so the product does n't even work :( you have to minipylate the trap by hand which kind of defeats the purpose . I added a pic of the piece that is missing
4 #### Just as good as the classic ! The kids enjoyed playing this who are 8 and 4 . Was easy to set up with the instructions too since there is a LOT to set up .
5 #### This just solidifies that I should not be a doctor , I for sure made the right career choice . This is the classic version and it rocks .
5 #### This game looks and plays just like it did when I was a kid . Bought those for my boys , they love playing it . Classic game , would recommend !
5 #### I got this for my daughter for her seventh birthday . Not only does she love it , my three year old twins love it as well . It involves them in a lot of pretend play and also is a fabulous teaching tool for all of them . I love the quality of this item and would highly recommend it ! It came at just the right time when my oldest is learning about money in her first grade class . You wo n't be disapointed with this purchase !
3 #### This is a very good cash register and it is durable but I noticed after a time that the money smelled like poop , I think it has something to do with the electronics in the register , I 've tried putting dryer sheets in the drawer but than it just smelled like downey poops , I 've cleaned it too but nothing seems to work . And no my son did n't do anything to cause this odor . Finally I threw the money away and bought him the McDonald register which came with food , a headset , and McDonalds visor , he plays with this much more than the old one and it works just as good . I also purchased a jar of money that I think Amazon sells , it 's cash , change and a check book w/ pen , very cute .
4 #### THis is a great register for teaching money concepts . The pretend coins and bills are very close to real money , but without the germs . The register is sturdy enough , and the buttons are big enough for little hands . Both my kids , ages 4 and 18 months love this toy . It is their favorite Christmas present . I like having them play with the pretend money , rather than the real money that is so filthy . A great buy for budding accounts !
5 #### My kids were aged 1 and 4 when I bought this . They both love it . Toddlers can use it simply by opening it , putting things in , closing , and repeatedly opening it again . Older kids can use the keypad numbers like a calculator for more serious math play and pretend shopping with actual numbers . The sound is a small chirping type sound that is not annoying to me . Most electronic toys highly annoy me . It comes with a small amount of play money . Be aware that replacement money can be purchased at some grocery stores or at dollar stores . I also figured out that buying replacement plastic coins costs more than using real money ! ! I now let them use real coins instead of buying fake coins . Of course this is after my youngest stopped putting things in his mouth . If you worry about choking hazards just let you kids play without coins of any kind , with paper money . My kids also love to put other objects inside this , little toys and such . Kids who visit for playdates also love to play with this toy . I highly recommend it as a good investment as an open - ended imagination - play toy . Another great toy from this company is the telephone .
5 #### My son was so excited to get this . Just like the original . He is 4 and just had to have it after playing with it at his cousins house . So glad Amazon revived the original . The new kid version look terrible .
5 #### This game is simple , fun and easy to play . My 3 year old and I love to play . Sometimes we end up playing longer than expected , but the one on one time is great .
5 #### Great for the little ones . They learn to count and get a kick out of the fun characters and candy designs . It teaches them to develop good game play and that when you win it 's great and when you lose , you can be happy for who won . I wish that the game pieces were a little more creatively designed .
5 #### Fun game for all ages . As a parent , I still enjoy playing this game . I just wish they would bring back the original game board . Everyone needs to have this in their closet . :)
3 #### I do n't understand why companies try to fix things that are n't broken . Now the board is so " busy " it 's annoying to look at , and it 's not even cute . There is a vintage version sold in a tin out there that I found after I purchased this one . So this one is going to Granny 's house ! ! !
5 #### My children played Candyland and now my Grandson beats me everytime . I bought the game for $ 10 and found it at Target at Christmas for $ 5 .
5 #### After reading all the reviews I opted to purchase the more expensive , older version . I 'm not sorry , it 's not too easy and works great .
5 #### I bought my son an operation at Toys R Us last year . When we first played it , I thought he had a career as a surgeon . He was able to clean out all of the bones and body parts without a single buzzer . I remembered that when I was a kid , it was nearly impossible to get the parts out of the body without setting off the buzzer . I was also a little annoyed that instead of realish body parts , the game was full of cell phones and head phones and other silly things . Then I discovered that the game had been changed and made much much easier . Thus started my hunt for the original operation , which THIS is ( although there is an added piece in the brain that was apparently added in the late 2000s . THIS version is what I remember from my childhood : difficult bone removal with an almost guaranteed buzzer , parts that slide so far out of reach that you can barely see them , and an actual challenge .
5 #### It 's a fun game for the granddaughter & I
3 #### I got this as a gift for my 4 & 6 year old sons . They were not very interested .
5 #### My kids love this game ! They do n't really play the game , usually just set up the mouse trap and let it off over and over for fun !
5 #### Just like the game we played as kids . Not like the new version in stores now .
4 #### The pieces get lost under the board and then you have to shake the whole game to find the pieces again . I find this game more frustrating than fun , but the five year old loves it . It would be impossible for him to not set the buzzer off , so we just give him three - second tries .
5 #### This is such a fun game . I love the more classic feel . It is almost impossible to find in the store without it being spongebob or despicable me or just some weird version that is different than i remember . The kids and i enjoy it .
1 #### They forgot a piece when designing this . It wo n't work without it .
5 #### Finally an old school version of Mouse Trap . That new version they are peddling at big box stores is a joke !
5 #### Great family game . Bought it for my nephews . They are excited to play .
5 #### Classic game , Just liked I remembered it a s a kid
2 #### I had fond memories of playing this game growing up , so I was excited when my kids received it for Christmas . After opening the game , however , I 'm not so excited . They have changed the board from the classic version ; it is much more visually cluttered and Princess Lollypop and Queen Frostine look like Bratz dolls , which I 'm not happy about .. Also , after playing the game as an adult , I realized that it requires no skill whatsoever and is completely a game of chance . Not super educational . I 'll probably end up donating it to the thrift store .
5 #### We bought this for my 3 year old for Christmas and it 's become part of our nightly routine to play this . He loves this game !
4 #### My girls love this game , but the board is a bit busy . They sometimes have a hard time following the trail and try to skip ahead too far .
5 #### This is a fun game for the whole family ! We love it ! !
4 #### My seven year old son really wanted this game and he seems to really like it . I find it a little difficult to put together , but I guess that is the fun of the game . A decent game and that my son really enjoys ... that 's all that matters to me !
5 #### I purchased this game for sentimental reasons as I had it as a child . A fun game , easily played by everyone in the family .
5 #### What kid ( or my wife ) does n't enjoy Mouse Trap ?
3 #### It 's a fine game , nice quality . The set up is torture for parent 's . do n't buy this game . Do n't do it . Turn off your computer and go to sleep . Just stop it ....
5 #### Purchased for my god daughter and she loves it . The kids love taking turns trying to remove the pieces . I love reliving my childhood .
5 #### My kids love this game . I loved this game as a kid . But as an adult , oh my G ! This game is tedious and can be REALLY LONG . Basically , it sucks . It totally sucks . But it 's a classic . You loved it . Your kids will love it . So you have to get it . If you live in the United States and have a child , you simply have no choice .
4 #### I got this game for my 2.5 year old daughter . She loves playing and it is great at teaching her colors and counting . As she gets older and she understands more we will have even more fun with it . My only complaint is more because the new board is different from when I was a kid but it just seems a bit cluttered to me with all the art over the whole board with very little white space . This is just a personal preference though .
1 #### Ugh ! This game is horrible . You have to rebuild the stupid thing EVERY TIME you play , AS you play .
5 #### I love it as a child as did our son and now our grandsons do too .
4 #### A true classic ! It does n't totally stay together and kids may need help assembling it , but it 's a fun game .
5 #### As I remember when I was a kid , this game is a pain to set up and does anyone actually play the game ? I do n't know but I never have . We just make it trap the mice . I do n't know what it is about this game but it 's fun and never gets old . As expected , my daughter loves it just as much as I did when I was a kid . It 's a must - own . You have n't had a childhood unless you 've played Mouse Trap .
5 #### Got this as a " present " for a friend who is a nurse . They LOVED it and played it as soon as they opened it on Christmas . Brought a lot of laughs .
5 #### My daughter was so happy to receive this original game from her childhood for Christmas .
4 #### Operation is one of those classics all kids should have . I am always looking for games that teach something too . This one is one that definitely works the fine motor skills and hand eye coordination and patience . It also teaches some general anatomy . The new one is stupid . Cell phone parts ! ? ! ? i remember playing this as a child and loved it . It is so nice to see some of the classics coming back in the original forms . I hate what they have done to so many of the classics . My son had to go to occupational therapy and struggled with fine motor skills . This game is good for that . Like with everything else quality just is n't what it used to be but this is close . I also like that this is a game that kids can occupy themselves with for a while . My daughters and I play some kind of game together every day but sometimes it is nice to have one they can do together with out me . My youngest is only 4 and she really struggles trying to get the pieces out lol . But she is determined . A game I think we will enjoy for a long time .
4 #### Love the game . I bought this for my 6 year old girls . As a kid , I remember being excited / nerve wracked trying to avoid the loud obnoxious buzzer , it would almost startle you when it went off . This is partly why the game was so much fun ! But the buzzer is n't the sameit sounds softer and less annoying . I miss the old buzzer !
5 #### Great throwback to my youth ! Works great . We had one part break the first time we used it ( even with adult supervision ) - but Hasbro customer service is fantastic and it is sending an entirely new game . And the kids LOVE it .
1 #### Game was broken and had many missing pieces . Disappointed with this purchase !
5 #### I have fond memories of this game , and it is still a great play for children and families even after all these years . I love that they update it periodically so that the version at Nana 's house is slightly different from mine , making it more interesting for the children to play . The mechanics are simple enough for very young children , and the quality and whimsical theme make it fun for adults when playing as part of a family .
3 #### I wish I could find any of the earlier , less cluttered , better - designed , Candyland boards . In fact , I ordered 2 from Amazon that clearly displayed earlier versions and in both cases the seller sent me the latest one . You ca n't trust the product picture or seller 's description as " collectable " on this site .
5 #### I 'm not going to repeat the reviews of every other commenter and say that this is the first board game that your child should play . Rather , this review is about this particular version of the game . The game pieces are all plastic , not the cardboard with plastic slotted feet that they used to be . It makes them more durable for little hands as they can be rough with them . Plus without taking them off and on the plastic feet , it saves in wear . The cards are a thick , glossy cardstock - easy to clean if they get dirty . They need a rubberband to hold them together when you put them away . I 'm surprised the manufacturer did n't provide something for it as they scatter all over the box if you do n't . The board is slightly more busy than past versions , but if you have a child who likes to study the board , you have given them a few more minutes of entertainment . My son likes to put the people pieces on the pictures and have them fall down the waterfalls and lick the lollipops . Why stifle creativity ? The illustrations are vivid and well done . Yet not so overpowering that they take over the board . The main course to the palace is easy to follow as my 2.5 year old can attest to as he runs the pieces along the path to the castle . This version is my favorite so far and well worth the time to play it .
5 #### This is a very good game to start off with teaching your young children how to play board games . It is a simple and fun game that lets children play even though they ca n't read yet . The movement of your player piece is based on drawing cards and moving to a certain color or symbol , like a gumdrop or ice cream cone . Drawing a color moves you forward but drawing a symbol can make you advance or even go backwards . There are even spots where you lose a turn or shortcuts you can take if you land on the right spot . There really is not much need to do counting like monopoly or reading so this is great fun for young children . It teaches them how to take turns , their colors and how to follow the rules of a game . It is simple and good family fun but if your children love it they will drive you crazy wanting to play it all the time . The fun part of the game is the ability to draw the cards and face whatever it lets you do . The children have just as much chance as anyone and the luck of the draw is the key in this game . They love beating the adults and I think that this is part of the big attraction for children . This is a great game and a lot of family fun together . Turn off the TV and do something as a family , play a game !
3 #### OK , first of all , my son loves this . HOWEVER , I hate the redesign they did . WHy screw up a good thing by making the board busier with useless characters ? I spent FAR too long explaining why some guy was snowboarding incorrectly on an ice cream bar instead of skiing on Popsicle sticks or riding sideways . ( yes , my 4 year old noticed this and pointed it out ) And why , if you are doing a redesign , not make the person who wins get to be king or queen of candyland ? If you are adding plot to a insanely simple toddlers game , make them have to help the citizens along the way . We did have a lot of fun designing our own giant board and drawing and coloring it . Cotton candy forest and the hot fudge swamp were fun additions , as was the dragon on chocolate mountain . Sooooo , your kids will probably be happy , as long as you do not spend too much time griping about how the old one was better .
5 #### Our grown child wanted this game for his children and we were excited to find it ... Know they will enjoy it for Christmas .
5 #### it 's a hit for my 5 y.o . He played it at his friend 's house during a party and we had to buy one , too =)
5 #### Let 's dissect this fool ! This game is a blast ! The kids and I love playing doctor on this pool soul . Try not to touch or you 're out .
4 #### I bought this for my kids for Christmas . I knew I wanted to get the classic version from the beginning , and i 'm glad I did . It is so much better . Tue new version is too easy . The holes are bigger and the pieces are bigger . Not to mention , the pieces are weird items like a cellphone and frog . Also , the new version does n't come with the cards or money the classic one does . I highly suggest if you 're looking into getting the Operation game , that you get the Classic version . My only complaint is that the game itself is very light weight . So when it buzzes , the whole thing moves a bit . I do n't remember it being like that when I was a kid , but maybe it was . All in all , this is a very fun game . We all love to play it . Both of my kids can play , ages 3 & 6 .
3 #### Classic version but a lot less noise than I remember ( not necessary a bad thing ) Pieces are much the same as I remember form 35 years or more ago . But small differences are not necessarily improvements .
5 #### ... it is so much easier than I remember . But , perfect original operation game !
5 #### She loved it ! We gave this game to our eleven year old granddaughter and she could n't wait to start playing it with her eight year old cousin .
5 #### I love candyland and so does my 4yr old daughter . We got this for her for christmas and we are still playing it on a regular basis 4 months later ! Its fun for the whole family !
5 #### My son loves this game and this was fun for family bonding and family game night . We teach him a second language so we have him speak in a different language for the colors .
5 #### This game is great for my 3.5 year old . I totally remember loving this game when I was little and I still love it ! Who does n't love Candyland ? :)
3 #### This game is a classic . I remember playing it when I was kid , so I was excited to share it with my daughter . The game is the same as I remember . My only complaint is the box packaging . The game pieces are thick cardboard with a plastic " footing " . The way the box is designed , you have to remove the plastic fitting from the pieces every time you want to put the game away . The plastic footings are too tall for the box when the pieces are laying down . To fix this , you can throw out the cardboard insert with the instructions and pictures , but it 's just a poor design . Removing the plastic footings each time will wear down the game pieces , OR if you force it , like my 3 year old will do , you damage something else . I 'm overall glad we bought the game . It 's a fun family activity , just wish the box design were better .
5 #### We bought this game for our grandson who is 3 . He does great with the colors . Our son LOVED this game when he was little and now our grandson is enjoying it too .
5 #### Its wrapped and ready to go under the tree . Package looks great and exactly like described .
5 #### My boys love this game . It is our standard birthday gift to other kiddos . It is very interactive .
5 #### This is the classic version so happy amazon had it in stock .
1 #### I do my Christmas shopping early starting in October , so the return window is now closed . My daughter unwrapped this this morning , it 's Christmas today , and we were excited to play it . I took the plastic wrap and unboxed it myself as I would be inserting batteries and was shocked to find the bones were not included ! No wonder it was on sale so cheap ! ! ! ! Amazon , you need to accept a return on this item and you need to inspect the items you represent for quality . Shame on you . I buy gifts for needy children as well and thank god I did not gift this to one of them !
4 #### My kids love this game . They beg me to play it any chance they get . While the adults are n't so fond of it , my daughter is old enough that she can generally play with her brother without too much incident ( unless she cheats again ... The game play is simple enough that we were able to introduce it to my son when he was too , but he needed a lot of assistance . I think the idea of being included was more appealing to him than the game itself . For an average sized family , this is a wonderful game that I remember playing when I was little . This classic game still entertains children today . The only down side ? The game pieces are fairly easy to break and the cards have no way of being contained , so you 'll need to provide your own elastic to bind the cards . Thankfully , when our first game 's pieces broke we simply replaced them with different coins we had around the house and the kids loved that . Eventually we did end up replacing the game .
5 #### I just gave this game to my grand - nephew age 5 and he loved it . He started playing with his grandpa and had a great time . He 's into taking apart , building and making anything so was definitely ready for this game .
3 #### I played this game as I kid and so I bought it for my kid . Played once and wondered " why did I want this ? " It 's not a bad game , just , well , pretty much a one - off or nothing - better - to - do game . My son , who plays his games repeatedly , has n't asked to play this again , and he 's six . The actual parts went together sort of well , but were really touchy , and one part did n't work at all the way it was supposed to . It did n't matter how it was set up or fiddled with : it just did n't work right . Maybe if you make up your own rules or something to add to it , it would be more fun , but really , I kind of wish I had n't bothered to get it . Nostalgia bites sometimes .
5 #### fun toy for the family . great for working with patience and dexterity . children love it
3 #### I loved it when I was a child , but my 5 years old does n't like it too much.he played with it just twice and that 's it . Maybe he is too little for this game .
5 #### This game was recently updated to include stupid things like a cell phone , a green gas cloud coming out the back end and a toilet . Seriously ? I feel like I 'm living in the movie " Idiocracy " where everyone giggles every time reference is made to farts or butts . It took me some time , but I finally found a CLASSIC version sold by amazon . There is still one change from when I was a kid in the 80 's - they 've added an ice cream cone in Sam 's head for " brain freeze . " This version , unlike the " gas " version , still comes with the " operation " cards and money . This is apparently something that was done away with in the newer version . Love the classic game , it works beautifully and I would buy it again .
4 #### I bought this for my daughter , remembering the great times I spent playing this game with my family as a child . The basic premise of the game is exactly the same , however the new game board is very busy ... too colorful and jammed with illustrations , in my opinion . My daughter had a hard time focusing on the trail at first , because of all the illustrations . The original characters are still there , however a few extra have joined the board . I like that the gingerbread game pieces stand up much better than the original design . I think I will buy a classic board , and use the new gingerbread game pieces . For now , my daughter plays it at least twice a week .
2 #### I played this as a child and loved the game . It was so much fun to look at the pictures because they were so tempting ( from the 50 's ) . Sadly the game is cheaply made and the graphics are terrible and extremely ugly . I would pay more for a well made game and would much rather have the vintage graphics than these cheesy looking pictures . Ugly , ugly , ugly !
5 #### I purchased this for my 7 year old niece and she loves it ! ! It was a little difficult to get some of the pieces in the first few times but now everything seems to go in easily ! Still a great game !
5 #### Bought this on a whim , after I was only able to find the junky new version in stores . This is the one we had as kids ! Love I !
3 #### I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter . She got impatient having to wait to build the trap but once we got it all done she had a ball just playing with it as a toy instead of a game .
4 #### Still a cute game with the updates , I do think it 's a little on the cheaper side as far as quality but it 's a board game and not played with constantly so I 'm not too worried about that .
1 #### A week ago this game was $ 20 . Now it 's $ 90 ! ! Taking advantage of Christmas . Guess who is n't buying one . :) Have a great Christmas ! !
5 #### A little frustrating for the children , but they are still quite young . This will become a favorite once they get a bit older !
1 #### Bought for my 5 year old grandson . It 's made much more cheaply than I remember from this game many years ago . It 's very frustrating because parts fall down and the sequence very rarely works . Do n't waste your money .
4 #### One of my favorite games when I was small . Hope it has n't changed much in 55 years . Bought it to drop in a Toys For Tots bin this Christmas .
3 #### The good of the Candyland game is that it 's simple and my daughter has played since she was two . The bad part is that it does n't teach anything other than the very basics of board games . There is absolutely no skill used . Once you shuffle the cards the game is decided . You pick cards one by one and move accordingly . The kids can not learn any real strategy at all . If your child is over 3 or 4 and has the basic understanding of what a game is , then I 'd say skip Candyland . There is little point to a game that is decided at the first card . But for the very young it 's worth having around so they can learn what game boards look like , pieces , cards , and feel the joy of winning ... and losing . But I 'm very glad to see my daughter grow past this game . Very .
4 #### Classic game in a great , durable plastic case that resembles a book . Fits perfectly on a book shelf and travels well without fear of losing game pieces . Say goodbye to broken game lids and losing game pieces .
5 #### Such a classic game ! I 'm glad they are still selling this . I ca n't wait to introduce my kids to it soon .
5 #### My mom still has the mouse trap game from when I was a kid and my son likes to play it at her house so I wanted to get him his own for at home . I saw they have an updated version that looks different but I like the old style better so that 's why I got him this one instead .
4 #### This is a great game , I bought it for my 2 nieces for Christmas and they can not stop playing with it . Everytime I come over to babysit them they bring this game out , it was awesome to play when I was a kid and now I can pass that same excitement on to them .
4 #### A must buy for age appropriate kids ! Could n't go wrong with the lightening deal price
5 #### This is much more difficult than the new ones ! Comes with money and cards which is what makes it so fun !
2 #### Not like the one I had growing up . Meh .
5 #### I had a Candyland board game as a child and I remember loving the game . I have n't played it recently , but I sure can tell you that I played with my younger brother , parents and grandparents EVERY DAY and it never got old .
5 #### Bought this for my niece and nephew ( 5 and 6 ) , they had never played this game . They loved it ! I love the original mouse trap game ; the newer versions are different that the original . All the pieces came with the game and we had a lot of fun making the mouse trap work .
5 #### I love this game . I used to play it all the time when I was younger and I was surprised to find a new version of it . My kids love it and we just put it together and play with the trap instead of playing it like it is supposed to be played .
3 #### This game is a lot of fun ; however ..... it is a pain to set up . My children are 5 and 8 and they can not set it up . It actually takes us ( adults ) a little while to get it right . So , needless to say , if it does not stay set up then it is not played with . Keeping it set up is a difficult task because it gets bumped while they are playing in the bedroom . I gave it a lower rating because , for us , it was a complete waste of money . I actually trashed it last week .
5 #### My so asked for this game , and we have had a blast playing it since it arrived ! Though not new , it was obviously take care of , and had each piece with instructions . Very pleased , and have enjoyed the hours of fun with my family !
4 #### It 's not quite the same as it used to be but still a great game .
1 #### I remember the game when I was a kid . The game is still the same , however , Made In China means cheap construction . The pieces do not fit well on the board . The board is way too small . As you turn the crank the plastic pieces move and pop out of their cardboard slots . The kids just construct the pieces and turn the crank to see the action ... they do n't like to play the game because of the issues with the pieces issue .
5 #### This is a fun game for kids . I grew up playing this , and now my 4 year old loves it . As far as educational value , the children learn colors , sequence , how to take turns , and consequence .
5 #### I got this for my son for Christmas , just before he turned 5 . He loves it ! He wants to play it over and over , and it 's very easy for him to understand . Also , I got this game for less than $ 5 when Amazon had it on sale , so I loved the price as well ! I recommend this game !
5 #### Bought for one of my grandchildren at the request of my daughter . It 's actually her most favorite board game EVER . They 've gotten hours of fun .
5 #### Always wanted this as a kid , never got it . But now I can play it with my kids ! It 's just like the original instead of the lame cheap version they make now .
4 #### https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DMFM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_59 gave as a gift and did n't come with battery
5 #### My grandchildren , ages 5 and 3 , dearly love this game . All they really want to do is set it up and trap the mouse over and over , squealing with delight each time . More than worth the money to see them having so much fun !
5 #### Loved this game as a child , I am now 61 years old , so having a 7 year old granddaughter was the perfect time to share something Grandma once played with . She loves it . And I am so thrilled the new version is not all distorted from the original . Too many old games are resurrected in such a way you can barely recognize them . Good job Hasbro ! ! !
3 #### I bought this for my 8 year old . Took us adults 3 hours to get it together ... and then was n't as fun as I remembered from when I was a kid
5 #### Little dent in the box but the game was just fine ! ! Love playing it . Even beat my boyfriend the first time we played . Both of us have n't played since we were kids ! ! Very happy with my purchase .
5 #### My son wanted the original mousetrap and not the newer junior type version popular in stores . This game is just as I remember it ! All pieces were included and instructions clear for setup . For some reason it 's easiest to assemble it the first time but my 6 year old thinks putting it all together is half the fun !
5 #### This was a childhood favorite of mine and I bought it for my son . He was three the last time we tried to play , and he had a bit of a hard time remembering what order to do things , but I think we could try it again and it would be easier now that he 's a little older . This is a simple game and easy to throw in case your child is getting upset about repeatedly having to go back to the beginning !
5 #### I remember playing this game as a child , and now I 've used it to teach my older autistic son and his younger brother how to play board games . They do n't play it much anymore , but I 'm sure that their mastery of this game paved the way for them to play the games they enjoy now . At a most basic level , this game introduces the young mind to the concept of " games " . " Games " have " rules " and " winners " . This is quite a hurdle to jump for a young child ( especially an autistic child ) , yet it is essetial that they jump it . And , thankfully my kids did ! This attractive game teaches linear progress ( there is one correct direction to go , and there is a goal ) ; thinking ( what to do if you get two colored squares on your card instead of one ) ; the impact of luck ( good and bad fortune happens to eveyone ) ; how to win , and how to lose . All while thinking about ice cream , candy canes , and other yummy treats . And , if you lose , you can always play again ! In fact , I think this game might just be one of the fundamental cornerstones of civilization .
5 #### As a child , I myself grew up with Candyland . Now that I have children of my own , my house would n't be the same without it . We got this game when my son was 3 and my daughter was 2 . Both of the kids understand the concept of the game and enjoy playing it . The best thing about this game is that there 's nothing really complicated . The kids do n't even have to know their colors to play . They just need to match up the color on the card with the color on the board . The game is simple enough that the kids often win which makes the game more enjoyable for them .

2 #### I was expecting much more fun game . My daughters are almost 4 and they get bored after 10 minutes :( It 's so slow going and boring . I would n't recommend this game to anyone .
5 #### It is the old version ! YES ! Last year I bought my son Operation for Christmas from Walmart . I did n't think too much of it at purchase . But when we opened it I noticed it was completely different . The pieces were stupid . Cell Phone , Fart smells , Just gross . There were no cards , no money , no real rhyme or reason of play . I got rid of it in a yard sale for $ 2 . I hate the new versions of old classics . THIS ONE IS IT ! ! This one is what I had in mind ! It is the old face , with the old pieces , it has the cards and the money . Real game play . My 3 year old loves it ! I am happy ! Thank you !
5 #### This is a great old time game for little kids . We loved it and our kids love it . Yes , they tire of it quicker than the new computer games , but over all well worth the price .
3 #### It is ok , very , very hard to get the whole thing to work right ,
5 #### Hours of fun for children playing with adults . Building the mouse trap for younger children needs assistance . Directions could be clearer on how to build the trap .
5 #### This old favorie has n't changed a bit and keeps our family busy and giggling all evening . The children even play it all by themselves !
4 #### Kids love this game , was missing a piece though
4 #### My 7 year old daughter says , " It 's fun and I 'm really good at it so I like to play it a lot . I 'm really good at board games .
4 #### I got this for my godaughter who was 4 at the time and she LOVED it ! She was SO excited to get a game that her Godmother and mother played when they were little girls like her . To sit and watch her recognized the colors and match them up was wonderful to me also !
3 #### There are a few problems with getting all the parts to stand up correctly . I had this game myself years ago . Too bad they have n't improved on the quality .
5 #### Requested , and received the original version , ca n't wait to play it on Family night !
5 #### When my kids got this game at 3 and 4 it was a great first board game and they still enjoy playing over a year later ( ... ) . To make it a little more educational and challenging we made new cards recently with the names of the colors written on them . Both kids are just beginning to read so this has been a fun way to practice recognizing color words . We made cards for some of the special squares as well so the feel of the game stays the same . It 's keeping the game interesting for all of us who get roped into playing .
5 #### We have had this game since our daughter was 2 and she is now 4 and we still play it over and over again ! It is one of her favorite games and I can see it being her favorite for a few more years .
5 #### As I sat to write this review , I wondered within myself if there was anyone who did n't know about this ageless game . I can remember playing it with my children so long ago and now I have purchased it for my grandchildren . Still bright and colorful , one has to smile as you look upon the rainbow gameboard and hold in your hand your little gingerbread men . Oh the joy of being a child . No reading is required to play this game , just matching of colors will do for the fun to begin . Easy instructions for the little ones make for a perfect beginning game . Colorful and exciting this game will give them hours of entertainment with a slice of learning , sharing , winning and losing . All a part of life . The only downside are the cards , which I feel should be made a little more durable . All in all a really fun treat to share with that little one in your life and a memory that will last forever . Shirley Johnson
4 #### This is a great " first board game " for kids , who will probably enjoy it from ages 3 - 5 or so . Extremely simple to play , players take turns drawing cards and moving their pieces to the colored square indicated by the card . Rather predictable , though with a few twists and turns thrown in , it is simple enough to keep the attention of the very young . I award it 5 stars for educational value because it teaches color recognition , taking turns , and fair play ( when these are reinforced by an adult playing along ) .
3 #### Fun game to play but the set up is complicated that my 6 year old wo n't play be himself .
4 #### Fun game . Brightly colored , sturdy pieces for the game , sturdy box to store it in also .
5 #### My 4 and 6 year old love this game ! ! ! ! Great for working on fine motor skills . Helps them learn patience also .
5 #### Old School game . Love it played with my 2 grandsons and they love it too .
5 #### My little boy is going to get a kick out of this game , and I love that my older son will have fun playing with him .
5 #### Kids loved it . I enjoyed playing it when I was a kid and still do .
5 #### We got this game when my daughter was about 3.5 . It took her a very little while to grasp the concept , although I do agree it was hard to make her understand when she was stuck on the spaces where you ca n't move for some time . However , she is almost 5 now and she still asks to play it ALL THE TIME ! I 'm glad it does n't take too much thought to play that way I do n't have to feel like I 'm playing allllll the time . I have to say that it is a very enjoyable game and its even more fun when you get the whole family in on it . I kind of thought that the family game nights that some of the game companies push , on their boxes was silly but , after we gave it a try it became like sitting at the table for dinner ! You just make time to do it ! I will have to agree that they should make the box plastic even if it would make it cost a little more , mine is covered in tape ! Still a wonderful game and a joy to play anytime !
5 #### This game is instrumental in teaching colors to children . Children can do a basic matching : purple square on a card to purple square on the board . Lollipop picture to the Lollipop Forest . This is a game that is replaced every year so that children can enjoy it . I love the independence it allows children after they have learned the basic rules of it . To sit to the side and watch students play and teach one another is a gift in itself . After 1 school year of continuous playing , though , the cards are dog - eared and can get lost . ( No one goes to the Lollipop Forest ! ) The board 's cardboard does n't hold up to a year of holding , folding , and game playing , but it 's a classic design that works .
5 #### I remember playing this game in kindergarten and I always enjoyed it . My husband and I were so excited about having a child to share this game with that we bought it when our son was 5 months old and we have played it a few times to show him what it is even though he 's not old enough to play it . I 'm positive he 'll enjoy it when he 's older .
2 #### I loved the game as a kid . My daughter was given this new version . The board is different - more pop than before ; cartoony characters . I found the new board to be distracting . Otherwise , it 's about the same game I remember .
4 #### Looked like new but the buzzer is iffy , perhaps a blessing .
5 #### We really liked this game when the kid were growing up an now I 'm ordering these for my grand - kids . Very cool ! This is the original version , not the new version and I could n't be happier . My seller was Amazon.com LLC Do n't forget to get 2 AA batteries !
2 #### Probably a really fun game . I had the old version when I was little . But I bought two of these and both of them had pieces break before I could even put it together . Cheaply made .
5 #### love this game as a kid and I love playing this game with my son now
5 #### Awesome game ! This is the same game I remember playing with back in the 80 's ! My kids are really enjoying it , too !
1 #### I ca n't believe I spent money on this POS ... the crank does n't work and the boot has to be swung manually to make it kick the bucket ( I had to bend the pole it 's on to even get it to be close enough to kick it ) . It constantly fell apart each time we tried to add more pieces . I put this away after 1 day of frustration and my son has n't asked to play with it since .
4 #### I love this game , but it 's hard to put together and definitely for older kids . Too hard for young kids .
3 #### had as a kid was disappointed when sharing it with the grandkids , it wasent how I remember it ! !
5 #### I bought is for my 6 year old son because he played it at Camp . We love it . Brings back memories from when I was a child
5 #### My son plays this for hours ! There are some small parts so make sure no littles can reach it , but for my 3 year old it is a great game ! It also is a fun game for my and my husband too !
5 #### Bought to have at my house for grandchildren . It 's already a favorite . Old time classic I remember playing as a child .
5 #### This looks exactly like the original one did years ago . Good quality .
5 #### This is a great game that the whole family can enjoy . This version is almost exactly the same version that I had as a kid back in the 1960s . The only change I noticed is that the mice are a little different . Everything works well and fits together properly . There is no real strategy to Mouse Trap -- it is about 99 % luck of the dice roll . That means that even little kids can play and win ,
3 #### received in good condition a bit shaky to play/ pieces fall apart easy
1 #### Very poorly made . Pieces broke apart badly when trying to set it up . Never got to play it because the pieces did n't fit together n it did n't work because of it .
5 #### We all love this game ! My granddaughters , ages 8 and 4 , are crazy about it . When I first looked at all the " moving pieces " , I had my doubts as to whether or not they would hold up , and more importantly work properly . Well , I was very pleasantly surprised . Works as advertised , and keeps the kids occupied . Lots of fun !
5 #### This was a gift for my 7 year old grandson . He specifically asked for this game and he is very happy with it , now he has a game he can play with his big brother and big sister .
5 #### I got this game for my kids for Christmas . I do n't know that they 've actually played the game , but the have so much fun just setting it up and setting off the trap . Lots of fun for kids who love to build contraptions !
4 #### Flimsy plastic but a decent price . Luv building this thing !
5 #### This is the old version & we love it !
5 #### I bought the Operation game as a gag gift for a friend 's husband who was having surgery , He 'd already gotten all kinds of magazines and books and I thought this might give him a laugh . Plus , he could play it w / the grandkids when they visited ... that 's already happened and it was a big hit .
5 #### Reminds me when I was a little girl . I loved this game .
3 #### Three generations of looking fun , but not easily put together . Haha !
5 #### Bought it for my 8 year old niece . She loves it .
4 #### The game is great once you figure out how it goes together . Kids love it . I would recommend putting it together completely before playing it by the actual rules . It takes some patience and practice to get it all just right so that it all works correctly .
5 #### The kids have enjoyed this game . We still play it !
5 #### I remember this game when I was little and I loved it . I am so glad that my 5 year old gets to play it now :)
5 #### I ordered this game and it is the original one- my kids and me love it ! ! !
5 #### This is more like the version of the old game from many , many years ago which is what we wanted so its great . Materials are the decent quality you 'd expect for a board game ( no issues ) . I strive to provide useful reviews , so it this was helpful to you , please give my review a thumbs up :)
5 #### My niece loved it ! Thank you for having the original Mouse Trap !
5 #### My kids could n't wait for this game to be delivered . Granted ... this game can be a pain in the butt with all you have to do to put it together , but its a fun time ! ! As you play , the players put the game pieces together to build the mousetrap as you go , but sometimes that can be too much for the little ones .... so we sometimes just play once we set everything up and see who gets to the trap first . All in all .... it 's fun !
4 #### This is like the original game I remember playing as a kid . The kids love it , but it can be a bit tricky getting all the pieces to work together exactly right .
5 #### The joys of playing old school board games . My 8 year old daughter loves this game .
5 #### the grandkids love playing this game . the range in age from 5 yrs to 17 yrs .
3 #### Great but they change the sound from the original game
5 #### Just like the classic version I played as a child . My three boys love to play this . The buzzer has a volume control , allowing the user to customize the level of annoyance experienced by players in the same room during gameplay .
1 #### I bought this game as a gift , so I did n't open it and test it beforehand :( Wish I had because it did n't work . It 's used and the battery area is corroded ! Unfortunately it 's past the 30 day window , and I ca n't return it . VERY DISAPPOINTED ! ! ! ! Lesson learned .
4 #### Almost as good as the game I knew as a child . Agree with other reviews that parts of this game appear to be flimsy .
5 #### Just now realized I did n't do my review I bought this for my daughter .... Dude ... Its Operation of course it was fun ! We had HOURS of fun playing it together !
5 #### Do n't know what the other reviews are so upset about . This is an awesome version of a classic ! It does take some ADULT assembly , but kids love it . If you 're playing with small children probably better if an adult assembles the trap from the start . If you follow the simple directions it goes together easily and works every time .
4 #### This is a fun game .... but it takes forever to put together . It 's a lot of work . I had forgotten ( or blocked out ) this fact from when I was a kid . My children enjoyed one game . Then we cleaned up . I 'm sure we will play it again .
5 #### I loved this game as a kid and the 7 year old that I gave it to for Christmas also loved it . He really likes the mouse moving through the plastic pieces . It is a great buy and was convenient to order and have delivered .
5 #### Amazing family game , my 6year old truly enjoys it !
5 #### Put this together for our 3 year old and he loves it . He enjoys just setting up the trap and repeatedly getting the mice .
5 #### bought this for my 1 year old son - of course , we ca n't play with him for years , but the grownups are having some fun - my hand is n't any more steady than when I was a child ! good thing I did n't become a surgeoun !
4 #### Get ready for a few laughs with the kids . Do n't compare it to the stress you suffer over bad HMO 's or the decline of civilization as we know it . This is the stupid - funny game you played as a kid , and it 's about time you had a few guffaws with no redeeming social value ! ! Add an extra star if you believe that laughter is a good aerobic activity !
4 #### This is still lots of fun . However , it needs to be made with a sturdier wire and connections . Also , it sure would be great to be able to order extra parts . Since they are so little , they do get lost . How hard would it be to include an extra set of body pieces ? ( Or at least make it easy to purchase them cheaply somewhere . )
4 #### Its really fun but kind of complicated . Also its too easy to lose a vital part so make sure you do n't let the kids get into it first or play with it unsupervised .
5 #### Simply the most fun game around for 2 - 17 year olds . My son and all of his cousins ask to play this game every time they are over at our house . The little ones need help but they love watching the board come together and especially cranking the wheel to trap the mice . Anything that makes preteens and teenagers put down their phones for over a half an hour is wonderful ! This game gets everyone involved and laughing together which is my favorite .
5 #### Super old school fun for the family , put down those electronic devices make some popcorn and have some fun playing this game for some family bonding .
5 #### It 's not the original but I am certain we will have fun with it .
1 #### We purchased this game for our granddaughter because our kids had it as children and spent hours of giggly fun operating on Sam . We were so very disappointed with the quality of the game . It sure is n't what it used to be . The plastic " organs " and " bones " slip right off the tweezers when you try to remove them during the " surgery " . They could have at least produced some kind of grip edge on them . Also , the tweezers actually throw sparks when they touch the sides of the " operative sites " . Coupled with the loud buzz , our granddaughter perceived the was going to be shocked or hurt . Even though we explained that she would n't be . She said , " I do n't like this game . " The game board itself is also very cheaply constructed . It 's really a shame that they 've ruined a game that was loads of fun in cutting costs by cheap manufacturing . Sadly , this is another product manufactured outside the USA and it 's become junk !
4 #### I played this game as a kid , and this past Christmas we gave it as a gift to my wife 's nephew and niece who are within the appropiate age group . As a bonus , we even got a rebate for the item , since removed the Toys R Us shelves . I have to admit , the contruction is pretty cheap and the pieces could get easily lost by kids if they are not careful to put them back in the box . As a warning , you should not buy this game if there are small kids in the house because of the choking hazzard of the small pieces . Also , you got ta get your own batteries . That said , we had a lot of fun playing this game . Trying to fetch the little pieces with the tweezers ( which I had to sometimes manually bend into a better shape ) required patience and dexterity . You have to coax some of the pieces out of the crevices and some the harder items ( Writer 's Cramp .... Argh ! ) may take a lot of tries . The buzzer is an effective way to suprise you while you are deeply concentrating to fetch out the pieces . We had a lot of laughs ! BTW , older kids and adults played the game too . This could be a good family bonding game .
5 #### I loved playing this game when I was a kid and I am glad I am able to introduce it to my daughter and the kids I work with in therapy . Yes , set up does take some time , but after a while you get the hang of it . I like that this is more than just start and race to the finish . It is a great game for learning and having fun .
5 #### I like this game , I loved it as a kid and I like this one , it 's not a durable as the orginal but it 's just as fun and my child really has fun building the trap and loves setting it off to catch the mice .
3 #### Another game that I find it amazing that is made available in this hi - tech age we live in . As a kid , I thought this game was okay . Purpose is to remove these tiny plastic parts from the operating board . Comes with twelve parts that 's to be ' professionally ' removed with a pair of tweezers . Do n't lose the parts and this game should last awhile . Anyone else remember the TV ad for this game way back when as the girl in pigtails reads off the instructions on the card , " Take out wrenched ankle ... " ? That commercial may have done more damage than Milton Bradley knows . Requires two size AA batteries .
4 #### I do n't personally have this game yet , but I 've played it tons of times . Ok , the buzzer can be a little frustrating , but moving in little cramped spaces with huge tweezers helped teach me really good hand - eye coordination . Here 's a hint : do n't like the buzzer ? Take out the batteries .
1 #### Worst game ever invented for a parent . Setting it up and getting it to actually work is a nightmare . My son and his friends do not care about playing the actual game . Just setting off the trap . The game always ends in arguments and as a result needs a parent referee .
2 #### Just OK . First time I played this with the grandkids they enjoyed building the trap and seeing it all work . But now they just want to get to the part of capturing the mice . And they figured out how to place the mouse under the trap so it wo n't capture completely . So not sure they are really getting the whole idea of the game . Kids are 7 and 9 . Became bored with this pretty quickly .
4 #### We had an older version of this game from when I was younger but we 've lost some pieces over the years . We re - ordered it for the kids and it 's pretty much the same . The board itself has been " updated " with some newer graphics than the original release and the mice look pretty dumb , but the game - play is still the same and so is the trap itself , with the exception of using two heavy marbles now instead of one heavy marble and one larger , plastic ball . I have to say I much prefer the larger ball to sit on top of the ' helping hands ' because half the time the first marble does n't jar the hand enough to send the second marble rolling . And sometimes , even when it does roll off it 's platform , it does n't actually fall through the hole in the bathtub and you have to give it a push . The kids do n't care , but I do n't remember that being a problem in the original set .
3 #### This seemed to lose its allure pretty quickly with the kids .
5 #### After reading reviews I was concerned , but my 9 year old really wanted it for her birthday so we took the chance . It worked perfectly time and time again . It was so much fun playing the game . Set up happens during the game play and kids had no problem with it . After playing it approx 10 times , still sets up easily and still fun watching the little ball go thru the process until the trap falls on the mouse . Classic fun .
5 #### Like a lot of people , I have fond memories of this classic game . Our cousins had it , and we were always excited when we visited them so we could play , but if we did anything to annoy them they would n't bring it out . Oh yes . Good times . So we got the game out of nostalgia and we have enjoyed it . The pieces are all here -- wishbone , breadbasket , wrenched ankle , broken heart -- 12 in all . They are smaller than I remember , but that may or may not reflect reality . It runs on 2 D batteries , and when they run low the buzzer stops working . There 's no on / off switch .
5 #### Got this for my grand kids and they loved it as much as I did when I was a kid . It 's a classic !
4 #### Classic board game . My children love board games and my husband and I enjoy getting them ones we enjoyed ourselves as kids . That 's just what you are getting the same classic game you remember when you were young .
5 #### Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and have n't played this for over 30 years . Still having fun playing this game
3 #### We have all had this game , and the bones get stuck sometimes , but overall its a very addictive and challenging game . I would make sure your smaller kids are supervised when using this as the tweezers are sharp and the game pieces are small .
2 #### The pieces are way too small and way too hard to get out of the spaces without making the buzzer go off . My 6 year old does n't find anything fun at all about this game . The pieces get stuck under the game board and are almost impossible to get out . Save your money for something else .
5 #### The premise here is silly , but slyly educational . Your children will learn dexterity , patience , and a little bit about biology . No , I did n't become a doctor on account of using it , but I did have a lot of fun . The only drawback is the tiny pieces . I think we still have some under the couch some thurty years later ! I fully recommend " Operation . " Anthony Trendl
1 #### Perhaps it was the nostalgia , perhaps the clever packaging . Whatever compelled me to buy this game , I hope you do not fall prey to the same misguided intention . My kids hate the game . They hate the buzzer , and they hate the tiny parts that get lost in the carpet . They hate the premise . There is no educational value in this game other than learning to count money or learning that specialists get paid exorbitant amounts of money , even more than " regular " doctors . Within minutes after we installed the batteries , the red light bulb that serves as a nose no longer worked . I recommend you spend your money and time elsewhere .
5 #### My 9 year old loves this game . A little challenging to put together at first , but after that it is easy .
5 #### This is and always has been a great game . My kids set it up just for the fun . Great family game night .
5 #### This game is way better than the newer version that is out in the stores now ! My 5 year old son loves to play it and we have a blast !
2 #### Bought his for my son for xmas . We were disappointed that the game has changed since I was little . Now you build the board as you play the game . As a result we do n't actually play the game . We set the board up and make up our own game .
4 #### Bought as a gift for sisters aged 7 and 4 , they have had lots of fun already and i m sure will continue to do so . Good value for an old classic game .
4 #### This is mouse trap . It is fun and fairly simple to play , but younger children will need help assembling the trap . I think the origianl I played when I was little was a little more sturdy , and they replaced the big yellow ball with a small metal ball that I think does n't work as well , but then that is kind of part of the game .
5 #### This is the most stressful game I ever played . The whole time I was playing all I could think was please do n't let that buzzer go off . This is also probably the only game that I love that I always lose . I ca n't really explain it but the game is just a classic . Something about that bright red nose just makes you love this game . Not to mention the taunting you can get away with when the buzzer goes off when your opponent is trying to pull out a bone .
5 #### My daughters are a little young for this game , ages 3 and 4 , but they like to play too ! The only bad thing about this game is the fact that those little pieces sometimes fall out of the box when we move from the shelf to the table . So , put them in a little ziploc bag or something ! Enjoy ! !
5 #### My six year old son loves this game . We have a lot of fun playing it together as a family . Just like I remembered it !
3 #### Fun to put together the mouse trap but the game part is kind of confusing . Better to just get a marble run kit , but I was lured by the nostalgia of mousetrap .
5 #### Got this for my nephew . He loved it . He was happy it was n't a " baby game . " His grandmother liked it too , a memory of her younger days . It is sturdy enough to be constructed & reconstructed many times .
5 #### I 'm reintroducing this game to my boys and my niece ( my sister and I used to play this when we were kids . ) We had so much fun setting it up - it brought back so many memories . And we really enjoyed watching our kids see it all work for the first time . They were amazed . And even though they are under the recommended age of 6 - they were able to set it up and make it work on their own after the first few times .
3 #### So , we set this all up and tried to get the whole contraption to do what it 's supposed to do . I do n't know what is going on , but things are not working very well . Some of the parts are not connecting the way they should . Yes , I followed the directions , everything is where it 's supposed to be . When we do get it to work my kids just love watching the man jump into the bucket . That is their favorite part !
3 #### Recipients are trying to play the game and have discovered there is no lamp stand . How can I get the lamp stand if it was not included ?
5 #### I have read some reviews that say this game does n't work properly- I am not sure what 's going on with theirs , but my son(8 years old)can put this together perfectly and it traps the mouse 99 % of the time . The goal of this game is not to put it all together at first , but to do so as you move throughout the game one piece here and there . I have had ZERO broken or flimsy pieces . We have taken it apart and put together multiple times with ZERO issues . The thing works like a well oiled machine . This game was for my 8 year old . When we received it , it took me to my childhood . Worked like a charm as I remembered it- Great game .
5 #### I loved this game when I was 8 and being a adult in my 30 's it is still fun ! must for the kids
5 #### Love this . I bought my daughter ( 8) this for Chanukah and I played this when I was her age . Ca nt believe they still make it . Alot of fun ! ( I 'm 57 ) .
3 #### This game is a lot of fun , but certainly requires adult assistance for younger players . The pieces can be difficult to fit into the board or setup for little hands .
1 #### If your kids are older and are really good at following the directions , maybe this could work . Otherwise you will be struggling to put this together while your kids are freaking out impatient to get started . It ruined our Christmas morning hassling with this game . Very annoying .
1 #### To many rules to much crap to keep track of , not for children at all . Children just give up and walk off .
5 #### Love this game when I was younger and thought I would get it for my daughter for this Christmas . I ordered it super early and it came quick and brand new in package .
5 #### I have an in - home child care and I always encourage board games or card games over video games . Mousetrap has been around for generations and there has to be a reason for that . It 's FUN ! The kids enjoy building the game almost as much as they do running the ball through the " Rubes Goldberg " set up . Lots of fun for the kids . Would recommend .
4 #### This game capturers the spirit of engineering . Rube Goldberg would be proud to own one . ( Rube Goldberg was a cartoonist who devised ways of doing simple things in a long , complicated manner . )
5 #### I have had a wonderful time playing this old fashion version of an old game with my grand kids . I looked everywhere locally for this game and finally gave up and bought it on line . Shipping was great and item came in perfect shape .
5 #### The item arrived on time as described and have used it many times and it is too much fun for kids . The price is cheaper than most department stores . Thanks !
4 #### I loved this game as a child . Turns out my 5 yr old loves it too ! The only complaint : it does n't seem as sturdy as the one I had as a child . Other than that , we love it .
5 #### I played the old Mousetrap with the little mice to move around the game . The only thing that I can see is different now is that they do n't have little mice with tails . Instead , they have mice characters that stand up and look more like people walking . Our kids love it ! ( 9 yr old , two-4yr old girls ) . The 4 year olds are able to put on all the pieces . I always supervise them , however , because I want the game to last and it is very breakable .
3 #### I do n't remember mousetrap being so laborious when I was a kid ! I 'm sure it 's the same game now as it was 20 years ago , but parents be warned : you will be sitting through hours of complicated board setup ( which require reading skills ) . My son loves it , but I have to admit I try to avoid it unless I am absolutely finished with all of my other daily duties and can afford to commit the time it takes to complete the game .
2 #### The game is kinda fun and my son loves it , but it 's so cheaply built and over priced ! The plastic breaks too easily , nothing sits right and the slightest bump knocks everything out of place . If your kids are n't asking for it , get them something else !
2 #### I always enjoyed playing Mousetrap as a kid . The game setup is the same , but the pieces and mechanisms are very flimsy , cheap , and low quality . Parts do not fit on the board very well and the mechanism broke after just a couple of times setting it up . This game is a great example of a company totally sacrificing quality for the bottom line . A once fun game now compromised .
5 #### My daughter loves this game so much that she played with it all the time in lots of different places . We ended up losing several pieces and we needed a new one to keep the fun going !
5 #### I remember playing this when I was little . When we first got it I was n't very interested in the game itself , it was more just fun to set up the traps and set them off . That 's one of the reasons it 's fun for a large age group- even if you do n't care about the game it 's still entertaining . Young children do need supervision as some of the parts require fine motor skills to set up that most young children do n't possess yet .
4 #### I had never played this game as a child , so I have nothing to compare to as far as quality . My children are 6 and 5 and they caught on to this " build a mousetrap " game straightaway . In fact , we had so much fun putting together the mousetrap , that the ending to the game was a bit of a let down . First off ... what do you do with your cheese ? Second , since there is only one Crank space , it 's a luck of the draw when the mousetrap will ever " Go " . In our case , we played the ending for nearly 15 minutes and the crank was only used once . So much for climax at the end . I finally ended the game , because we were all sick of going around in circles with our pieces . I give this game 4 stars , because DO have fun , we like it and it 's educational . The lack of true ending to the game , I take away a star .
5 #### We purchased this game three years ago . Upon opening it , I slumped when I saw all the pieces to it . I was even more dissappointed when the only instructions in our box were in Spanish ! So -- on to the shelf it went and I promised the kids we would play it " another time " . Reading the reviews of what a beating it is to put together , how the game itself is not fun , etc . only helped to deter my motivation in playing it . Three years later on a rainy day , I pulled it out and downloaded the English instructions . My 8 and 10 year old sat at the table with me ... and we played this for over three hours ! ! Can kids that age engineer it themselves ? Probably not the first time -- but with supervision you can teach them how to assemble it , and after a few " Ahhhhs " and " Ooohhhhs " they will have no problem putting it back together . I found it interesting a majority of reviews recommend simply building it . However , we actually found the game ( once it was built ) to be much more fun than building it . After all , the reason you build it is to play the game . Our kids have a plethora of board games ( see my ListMania list ) and they state this is one of their all - time favorites ! Do n't let some of the reviews deter you . If you are willing to spend an hour+ of quality time with your kids , then this game is well - worth it !
4 #### My son loves this toy , BUT he broke a piece of it within the second day of getting it for a gift as he fell on the board and broke one of the plastic pieces . I doubt this one will last long in our house despite it being one of my favorite kid toys from my childhood .
5 #### I rated this game for my 4.5 years old son . He loves this game because he loves to wind the crane to trap the mouse at the last part of the game . Building the whole mouse trap is fine during the whole game not much exciting .
3 #### This game has been fun for our 7 year - old . She has enjoyed building it and playing the game . I 'm dissapointed as a parent with the quality . Toys in general just do n't seem to be made like they used to . The sections slid around once they were attached to the gameboard which made the end of the game pretty dissapointing because the trap would n't always fall . But the kids do like it and it was a fun trip down memory lane for my wife and I.
3 #### We love all types of board games ... but I avoid this one in the game closet at our house . I wish it were easier to get the game started ; and likewise to break it down completely and put it away . I think I 'm either going to " hide " it or re - gift it . haha . The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the kids DO enjoy playing once it is set up . But since they are 4 & 7 , they need a little help putting it together . It has to be set up * just * right or the whole game is off . Not my favorite . :o
5 #### I have always loved this game - from the time I was a kid to now - I love how you make a little machine that captures the mouse at the end . Careful , you may turn your kid into a future engineer !
4 #### Our son asked for this for his 5th birthday . Like some other reviewers have said , the board game itself is nothing spectacular . But , both our son and his 3 year old sister have had a lot of fun putting together the " mousetrap " contraption and making it work . For the most part it has worked much better than I expected for mass - produced cardboard and plastic . Our 5 year old can pretty consistently put it together by himself and make it worth with only minor assistance . The 3 year old needs help putting it together , but gets a big kick out of making it go once together and the little kinks worked out . All in all , I think this is a good purchase for kids this age or a bit older .
1 #### I HATE THIS TOY ! ! ! IT LOOKS SO MUCH FUN BUT HTEN , ONCE YOU BUY IT , IT BREAKS ! ! ! THE TRAPS ARE BROKEN AND THE BOARD GOT SCRATCHED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I HATE THIS TOY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! DO NOT BUY IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
3 #### In this high - tech age , I am truly amazed a game like Mouse Trap is even still made anymore . Do n't get me wrong - for I liked this game very much as a kid - well over thirty years ago . I recently purchased this game and I ( found out ) the hard way that most kids over the age of eight years old - likely would n't have much interest in it . The recommended age is over three . So that would narrow it down to ages 3 to 7 . If you 're an adult with some time on your hands , you could possibly find this -classic- game somewhat entertaining for a short time - while you 're waiting to do something else . Only downside of Mouse Trap is that there are too many required pieces that can ( easily ) end up misplaced or broken . Overall , it 's an okay game .
5 #### I had this game when I was young and it has been around for years now . You could be forgiven for dismissing the game as a silly bit of fun but a large part of the point of this is setting up the game . This requires kids to test their dexterity , physical and mental , as well as consider some early notions of scientifc principles ; logic , physics , probability etc . I think it 's fab for developing young brains while the have lot 's of fun and barely realise you are taxing their grey cells !
5 #### Any kids that I 've played this with have never actually played the game ... they just love putting the contraption together ! There is nothing more rewarding than hearing this excited little laugh - scream when the mouse is captured . I say , skip the game part and build the trap first !
2 #### I give this game two stars because my 5 year old son always pulls it out to want to play with it . The game itself is not worth playing , but the construction part can be fun . However , the game pieces are so poorly and cheaply made that I do n't think it is worth anyone 's time to play with it . Not only do the parts NOT fit , but the thin plastic pieces bend and break very easily . My husband got this game because he played with it as a kid , but this particular set does NOT offer the same kind of fun as the old set .
5 #### This is a great game for kids and one that older people can appreciate as well . Some people do n't like this game because it takes a while to set up , but to me that is the whole fun of the game . When I was younger I use to set it up and just set off the trap to watch it . The game play is just your run of the mill roll the dice and move but the trap makes this one not to miss .
5 #### A Favorite Game ! Fun for everyone - really better than balderdash ( It is often compared to that game )
5 #### This game is amazing . If you have played and liked Balderdash , you should try this . Either way , it 's a game that adapts well to different groups of people with different tastes and strengths . Almost nobody has heard of it who has n't been introduced to it by me , and I get frequent requests to bring it to parties , board game nights , and such because it 's so accessible and often hilarious . If it 's in stock , grab it , as this game can be hard to find !
5 #### Our Mensa game night group played this once ... and then could n't put it down . Very funny quotes , and it will trip you up - in one quote , it will be a very normal ending ; the next one will be weird . So players ca n't get comfortable thinking " oh , I will always just pick the odd one " - as the answers are not consistent . People were crying with laughter , and it just got better as it went on , as we would refer back to previous answers . GREAT game . LOTS of cards - and I do n't think anyone had to " pass " on any card , as each one had at least one quote players could work with .
5 #### Bought this game years ago ( 2001 ) and we still play it ! It is so fun to play . A partial phrase is given ( there is an old Hebrew saying : A man and a cart ... ) then you have to write what you think other people will vote as being the correct answer . Kinda like Balderdash but more easier and more fun . Kids love it , adults love it , party people love it . It was voted as the best new game back then . You ca n't go wrong with this game . This is one game that I will never get rid of .
5 #### Great group game ! Our family ( adults mostly ) played it multiple times , although we never used the actual game board , which is mainly for scoring -- we just kept track of our own points . Not using the game board meant more than the allotted number could play easily , and after a while , sometimes we forgot to keep score because it was so much fun . Even our non - game - players ( every family has one ! ) played and enjoyed it . We paired up children ages 5 to 9 with adult partners and that worked well . I do n't think they could have played in a big group as independent players ; a little too much synthesis of information required . But they enjoyed being part of it . " What good is wisdom .... when the butter does n't stick to the bread . " Now who would guess that answer ? Only one of the fifteen people in our group ! I gave it fewer stars for educational value because that 's not really the point of it . But it 's great group fun . If you have ever played the Dictionary game , this is similar , but a little more humorous .
5 #### The first time we played this game , 6 people ( grown adults ) were in tears laughing at the absurdity of some of our responses ! We continued in this gasping for air style of play for about 3 more rounds before we calmed down enough to get into more of the subtleties of the game . It is at times hilarious , thought provoking and insightful of those you play with . How funny or insightful depends on the players ' effort , but if you are truly trying to win , you 'll be surprised how many people you can fool with bogus phrase endings . I highly recommend this game !
5 #### Wise & Otherwise is a better version of Balderdash , but with proverbs , rather than words . One player reads out the first half of a quote , and the others write their guesses at the second half . The result is a sort of bluffing game in which people guess which is the real quote . Of course , among all this racuous fun ( and it can get wild ) , real education seeps in , since , of course , the sayings speak about the cultures from which they originate , as well as passing some wisdom , as sayings are wo n't to .
5 #### Bought this for my cat - obsessed 6 - year old . We 've played it ten times a day for a month now . It was easy to learn . The 3 - year old plays with us-- she does n't know all the numbers , but recognizes that the rat cards are " bad " and knows which cat pictures mark the best cards . This seems ot be helping her recognize numbers , and the 6 - year old practices math adding up all her cards in the end and figuring out who has the least . The illustrations are really cute . Great purchase .
5 #### Fun game , took a bit to figure out exactly how to play ( thank you youtube ) great for learning the value , greater / lesser numbers and adding .
5 #### Fun , easy game to play with little kids that want to be able to play a card game like the big kids . Big kids have fun with it too !
5 #### My 7 year old triplets caught on right away and loved this game from the start . They 've asked to play several times in the 24 hours that we 've owned it . I see this being a frequent game in our house ! Great for adults and kids .
5 #### My 8 year old and 4 year old both play and LOVE it . My 8 year old is obviously better at it , but we all play together quite a bit .
4 #### I enjoy this game as much as my almost 6 - year old does . So it 's fun for both adults and kids However why would anyone put guns in a children 's game ? ? ? The number 2 card has a cat firing two guns simultaneously .
5 #### Great gift for my nieces -- they will love it .
5 #### Our 6 1/2 year old granddaughter pulls this game out of the game closet every time we visit . So easy and fun to play with our own modified rules . It 's even teaching her how to strategize .
5 #### Gamewright we love you ! Your games are always well designed , clean and fun . Rat - a - Tat - Cat is no exception . Definitely a great gift for kids . Recommend highly !
5 #### This is a favorite of the grandkids . It requires a good memory or sometimes just the luck of the draw , but it is really fun .
5 #### Fantastic game . If you like Sleeping Queens ( and you SHOULD ) , then this is the next thing to get . Easy to play , and it can go very quick .
4 #### Good game : it involves memory , risk , and strategy . It is also relatively fast paced . You can change the rules too in an attempt to make it more interesting , like trying to accumulate the most points , instead of the least . My kids are a fan .
5 #### Gamewright games are the best . Got this to play with my grandchildren who are 6 and 10 . We had lots of fun . I had bought this game for kids at a day care years ago and they liked it too .
5 #### Super easy , quick and fun card game ! Card games are great in our family games because they take up less space and are easy to set up and play . So far my kids 8 and 11 are loving this one .
5 #### Super fun game ! I love the memory challenge and uniqueness ,
5 #### Fun game that the whole family enjoys ! It took my six year old daughter a little while to catch on , but once she did , she really enjoyed playing . We have a lot of fun as a family .
5 #### fun numbers game . good for young kids understand of number relations
5 #### My 6 yo loves this game . And it is great practice on counting when we add up the cards at the end .
5 #### This is our favorite game - OUR meaning both my husband and I AND my 6 year old . It 's fun and easy to play but also has the perfect mix of strategy . It introduces math skills ( adding numbers from 0 - 9 ) , has a memory and concentration element , involves basic strategy , but does not require so much skill that my 6 year old gets frustrated or bored . Great for kids and does n't annoy the adults . Awesome family game .
5 #### One of our favorite card games for many years . The special edition version has secret glasses / codes ... a fun twist .
5 #### perfect game in a box . really .. it is amazing
4 #### My kids ( 6 and 9 ) love this game and play it all the time !
5 #### The kids love this game and it is great fun for everyone at the table .
5 #### one of my 7 - year - old 's favorite games ... he loves it because it is fast paced , fun , and he can legitimately win it . We love it because he practices his addition ( his job is to count EVERYBODY 's score ) and he has to memorize things and focus and yet it does n't feel like a chore . It is an added bonus that each game is quick ( usually under 5 mins ) , does n't take lot of space which means we often take it to doc offices , restaurants , and any place we know will have some wait times that we do not want to fill with electronics .
5 #### Purchased this game for my granddaughters , ages 5 and 8 . Fun game and they really enjoyed playing .
5 #### Great game . My 5 and 7 year old can both play and enjoy it . It 's short , and fun for all ages .
5 #### Gamewright games are always fun . This is a card game that even the youngest kids can play with a little help once they have a little number sense .
3 #### Have no idea how to play this game - the directions do n't make sense to us .
5 #### Rat - A - Tat - Cat is so much fun . My five year old grandson just ca n't get enough Rat - A - Tat - Cat time , and his laughter is contagious !
5 #### A favorite family game ... loved by the kids and the parents . Great memory game !
5 #### We absolutely love this game ! ! ! Our 5 year old daughter loves it and unlike some games for kids , we all really enjoy playing it as a family ! Some memory , some adding and lots of fun !
5 #### We all love this game . I have 2 boys , 7 yrs & 12 yrs . They both love it . Especially my 7 yr old :) I enjoy playing it with him :) There is a way to modify it for younger children ( like my nephew who is 5 yrs ) . Took us a good 10 minutes to figure it out , but after that it was just plain FUN :)
5 #### Best game for my daughters after sequence and drop it . Helps them in memorizing and strategic thinking
5 #### My husband and my 10 year old son love to play this game . I do n't like it because you have to remember numbers and what was already played and I ca n't . Obviously I gave the stars based on my son 's opinion , he is who we bought the game for .
5 #### great game I am happy to play with my 5 year old and 9 year old . challenging and fun . it holds everyone 's attention .
4 #### We are fans of this card game ! It has some math to aid in mental math ability .
3 #### I bought this thinking that it would help my developmentally delayed granddaughter with some basic skills as the game had won different awards . We played it with her sister and grandmother . While everyone was able to perform the functions , no one found it particularly fun or interesting . I had also ordered Sleeping Queens not expecting much from it and we found it fun helpful for memory function and strategy .
5 #### It is a game where you need to try to remember which numbers you have . My 7 yr old daughter loves it and so do her parents !
5 #### Simple to learn , easy and fun to play , even with mixed ages . The illustrations are fun , too ! Basically it 's a memory game . Each player gets four cards facedown . They get to look at two of their cards , but do n't know what the other two are . Most of the cards are numbered 0 - 9 , but there are a few special cards that let you peek , trade a card , or pick two . Each turn you either take from the draw pile or from the discard pile . You MUST trade that card with one of your existing cards , discarding it for the next person to consider . The goal is to get the lowest score . When you think you have the lowest , at the END of your turn you knock on he table and say " Rat - A - Tat - Cat " . Everyone turns over their cards and the lowest score wins . The biggest challenge is that when playing with children , they do n't immediately understand that " trade a card " does n't allow you to peek at EITHER card . This game does n't take a long time to play , and you can always stop the game by calling out " Ray - A - Tat - Cat "
5 #### Fun game for the whole family ! We play it with our 6 and 9 year olds .
5 #### This was the perfect sixth birthday gift for my game - loving daughter . It is easy to play a round or two knowing it wo n't be a huge time commitment . The game is simple but fun , and adults do n't have an advantage : our six - year - old usually wins . It 's also not nerve - racking and boring for adults to play like some games (: : cough::Candyland : :) . There are also easy ways to alter this game to change it up a bit . You can play for a high score instead of a low score ( we call it " rats " instead of " cats " ) . You can add an extra hidden card to the middle of each person 's hand . What 's more , the pictures on the cards are super cute and funny . This may be the perfect game .
5 #### One of my favorite games . I like that we can play it as a family . There are not many games that put kids and adults on a level playing field , but this is one . My 7 year old enjoys it and I have a sharp 4 1/2 year old who is starting to get the concept as well .
5 #### We have worn this game out ! We leave it in the car so we can have it at restaurants , doctor offices and anywhere we have a wait time . Excellent product , easy to learn , and good for teaching probabilities and risk .
5 #### My grandkids love it . Not challenging for older kids though .
5 #### Great game . Kids love it . Cute pictures on the cards . Would buy it again .
5 #### This is a favorite game of a very competetive grandson and his grandma . We are killers when we play and he asks to play it every time he comes over . He 's still figuring out the strategies to win and I 'm working on keeping the 4 blind cards in my memory to beat the socks off him . Truth be told , he now owns most of my socks ! We love this game .
5 #### Fun game . teaches some interesting concepts of probability and chance .
5 #### Great game ! Our whole family has been playing this game ! It forces kiddos to use problem solving to come up with the lowest score . They have to use their memory to remember what they have and the other players have . They also need to keep score and tally the total of their cards . This would be great for students k-3 as a classroom center , or for homeschoolers . We have only had this game a few months and already the cards are starting to show how much we love this game !
5 #### My whole family loves this game ! Especially my 7yr old !
5 #### Outstanding game . It is one the entire family enjoys playing with younger members of the family . Builds on concentration skills . Even our preschool grandson along with his kindergarten brother and 1st grade cousin beg to play this card game ... yet adults love to play along ... challenging enough for everyone !
5 #### This is a great game ! I play it with a 7 and 10 year old . We laugh and have a lot of fun playing . It really works on skill and memory , but they just think they are having fun ! Perfect game for home , or even camping !
5 #### We really like this game . Our whole family can play ( including children starting at 4 ) . It 's fun for all of us , which can be a challenge to find . We 've even given this as a gift to friends who like to play family games with young children .
5 #### We have several Gamewright card sets . This is a favorite . Good for ages 5 and up .
5 #### Fun game to play especially with in the mood to compete .
4 #### Got this game for my 6 - year - old . I think it will be fun in another year or so . The rules are kind of hard to explain .
5 #### We are a game - obsessed family and this game does not disappoint ! So often our 6 year old feels left out when the grown ups play games but this is a great game that she can play ( and win ! ! ) right along with us . This game is a new family favorite !
5 #### This was my 5 year old nephews favorite game for quite some time . He caught onto the strategy of the game quickly , and got a huge kick of sticking me with the , " fat cats " as he called them . The game has some similarities to the card game concentration in that you need to try to remember a series of cards that are placed face down . It also has a gin rummy aspect in that you want to try to get a hand that beats your opponent(s ) hand . It also has a couple of cute , " special " cards that allows you to , " take a peek " at one of your opponents cards , or " switch " one of your cards with one of your opponents . In the end , it 's a game that 's easy enough for a young child to learn , but amusing and strategic enough to keep an adult interested .
5 #### This is actually one game I like to play with my kids . They love it . Lots of fun . Funny pictures .
4 #### It 's a fun game . You could play the exact same game with a standard deck of cards , but the little pictures make this one kind of cute and fun for kids .
3 #### So so but purchased as daughter going through a cat phase . Game won awards but playing it is simply okay . We are a big board game family and are perhaps a bit jaded . Packaged neatly though .
5 #### Best card game ever . You can play with your small children and not get bored .
5 #### Great game , bought for family and have also bought as gifts . Great colors on the high quality cards . Fun game !
4 #### This was a gift and came recommended by a friend who bought it for her 5 and 8 yr olds .
5 #### A birthday gift for eight year old grandson . Now his favorite game .
5 #### My kids love this game and ask to play it a lot . Easy to play and does n't take forever . Win - win . Kids are aged 5 - 8 .
5 #### Really fun game for the family . My 8 year old girl loves it . I think it is probably best for 7 + age kids and adults .
5 #### Our daughter loves this . She can be rough with toys , but she 's had this since Christmas and it 's still holding up well .
5 #### My grandson loved receiving this and had fun with it ! .
4 #### Second one of these - the kids love them
5 #### This is totally fun game to play with kids . They have easier way to play for easier kids . Kids had lots of fun playing !
5 #### Fun family game . This is especially fun for younger children to join in the action . Since each player has 2 cards visible , it becomes an easy game to help young ones learn how to play their own hand because you can see part of their hand and make suggestions , yet it 's still their own hand of cards and they do n't have to team up with an adult . Fun for all ages ! Easy to learn , good playing time ( not too long or to short )
5 #### I do n't know why my daughter likes this thing but she does , and plays with it often .
5 #### Got this for my Daughter for Christmas as she 'd been wanting one for a long time . Not sure who has played with it more ... her or me !
3 #### I always wanted a hoberman sphere . Fun to throw around and open and close when bored . Unfortunately , I must have opened / closed it too much and loosened all of the joints . When I open it now , its egg shaped instead of spherical due to sagging . Spend the extra $ 15 and get the big one .
5 #### My six year old son wanted one of these for a while now . I ordered this one for him for Christmas and he loves it . I like the smaller size , but now he says he wants the big one that he has always wanted . I opted for the small and am glad I did because I personally think this is plenty big for him to toss around and play with in our house .
5 #### I got this for my son but all my kids try to steal it .
5 #### My 10 year old has wanted one of these . The colors were great , seems sturdy ( just got it )
5 #### This game is a ton of fun for adults and kids . Perfect balance of strategy and chance . Individual hands take only minutes , but keep a running score to make it take as long as you want . I would highly suggest that you try playing with the simpler rules where you have 2 of your 4 cards exposed . Why ? Well it easier for the kids and , ahem , the adults to remember their 4 cards as they eventually see them . Even better is that since the hand can be ended at any time , seeing 2 of someones cards gives you the strategy of trying to really stick it to someone if they have two 9s and are in the lead ( you want a low score ) even if your own score is n't super - low . Also , we allow the swap card to have no rules : any of your cards for any of theirs and it 's fun handing someone a 9 for their 0 or a card you have n't even gotten to see yet for a 2 only to see you gave your opponent a zero later . Cards are cute and seem well made after moderate use . This game would be fun for adults too if you like playing rummy , hearts , pitch which it feels somewhat similar to .
5 #### My kids love this , and we adults do n't mind playing with them !
5 #### This is the current favorite game of my kindergartener , and a great family card game . Enough strategy involved to keep everyone interested , and enough luck involved that the younger kids can win sometimes . It 's fun watching the five year old get better and better at the strategy and starting to understand probability . Good for memory and early math , but lots of fun . This was a great purchase .
5 #### Awesome game ! We are BIG card / board game players , and with a 7 year old it can be hard to find games entertaining for adults that she can understand . Gamewright has mastered it ! Highly recommend .
5 #### We taught our 5 yr old daughter the game " 31 " right before buying this game . It just so happens that this is backwards " 31 " but with blind cards in your hand and power cards to let you peek , swap , or draw 2 . Too complicated ? Not at all ! It just brings the game to a whole new level with strategy and memory . I 'm pretty addicted to it myself ! Could use it at an grown - up party with chips or money thrown in the pot when you lose a hand , just for a twist on the normal euchre or poker party .
5 #### An easy and fun game ! It teaches some easy addition and simple strategy that my 7 year olds were comfortable with . Fun for the whole family !
2 #### Got this based on the reviews and how much we enjoyed Sleeping Queens ( for a game the whole family can play ) . We did n't enjoy this one nearly as much . It is n't a bad game , but when placed next to other games in our game closet this one would n't get chosen .
5 #### I played this as a child and teenager 20 yrs ago . I watched all my younger four siblings play it and love it . I now had a 4 yr old girl that LOVES it ! ! ! I bought it when she was three and I was sick of candy land . She picked up on her numbers very quickly when I told her she could play if she remembered her numbers . She understands the small amount of strategy . I played the younger child rules where they can leave the outer two cards face up about four times . During those times my husband and I played the older child rules . She quickly caught in and wants to play like us . I have been using this game for homeschool preschool math . She understand higher and lower numbers with no problem now , and it was a very fun way to teach it . We own hundreds of games at our house and this is one of my favorite two games for her age group . I would recommend for any family . While it is simple to understand for an adult , most adults are willing to play many rounds with my child . Each round takes less than five . Minutes and the game can end after just one round .
5 #### Wow this game is genius . played with a 70 , 40 , 38 , and 6 year old and it was insanely fun . we all laughed so much .
5 #### Every kid should have this game ! So fun ! For all ages !
5 #### wonderful game~~in family games .... it is very fun and easy
5 #### We absolutely love this game , as a family . We play it in 2 , 3 , 4 and it 's always fun . Strongly recommend it for families with young kids ( elementary & middle school ) . Easy to carry when travelling too .
5 #### This toy is one of the favorites at our house
2 #### my son loved this although it broke within the first ten minutes and he was not even being rough with it
5 #### To be honest , I saw Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) have one of these on his desk in the show ' The Office ' so I purchased it . It is surprisingly awesome for everyone walking by !
3 #### This is a " no peek " game in which you try to lower the point value of your hand . You originally get to look at two of your cards . There are also some " power " card additions so you can " peek " , " swap " or " draw two " You end the game when you " think " you have the lowest hand and then points are counted . I played with grandchildren . The six year old played two hands and then was disinterested . The ten and twelve year olds only played the first hand . They said they like Uno better .
3 #### My granddaughter has n't played with it as much as she thought she would when she requested it at Christmas .
5 #### great game . introduced by my son and his wife . my granddaughter loves it . she just turned 10 -- would play it over and over again .
4 #### Slightly limited , but a favorite with 6 and 9 year old boys . We started with all cards face up and playing for the same goal as in the directions . Eventually , have made the game more and more difficult as we continue to play ... the game directions way to play are pretty simplistic . There are ways to adapt this to make it even more challenging so I look forward to the family growing into this and using with math for high numeric values ( which is not in the directions , but possible ) . Funny cards ... good stuff here .
5 #### I bought this for my 5 year old for Christmas . I love that both luck and strategy play a part in winning the game . The graphics are so much fun , and they help my son understand how the game works . I love how the instructions include different ways to play , especially ways to play if your playing with a younger player . Even though it might be a rough start learning how to play , once you 've played a dozen times , the game becomes addicting .
5 #### We have so much fun with this toy ! Great quality .
5 #### Fun toy , held up nicely even after being thrown all over by 2 small kids .
3 #### Not a bad little toy , but there are others for less money out there , for sure . This one has some pieces that broke after just a week of playing with it . Although I know the kids can be a little rough on things , I expected it to last a bit longer than it did .
5 #### Son loved it ! now wants a bigger one
1 #### This game takes to much effort to figure out and play . So we have not taken it out again to play it since Christmas . The other games , Dweebies , Sleeping Queens , and ARGH ! are way more fun !
5 #### Our family has had so much fun playing this game , I 'm so glad we bought it . My three year old understands it and has fun playing and aunts and uncles also have a great time when we play all together .
5 #### My six - year - old loves this card game , and so do I. She asked to play it again and again , and I look forward to it . She is learning math , strategy , and a host of other great skills . Great things come in small packages . I will be giving this as a gift to other kids !
4 #### My 7 year old and I really enjoy this game . It 's a little harder for my 5 year old to grasp so he does n't show much interest yet , but all in all its a fun game .
5 #### We bought this to play with our 3 1/2 year old granddaughter , we all love it . She was able to grasp the concept quickly and she loves it so much we are wearing out the cards ! The cards are good quality but any cards will wear out given enough play . We will be buying a second set so she can have one at home .
4 #### It takes my 4 year old some time to learn this , but my 6 year old got it fast and loves it . a very cool game to play with our boys , that 's also addicting . we love it .
5 #### got here quickly and product was as expected ! ! ! ty ! ! !
5 #### I purchased 2 of these for my grandchildren , ages 7 , 18 months and 6 months . ( I have n't given the 6 month old his yet . I am holding on to it a while longer . ) . They love them . It is great fun . I also bought the larger size .
5 #### Very pleased with this product . It 's a great passtime for kids .
5 #### Interactive toy perfect for hand manipulation and boredom buster .
5 #### Whole family is playing and loving . And the 4 year old twins can play with very little help . Whoo hoo ! Highly recommend . Like " sleeping queens " which is a sure fire hit as well .
5 #### This is a great game ! We are currently on our 2d set . The first one lasted us for 6 years and we just had to get another one to replace the worn out cards ;) this is the game for anyone from 5 years old to 99 !
5 #### I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 5 ( almost 6 ) year old , and it was an instant hit . We played the first few hands facing up until we got the hang of the game , and became familiar with the cards then we turned the cards face - down for normal game play . The game concept is easy - score the lowest amount of points to win the game . You have to rely on memory to keep track of the cards you have , but it 's also a matter of luck in the cards you get in the game . We 've loved all of the games we 've gotten from Gamewright ( Slamwich , Hisss , Feed The Kitty ) , they have a great assortment of games for a variety of ages .
5 #### When my son ( now 24 years old ) was a kid we played this a lot . Today I asked him if he remembered it as he now has a wife ( who loves to play games ) and a 3 year old DAUGHTER . Who knows where the old game went so I 'm buying another for him . and of course Chutes and Ladders & Candyland ( I 'm a 50 's child )
5 #### My five year old son has recently gotten in to games . His father and I are both big on table top games and he inherited it . He 's great at games like chess , Forbidden Island , mancala and even DnD. This is n't his most challenging game , but it 's fast - paced , energetic and supports good math skills . Recommended for EVERY family .
5 #### I 'm not sure why we love this game , but we absolutely do . I have one child who plans everything , one who never takes a chance , a husband who is a stickler for detail and myself , a " play by the seat of my pants " gal - and we all enjoy this game !
4 #### This is a fun and bright toy . I does n't open and close as smoothly as the bigger , better made ( more expensive ) model , but we are still happy with it .
5 #### It 's been fun with my 5 year old . The characters on the cards are fun and the cards themselves are terrific quality , similar to Bicycle cards . The instructions are clear and thorough .
5 #### Purchased this three years ago for a 5 and 6 year old . They are now 8 and 9 and still love this game . The age range should be 5 - adult since it 's just a fun for adults . This game requires only a few elements : strategy , luck , bluffing , and math . Each round can take from 1 - 5 minutes and people of every age are matched pretty evenly . The kids win as often as the adults - which is a good thing - without the parents having to " let " the kids win . This is the game the kids keep in rotation all the time while other games have gone to the back of the game drawer and game closet . Daughter has taken this to school a few times and everyone loved it . When the kids want to play a game with me , I often suggest this one .
5 #### Child has been wanting one of these - loves it ! Great gift from Santa ! Made well .
2 #### It broke when we used it just a few times . The links inbetween are flimsy that they break easily . And now it does not open up .
5 #### It is what it is which is what I wanted . Cheaper than elsewhere so why not ? Hope this finds you well !
5 #### I bought this for my grandchildren and it was an immediate hit . Yes , I chose right and they are delighted !
5 #### this is the funnist game we play it for hours and have a hard time putting it a way yes
4 #### My 9 and 5 year old like this game , and so do I. I want to play it more than them I think . Fun family time and keeps everyone entertained . I was so tired of playing Candy Land . Great idea ! !
1 #### the one I got was not the same color as shown in the photo , it was significantly different .
3 #### This game was great until my daughter figured out how to see the numbers on the cards without using the filter which spoiled all the fun of the game .
4 #### My 3 year old loves cats , so this card game was even good for him to learn numbers . My six year old loves math , so it is a fun game that really makes him think . Oh .... good for helping the adult mind with memory skills also .
5 #### I bought this game after reading so many 5 star reviews on it , and I am happy to say the game lived up to the reviews ! ! My family loves it ! I have a 4 year old and a six year old and they really enjoy it . The rules are very simple to learn , but it is a test of memory to play ! It is a game I really enjoy playing with my kids . I highly recommend this game !
5 #### used this as a " breathing ball " for a calm down classroom activity . Not sure how it will hold up over time , but the fact it has so many moving parts also made it a good lesson on why we need to be gentle with it
5 #### My son enjoys it . Plays with it often . I personally think it 's over priced but it was his money to spend .
5 #### This must be my 6 year old son 's favorite game right now . He seems to love it and it 's often what he wants to do when you ask him what he wants to play . Mostly we play with 2 players , and it works well ... but you can play with up to 6 players . It 's a good memory building game too , as you have to remember what cards you have an in what positions . You also benefit by remembering your opponents ' cards as well . So this game is good for adults like me whose memory could be better . Overall 5 stars for it 's fun , strategy , and learning ( memory & math mostly ) .
5 #### This game is great . I was a little concerned when I started explaining it to my 5 year old daughter but much to my surprise she caught on very quickly and loves it . I enjoy playing as well . I always like a game I can play with my young children that I really enjoy too . She has to pay attention and remember what cards she has so she really focuses on the game when we are playing . I think that is my favorite part . She is learing to really focus plus she 's working with simple adding of numbers . This was a great choice to purchase . I may pick up a few extra packs as gifts . Not a bad gift at all for $ 10 . Really ca n't beat it .
5 #### My husband and I love this game just as much as our 6 - year - old . Educational , fun , and lots of fun for our entire family ! A++ from all of us !
4 #### I bought this to use for therapy for young kids as a tool for taking deep breaths . It is great for that , but it is not strong construction so I would be worried that if someone pulls too hard it would break easily
5 #### Very happy with item and quick delivery . Thought it would have been larger .
5 #### We 've gotten so much use out of this card game . Have had it for at least 2 years now and it travels with us to restaurants and on vacations . Kids are 9 and 7 and we are still having fun with it .
4 #### This mini sphere was really enjoyed by my 8 yr . old granddaughter until it broke . She was so disappointed . I contacted Amazon and they immediately sent me out a new one . Now my granddaughter is happy again and plays with it every day . She 's also been asking for these in different colors ! That 's how much she loves it .
2 #### really cool , but fasteners start to loosen and do n't pop back on and stay .
1 #### Clearly I got a cheaper knock off direct from China . Although I ordered the sphere with classic colors ( red , lime , yellow , purple ) , the color of the one that arrived is more neon . The plastic is super flimsy . It arrived broken , which is no surprise since it was not in box . The black poly plastic bag that it was shipping in was also damaged , then taped up . What a disappointment !
3 #### We are a pretty avid game playing family and were excited to try this game . The description sounded right up our alley , but in reality , the game is pretty boring with only 4 people . Our boys ( 8 and 6 ) seem to enjoy it much more than my husband and I ; it seems to drag on for a bit . I will say that we pulled it out when we had some friends over and playing with 7 made it much more difficult to achieve a low score , remember where cards were , etc . and thus provided a much better playing experience .
5 #### We have played this game weekly for months . Even the adults enjoy it . Uses math skills in a fun way .
5 #### I gave this as a birthday gift to an 11 year old . He loves it . Within the first few minutes he was catching everyone around him in it . He wants more that glow in the dark so he can make his own moving solar system . I thought it was a good idea so we will see
2 #### This came in a plastic bag wrapped in bubble wrap . It was partly squished and looks like it wo n't last very long . The plastic is flimsy looking . Not nearly as substantial feeling as the glow in the dark one I previously purchased .
5 #### This fun family game boasts a lot of eductional value . Players have four face - down cards in front of them . They are initially allowed to peak at two and may or may not be able to take others . Players take turns drawing cards from a draw pile or discard pile and can use their draw to replace one of their four face - down cards to create the hand with the lowest points . Each card ranges in value from 0 ( the top cat ) to 9 ( the dirtiest rat ) . When a player believes they have the lowest point value , they call out rat - a - tat - cat and the other players each get one more turn each before the reveal . The game requires memory , strategy , and some simple math . A good time for the whole family !
5 #### This is one of my 4 year old granddaughter 's favorite games . She loves that you yell " Ratta - Tat - Cat ' when you think you have a winning hand . It works as well with 2 people as 6 and all ages can play . Once you play this , you 'll probably realize your memory is not as good as you thought .
5 #### This is a fantastic game ! Easy enough for a 6 - year old to keep up and enjoy and fun and interesting enough for adults to want keep playing again and again ! My husband , as a matter of fact , said that he is trying to figure out how to bring this game to his poker night next time and bet on it ! Do n't take me wrong - there is no gambling evolved at all ! This game keeps your interest and memory and luck in check all the time ! And at the end of it your little ones get to add up the pints ! I would recommend this game for everyone , any age !
5 #### Beautiful Ball ! ! ! ! Great quality ! ! ! ! My nephew is so happy with it ! Thank you ! ! ! ! :)
5 #### This game is fun for all ages . Grandmas especially love to play with the boys . It does take some simple skill / planning which is always something I look for in a game . Super cute , can be played fast . Travels well . Our kids are 1st & 5th grade , boys , and they both enjoy it very much .
5 #### This is our favorite family game . Both my girls 8 and 5 love the game , as well as my wife and I. Even the 5 year old picked up the game fairly quickly , and regularly beats us and her sister without too much bending the rules in her favor . The cards are durable as well .
5 #### I bought this to play with my grandkids at Thanksgiving , ages 7,6,6,5 . Once they learned the rules ( we played the easy version) .. they played for an hour straight . Later in the day , they played for another hour by themselves . I 'm a teacher and I love the thinking challenges in this game ... memorization of card locations , addition , and knowing when to call an end to the game . It 's quick , easy , and fun . Overall , an A+ !
3 #### It 's fun to play with , but the little plastic joint pieces keep popping off . This was after the first use . Kind of frustrating , and as a result , my daughter does n't really want to play with it anymore .
5 #### My son absolutely loves this . I bought it for him for his second birthday to teach him about small and big and he got the concept of big and small very quick . He loves running around the house with it expanding it and saying " big " , and then collapsing it and saying " small " . We play a lot of games with it and I am quite frankly surprised that we have n't broken it yet ! Yes , my 2 year old has had it for almost 6 months and uses it daily and has n't broken it yet ! I am impressed . It 's a great learning toy that is also great for games and physical activity . I would suggest this toy to other parents of small children . My son loves it and I am very happy with this purchase .
5 #### My wife and I , along with our 5.5 year old enjoy this game as a step up from crazy eights and go fish or old maid . This game requires more brain activity , but teaches a lot of skills that are good to have . The cards are of nice quality , and the box that it comes in is nice and sturdy to keep them safe . Do n't hesitate to get this if you have younger kids .
5 #### The first time I played the game with my son , it was just OK . I guess we were learning and did n't quite get it . We picked up the cards again to play a couple weeks later , we liked it a bit better , ... now we 're hooked . My three daughters have joined in as well . The oldest is 16 , the youngest is 4(yes , she 's caught on enough to be able to compete ) . Amazingly , we ALL enjoy playing this game . Not like Candyland , or other kids ' games where adults feel tortured . This game is actually fun for the older kids and adults too ! It 's got a bit of luck involved , which allows all ages the opportunity to win . But it certainly is n't all luck . You need a good memory as well . The game is different than any card game I 've ever played . If you 're not sure , I 'd suggest getting it ... you will enjoy ! Just make sure you play it a couple / few times before you decide if you like it or not . Oh , and one more thing . My 4 year old has learned how to add numbers from playing this game . At the end of the game , you have to add 4 cards together . The numbers range from 0 - 9 . If her total is n't too high ( say under 20 or so ) , she can add them up . I think that deserves another star for Rat a Tat Cat !
3 #### Fun game . Directions could be clearer about a couple of things : 1 ) Can players look at outside cards again or just once ? 2 ) Once " rat a tat cat " is called , how do you score players if they are still holding a power card ? Also , when explaining how to use the " scanner " directions should indicate that the player should place them on the bridge of their nose for best viewing . With kids , the strong impulse is to look at other people 's cards and to try to read the " word " without using the scanner so they understand their own hand better . This could all be spelled out in a more explicit way with kid - friendly guidance . I had fun with my family but had to really reinforce some things that were not spelled out in the directions .
5 #### This was a birthday present for my 4 - year old little girl . Since her birthday ( 3 months ago ) , she has asked to play this game EVERY day , multiple times a day . She loves it ! I have to admit that I really enjoy it too . It says it is for ages 6 and up , but she grasped the concept of the game very quickly and is able to play independently . It has been a fun way to also work on addition . I love it , my little girl loves it and my husband loves it ! What more could we ask for . The packaging is very nice . It is easy for my little girl to put the cards away when we are all done playing . The cards seem to be very durable as well . We play it a lot and we have n't seen any wear or tear . Ca n't recommend this game enough . Now if I could find another game that we could enjoy just as much !
4 #### I bought this last year but my daughter is just really enjoying it now . It took a couple of minutes to figure out but then it is easy . So far we 've only played with the two ( of us ) but I imagine it will be even more fun with more people . As with most 1 - off card games , you COULD use a regular deck of cards - you are paying for the " rules of the game " ( and of course the cute rats and cats ) .
5 #### I work with kids and bought this for my office . They love this toy . It is the perfect size for them to play with and use for breathing exercises . Some of the kids like to bounce it on the floor and it has actually held up really great . I would buy this toy again and recommend it to others .
4 #### My 3 year old loved playing with this ball . The glow in the dark feature is ok . It glows a little .
5 #### My 9 year old son bought this with his own money . :) He has had it for months and still plays with it . Just a fun , keep the hands busy kind of toy .
5 #### Our daughter loves this ball . She plays with it literally every single day . Totally worth the money , in fact once she is a little older I will get the larger one . Who 's kidding ? We 'll probably play with it too . Great for stress relief .
5 #### Great ! Kids love it and it holds together without breaking !
5 #### It 's all been said before ... but this game is really great . My 6 y.o . says it is her favorite game . It 's educational and fun- what a perfect combo ! My almost-4 - y.o . plays too , but often needs help .
4 #### You can play this game with kids , and the adults wo n't get bored . Heck , you could even play a few rounds with other grown - ups , though you would n't replace poker night with it :) There 's a lot of skill involved and kids are figuring out basic mental math and probability , so that 's great .
5 #### I prefer games where I do n't have to " dummy down " for the kids to have a chance of winning . This is one of those games . It is easy , fun , and short . It saved my life when I was flying alone with the kids over Christmas break and we were stuck at the airport for two days . We must have played 100 rounds of this , and noone got tired of it . They still wanted to play more when we were safely at Grandma 's house .
5 #### This sphere is a lot of fun . I use it with my son when he needs to calm down a little . We work on breathing exercises with it .
5 #### Not too long ago my " quality time " with my two young boys hit a crisis when they both decided that they were sick of all the game we had on the game shelf , so I desperately went out and bought this card game based on a recommendation from a person who works at a toy store . Well , my five year old loves this game , and we 've played it almost every day since I bought it . He 's beat me several times too ! This is really a simple card trading game based on trading higher numbered card for lower numbered cards . In fact , a conventional deck of playing cards could be adapted to playing this game at a very basic level , but the addition of special " power cards " adds fun and randomness to the game play , and there is a memory building angle as well , so you really get everything a game should be in one package : strategy , random luck of the draw , and a bit of genuine gambling . Then there 's the entertainment value of the really cool rat and cat cartoons on the cards . So , if you are at the end of your rope for game night with the kids , spend a few bucks and try this one . It looks like it 's going to have nine lives in my family .
5 #### This was one of the first Gamewright games we purchased and it is a winner . Kids , parents , grandparents , even great , great grandma wanted to join in ( we caught her " peeking " a couple of times when she should n't have , but hey ... ) . I remember playing a similar game with just your basic deck of face cards ( we called it " No Peeking " ) but Gamewright 's " peek " and " swipe " ( the " draw2 is ok ) are a great addition . My kids complain there are too many NINES in the deck . Lots of luck , but it does require memory and logic .
5 #### this is one of my family 's favorite games .... my youngest started playing at about four years old ... and i do n't think anyone who enjoys games would outgrow it ...... in rat a tat game you play multiple hands and keep score .... we play so often that we have a dedicated journal that we just keep rat a tat cat scores in ...... great game !
5 #### Really cool toy , what I like to call a thinking type toy . Fun to play with and they open up the mind . My son loves it .
3 #### Good quality sturdy and a bit smaller then expected . Great colors .
5 #### my whole family adores this game ..... the youngest child to the oldest adult ..... we play when friends are over ... with the grandparents ...... everyone loves it ..... it is quick to learn and fun to play .... but it is n't easy ... there are lots of different strategies to take ( i always rat rap early ) and if you are n't spot on , you 'll forget what your cards are .... and you ca n't peek ! ..... this is a fun , fast and fabulous game for 4 year olds to 94 year olds ......
5 #### This is definitely one of the best card games we 've bought -- including several from Gameright . It tests one 's memory , strategies , a good poker face , and of course , above all one must have good luck with each round . My 4 year old son and my older daughter both play this game . Believe it or not , my husband and I also enjoy playing the game with them . The cards are made of durable material . It is worth every penny . Highly recommend it .
5 #### Fun toy for the kids and i played with it to , great entertainment on the cheap
4 #### This is a fantastic sensory toy , and will delight kids for years ! The only downside , and the reason that I 'm knocking a star , is because the connecting red pieces are mostly swastika shapes , which , while understandable within the design , is still unsettling when one of them breaks and you 're tracking tiny red swastikas through your home trying to find out which of your kids toys is the culprit .
3 #### Does not open and collapse in the air like other Hoberman Spheres . Also , a piece broke off the first day .
5 #### Kids love them but the dogs seem to think that they are some kind of Death Sphere and flee in terror when they expand . Warning : Do not taunt Hoberman mini sphere
3 #### The one I received was kind of tight I expected to be at larger ball but I did n't really spend that five but it worked and my daughter was satisfied but it is small
5 #### I do n't really know why , but my ten year old loves this toy .
4 #### This is smaller than I pictured and expands to a sphere about the size of a basketball . This was overall not as impressive as the large classic desk toy version , but aside from size is a nice quality and a fun toy . Would come apart under heavy play , not for small children .
5 #### My grandson loves this sphere . Two of his cousins have one and he was happy to get one for himself .
5 #### Very well made and a fun toy to play with ! Even the adults ca n't resist .
3 #### My son like this but the end pieces kept coming off .... he mentioned to me that u r supposed to be able to throw it in the air so it should not be doing that so easily , because he did n't even drop it .... real opinion of the 10 year old playing with it ....
5 #### I bought this to brighten my cubicle at work . Someone is always picking it up and playing with it . I recommend .
5 #### get it for my 12 years old son for Christmas . He loves it . he always wanted one it this , and glowing in the dark was the extra bonus that he did n't expect , but really like . just keep losing one connection piece ... probably need to glue it before he lose it completely .
5 #### Great product ! My granddaughter loves the way it opens and closes !
3 #### Got this for my nephew who fell in love with them in his therapy sessions . Sadly one of the spokes broke at the joint within 10 minutes , and he did n't play rough with it .
5 #### my 12 years old son fall in love with this toy . i did n't expect that it would be such a big hit . he said it can occupy him for hours ... :) But 14 years old son that got similar one only in different color was n't excited at all and at the end traded with his brother for something , So that other one can have both of them and keep one in both houses . the only thing that we lost one of the connection same day ( probably after rolling git on the carpet ) , but then we found it and clip it back pretty easy . not sure how long it would servive
5 #### This is a great toy for parents to enjoy , not just kids ! The way the sphere goes in / out is just fun to watch . Throw it in the air ; throw it on the ground , and watch it shrink . It is pretty nifty .
5 #### My one - year - old grandson loves it ! So do the slightly older kids he plays with .
5 #### Our 11 - year old grandson has enjoyed this . I ca n't say that he plays with it over and over . He takes it in spells . He will enjoy it for awhile and then put it away for a few weeks . Then it sparks his interest again . He enjoys the movement of it , and how unusual it is .
5 #### Update : One year later , this toy is still surviving in my house of 4 rough kids . They are not delicate with their toys and this is still holding up just fine . Every child that comes to visit always checks this thing out first . Would buy again for sure . Very cute toy , and it 's held up well to my almost 2 year old playing with it . This toy makes a lot of rounds in my house , and has interested all my children ; ages 1 , 6 , 9 and 12 . I would buy it again .
3 #### Five stars for entertainment and a great idea and concept . I give it three stars for durability . After just a few months , it started to pop apart and break when the kids would toss it and grab it as kids do . I do n't think I would call it rough play , but normal boys playing with a toy . Unless played on carpet alone , the edges started to get worn , and the plastic scraped . A fun toy for sure , keeping interest over time , but not as durable as we would like .
5 #### I use the Sphere as a breathing tool for my kids Yoga Classes . They love it and always ask me to bring it out .
4 #### My son loved it until it broke one day after we got it , needs to be alittle more sturdy
5 #### These things are so fun ! The adults play with it more than the kids do .
5 #### Bought this for my friend . She uses it for therapy on her hand .. Received the order very fast . Good Price ..
5 #### Kids and adults ca n't put this ball down . It 's interesting and fun . ( a good fidget toy )
3 #### Meh . I got this for my autistic five year old , he liked it at first . But after a few days the novelty wore off and it now sits in the toy box .
5 #### I looked everywhere for this ball , and I am very grateful to have Amazon on my side . This is a really cool toy !
5 #### My grandson loved this toy . It 's amazing how something fairly simple can provide for hours of learning and enjoyment .
5 #### Sturdy , fun , interesting . My autistic child likes it as does everyone else ! not the most sturdy of toys though .
4 #### this is supposed to be a sensory toy for my kids to play with . it is very cool as it opens and closes as you throw it in the air and you can teach your kids the concept of big and small . the colors are bright and beautiful .
4 #### Great for a car to entertain a kid , but * much * more fragile than the regular size .
5 #### Ah , this toy was a huge part of my childhood . I had these in multiple sizes and colors and they never broke . The same goes for this one - the quality in their products is still alive and well today . Even my german shepherd has taken a bite at it when it was fully extended a few times and it still works great . I find myself opening and closing it because it 's so mesmerizing ... This might be surprising to you , but it 's a fun little toy for all ages !
5 #### This is a neat ball bought for my granddaughter but I think I am more fascinated with it than she is
5 #### My grandkids love these , especially the younger ones because they can catch them easily when they are thrown to them .
4 #### Fun toy , and keeps you occupied . I like the multi - color !
5 #### It was smaller than I thought but my kid loves it .
2 #### Broke the first day we had it . It was cool while it lasted , but not very durable .
5 #### Bought this for my nephew 's birthday . It was a big hit !
5 #### My 2 year old and 6 year old love this as a fidget and play with this a lot .
3 #### Really cool , but quite a bit " looser " than I assumed . In other words , I thought it would be harder to collapse , and would stay formed if held , but it immediately collapses when touched . However , my sons are still enjoying it .
5 #### I can not give a review , since it was a gift . My grandson told me that he just loved it .
2 #### Did not glow . I feel mislead because it 's very small . I know it says mini but the pic on the box looks bigger than it actually is . Also the picture shows the whole thing glowing which it does n't ! Ours did n't glow at all ! My daughter asked me to return it . That 's how unimpressive this is . Also it cost as much as the huge one I bought for my son .
4 #### Does not have the impact of the larger sphere , but cute anyway .
2 #### I am a teacher and ordered this product for my classroom . While I would n't expect this product to stand up to heavy abuse , it broke almost immediately . One of the blue connector plastic pieces fell off after one of my students simply handled the sphere . I spent ten minutes trying to get the two blue pieces ' clicked ' back together , but they will not stay on the sphere . Now I am simply waiting for the rest of it to fall apart . Good idea in theory , but not if it can not be used without breaking .
5 #### more accurately , the kids love it . this is a pretty cool toy ... but try and get your kids to say icosidodecahedron 3 times fast ...
5 #### It gets bigger .. then gets smaller . Little hinges can pinch you but frankly after many , many years of evolution you quickly figure out that it does n't really hurt and to keep your fingers out the pinchy spots . Did I mention it gets bigger ? then smaller ? then bigger again ? I like to throw it to my dogs , completely wigs them out . They just bark at me now when I bring it out . I like it .
5 #### My 9 - year old son uses this for breathing exercises that he learned in yoga class . It 's been helpful to have at home .
5 #### I am in the process of getting my fianc everything that Michael Scott had on his desk in the famous TV hit series , The Office . I am so excited to be finding all of these toys and gag gifts here on Amazon . This was one of the items on his desk , and it is going to be PERFECT for what I am trying to do here .
3 #### These are very fragile and things started popping off after a few days , still works but not worth the price IMO .
5 #### Every kid needs a hoberman sphere . These were a big hit . All ages loved them . Even the grown ups !
5 #### As a social worker , I see children in the school setting and it helps to have items or activites that are small enough to carry yet helpful to create excitement , use for demonstration if needed , or to help problem solve . This is a great item to carry along and kids love it . Adults get excited with it too .
5 #### I bought this for my 14 year old grandson . He 's ' too old ' for toys Yet he ca n't keep his hands off his younger siblings ' similar hands - on toys . I have n't given it to him yet but am sure he will find it enticing ..... actually it 's great for all ages ... I ca n't wait to try it !
5 #### I use it to teach breathing to small children and in my work with families . It is also in our calm down kit at home . You can also throw it in the air and it expands and collapses . Fun toy
5 #### Fun little toy that has no use what so ever . I have people come by my cube and just play with the thing while talking . Funny to watch .
5 #### My grandson absolutely LOVES this sphere ! He has played with it every night for going on two years now . He is 10 now and still loves it !
4 #### Product is about what I expected but the larger spheres are a lot more fun . They hold up well , has n't popped a connection yet . Very intriguing .
3 #### My children have had a couple of these before and have always loved them . This one is no exception except that it does not close up as easily as it seems like it should .
5 #### My kids are a big fans of these & they love this mini one . It 's perfect to take on the go due to the size & the glow - in - the dark feature is fun .
5 #### Durable enough for kids to play with . Obvious , do n't body slam it . The expanding is mesmerizing . It can be hung from ceiling kept full size open . You can get real creative and technical and install a cable with motor and pulley mechanism that will lower and raise it from the ceiling while closing and expanding it like they do with big metal ones at some city science centers / omniplex .
5 #### I use this to demonstrate breathing with my choir students . The visual aid 1 ) gets them to visualize the expansion of their lungs and the volume of air intake and 2 ) entices them to participate because they feel like they are playing with a toy , not working on a skill . Wish I had had one of these years ago .
3 #### This was fun for a while but the novelty wears off . If your going to spend money on it just know there is an expiration date .
5 #### Made a great gift for my 7 year old . Bright colors . Safe enough to play with in the house . She loves tossing it in the air and watching it expand before catching it again . Good size too !
5 #### I purchased this for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it , one of the plastic blue pieces fell off , but I am sure I can fix it ! Everyone loves playing with this , kids and adults !
5 #### awesome sphere ; I use with elementary students ; it has many uses : visual for breathing ; play catch ; calming / relaxing ; it makes people happy .
4 #### My son always wanted one of these , he wanted a four foot tall one but they are too expensive . He likes it and also likes that is glow in the dark . So far , it 's sturdy and seems to be well made . Amazon shipping was very fast as always .
5 #### I use this with my seniors choir to demonstrate breathing technique . My choir is made up of 28 older singers ( average age is about 85 or so ) , many of whom have n't sung in years or have never sung . Proper breathing is the key to proper singing , and that means breathing in so that the entire rib cage expands outward , not just the " belly . " The Hoberman sphere perfectly demonstrates this concept , as it expands in every direction . We use this in conjunction with blowing up balloons to strengthen the muscles needed to produce the best sound possible , and it works ! They " get it , " and I hear the difference in their sound . This has been a great communication tool .
5 #### This toy was purchased by me for my work as a child and family therapist . In teaching relaxation to children this toy allows me to illustrate deep breathing with a fun visual aid that will keep the kids paying attention and allow them to place their hands on something at the same time . This is often important when teaching children . They tend to be easily distracted and uninterested in learning some of the skills that are needed for their treatment . This toy expands out and I use this to talk about breathing in deeply and filling your lungs up with air . When breathing out the ball can then be contracted and go back to normal size . The kiddos are fascinated with the colors and how big it can get and it provides some sensory feedback and " hands on " work that I find is so helpful when engaging children in skill building . Even if it was n't used for this purpose its very amusing and fun to look at and play with for all ages .
5 #### I purchased this for my 2 year old at the same time as I purchased the big one of these for my 6 and 8 year olds . I thought that the big one would be too big . This one is perfect for him and his little hands . It lets him be like it big siblings but be able to manage this too . Very cute and fun !
3 #### My daughter got this for Christmas and it has already broke . It was really fun when it worked , but the blue pieces on the ends started popping off . Was fun while it lasted .
5 #### This is an awesome toy . I keep it in my office for kids to play with and they love it !
4 #### This is a great stress relieving item for your desk at work or at home . Unfortunately it 's not really durable enough to be a child 's toy .
4 #### Our 6 yr old is enjoying this product . She needs help with getting quicker at drilling addition and subtraction and this is helping . She likes when the green light lights up to tell her she is correct . The levels are very good since my niece ( 8 yrs ) , nephew ( 10 yrs ) and the adults have all tried it . If it 's durable enough , it should last her for years as she gets to multiplication etc . She does n't think it 's FUN though - it 's just something to do when she is bored . For this reason we keep it in the van . Our plan is working though because she climbs into her seat and immediately turns it on . We had it in our home for awhile but there were too many other FUN things to do besides Math ! If your child enjoys challenging math facts , they will think it 's fun though - our 8 yr old niece did and so do myself and my husband .
5 #### My nearly-4 and 2 year old sons love this toy ! They each have one to prevent the fighting . They love to dismantle the car and figure out how to get things back on . Daddy likes to get involved , too !
5 #### Excellent product ! Great quality ! Both my kids love it !
5 #### Very nice game for learning . Fits nice in hands
5 #### nice one recommended by my son 's first grade teacher .
5 #### Great for kids to practice anywhere , -at home or in the car . Very handy .
4 #### My 8yo twins received this for review and were actually excited to practice math with it during their summer vacation ! It requires 2 AA batteries in a rear compartment that can be unscrewed with a coin . As stated in other reviews , the battery door bulges with the batteries inside although it does not affect the function . The screen is a very basic design typical of a calculator but with functions that allow testing in addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , decimals , fractions and percentiles . There are 9 levels for each function and a help button to provide clues . It 's simple enough that my 6yo was able to figure it out and the green and red light next to the screen lets the player know if they have the correct answer . It 's great for building math skills and since my kids are happy to play with it as an electronic toy I 'm very happy
5 #### My 6 year old son loves numbers & this is perfect for him . The device was easy to hold and is small enough that we brought it on the airplane during vacation . My son was able to play the game independently and enjoyed the green / red lights to indicate correct / incorrect .
4 #### I received this product for free to provide my honest feedback . This toy is a hit with my 6 year old son ! My son loves math , so when we received this product , he immediatly wanted to start playing with it . I like that you can add , subtract , multiply , and divide with it , so my son will be able to grow with this toy . He is going into 1st grade , so it is nice that he can practice adding and subtracting , all while having fun with ' an electronic ' toy . He even took it with him in the car and played on it the entire 4 hour car ride to go on vacation . The screen it a little hard to read if the light hits it just right , but it is easy to hold and my son will be able to grow with it .
4 #### My daughter was thrilled when she got this to use . She is always trying to learn math above her 7 - year - old level and this is great for that because it allows you to adjust the difficulty . Love how it has sets for addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division and even tougher problems like fractions . She was able to quickly figure out how to use it herself . My one complaint is the screen is a bit difficult to read if you are n't in the right lighting . But otherwise , I 'm excited to have her use this as she goes further in school to practice tougher problems . It 's also a great size for the car or waiting for an appointment . I received this product free from Educational Insights in exchange for an honest review .
4 #### My four year old loves math and electronic gadgets and Math Shark was a hit with him ! He currently likes doing the easier levels of addition and subtraction and I like that this product will grow with him as his math skills develop further . It is convenient and educational - wonderful for travel or just small outings where waiting is necessary ( like going out to eat ) . My six year old plays with the Math Shark occasionally and although she 's less a fan of the product ( because it is dedicated only to math ) that is also another plus for the parent - you know your child wo n't be switching over to some mindless ice cream game instead of practicing math if you have the Math Shark vs. a tablet . Also , this product makes it so much more fun to do math drills than having to use flash cards . I would give this product five stars if the display screen was clearer - the numbers are sometimes hard to see / distinguish . Overall , this is a product I would recommend . * I was given this product in exchange for an honest review *
3 #### I was so excited to get this for our son . He loves riding in it to no surprise , it really is a great toy , but the quality is going down . Older models I 've seen at yard sales are better quality than this new one . Door wo n't stay shut properly and stickers come off after a few months even if used indoors only . I should have bought a used one someplace , I totally wasted money on shipping and now I am stuck with a car with no stickers . I am very disappointed , but yes , this toy is a great fun for all kids I know .
5 #### Bought for 24 month old , 35 lb , rough and tumble grandson . Took Grandpa about 1/2 hour to assemble . He 's pretty good at this stuff . Grandson quickly figured out how to coast car down the slight incline of our driveway . It hit the gutter with such force I winced . He was n't scared at all . In fact he laughed and did it over and over . I was concerned car might topple over , but it never did . It is remarkably stable . It is also light weight for it 's size . This makes it easy to move it around the house / garage . Hands down his favorite toy .
5 #### My daughter was excited to practice math with this learning tool . The shape is nice , making it easy to hold , and everything seems very sturdy . I like how you can choose the learning level so this device can grow as my kids progress in math . The sound and light - up feature for correct / incorrect answers make this an easy - to - use learning tool .
4 #### Math Shark has been a big hit in our home ! My 7 year - old son has really enjoyed playing with it and finds it easy to understand . Math Shark has several games to choose from including addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , decimals , fractions , and percents . Each game also has various skill levels . There is even a calculator mode ! Math Shark is portable and would be a great toy for car trips . It kept my son entertained for quite some time .
4 #### My daughter is in 2nd grade and this product works well for drilling basic math facts . I like that you can select different levels of difficulty and different operations to practice . I also appreciate that this is a product that will grow with my child , and she will be able to use to drill the basics for several years . And of course , these drill can be done on computers or tablets or phones , but those things have all sorts of other distractions on them ; if she 's working on this , at least I know it 's math she 's practicing !
5 #### Math practice for all ages . The skill difficulty has a wide range of valuable math computations .
2 #### The random math problems for the drill are not random ; the mathshark just assigns the same questions over and over . My son loves math , so I thought this would entertain him in the car ; it worked for the first few minutes . Very disappointed .
4 #### I like it better than my grandkids , wish they used it more .
5 #### My grandson , 13 months , loves getting in and out of this car all by himself . He likes using the key and the horn . He has not mastered moving the car forward with his feet , but it wo n't be long .
5 #### My kids love this toy , even my 12 year old crams himself into this car . If that s not durablity I do n't know what is . This car has lasted threw 4 children the oldest 12 & now still getting use by my 3 & 1 year old . It has very little fading with tons of hours out side . We are also a military family so we move every couple of years & it is still in great shape after 4 moves . I would definitly recomend this car & most little tikes out door products .
5 #### My son got this for his birthday from his Grandparents when he turned One . He loves it and so do the two neighbor toddlers . They all fight over it . My son turns it over and runs it into things and it has held up for 8 months now . My husband will tell you it was a pain to put together and the stickers do not last on it . Other than that the car has been a huge hit with our son and the neighbors .
5 #### Great for a kid that reads but a bit more difficult for K-1st graders . Works great for the younger kids if an adult or older sibling can help in between quizzes and to get it started . The screen can be hard to see but its nice to have a dedicated math game that ca n't be switched out to angry birds :) . I know my son is practicing if he has this in hand . Wish they would fix the screen or allow for voice prompting , but it does exactly what it says in the description - quizzes math facts .
4 #### This is a simple math drilling device / calculator . It consists of 8 levels of each of the following area -- addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , decimals , fractions and percentages . The levels progress rather slowly from simple ( 1 + 3 ) to algebraic thinking ( ? + 13=42 ) . I like that the multiplication allows you to select the times table that you will be working with . You can use the sound , or not and there is a red light or green light to indicate whether you have reached the correct answer . It 's durable enough for all three of my kids though I doubt it will be around like my old Speak & Math is ... they just do n't make things like they used to :) . It is still a math drill computer so it does n't make it FUN , per se , but I accidentally read a review before I posted mine and they mentioned keeping it in the car for when they get bored . I LOVE this idea because my two year old has car toys but the older ones do n't and this is perfect for them ! Disclaimer : I received this item in exchange for an honest review .
4 #### My 6yr old is enjoying addition and subtraction on this ! He has yet to learn multiplication and division but I think it will be a useful tool when he does .
5 #### I home school my 10 year old daughter and I hate the " drill and kill " methods of teaching , so I am always looking for ways that make learning fun . Much of what I come up with or have purchased , my daughter finds boring . Not so with this math game ! She actually expected to find this game dull , but she is hooked . She literally came to understand decimals much better just by playing with this " toy " for less than half an hour , and she enjoys trying to beat her previous timing . It comes with a booklet that shows HOW to perform the various math operations if the child does not yet know how , then the game is used for practicing . Once they are comfortable with a level , they can advance to the next hardest level . This is the first math learning anything I 've found that she finds entertaining , and it really does improve her math skills , so I 'm happy , too ! It teaches several skills including adding , subtracting , multiplying , dividing , fractions , percents , decimals , and it can be used as a calculator , too . My daugher said to give it 5 stars .
5 #### I read the reviews from Amazon , before ordering this car from Toys R Us . We paid the extra money to have it assembled . We gave it to my daughter for her birthday ( December 2005 ) , when she turned 2 . She was so excited she drove it around the house . We have n't taken it outside yet , because it 's still cold out . But , she plays with it at home , and when she does she puts on her glasses ( baby bop 's glasses ) and gets her keys ( plastic keys ) and drives around the house in it . When we purchased it , the only color available was Purple and Pink . Which suited her . It seems that the yellow and red color was n't available at the Yonkers , Toys R Us . But , she loves this car and so do we .
3 #### My son received this toy as a hand - me - down and it 's in great shape ( hence the 5 stars for durability ) . The problem is that at 18 months ( or younger ) my son ca n't make it move forward with his feet , only backward which is frustrating for him . I have tried to push him around in it but his legs are too long and get all tangled up underneath the car which was frustrating for us both . He 's pushed it around from behind but would rather ride in it . He loves it and wants to play with it but I 've hidden it in the far reaches of the garage until he 's a little older . Perhaps manufacturer 's age should be 2 years and up instead of 18 mos .
5 #### Every first grader should have their own math shark ! It 's the perfect tool for memorizing their math facts . Timing themselves each time instills their internal desire to beat that time the next day . Our family has used math sharks for early elementary mental math going into our second generation now . That 's not all . This handy tool prepares students for math memorization beginning with one digit addition and subtraction and goes all the way to pre - algebra . Take a look . It 's so worth the $ 40 to never have to teach your own child math again .
4 #### My son recieved this as a Christmas gift . I really wanted to wait until his 2nd birthday , but a family member bought it without telling us . Anyways ... I was looking at the Little tike race car toys for a first ride on , not this . This car was difficult to put together . The instructions were horrible ( no words all pictures ) . After a few hours dh and I got it together . My son loves it , he jumped in turned the wheel , but the car did n't move . He plays in the car everyday , but has no clue how to get it to move . He also holds the door while getting his foot in and the car toppled over twice ( on level ground ) . I have to walk around and push it for him . He also slid out from under the car afew times . The more he tried to get up or me help him get up , the more the car would move over him . He does push it himself , but he would rather ride in it than push it .
5 #### I bought this toy for my daughters second birthday . She s three now and it remains one of her favorites . Its so sturdy i have to tell my 9 year old to leave it alone LOL . The only problem that i have withg it is that it only fits one comfortably . But other than that ITS GREAT ! ! ! I highly reccomend it . You will defenetly get your moneys worth ! -L
5 #### Great for drill practice of math facts ! You can control the levels , allowing my preschooler to play by adding with 1s and 2s while my second grader can do harder addition and simple multiplication . Since we homeschool I let him use the Mathshark instead of the drill work in his workbook , which makes him happy ! It 's also great for leaving in the car for practice during any short trip . With eight functions we 'll be using this for several more years !
5 #### I gave this Mathshark to my son for Christmas and he LOVES it . He is 7 and my daughter is 11 and they are both enjoying it and using it . I figure if they want to be on a type of video screen sometimes , they might as well be learning ! I highly recommend it .
5 #### My 4 year old as well as my 15 month old enjoy this durable toy that was very easy to put together . The door easily opens and closes without pinching little fingers . The wheels roll easily so pushing the toy is easy for even the youngest toddlers .
5 #### We have a Cozy Coupe at home and one at Grandma 's too . It 's a durable little car that 's fun and cute . Initially , it 's hard to get it out of reverse , but once the little ones figure it out , they 'll cruise all over . It 's one of the cheaper ride - ons out there , but it 's well worth the money . This is one of those toys that will last for years and your kids will play with for years . 10 years later , our Cozy Coupe is still in great condition and providing hours of fun for a younger sister .
5 #### Bought this for my grandson to keep him up on his math as he is very smart for a 10 year old and he loved it .
5 #### When we moved to our first house , I immediately went out and bought one of these for my 2 year old because every time we went to Toys R ' Us all he wanted to do at the store was play with this toy . Now that he has it all he wants to do is go out in the front yard and drive it . We also got the gas pump and he loves getting out and filling up the gas and then driving some more . This is a great toy for kids and seems very durable , I definitely think it will last . However it was very very very hard to put together . One of the front yellow pieces would NOT fit in the red car part . My husband has to shave plastic off with his knive then cram it in there while I sat on top of the whole thing to hold it in , so he could then drill a screw through the outside of the back into the red car part . I would suggest paying the extra 10 bucks to have them put it together at the store .
3 #### Bought for my seven year old grandson . He had loved the electronic dictionary but found this toy below his level . It did not hold his interest . It only allows you to drill , like electronic flashcards - there is no " game " aspect to it so he gets bored fast . I could see keeping this in the car or using it as part of daily homework , but he 's unlikely to pick it up and play just for fun . It fits better in an adults hands than a childs , as it 's quite bigger . The buttons feel almost old - fashioned , you really have to push them with force to make it register - I think if this was used often , the buttons would wear out . It 's easy to figure out how to use it , but once you start one of the flashcard quizzes , there is n't a good way to exit . You have to finish the whole quiz or turn it off to start over on a different skill , which is a bit annoying if you start a quiz and realize it 's too easy or difficult and want to change the level . That 's about it - a good tool but not a lot of " fun " .
5 #### We went to a friends house and my son fell in love with this car ! It was just the right size for him to drive . He loved turning the key in the ignition . He enjoyed putting gas in the car ( pretend of course ) where the gas tank hole is . Considering my friends little boy put hers through hard play and it still looks new , I think this is a very sturdy and durable toy . If you look for toys that are fun and versatile and easy to use , this is a good toy . If you look for toys that will grow with the child this looks like it 'll last a long time for my two year old to grow out of . If you look for toys that do encourage the child to explore his / her world and will do more than just let him / her push a button , this is the toy to get .
5 #### Bought this for my granddaughter who has trouble learning math and she enjoys using it and it has improved her math skills and confidence . It was delivered on time and was at a good price .
1 #### I bought the Mathshark for my 7 - year - old child to practice her math skills . Opened the package , put in the batteries , and tried to use it . Half of the buttons did not work , no matter how hard I pressed . A few other buttons only worked if you pressed them REALLy hard . I was surprised given that we own several other Education Insights products with which we have had no problems . Too bad , a piece of junk .
5 #### My son got this for his first birthday . He loves it . First it is a pain in the neck to put together very difficult . Took me about an hour . But once it was together he really liked it . It has so many uses . He can sit in it and turn the wheel honk the horn and play with the key . He even at 15 months now does n't know how to push it from inside . We give him rides in it though . His favorite use is to stand behind the car and push it . He will walk up and down the sidewalk pushing this car . It is the perfect height for litle ones to push . The bad points is it is hard to get the door open and shut it takes more strength then young ones may have . Also if it gets wet you have to turn it over to get the water out . But we leave the car outside and it is weathering well . No fading yet . I recommend this
5 #### My daughter was struggling with learning her math facts . This was the perfect solution . I am so glad I ordered it . Well made .
5 #### When my niece received this as a Christmas present a few years ago she was fascinated . She was scooting around in the living room in no time at all . Her older sister tried to borrow it ... and did n't get too far . This was Lexi 's for sure ! I thought it was very sturdy and easy to clean if you take it outside . The wheels work nicely on a deck or smooth concrete surface . When I was little , my dad had to build me a fire engine . It had foot pedals which I think are not as safe for younger children , so I like the fact that children have to " walk " it around . this gives them a bit of exercise and is fun for children who are learning to walk and are frustrated about not being able to get around as easily . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### Our daughter loves this car . Hers was passed down from a relative , and is about 6 years old , but still looks GREAT ! It is east to clean , infact we make a game of it . Hannah washes her car while Mommy washes her car . I like that they have to push themselves around , I think it makes for more creative play . This toy is just as good as any of the Little Tykes items . It will last forever .
4 #### This has been a great tool for our kids to use for Math . It was recommended by their teacher . The kids will take it off the shelf themselves and use it ! :) Have n't had any issues with it .
1 #### I really wanted to like this . The screen is just so sub par . The kids will pull it out occasionally to use as a calculator but that 's only because they do n't have another one . However bad you think the screen might be it is probably worse . This quality of screen would have been complained about by reviewers 20 years ago because it does cut things off and make them unreadable . Today it makes no sense to sell a screen like this when people are use to so much better . Also a rubber button promptly fell off and is still floating around the house somewhere .
2 #### Not impressed . The graphics are very hard to read and all it is is numbers ! In this world of amazing graphics this should not be an issue . My kids love math but this only holds my 7 year old attention for a few minutes . I would not recommend .
4 #### I got this for my son for his birthday when he was turning 7 and in the first grade . I was looking for something electronic to help him learn / practice multiplication and division before 2nd grade . The addition and subtraction were way to easy for him . He was at the time slighty above his piers in math . The multiplication mode goes in the same sequence which made him memorize rather then learn . He could spit out his multiplication tables in 1st grade after using the math shark , but I did n't get the feeling he understood what mutliplication was after using this product . I also do n't feel it was good value for what he learned compared to so of teh other products out there .
5 #### This is an awesome buy ! Sturdy , hours of fun . Very easy to store and it pops open in seconds . I love how it is n't held together with pvc so it does nt bend or break easily . Love it !
3 #### My 2 1/2 year old son is obsessed with school buses . He does enjoy playing with this toy , but not as much as I 'd hoped . It has withstood several playdates with five 2 - 3 year olds jumping through it , on it , in it , etc . I think it is something he might need to grow into .
5 #### This is a great toy . Easy to put up and take down . My children and their friends enjoy playing with it . Its a must have .
5 #### kids loves it . My 16 months age daughter and four years old son both enjoy it alot .
5 #### I had wanted to get my 17 month old daughter a play tent or something that she can go in and out of . I had found this school bus and thought I would try it out since it was so affordable . My daughter loves it ! She loves to run in and out of the door flap and crawl through the hole in the back of the bus . She thinks it 's hilarious when we stick our heads in through the windows when she is in there . This school bus is very light and can be knocked over and moved around but that is all part of the fun as my daughter even likes to move it around while she is inside of it . The best part is that it folds up easily in seconds to be put away and unfolds in seconds for play time .
4 #### My 18 month old and 3 yr old girls got this for Christmas . My 18 month old absolutely loves it , loves it , LOVES it ! My 3 year old enjoys playing in it with her sister , not sure it would have the same draw for her by herself especially with all the other new Christmas toys around but she still likes it . Only had a few days so far , but think this is a great gift .
5 #### This is the greatest thing , I was worried because some of the reviews said it was not made good and it was easily torn . Not only has it lived up to my 3 year old , but we set it up outside and all the kids come and play , it has not torn . It sparks great imagination . All her friends go to school now , this allows her to pretend with them that she is going also . And best of all , we can store it anywhere when we are done , she has even learned to close it up and put it away . I highly recommend this bus to all ! ! !
5 #### I have this schoolbus set up in the bedroom of our 1 bedroom apartment and it 's a favourite amongst other parents , children who come over to play , as well as my daughter to " hide into " for a little privacy . She is 2 1/2 yrs old and likes this alot --- to either play in , or read a book in privacy . I find her doll in here sometimes , which shows she likes to take along her doll for a busride sometimes too . Great idea .
4 #### My 2 - year - old son got this for his birthday . He loves playing in it and loading it full of his stuffed animals . I think he will enjoy this for a long time . It is easy to fold up and stick behind the couch or some out - of - the - way place . The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the material seems like it would be likely to rip if more than 2 or 3 kids were playing with it at the same time . When we have alot of kids come to our house I usually hide the bus ! ( especially if the children are older than 7 or so ) . So far the inflatable steering wheel has held up well . I noticed that other reviews complain of the steering wheel deflating or getting holes in it ; thus far that has n't been a problem for us . This is a great toy , especially for the price !
5 #### My 5 year old and almost 2 year old love this , it 's one of the few toys they have where they play together without fighting . They fill their backpacks and lunchboxes , put on jackets and hats and out they go . I 've even been given a small part in the production ; when the five year old comes back in and says " Hi mom " , he has instructed me to say " How was soccer practice ? " It 's great , folds pretty much flat and slides under the couch . Unfolds in seconds and can be used indoors or out . There 's even a cool inflatable steering wheel . The photographs of them peeking out the windows are fab !
5 #### We bought this for our two year old music loving boy . He LOVES this drum . This is not a fake toy drum that sounds terrible and will break in a few months . Remo is a respected maker of amateur and professional drums for adults , so this is a real instrument . It sounds good and is very sturdy . And most of all , toddlers LOVE it .
5 #### This is the coolest drum I 've seen . Soem that I 've seen have a really cheap top that could easily be punctured ... and they are over 20 bucks ... this one is very thick and sturdy for only a bit more . I just ca n't believe how good the quality is . The sound the mallots make on it are incredible . I 'm really pleased . I got it for my daughter 's 2nd birthday ( she LOVES drums ) and she absolutely loves it , and it is something that will grow with her . Such great quality and an amazing price .
5 #### Great game for family therapy . I also used a few times with my family on a holiday where we were all together .
5 #### I got this board game to use as an ice breaker with my adolescent clients . I had great results and found it to be lots of fun . I definitely want to use it with group therapy in my adult groups as I feel that it is really fun and opens the doors to communication in a non - invasive way .
3 #### This game is like being trapped in an airplane seat next to someone who 's really , really bad at conversation , but wo n't stop trying . It fell completely flat with our mixed - ages group , especially with the under-30 set . Many of the questions just are n't that much fun and do n't fire the imagination . Picture asking a 12 - year - old boy , for example , what kind of house or apartment he wants to live in ... Well , he wants a cool one . Beyond that , though , he ca n't define " cool " and has n't thought about where , or with whom , or what it would look like , or let him do . Now , ask a niece who 's been the most influential person in her 9 years of life ... now define " influential " for her .... now ask her in what way that person was the most influential ... now lose all momentum . Even the alternatives lacked creativity . Have each person make a funny face ? Come on ! I think it may have been okay for a 50 - and - up crowd . Our group , though , abandoned it after a desperate 30 minutes . This was a games - happy crowd that went on to play other games happily for several hours . I was really disappointed in Life Stories , to the point that I wish I could return it .
5 #### My kids ( 10 , 8 , 5 ) LOVE this game . They mostly love it for the stories that my husband and I end up telling , it is a great way for them to learn a bit about our past and who we are . We are also quite interested in the responses our children have to the cards . If they ever draw a card that does n't apply , they just pick up a different one . Here are some sample questions : Where was a special place you liked to play as a child ? Tell about one of the best gifts you have ever received ? Tell about a famous person you have met ? Thumb wrestle with the person across from you . What is your favorite time of year and why ? Recall a time when you got into trouble at school ? Tell about a time when you helped someone . Describe one of the worst weather conditions which you have been in . And so on . We 've lost the game board , but still pull this game out and just grab a card and start talking . Now I have n't actually tried to get my kids to play this with their friends , in part because we 've lost the game board , but overall , this is an excellent game for bringing families closer and sharing family stories and history .
5 #### Just received this drum , its so awesome ! Its beautiful and the sound and quality is beautiful ! ! ! I m using this in my Daycare music and it is truly wonderful !
5 #### Great set of 3 ( three ) classic juggling balls . Wonderful for the beginner and especially for practice . Brightly colored vinyl type of covering around beads . They are approximately 2 1 / i inches in diameter , so smaller than the typical juggling ball size . Hold up after a long amount of time using them , so very sturdy . They are not exactly round so they are easier to use especially for a beginner . Would make an awesome gift . Good feel when working with this set . LOTS OF FUN . HIGHLY RECOMMEND
5 #### This is a perfect activity / toy / skill for a little one My guys only 10 months but loves this and it 's also great bonding time with my husband :)
5 #### Perfect for starters . Good condition and feel . Excellent value for a beginner . Makes a good , fun gift as well .
5 #### This drum is great . I am always skeptical about products with lots of 5 star reviews , but it deserves it . The sound is clear and the sticks that come with it are perfect for my 3 year old . I also like that the drum is a bit on the heavy side , so it 's hard for her to accidentally tip it over when she invariably gets up and sprints around . My only gripe is a minor one ; the design wrapped around the drum has a noticeable seam . I wish it were tiled seamlessly . Not enough to warrant a star off though , the product is great and I am totally happy with it .
4 #### What a great drum . We got it for our one year old 's birthday and she loves it .
5 #### Not the best juggling balls , but perfect for beginners . Cheap and sold as advertised .
5 #### This is the best drum . My grandson is having so much fun playing it .
5 #### This drum was a Christmas gift for my 8 year old ( with special needs ) who is super musical . She loves it ! So do her older siblings . The sound is clear and deep - like a jungle drum sound . I do n't mind a bit hearing it played . I highly recommend .
5 #### This is high quality and worth every penny ! ! ! ! ! My kids love it ! It 's fun and easy and sounds great !
5 #### Beautiful drum set recommended by our school music teacher . Great sound not junky . Kids love it and so do I. Check out YouTube for adults playing music on this type of drum .
3 #### Not all the same size or density . a lot more varied than others I have bought
5 #### This is a real music instrument , with great sound and a different tone on the edge . Has already withstood heavy use ! Forget toy drums ! Get the real thing !
5 #### Great sound ! My daughter loves it ! Quality is great too .
5 #### Great drum for my 4 year old . Quality product , seems very well put together and sturdy so we do n't have to worry if it falls over . Love the sound .
5 #### What an amazing little drum . My kids got it going on three years ago and it is still in flawless shape . They beat it , bang it , dance in top of it , use it for a stepping stool and flip it upside down and carry things inside and still it is perfect . I am impressed and precious few product impress me .
5 #### Good Quality . Right weight . Pretty durable . Kids immediately decided that they were hackysacks and had lots of fun with them , but two still survive .
5 #### Wonderful product . Very well made . 19 month old grandson loves this , his new favorite toy . This drum has the Tom - Tom sound , not like a musical drum set . Goes from loud to soft tones ..... grandpa wants him to take drum back to his house next visit ..... lol lol ..... tons of fun for almost 2 year old .
5 #### The drum quality is good . Just be aware it is pretty big and the sound is very big . Make sure your neighbor can accept the shocking sound
5 #### This is fantastic ! ! Wonderful quality and sound . Especially for a wee one just learning . My daughter loves this drum ! ! ! It 's fun to teach her rhythm . And she likes to " go wild " on it . Very sturdy ! !
4 #### This doll is really special . Her curly redish hair is different to any other barbie . It comes protected by a delicate nest . The dress is really well done , full of cute details and made using high quality fabric . The nice white - royal blue shoes do complete the outfit . I do love my doll and i will not allow anyone to touch it .
3 #### It 's a bit loud for my liking . My kid liked the drum , but it got the same amount of action as the empty coffee can drum .
5 #### Bought this for my then 8 month old grandson who will be a year in 2 days & he constantly drums on it with sticks provided but loves to drum with hands . He also turns it upside down & stores his other favorite toy : odd balls ; sometimes he rolls it all over . It was a great purchase & drum is sturdy , attractive , pleasant to listen too .
5 #### Wonderful child 's drum . Our 1 year old loves playing on it . It has such a nice musical sound and I love that it has two drum sticks . Our son has decided that he likes to chew on the rubber / fabric drum stick ends , but so far , they are no worse for the wear . Great toy .
5 #### I bought this drum for my toddler because it is the brand she uses in music class . She loves it ! It is so much better than toy drums that play music and sounds when you hit them . I highly recommend these drums !
5 #### Great gift for my two year old granddaughter ! She loves playing the gathering drum by herself and with others . The drum is colorful , sturdy and well - made . It produces a nice sound . I highly recommend it for the music makers in your family .
5 #### My two year old granddaughter loves music and loves playing her bongo drum . It 's colorful , well - made and has a nice sound . I highly recommend it for young music makers .
5 #### Perfect for our musical grand twins . When they become famous they will endorse these .
5 #### Our grand twins love this ! We also bought the bongos . I personally thought the mallets were too long , but only because the children are young . I put them away for another time and had custom made sticks by Bluehausmallets on etsy . Now I feel better . Very nicely made and good tones !
5 #### Got this for my little one . She loved it . It was madee well . No problems . Had it now for 4 + years . Still holding on strong
5 #### This is the best most amazing toy ever great for 0 - 100 years old -- I 'd give it more stars if I could because it is one of the bests things I have ever bought . The top is extremely durable and even withstands a baby crawling and sitting on it . Great sound and just an all around fun time for a kid to play by herself , with other kids or with adults .
5 #### Sweet sound , but beware of a 9 month old crawling on top of it .
5 #### Bought this for my older child then she was about 1 . She 's now 4 and still loves it . It 's been a soup pot for pretend play almost as often as it 's been a drum . It also stores most of her other instruments when not in use . Today I introduced it to my 5 - month old and it captured his attention for 30 minutes straight . He only stop out of sheer exhaustion to get some sleep .
5 #### I have very small hands , and juggling other things is very difficult . These balls are small , bean - filled and constructed pretty well for cheapo juggling balls . They come with a little bag thingy for carrying them and instructions for how to juggle . The instructions are't very good , but the balls are decent . Would buy again .
5 #### My husband loves this balls . He says that they a the perfect weight and zise . We had many hours of fun . They are well made . I recomend this product .
5 #### Great drum for the $ $ Enjoy several Remo Kids instruments !
5 #### excellent quality , well made drum , great sound , great drumsticks .
5 #### Beginner jugglers will not go wrong with these ! Perfect for just learning how . I would suggest looking up tutorials on youtube instead of reading the instructions that come with it , though .
5 #### Sturdy and sounds great . Overpriced but good quality and size .
4 #### This is a great kit for casting a dinosaur skeleton . It is easy to mix , and comes out of the mold looking great . It is somewhat difficult to pour , so I would advise using a large spoon to fill the small openings . Please be advised this is not a complete skeleton , just one side . The price on Amazon was very reasonable ; even better than the crafts stores with their discount coupon .
5 #### I got this for my dino crazy 5 yr old and we have been very pleased with it . I highly recommend this toy .. Basically you cast the plaster of paris when it is set you paint it glue magnet on the back to make it kind of a puzzle . what is interesting is that the box comes with information about the bones ..... and that is an added value in itself .
4 #### I bought this for my 4 year old because he loves dinosaures ....... the directions were quite easy and there was just enough of the plaster mixture to make one complete set of bones . I think that the impressions are very sophisticated and the mold itself is high quality . For dino lovers , there so many other things you can do with these molds ( make chocolate , play - doh) ..... but we love it for it 's intended use : Making them into magnets . It 's a great little project you can do over and over again ........ The paint pots that come with it are adequate and a separate gloss medium is a very thoughtful item to put into this kit . The little booklet of dino info is simple but also just as adequate . I bought this kid for around [ ...... ] and i think it was well worth it .
5 #### Great sound , quality , and ease of use ( 11 month , 2 and 7 year olds all enjoy ) ! Definitely a terrific product for kids ( or adults ) of all ages ! !
5 #### My son , and his dad ( OK , and me , too ! ) love this . This drum is extremely well made . My son has sat on it , stood on it , tried to sit inside it , beat on it hard , dropped it , and worn it as a hat . The skin is still tight and it works as well now as it did the day we got it . It was bought as his birthday present in June and it gets used nearly on a daily basis .
5 #### Juggling was never a very easy activity to learn . In fact only a few times have I managed to throw the balls in the air and catch them 5 or 6 times , and I 'm pretty darn confident that a considerable amount of luck was involved in these cases ! However , in my experience children actually DO like to learn to juggle . It 's one of those activities that 's fun for a little while but requires so much patience and determination to actually master that most people give up ( such as myself ) . Still , juggling is fun for a little while and besides , these balls can be used to throw across the room / yard and even play a game of catch with your dog so it 's not all bad ! At least they 're very cheap to buy .
5 #### Awesome product . My son loves it . I seriously thought this was like a real instrument . It does not look , feel , or sound like a toy . It 's so well made . This will last forever and he 's having a blast playing with it .
5 #### My nephen love Noise these days . so he can stop playing with it
5 #### Starting with 7 cards , all you need to do is discard them one at a time by matching the color or number of the last card played . Sound easy ? Well , do n't forget the Skip , Reverse and Draw Two cards . Not to mention your opponent can play a Wild or Wild Draw Four at any time and change the color on you . And do n't forget to say " Uno " before you play your next to the last card or you 'll be drawing more . Needless to say , your fortunes can change instantly in this game . I 've played this game with my family for years , and we all still love it . Every game is completely different , so anyone has a chance of winning no matter their skill level . You can keep score and play to a certain point total , but my family usually just plays rounds . This allows you to play for a few minutes or as long as you like . This particular version features all the cards and original rules . In addition , they selected the best " House Rules " sent in by players to add some variety to the game . Personally , I 've played several different wild variations , and they 're all as much fun as the original . Small and easy to carry with you , you can play it anywhere there 's enough room for two decks of cards side by side . This is a game the entire family can enjoy at home or on the go .
5 #### Now , if you have yet to play this game , you will soon find out the sweet sound of the word " Wild Card . " Just when the other players least expect it , you change the whole game around . I can still get into this game with my nieces who love to make up lots of different games with the cards . Of course I let them beat me , I am not that mean ! This game always makes us laugh . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### I like juggling my new balls . They are balanced in weigh and durable . The price was right and they are a good product .
5 #### The name does it justice . Everytime one person plays this in my house everyone else gathers . Fun for toddlers
5 #### Cat 's pajama ! My 4 year old received this for Christmas and loves it . Still plays with it off and on without prompting . Uses hands and the mallets that came with it . Solid construction as you would expect from the drum maker Remo . Good solid product .
5 #### My husband wanted some juggling balls and these did the trick .... based on the reviews I bought these and it 's a good thing . He says they are perfectly weighted and have the right feel . He was juggling in seconds .... great set ! ! ! Thanks ! You ca n't miss with this 3 - pack of juggling balls !
4 #### I have n't been juggling for long , and most of my juggling experience is contact juggling , but these balls are suitable for a beginner . The size is decent , the build quality is n't TOO terrible , the main problem is consistency . The fillings can vary pretty greatly , and so can the shapes . This should n't be too much of an issue for beginners doing simple cascades , showers , etc , but once you get into more complicated tricks it can be an issue . I ordered 2 sets and I ended up getting 3 that are perfectly even , still cheaper than a single high quality beanball .
5 #### I bought this for my 1 year old for Christmas and he loves it ! ! ! It is made very well and has a great tone too ! ! !
5 #### I bought my 20 year old one of these drums when he was three . It 's lasted , unscathed , through my son , my other kids , nephews , neighbors , etc ... So when it came to searching for a gift for my current three year old I was excited to find Remo still made these . I bought him this massive 22 " version to go along with the smaller drum I bought my older son . This thing is amazing ! So much BOOM and the kids love it . It 's constructed just as solidly as the twenty - year old drum , maybe even improved . I would recommend these drums to anyone .
5 #### I was hesitant on buying her just because I did n't think I would like her , but I took a chance and I am very happy that I did . I love the mini doll she comes with of the original Barbie . The outfit is beautiful as a new updated from the bathing suit and the flowers look so real ! I am very happy with this purchase and a must own for any Barbie collector !
5 #### A beautiful Barbie for her 40th Tribute Year . She was released over 10 years ago but still has a current as well as nostalgic quality . Loved the use of her striped bathing suit in the gown and as a collector piece - love the quality and look and packaging . Great seller as well ! ;)
4 #### An elegant barbie doll for collectors . The bouquet of roses are very pretty and not made of plastic . All beautiful dolls should be in a box like this , simple , not much writing to distract , and the whole front is a clear window . You can display the doll well without the need to remove it from the box .
5 #### Created in 1906 as an alternative " card " game for those who believed that regular cards were sinful and of the devil , Rook is a game that people of all ages will enjoy playing . My family has played Rook since I was a very young child and I 've never gotten tired of playing the game . I 've enjoyed playing the game with my grandparents , aunts , and uncles as well as college students . There are several different styles of game play , depending on the number of people you have ( 2 - 6 ) and depending on how challenging you want the game to be . Rook is a great game for families to play and I recommend it to anyone looking for something a little bit different from the norm .
5 #### Perfect gift for our 2.5 year old son who drums on everything ! Our 4 year old daughter also enjoys playing with the drum . It is good quality and has a nice noise to it
5 #### Well made drum . Sounds great and a good size
5 #### Great quality Real instrument ! I m sure my 2 and a half yr old grandson will use it more as he ages . Holds up to standing on , etc . Beautiful colors and instrument .
3 #### Hi folks This is a cool drum My son is three and has loved it for about 6months now Sadly the top is starting the crack Also parents take the black cover tip off the bottom of the stick or it can become a choking hazard .
5 #### My 15 month old Grandson love this drum . He can walk by it without playing a few bars
5 #### Bought this after my daughter participated in a group music class that uses it to get the kids together . Makes great sound . She enjoys it and now is asking for bongos .
5 #### This is awesome . The drum 's tone is deep and nice . I bought my sone this lousy plastic drum from toys are us , and it was more expensive and sounds awful . This is a worthwhile purchase .
5 #### My 18 m Grandson loves it . He bangs it very hard , throws , sits and stands on it . Very sturdy . Sounds good . More than a toy drum . Would highly recommend .
2 #### Cards get sticky and unplayable after just a dozen games !
5 #### Rook cards are getting a bit hard to find these days . Bought this deck for my father for Christmas so he could retire one of his older , worn out decks . Cards are great quality and have already provided some fun family game nights .
5 #### The Cards feel like other rook cards when you first pick them up but they hold their shuffle ability much longer . We have a large family that loves to play different card games with rook cards gathering several times a week to play . These have become a favorite ! ! ! !
3 #### My kids find this hard to play with . The directions or ideas are very poor . There are many sizes and not all of them fit together , so the toy can be very frustrating . My girls are 5 and 6 and plenty old enough to be able to figure this out , but even I found it to be challenging to get something large together that actually worked . I would nt recommend this one .
3 #### Did n't hold my 6 year old sons attention for long .
4 #### Some of the pieces broke within the first few uses , but kids still love it
3 #### too small for baby to hit , does best with large one
4 #### My 5 year son has played with this for hours . He loves building with it . I wish his tall towers were more stable and when he spins the gears quickly that it were a bit more quiet , but other than that I think it 's fantastic and especially love toys that make kids think and use their imagination like this one does .
3 #### Gears are fine . Some of the accessories are terrible . The springs are impossible for a small child to push in ( plus the kids snap them and break them when trying to get them in or out ) , the little red pieces are useless and just annoy the kids . The swirls are stickers you place on the gears turning them into ends and can not connect to anything without ripping the stickers . Overall get the other gear set for more value and interest for the kids .
5 #### We love these gears ! They make a great expansion to our original set .
3 #### This got about two uses out of my kids , who are 6 and 8 . The spring does n't quite work as pictured . It just tends to pull gears off their base . It 's a clever idea , but just did n't seem to captivate the attention as you 'd hope
3 #### Great set . However , I wish that it gave examples of using the parts . It leaves it totally up to the imagination , which is great . But some examples would still be nice .
2 #### My 6 year old would n't even open the box . She read the description and handed it back to me stating it was for babies . She was n't in the least interested . STEM club needs more challenging products age appropriate for kids .
5 #### Fun , almost all ages can play . We 've worn out sever decks throughout the years
3 #### Cards are too small for us old folks . But it is a standard Uno game .
5 #### My son loved playing with this drum at a music class . So I purchased as a birthday gift . He loves it !
5 #### I really love the sound , I play it with my son along , we both enjoy it .
5 #### The skin on the top of this drum is very comparable to an adult drum head ! I was very impressed ! We 've had it for over 8 months now and it 's still in perfect shape ! The sound is loud and crisp !
5 #### Very nice quality for a plastic drum . Nice deep sound . Mallets are perfect for my four year old . For some reason he keeps walking around the house with it while saying he does n't want to work . Then he just bangs on this thing all day .
4 #### We are loving the selection that comes with the stem club . This one has been her favourite yet . The lo has been playing with this set since it came in yesterday . She also ended up breaking a part , but that s ok , as we 'll try to glue it back . The plastic is sturdy , but sometimes can snap when too much pressure is applied . Ine broken oart is no biggie as she loves the set . However we unsubscribed to the club because a new toy every month is overwhelming her . She is practically drowning in her toys . Will start the subscription again in a few months . Super recommend .
5 #### A little tough for a 5 year old , and even a 55 year old , but still good for problem solving .
5 #### These gears are really cool . Not difficult to for my 5 year old boys to do . We bought two different sets and were able to combine all of the parts . I had fun playing with this while " helping " . It 's a unique and fun toy .
5 #### We have really enjoyed this drum ! Both of my children have been rough and thrown this thing around and used both the mallets and other items to make noise- it has stood the test of wild children time and time again . It was well worth the price as long as you do n't mind a drum in your house !
5 #### Hours of fun for my grandchildren . We have purchased a few sets and add on sets . It has been fun for me seeing the cousins all building something together .
5 #### All of my grandchildren , ages 3 thru 14 all love playing with this toy .
5 #### This was a gift for a small child ( 5 years ) . The pieces are sturdy and allow for many combinations . He seems intrigued and I think it will last him a long time . This set is also compatible with other Gizmos and Gears sets . Overall a cheaper option to Lego that stimulates young minds .
4 #### Nice substantial toy for the price . However , its a Christmas present - so it has not been opened or played with yet .
5 #### These gears are exactly what I was looking for . I am trying to teach my daughter about how things work and these gears are a good aid for that . They are your typical plastic gears with other attachment that will spin when attached to a moving gear . This set is very good for beginners and it is a good starter set .
1 #### In general , the Gears line is a great STEM toy , but this is a poor set . There are very few pieces in this set by comparison to others . The springs are fun , but hard for little hands to remove or move . My son always asks for help with them . The propeller was the one great piece in this set except it was broken on arrival . Customer service was poor . They promised to find a replacement propeller but never never called back . Hubby fixed it with a fiberglass kit . Would like to recommend the set as it has some fun unique pieces like springs , a variety of gear sizes and bases , a crank , and the propeller , plus the colorful stickers are fun . I do NOT recommend it as a first set as there are better sets for the price , easy of use , and durability . Update : The stickers have peeled off , so I 'm dropping another star . Definitely find a different gears kit . +1 Multiple Gears sizes -1 Broken propeller -1 Poor Customer service -1 Poor value -1 Hard to move springs -1 Peeling stickers : jk
5 #### We have this for our twins , they LOVED IT ! Now that other family members are having babies this item is a staple in my gift giving . It 's fun , safe and helps develope a love for music while aiding in hand eye cooridnation .
5 #### We have had these dolphins for years . My two year old LOVES them . If the note is n't sounding clear you can blow all the water out of the dolphin and then it is clear . It 's true that they do n't link together very well , but we do n't do that very much . One thing I should share : do n't boil them ! I boiled mine to clean them and now they look cracked and faded .
5 #### My daughter is nearly 11 now and she absolutely LOVES building with these things ! It keeps her occupied for hours ( no easy feat ) and she has to use her imagination to make her creations , which as a mom I like , especially in this age of technology . I would most definitely recommend this product ! I would love to buy the bigger , more expensive set , but they are pricy ( but they ARE worth the money ) . I teach preschool and my preschoolers enjoy this as much as my 11 - year - old and her same - age friends do . They come in a very handy container bucket with a lid for easy storage when not using them .
5 #### Four - year - old grandson Dax takes out his Gizmos ( and his Gears , Gears , Gears ) as soon as he gets to my house . He 's developing construction skills in his creations , and we have fun making things together . The parts from both sets fit together .
5 #### My son loves these toys . His teacher had them in their class room and he came home asking for them . He built several cars with it . They are great .
5 #### These are wonderful . We have this set plus another set that can be added together . Our 6 year old grandson loves these . He will play for hours Building all kinds of things . We have these at our house now we are going to get him some for Christmas for his house . He can follow the instructions and build certain things or he can let his imagination run wild . Brings out the creative juices . He is an only child so we try to find things that one person can play . That can be difficult . But this is a real winner
5 #### great and easy to learn for hours of fun
5 #### I bought these for my nephew ( 3 1/2 years ) to add to the basic Gears Gears Gears set I bought him last year . My son had these when he was younger and used them for years - they really grew with him and the adults that played with the Gears with my son , and now my nephew , equally enjoyed playing with them . It is a great open - ended toy and they hold up really well . I highly recommend this to everyone - both boys and girls - for play over many years from at least 3 years to 12 years for the motorized kits and such .
4 #### Grand - children and son in law really enjoy this set plus the basic one . Putting a non slip plastic " drawer liner " under the base pieces helped a lot !
5 #### Colorful and fun . We purchased this to add to Gears , Gears , Gears !
5 #### Even though it 's abit advanced for 3.5 yr olds , , he loves it ! He has older sisters to help figure out all the Gizmos !
5 #### This is a fantastic drum and it happens to be a great price as well . It 's a good size and has a cute design . The drum has a really good sound to it . I 've been really impressed with its durability because my son has really put it to the test . He 's sat on it and in it without damaging it at all ! He 's pounded a good beat on it and it 's just great . This is a very well made drum and more than worth the price .
5 #### I LOVE this drum ! It has an awesome sound . Deep and powerful . I use it for my Let 's Play Music class in my home . My own kids love it . I was n't sure how much abuse this drum can take , but when I was shocked to see my toddler stand on it and other times go crazy beating it it 's been fine . Seems like it will hold up for a long time because of the great quality .
5 #### I can see what all the great reviews were about . Great sound and beautiful picture of Amazon animals ( frog , snake , monkey ) . Comes with 2 Drum sticks . My 11 month old plays the drum everyday . I 'm so happy with this drum . Thank you ! ! !
5 #### This drum has a very rich , pleasing sound and seems very durable . I think I enjoy playing it even more than my toddler does !
1 #### There is a reason most of these reviews are one star this toy does n't even deserve 1 star all I can say is loved the ideal , did n't love the toy please save your money and PASS
5 #### The version I got came with 3 blank cards that you can write your own rules on . Super fun addition to the game .
4 #### Sure for an adult we can pick apart that the dolphins do n't link together easily and their musical notes are n't very reliable but I have a 2 year old that absolutely LOVES this toy . She screamed her head off last night when I had to finally pull her out of the tub . Stop being so critical over a effing bath toy .
1 #### We were looking forward to this but it just does not deliver . The dolphins do n't make sound reliably and the darn rings will not stay hooked together . It is going into the Christmas return pile if I can find the box among the recyclables .
1 #### I actually found these at home goods for [ ... ] ... well I am glad I did not pay more than [ ... ] ... First off the colors of the dolphins were all messed up .. they did n't match their tubes ... When I mean they did n't match ... they put in whacky colors like red / orange colored dolphin but a yellow tube ( no yellow dolphin ) then we got two of the same colored dolphins . Okay .. so the colors were n't a huge deal I suppose but then the dolphins would n't whistle ... that 's totally useless ... and as someone else mentioned the links do n't stay linked . HUGE disappointment !
4 #### My grandson is a builder and the whirlly - gigs add to the base set . Encourages him to think and break away from the video games .
5 #### Kids love this , although my wife and I spent hours playing around with it , too . Would definitely recommend for 4yrs and up . My two year old loves to mess around with it , but my 4yr old can put it together and make things with the pieces .
5 #### My students had a lot of fun playing with this gear set . The gears are made very well .
2 #### We bought the cards less then 3 months ago and they are falling apart . They are very flimsy not sturdy at all .
5 #### Love the game of Rook and this is perfect ! Has the cutest tiny little pad to write points on too !
5 #### Such a great drum , my daughter loves it ! It 's also not whiny as some drum sounds tend to be . Very good quality too . My daughter has dropped this a few times and it has held up just fine .
5 #### What a great sound this has ! So happy with this purchase .... well worth the money . My oldest son has autism and just loves music and sounds . I wanted to add a deep bass sound to his xylophone and bell toys , and this definitely fits the bill . My other kids ( 11y and 4y ) love it too .
5 #### Our kids 10 months and 21 months enjoy playing with this on almost a daily basis .
1 #### Fun game but this set is terrible quality ! Cards are thin and some of ours were not printed on so we do n't know which cards they are suppose to be and what we are missing . The directions have a ton of spelling errors too .
1 #### I was disappointed in that the various rings do not hook together well at all . Half of the dolphins do not make more than the slightest squeek . For the cost of the toy , it was a huge letdown . Do n't bother with this one .
2 #### It takes up a lot of space , without being much fun . The rings break apart too easily , which frustrates the little kid . Plus , they do n't whistle easily ... also frustrating a little kid .
5 #### We got this for my son after seeing it featured in some Baby Einstein videos . He loves propellers and gears ... so it was pretty much perfect ! Highly recommend it for your little guy .
4 #### My daughter kept asking what gears do . This set worked very well in demonstrating the transmission of power and gear ratios . We mostly used it in 2d on the floor as the vertical options did not seem very straight forward for a three year old . I would buy this again . If you are looking for a complex gear set , look for one that has a nice modular design for the vertical gear configurations .
4 #### Complicated for my five year old to use alone but he loved them . There were no pictures or anything to help him understand without an adult how to use them .
5 #### This got a rave review from the birthday boy . His little sister was able to add a few pieces and they played together very well .
5 #### We have two young children ( 4 and 7 ) in the house and the parents are both engineers so we thought this would be a fun game to teach how gears work . It is a good building set and the kids spend hours playing with it and the adults enjoy it too . Once you get the gears set up right they are lovely to run . It delights the kids .
5 #### Very cool drum ! It is a really instrument and has a nice sound .
5 #### This drum is perfect for all ages . We bought it for our 1 yr old and she loves " drum time " . The quality is great and I 'm sure she will be able to play with it for years to come . Ca n't wait to get the whole line !
5 #### I bought this toy for my son when he was two . I can not stress how much he LOVES these dolphins . He has played with them every bath time for the past 5 and a half years . The dolphins have taken quite a beating and are still going strong . Not only have they been a constant bath time toy , but they have been thrown around the backyard , driven around in dump trucks , buried in the sand box , still fine . We have a new baby and I will definitely buy him his own set . I want to mention that when I bought these I was a little disappointed that they did n't make a symphony in the tub besides the occasional squeak but all the enjoyment my son has had throughout the years makes up for that . Why do I need something else around here that makes noise ? We have never had a problem with the rings linking together , ours always have . Super toy !
3 #### Received this for my 1 - yr - old and he still plays with it sometimes - he is now 3 . It is really hard to get it to play music how it is intended to be played with . It is also way too big - I hate drying out all of the peices all the time when my son is done with it in the bath . He likes to play with the dolphins individually and just pretends with them instead of using it as it as advertised . It has poor musical ability ... Buy something more fun with your money !
5 #### I bought this for my daughter , new in the package at our local Goodwill , for $ 7.99 , no tax . Its just a simple , colorful water toy . I filled a pasta pot 1/3 way with H20 and she has so much fun with it . She does n't " get " the musical part , which is that the dolphins are hollow and have a whistle inside ... when their head is tapped ( they have to be floating in the life preserver ring ) they make a short , pleasant little whistle . Eventually she 'll figure that part out ... she 's 2 1/2 now -I'm actually kind of glad that they do n't make too much noise , those musical toys drive my husband and I up the wall sometimes . I 'm in no rush . This takes no batteries , is colorful and fun . If they fill up with water , they get emptied in seconds , it 's not like they have to be completely shaken out . She likes to dunk them all the way down and then empty them out . So who cares if they are n't used the way they 're " supposed " to be , she likes them for what they are . And for most kids , the box is more exciting than the toy inside , so I 'm happy this has proved that wrong . I gave it high educational value marks because she likes the colors and matching . The rings on mine do n't latch together , which is mis - represented , but again , I do n't care about that either . For the price I paid , I already got my money 's worth .
5 #### I bought this toy for use in a summer hands - on traveling science museum . It has proved to be very durable and was well worth my investment . I purchased two sets for the exhibit , which allowed more than one child to play at one time . Besides being well - made , the designer put thought into the extra gizmos so that the junior engineers could find a wide variety of ways to distribute the motion of the gears . There was one little tiny part that we could n't figure out the function for , but that did not detract at all from the overall use of the product .
5 #### Gizmos and Gears delighted my 5 year old granddaughter . She has all but constructed a new machine for spinning yarn into gold . She loves it and her inventiveness and creative juices are surpassing my highest expectations . The brighter the child , the more appeal . She turned 5 in July , and will enter 1st grade in August . So parents who are thinking about purchasing this toy , by all means get it ! It will keep your children entertained for hours without supervision . It is better than advertised !
5 #### My 5 year old son has advanced rapidly in just two days of playing with this . He is describing and building complicated gear layouts that incorporate gears of different sizes and gears at different angles to one another . Very nice ! My main complaint is that the set should include more pieces . I can not see more than two kids playing with the contents of this set , and even then I think there would be some fighting for scarce pieces . PROS * Durable pieces * Well - designed pieces connect well and allow for excellent spinning action of the gears * The type of toy that kids will play with for hours on end and go back to again and again CONS * Not enough pieces for the price ; you can get hundreds of lego bricks for the same price * What do the gears * move * ? There is only one propeller included and no wheels or other items that gears might control . Instead , we just tend to move more gears , which is fine for a 5 year old but not for an 8 year old PURCHASING RECOMMENDATION This is fun and very educational . I will buy the additional sets and give this one as a gift to other kids . I do wish they put more pieces in it , but it still is worth buying .
5 #### We have the original Gears ! Set and love it . This is an add on that you can use to make bigger , better , more exciting things . This inspires creativity , fun and imagination . It is more than a push the button type of toy to make some annoying noise . This encourages exploration of the world around you and more . My husband and father ( both engineers ) love this toy and have a ball getting down on the floor playing with my son while he tries to put new contraptions together . This addition only makes it more fun . If you are like and look for toys that inspire imagination , exploration , creativity . If you want toys that are not very loud and are easy to play with . If you want something that the whole family can enjoy . If you want a toy that is more than a push the button type of toy , this is the toy you might want . My only complaint of sorts ? I wish that there were books available for each add on set that is available similar to the book you can buy for the original Gears ! set . And maybe there are books out there , but I have n't found them . Enjoy .
5 #### Kids love this product . It 's excellent quality for price . A real drum .
5 #### Great drum for the whole family . Looks great . Sounds great .
4 #### We bought this for our son because he really likes music and he love to play it and it is decorated colorfully .
5 #### Great family game ! I had Uno as a kid but I had n't played it in years . We went away for our summer vacation and everyone had to bring a game to play . Everyone night this was one of the first games that everyone wanted to play !
5 #### My 2 year old grandson loved it and started playing it as soon as it came out of the box . I bought one for another grandaughter 2 years ago and it is still okay despite the fact that she used it as a stool for reaching things on the counter ...... Apparently , this drum is tough . I would definitely recommend it .
5 #### This is an awesome drum ! I bought it for my 1 year old grandson . He loves pounding on things . His 3 year old brother plays with it too !
5 #### This is a high quality drum with a beautiful animal graphic . I am a private piano teacher and use this daily to teach rhythms in my piano studio . The drum produces a wonderful sound and the students love to tap out rhythms using the mallets . This was money well spent and I hope to add more Remo drums to my collection . My 2 and 3 year old even enjoy playing with this instrument .
5 #### bought for daughter for xmas . she loved it . very durable , sound is nice and should last a long time . I would recommend this product
5 #### Very nicely made , sturdy and cute drums with good sound .
5 #### I prefer Rook cards to face cards , so I 'm always looking for a different back to Rook cards . Our family also loves to play Rook . Great game ! If you want to play with 6 people , order 2 decks !
4 #### I do n't understand the negative reviews about this product . I have ordered three copies of this game and have had each copy come in perfect condition . The cards are sturdy and I have no problem reading them and feel all of the colors are appropriate and easy to see . None of my cards were printed upside down and the cards feel like typical cards , if not slightly better than normal . The cards have a smooth finish . If you are a fan of the game Rook , or any of the fun games that exist that require a Rook deck to play , I would not hesitate purchasing this deck . It is a reasonable deal , includes a card tray , and also includes a booklet and score pad .
1 #### These dolphins are fun to blow through with your mouth , but they work POORLY in the water . They work better when the water has been drained out of them before placing them in their innertubes in the water . But seeing as they are water toys , it does n't make much sense to do ! My boys were 2 and 5 when we got them as a gift . They are now 4 and 7 and still do n't like them . I just gave them to Goodwill .
3 #### These cards are soooo very thin ! The game , of course , is awesome but the quality of the cards sucks . I thought they would be similar to playing cards with a similar finish . Too bad . Otherwise would have given them a 5 star review . The seller was outstanding . Very quick shipping .
5 #### My grandchildren love this game , and had worn out the old deck , so this was a great hit !
1 #### Ordered these thinking they were the genuine article , but they were clearly fakes . Multiple spelling errors in the directions . Cards were very poor quality ( faded colors , random dots on the back , etc ) . Contacted Amazon since I purchased them using Amazon Prime and was promptly issued a refund . I used that money and went to Walmart and bought the real thing for $ 1.50 less than I spent on these crappy cards .
2 #### did n't stay linked in a ring , difficult to keep the appropriate amt of water in them to make them whistle . We tossed them .
5 #### Great toy , my son loves it , perfect size and sound .
2 #### This toy is supposed to be for babies and toddlers and yet it does n't have any of the features one would expect in a young child 's toy . One would expect color , ease of use , softness , and purpose . The only qualification that the Water Symphony Tub matches is that the dolphins and the rings are colorful . Which brings me to the question of who on earth thought that making the rings so hard to connect was a good idea . As a mom , I usually have other chores at bath time other than ring rangler . And then there is the hardness factor . The dashboard of my car is softer . A little more built - in teething satisfaction would have been nice . Two stars . The dolphins do make noise but not often enough . They are hard enough that a baby can hurt their gums on them , or * you * or a sibling if they are thrown . One plus is that they do n't seem to mildew .
2 #### We got these for our daughter becasue she loves bath time and playing her toy piano . We figured this would be a cute toy that she would enjoy but we were wrong . You have to beat the poor dolphins to get them to play a note . And the note is more of an electronic sound ... it 's hard to describe it but it 's NOT a musical note ! And it never fails after fianlly beating the things enough to get a sound out of them the ring comes loose . It 's just a total pain to use . Granted she still plays with them in the tub just we could have bought a cheap bag of plastic dolphins at the aquarium and saves 3/4 of the money we spent on this set .
5 #### Like Rush Hour , Railroad Rush Hour has you " escaping " the traffic jam ... this time in the railroad yard , where the traffic can include rail cars and cargo . Rearrange the pieces to get the engine out . 40 challanges included ; nylon bag stores pieces when not in use . Larger than Rush Hour pieces makes this puzzle easier to handle for eager young solvers . And with the new pieces , the challanges are all new and different , even for Rush Hour lovers !
5 #### This drum is amazing . Very sturdy with well made mallets and a beautiful sound . Such a welcome change from the usual " kids " toys . I would definitely recommend this for any child with an interest in music . My 2 year old loves it and based on it 's great construction , i 'm sure it will be used for many years to come !
5 #### Great drum - was a hit as soon as it was unwrapped . Good quality - it 's loud ! My son loves the mallets but it can also be used on the stick end if you switch them around .
5 #### Perfect floor drum not all cheap like most you find at the stores
5 #### Very high quality drum . I bought this for my 3 yr . old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it . My grandson ( same age ) had a great time with it also , so I purchased a second one for him . This is by no means a cheap drum . Everything about it shows the quality and durability . I would highly recommend to anyone .
2 #### I was excited about the idea of a little toy for my 19 - month old that made music in the tub . From the description of the toy , you 'd think that 's what this was . First of all , tapping the dolphins on the head makes either a ridiculous whistling noise that can barely be called a note , if it works at all . Most of the time , they do n't really work at all . And , as stated in other reviews , the ring does NOT stay together in the tub , making it hard to keep track of them and play any kind of " song " whatsoever . That being said , it 's a cute toy if you 're just looking for a brightly colored , floating tub toy , and for that purpose , my daughter likes it . Just do n't expect it to be much else .
1 #### I was very disappointed with this toy . When it was put in the tub the dolphins do not make sounds like they are suppose to . The floats do not stay together and this makes my 20 mos . old very upset . They look good and are cute but not worth the money . Would not recommend .
1 #### This is obviously a fake . The cards are not made of card material and it is impossible to shuffle them . The edges of the cards are brittle and breaking right out of the package ! Awful ! ! ! Do not purchase .
5 #### Love this drum ! Quality construction and so darn cute .
5 #### My 1.5yr old son and I love this drum ! Great sound ! Comes with good sticks . This is way better than any little kid 's toy drum or music set . I 'm super happy with my purchase . Well worth the $ 33 and will last a long time !
5 #### My son 's preschool music teacher has a larger size of this drum and he loves it . We bought him this one for Christmas and he enjoys it just as much as the one in music class ! My 6 year old enjoys playing it too ! It comes with two drum sticks and is a wonderful , quality item .
5 #### I bought this game for my 7 year old who loves trains and thrives on puzzle solving . He quickly whipped through the jr . and beginner levels . The Intermediate has been challenging and I love to watch him concentrate and work his way through each card . My 5 year old daughter can do the jr . cards as well and when they are n't playing the correct way they are making up their own games with the train pieces ! This game literally provides HOURS of fun . I 've done a few myself and ca n't wait to play again . The whole set is very sturdy and durable . This is definitely one of our favorite games now . I am extremely pleased with this purchase !
2 #### The original Rush Hour is still much more fun . The only reason I had to buy this is my son is such a train freak . The puzzles are not as challenging overall , yet the difficulty level is a bit uneven in the four categories ( junior , beginner , intermediate , advanced ) . Also , the build quality is poorer , as a few of the train pieces do n't sit properly on the board , and the colors on the train pieces do not match those printed on the puzzle cards , a sore point for a young boy .
5 #### My 3 year old grandson loves his Konga drum ... very well made .
5 #### This works great ! So great that at my 2 year olds birthday party ( when I gave it to my son ) a few parents were so impressed by the quality of it that they went on amazon with their phones and purchased one themselves !
5 #### Sturdy , attractive drum . Not terrribly loud . Not cheap , but worth the price . Two year old and 4 year old loved this drum . I will get another drum from this set for the next birthday .
5 #### This is great quality and the perfect drum for toddlers and older ! We used this in kindermusic and my almost two year old loves it ! She is getting it for Christmas morning tomorrow morning . I 've already tested it before wrapping and it is as expected ! :)
5 #### Such a fun game . Easy to play . Great for lots of different ages .
3 #### My kids ( 3.5 and 2 ) received this as a gift , and at first I was excited -- it 's cute and colorful . In theory , a great toy . However , my kids do n't like it . Water gets inside the dolphins and when this happens , they wo n't make noises ( easily remedied by shaking the water out of them , but my kids do n't have the patience for this ) . They also get very frustrated that the rings that the dolphins sit in do NOT stay linked together . Slight movements that disturb the water will cause the chain to come apart . I 'm sure that this would be a favorite bath toy with a few improvements made by the company .
5 #### My son got this for his 5th birthday and we all like to play . We take turns setting it up and figuring it out . I thought it might be too hard for him at first , but if you start at the very easiest level , even the young kids can figure them out . The 5 year old has n't gotten too far into the various puzzles , so he is still working on the easy ones , but he just glows each time he solves one ! Such a good feeling ! I sat alone with the game after the kids went to bed and worked my way halfway through the deck -- kinda addictive , but lots of fun if you like challenging the way your mind works .
5 #### Replaced our old deck , nice to have a new one .
5 #### Delivered on time . My 4 year old daughter loves this game .
4 #### Definitely a well made drum . However , is quite loud ... just prepare yourself . Still going after > 1 year of use ( 2yo and 4yo kids ) .
5 #### Good product , my son likes it . Should get one for your kid .
5 #### This is going to be a Christmas present . I know it will be perfect . Love the exterior pictures and the sound of the drum . The quality is excellent ; glad I chose this one .
5 #### Fantastic drum ! My 5 yr old and 2 yr olds love it ! ! It is louder than I thought . But it satisfies the need to drum and is a very reasonable price for a real drum .
3 #### I bought this used at a baby tag sale , so keep that in mind when reading my review . The dolphins are much bigger than it seems in the picture , each ring is 4 " or so across . The dolphins fascinate my daughter ( 1 year ) and she does enjoy the toy , but they barely make any noise ( keep in mind it is used ) and the rings will not stay attached to one another . Instead we just have the 8 dolphins floating around the tub . I think its well worth the $ 2 I paid , but I would not pay the retail price on this toy !
2 #### I swear by the reviews on Amazon.com , but unfortunately I did not read them before purchasing . Our 4th son just turned 1 , and celebrated his 2nd Christmas . I just bathed him and put the dolphins in with him .... believe what you read . The rings do not stay together and the dolphins really do n't sing ! ! If you tap the tops of the head , nothing happens ; if you lift the dolphin out of the water and slightly " smack " the water with it , it will make a noise . Quite frankly it works better if you blow into the dolphin . The baby got a kick out of the toy for a short time . Maybe I 'll keep it just because he can dunk the dolphins and toss them around . Also , this toy takes up lots of room ! ! I gave it 4 stars for durability since it does seem pretty sturdy .
5 #### It is a deck of Uno cards what can you say ?
5 #### Bought this for my 3 year old grandson . His mom said he wanted a drum for his birthday . I sent him this one and he 'd been pounding on it ever since
5 #### Excellent buy for my LO . It is very high quality and she loves singing along with it , generally having fun and raising a ruckus
4 #### I like that this drum does n't feel cheap . It is fun to play with and has a nice sound . I wish it sounded a little better when played by hand instead of with the drumstick . My one yet old loves this but sometimes her hand does n't make the noise she is hoping for .
5 #### Wonderful basic drum that reverberates beautifully . Love the colorful illustration and the mallets are just the right density for a nice sound . This is a daily - use instrument in our house and I anticipate it being around for years . Highly recommend !
5 #### Chinese checkers is a fun way to teach strategy to kids . This tin version is quite durable . Please note : the marbles that come with this version are SMALL : less than half the size of a regular marble . So if you want regular sized marbles , go with the wooden versions that Amazon sells . And if you do n't want the marbles falling off check out the version that uses pegs .
4 #### I see that a few people complained that these dolphins do n't work the way they planned . That may be so but my kids ( 3 and 5 ) LOVE them ! They make up their own things to do with them and even make sure to pack a couple when we go on trips . They use them for pouring experiments and the love to match the colors together . The whistles , really , have n't gotten much use in the five years we 've had them but both kids do know how to drain the water out of them if they want them to whistle . They are a must - have in our house and I am buying some for our new nephew born yesterday . All other have come and gone . But the dolphins are still here - which is testimony enough for me .
5 #### This drum was such a great buy ! My girls still love to play with it . I also bought one for my niece for her 1st birthday . I think it makes a really nice gift . It is made extremely well and is a high quality product . If you are looking for an instrument to last w/ your kids , this is it . And it 's large enough that a little baby can sit on top of it and feel the drumming vibrations .
5 #### Our 2 year old loves to bang away on this drum . It can be a bit noisy in the house but it gives him a few good minutes of entertainment every day .
5 #### My infant son loves this drum ! He has a great time with the drumsticks and also turns it over to make it a bucket for storage . Endless hours of fun . Highly recommend for the baby / toddler who loves to bang everything !
5 #### Been a fan of this game for years and when my granddaughter was old enough passed on the fun !
5 #### This is great drum for children . I have had these drums in the classroom for many years and they produce a good sound and last for a long time .
4 #### Nice looking drum with a rich vibrant sound . It is almost too loud .
5 #### This is the first toy my 2 year old selected on her own . Its appeal was lost on me : dolphins whistle when blown from their back end ( yes , strange ) and float on water in rings . But to my daughter , they 're colorful , friendly and whistle various notes as submerged . Take these at face value and enjoy your child 's enjoyment .
5 #### Uno is the grandkid 's favorite card game . When they lost their deck , I ordered this as a replacement . They were thrilled and recruited me as a player . I 'm hooked . It 's a great game .
5 #### My daughter got this today for her first birthday and played with it for at least 20 minutes straight ( as I figured she would since she loves banging on things ) . Definitely a new favorite in our house ! Maybe she 'll be a drummer :)
4 #### Cute and fun game , but it 's hard to keep the marbles from rolling out of their slots . I do like the old - fashioned look of the tin playing board . Not a car game . Keep it at home .
5 #### I bought this drum 5 years ago for my grandson . He loved it -- great sound , colors , and quality ! Now my 8 month old grandson discovered it and loves it too ! Honestly , you ca n't go wrong purchasing this drum .
5 #### Ordered this for my 2 year old niece and my 8 month old son to play with at their grandma 's . We are teaching them music awareness and this works out great . The drum mallets bounce very well and are n't very hard so kid friendly if they accidentally hit one another . The sound is n't as high quality as my more expensive drums that I have for my personal use , but it is great for a kid 's drum ! So not like those fake drums that hardly give a sound ( no matter how you bang them ) . I 've gotten too many of those in the past that kids hate hoping for a good one . However , this one ended up perfect . My niece loved it and was mad when music time was over . I do n't think I 've seen her sit down in one spot for that long in a while ! lol .
5 #### My son is deaf . He extremely loves this drum where he could feel the vibration perfectly . He would bang it loud and laugh along it . He s obsessed with this . I am glad we got this for his joy in feeling music since hearing is not his best source but able to feel them very well .
5 #### I had a set just like this as a kit and was thrilled to find it again . My board had long since bitten the dust and it was nice to play chinese checkers again . Great strategy game . The marbles were plastic but still worked . I 'd buy it again .
5 #### I love this drum . I bought it for my 2 + y / o grandson for Christmas , and more important he loved it too . He played it with such authority and attitude . It really was a delight to watch him give us a little concert . It is a nice size , well made and with the padded mallets make a wonderful sound .
5 #### My kids love it so much we are getting another .
5 #### Love the beat and quality/ colors My baby got it on his 1st birthday , last year , and now that he 's almost 2 years , he 's begun to appreciate it- oh such sweet sounds - he 's getting the rhythm !
5 #### His Humvee is already put together . The doors open and the gun on top swivels . There was nothing to do but use our imagination and play . It does n't make noise . It does n't take batteries . There is no remote control . It is just a play Humvee . So kids get to use their imagination and make their own noises . My grandson loves it !
5 #### Nice car , very good details , design and also cheap ... my boy loved from the beginning and asked for more similar military cars ...
5 #### I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop . Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you .
5 #### I just love the card game uno I had it when I was younger and now that my kids know colors and numbers I thought I would get it to play with them . They loved it we played 3 rounds . They wanted to play more but the pizza guy came . Then my nephew ( who is a baby and apparently sick ) got dropped off . So we could n't play any more but I promised them we would play tomorrow .
1 #### Although they arrived before their time , That seems to be the only thing I liked . All of the game instructions are in Chinese , that wo n't help me out as I only read English ..... What a scam ....... what a joke , the garbage can is a good place to store them . The cards do n't even look like what is on the box . I guess I should have read the reviews but I figured WHAT COULD GO WRONG WITH A UNO DECK ! !
5 #### Fantastic quality , great sounds ! This is a fun instrument to introduce to a young toddler or older child , and it 's always fun to beat on a drum , never gets old !
5 #### Love this drum , although it is much bigger than I anticipated . Kids can climb on it and it does n't break . We like that many kids can play it at the samem time too .
5 #### My 14 - month - old loves this drum . It is the same one they have in his music class and he bangs on it with and without the drumsticks . His dad loves it too , maybe even more than my son . It is a large drum and makes great booming sounds . I only just gave the drumsticks to my son as he was chewing on the end at first and I was concerned the covers on the handle end would come off . Just be aware and watch your little ones closely while using it .
5 #### very well made , sounds great , my sons loves it !
4 #### High quality and really fun . Highly recommend . Good tone and durable too !
5 #### Got this for our one year old & he loves it ! Very sturdy- has survived a lot of abuse with no damage or loss of tautness on the head . Pleasing deeper tone .
5 #### Bought this as a 1st birthday gift for my baby boy , who 's a big fan of making noise . This brand was recommended to me for its quality , and I 'm not disappointed . My son figured out right away how to bang away . No damage to the drum yet , despite his attempts . He sits on this drum , stands on this drum , and it still looks brand new two months later .
5 #### Always popular family classic game . Excellent for kids having a bit of trouble in 3rd-5th grade math but fun for all ages and easy to learn . Game takes max . 15 minutes .
1 #### Such a disappointment on Christmas morning ! When taken out of the package , the driver 's side rear tire is broken and falling off . I wish it was n't a Christmas present so I could have opened it earlier when I ordered it . I will not be ordering again , as I fear the same thing might happen . We are very disappointed in this product and the waste of our money .
5 #### This is the BEST drum ever ! My grandson absolutely loves it . It 's the perfect size . The sound is amazing . It seems to be extremely well made ... since my grandson not only beats on it , but uses it to roll around on the floor , turn upside down and put his other toys in , throw things in it as if it were a basket , and climb on it . Hours of play for a busy toddler !
5 #### I bought this for my 2.5 year old niece and she started playing on it right away ! It was just awesome to watch her on Skype singing and beating the drums with her father ! The sound is pretty nice and piece appears sturdy . Recommended !
3 #### Not the " Original original " Uno set if that is actually what you are looking for . But a good enough set to teach the new generation of players the ropes .
5 #### This is a really cool toy ! It is well made , sounds good , and beautiful with the colorful graphics around the drum .
5 #### This is heavy duty and good quality . It has a nice ring to it so it is n't annoying like all the toy drums out there . This is the real thing and my son loves it .
5 #### A great gift . It has lasted for over two years with two male toddlers pounding on it often . I would highly recomend it .
5 #### My son loved the drums at Gymboree and so I bought him this small one for Christmas . He loved it ! This drum is very well made , sounds great , and the colors are a nice change from the bright primary colors kids things all come in .
4 #### We use Remo drums in our daughter 's music class so we purchased this hand drum set for home use . The physical quality seems fine - the drum skins are tight and seem to be attached well . The overall manufacture seems decent and we anticipate and expect them to survive several years of use . The only real complaint is the sound - it 's quite " tinny " . Regardless , the drums can take a beating , pardon the pun .
5 #### Good item . Brings a lot of joy to my little son , a lot of headaches to ourselves , LOL .
5 #### Great . The child loves it , and it stands up to some heavy treatment .
5 #### It 's sturdy and serves it 's purpose . My 14 month old has recently gotten accustomed to using the drum sticks and bangs on it everyday .
5 #### My grandson enjoys these . He loves music . Received on time and in excellent condition .
5 #### This is sturdy . It can take a beating with the drum sticks . I would get more than one kind of drum though . Otherwise , its just kind of like noise .
5 #### Very sturdy and has held up well ! Nicely made and makes great sound .
4 #### I wanted something to serve as the " backbone " of our fledgling family drum circle ... to keep everyone in rhythm as we learned to " solo " and to experiment on our respective instruments . This gets the job done . Sturdy ... nice and loud ... quality beaters . We have n't gotten much sound out of it at all by using our hands and I probably would not recommend that - get a djembe instead if that is your intent . Not really two distinctly different sounds ( such as a bass and a tone or a bass and a " slap " , if you 're familiar with those terms ) by striking different places on the drum ... but a very nice instrument that we have enjoyed .
5 #### My husband suggested we order this game to play with our two grandchildren to " wean " them off of TV . It is easy enough for them play and exciting enough to hold their attention . We looked at local big box stores and several toy stores and we 're unable to find them . I was very pleased to find this Original UNO Card game on Amazon . The cards are large and easy to hold and have held up to the exuberant use of two young kids . I highly recommend this card game for great family time fun .
4 #### I was hoping to get the old fashion version but got the new version instead . I still like the old version better but could not find it .
5 #### Our family loves uno ! We prefer the original cards over the newer version ... We like the art work of the original cards . We picked up a deck at the local walmart of the new version and we were very disappointed with the artwork ( VERY ! ) This picture of the original uno cards looks very close to our decks through out the years , as we have gone through so many decks because we play so much and love the game of uno ! Even our three year old plays , how ever we need the art work on the cards because also use uno as an educational tool and with out the original art work it will be hard to continue to use the cards for an education purpose , I have also heard that some schools also use uno for educational purposes .. So with that said if you are looking for the original uno , buy these as we tried the local store and we are very disappointed with our deck from the local store ... Happy playing ! !
5 #### Good quality and sound . Looks like picture . Comes with two drum sticks . Grandchild enjoys beating on it .
5 #### Great gift for grandchildren ! ( after checking with their parents , of course )
5 #### I bought this for my one year old grandson and he loves to beat this drum . It is made very well and looks like it should last for years .
1 #### Had to send this back . The smell was so horrible ... smelled toxic ... didn't want my kids touching it .
5 #### I teach a children 's music class and purchased this to help them learn their rhythm songs . I received the product within the last two weeks . I am so happy and very impressed with the quality of this drum . It 's very well made . Nice and sturdy and seems like it will stand up well to use by children !
5 #### If you have a child that loves to play drums , get one of this brand . The sound is amazing , and it is just fabulous .
5 #### great sound , great look , great instrument . my son loves it .
4 #### Ours was not made in the USA . I was hoping for a made in the USA drum , because the company does make larger drums made in the USA . However , our kids drum was not made in the USA . The drum is a good drum and my children like it . The sound is good and the drum is well made .
5 #### This Drum is amazing . When I looked at the reviews here on amazon before buying it I thought people must be exaggerating , but I was pleasantly surprised , this drum makes an amazing lovely sound for the price ! If you are buying a drum for your child to experience the joy making their first musical sounds , it is so worth paying the extra $ 15 or $ 20 to get this instead of a cheap drum that will just take space and not get played with . The drum has a deep musical tones and it is also sturdy so it 's not wobbling or moving around on the floor when played with , it is very well made and seems like it will last . I bought this Drum for my 2 year old and he loves it but it is also getting plenty of play from my 4 and 6 year old . A great gift that will foster their imagination and built like all toys should be , buy it you wo n't regret it !
5 #### My toddler loves this drum . It makes a very nice loud and clear sound . It seems like a good quality drum ... though this is the first drum we have ever owned ( we are not drum experts ) . It does what we bought it for ... it entertains my toddler and it sounds great . It is also very , very sturdy . My 42 lb toddler sits on it and has even stood on it several times and this drum seems no worse for the wear . This drum does seem to be able to put up with a lot of abuse and still works great .
5 #### These , along with a box of long straight tracks , were the perfect addition to the basic figure 8 starter set for my young grandson .
4 #### I 've been happy with the Brio tracks ; these are helpful . $ 10 seems a little pricy for four tracks , but I found no better price than that . These are n't cheap tracks , either . Satisfied .
5 #### BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market . These pieces are a must for extending your existing train set . My 5 year old loves having these extra pieces to create with .
5 #### We have picked up several of these types of pieces during our train building / buying marathon that has lasted many years now . These are typical brio quality . They are well built , sturdy pieces . They have been helpful . We have found you need a variety of sizes and shapes to fill in the odd opening . These have been more than helpful because you can make your track go straight without having it go too far straight and running off the table . Well worth the money . enjoy .
5 #### Well made and not too obnoxious sounding . If your little one wants a drum , this is a great pick .
5 #### These short curves are really a nice addition to your wooden railway system as they make it possible to create small and sharper turns than you can do with the normal curved track ( 33342 ) . The downside of this track is that it may be a bit difficult for longer engines ( like the mighty red battery - powered engine ) to drive through the curves . However , if the tracks are laid without too many " bumps " at the connecting points the larger engines will manage to drive through it as well .
5 #### first we tried the 19 " and the pitch was way to high . then we tried the 16 " but it arrived damaged . so we splurged and got the 22 " . wow . not only is it the coolest sound you 'll ever hear the pitch is so deep that you can feel it in your chest . my 2 year old boy makes " parade " every 10 min . he 's super stoked . and as a purcussionist myself , i 'm very happy we went with something deep instead of something high pitched like a snare drum . our friend has a baby snare kit for his son , but the poor kid does n't ever get to play cause he 's always being told to be quiet . haha . buy this drum .
5 #### Excellent product ! My 9 month old is loving this gift !
5 #### bought for my 3 year old nephew and he absolutely loves it ! ! wakes up wanting to play his drum .
5 #### This is a wonderful drum , my kid loves it , and it seems to be pretty good quality . We 're not musicians so I ca n't tell you if it 's musically sound , but fun for the kids to play with .
5 #### Bought 2 of these for our grandsons [ 7 + 2 year old ] . They sound GREAT . They had a BLAST with them right away . Banging and laughing and whooping it up . We expect many hours of joyful banging - and , hopefully , plenty of rhythm finding & expressing & sharing . Perfect .
5 #### I 'm an elementary Music teacher , so I 'm picky about children 's percussion instruments . This one is durable , has a wonderful , resonant sound , and is very satisfying to play . This is worth every penny , and will provide years of satisfying play . Remo really knows what they 're doing with children 's percussion instruments .
5 #### My son got this toy at 18 months , and it kept his interest for nearly 6 months . I added on the amusement park after 3 months , and he figured out directions , speed , on and off , how to set gears against each other so they would start spinning , and he even learnt to look at the back of each gear to see whether it could go into the middle part on the motor cog . The toy and he were practically inseparable for weeks , and its been known to have stayed on for the whole day at a time ... Cons : its noisy especially at the slow setting , and my son liked it on , so even if we switched it off , he would walk over and switch it on even if he was not playing with it right then . Get rechargeable batteries ! The pieces turn up all over the place ! Its started making a grating noise at some point , louder even than the usual whine . The noise went away mysteriously after a couple of days . It quit working after 6 months . So the 4 stars on durability . Not too bad given the price and tough usage it had been put through .
5 #### My toddler son attends a weekly music class that uses this brand of drum . He was becoming resourceful in repurposing many household items into drums ( most notably , baking pans ... thanks , Gram ... ) despite a couple of toy drums he has . The wood - on - wood or wood - on - metal was driving me a little crazy . This drum is the perfect size . It 's large but he can easily carry it around ( and does ) . The mallets are soft rubber and despite his enthusiastic drumming , the sound is mellow , low , and not obtrusive . It 's much more pleasant to the ear . The drum is excellent quality and holds up well in a classroom - type environment , so I expect this will last a long time . The artwork around the outside is also attractive and my son was able to identify some of the animals .
5 #### I purchased this for a friends 1 yr olds birthday . Her kiddos love playing with music and he just loved this drum . It was so cute seeing him play with it and now he can join in on his older brothers jam sessions
1 #### I purchased based on high reviews . Thought it would be great for 3&5 year old grandkids . I tried it out and was frustrated by the difficulty in getting gears to mesh easily ... Plus it 's pretty noisy . Over $ 7 for return shipping ! Disappointed .
5 #### My kids LOVE playing with this ! There was one at my daughter 's preschool and the teachers were telling me how much she loved playing with it . We bought one for her and my son for Christmas and they love when we get it out . It is easy for the kids to use .
5 #### Son really enjoys playing with this magnetic board . Wants his gear board daily .
5 #### This is so fun for my three year old . He loves putting the gears together and figure out how they all turn . He can spend a long time playing with it . A great independent play toy .
5 #### Great . My 2 1/2 year old grandson will love these . His parents maybe not so much ! ! ! !
5 #### 4 year old loves this drum ( what was I thinking - LOL ) .
5 #### Omg ! What a great toy ! Beautiful sound that you do n't mind listening to .
5 #### This is a quality product . Brio puts out a great wooden train track . They are wooden , well made and have held up to many years of use at our home . The more different sizes and items you have for your track the more your track can change from a simple circle to a large fun track . We have several sets of these to play with at our home . I would probably buy these after I have bought some of the extension kits with the more specialized track pieces and after I had some of the smaller pieces available for purchase . Well worth the money . Enjoy .
5 #### You will need these to expand your Brio set . They are very robust and will not break unless really abused . Also look at the other Brio track expansion kits to add a larger variety of tracks . Often you will need a selection of the shorter straight tracks to close the gap in your track design .
5 #### Excellent toy . My grandson has autism and he just loves this toy . This is the second one I 've purchased for him . He played with the first one so much he wore it out .
4 #### Overpriced , stickers not durable , cute if only my son enjoyed it , not played with much for a year to my surprise .
3 #### I had high hopes for this after reading other reviews but it did n't hold my kids attention . It is cool the first time you play with it to see all the gears work but after that the play is limited . The magnets hold is n't as strong as I would have expected ... when I store it in the toy closet standing up the magnets tend to fall off . For the price I wish I would have bought a more educational or fun toy .
4 #### my 3 year old loved this toy buy grew out of it quickly .
5 #### Got this for my 1 year old for christmas after he used them in music class . Very durable . Great sound . Also bought the 16 " diameter drum . Both Remo drums came with two mallets . These get used with every playdate at my house and hold up well to being sat on or climbed upon . Even the older kids ( 6 - 7 ) enjoy playing with them .
5 #### Got this for my 1 year old for christmas after he enjoyed playing with them at music class . Great for all ages but certainly through elementary school age . Pretty durable . Most playdates one or two kids ( age 2 - 3 ) will try sitting or standing on them and they seem to old up just fine . Both of the drums I ordered by this brand came with two mallets in the box .
5 #### Having had two children in the high school marching band , and one in a college marching band , I am pretty familiar with the sound of drums . While this drum is certainly not even close to professional quality , for a child it is superb . I totally disagree with the negative review complaining about its tone .
5 #### A well made percussion instrument great for kids of all ages . We bought it for our two year old who loves music and we just leave it out so he can bang out a tune as he goes through the day . He loves it . Our nine month old picks up the sticks as well and hammers on the drum just like his older brother . It is a wood base with a natural skin top . The drum sticks are felt covered and the drum is a perfect size for toddler use and can easily accommodate an older child . It is fun for the parents too , as my husband likes to play along with the children . The colorful design is attractive and inviting , giving the drum a fun and toy like image , though the drum itself has a full and authentic sound . A great first time instrument for children .
5 #### This was a 4th birthday present to twin girls who just love it . They like to make different configurations and then change them over and over again . One likes it to go fast , the other likes it to go slowly . But , they both love it ! Me too . If it 's left out , I ca n't help but play with it too . It 's addictive .
4 #### My two year old granddaughter has enjoyed playing with this as well as her older siblings who seem to have enjoyed it even more . The gears are easy to arrange and put into motion . It has not been one of those toys that she continues to play with every day , but one that is fun to get out from time to time and play with again . It is a nice size , enough room to put all the gears on but not too big as to be too hard to manage .
5 #### I purchased this for my 4 year - old granddaughter . She opened this gift with lots of other gifts at Christmas . This was the gift she wanted to play with for the rest of the evening . It was also the only thing her Dad wanted to play with . This is a cool toy - there 's lots of things you can do with it . I highly recommend .
3 #### This drum is okay . We have the floor tom and love it , was hoping for the same quality from the gathering drum . While this drum is huge and 3 toddlers can easily gather around it to drum ... the drum head itself is very pitchy and sounds loose in several spots , and makes different noises . Sounds almost vibratory in nature and if If it had an area to use a drum key I would love to adjust / tighten it . I 'm hoping that over time as the natural fibers wear it evens out , but overall good for kids .
4 #### Its not bad .. looks beautiful , love the mallot / drumsticks , the sound is a bit sort of tinny though , I was expecting somethign different perhaps .. I have found using regular drumsticks gets a slightly nicer sound .. and also if you put something inside it , it helps baffle a little of the sound , takes some of the ' steel drum ' and volume out of it ( if it gets a bit noisy ! ) .
5 #### All of our children play with this ( ages 1 , 4 and 7 ) ! It is colorful and has a beautiful sound !
5 #### Great quality . My two year old beats on this drum like there 's no tomorrow and I do n't mind because it has a nice low sound .
5 #### My son loves it . thank you and God bless .
5 #### I wanted to get my 8 year old Gson something other than toys for Christmas . This rocket will do the trick . He also loves science , so I 'm sure it will get many uses " outside " . LOL
5 #### Other than the price being too high , they are good quality , arrived on time , and were packaged well .
5 #### Great quality , like all Brio products . These long tracks are essential to create a nice long stretch of track to help build up optimum train speed ! The speed we manage to reach with these nice long tracks makes the investment well worth it . I purchased a couple of extra track sets ( straight and curved ) in order to jazz up the complexity of my sons train track . Brio is an investment , no doubt about it .
5 #### This is one of the best toys that I have ever seen . I have got this back in 2012 and it still works great and my kids still use it ( they are 2 and 5 ) I have a lot of play dates and everyone is always asking me where I got this toy . They put toys on top of the spinners and watch them go round and round to they stack them up to see how high they can get them to go as they go around .
5 #### I 'd purchased one of these for one Grand Child in the past & now this one for another ! These are great toys - get the mind working as well as the toy gears .
5 #### Bought this for a grandchild . It was a huge hit when she opened it and she still loves it months later . Great Toy ! ! !
1 #### 15 to 20 bucks seems a bit high for a few pieces of tape , balsa and a pop bottle . ( But are n't most " science " kits expensive for what you really get ? ) The only unique part was the molded plastic fin holder - tape it around the bottle and slide the fins into place with perfect spacing and alignment . The parts were only durable enough for a few demonstration flights and then the rocket needed some first aid ( bring duct tape for the balsa wood fins and paper towels to dry the fuel tube before refilling ) . I found the launch instructions lacking in safety warnings . In five launches we had one kid hit in the face by the rocket almost immediately after setting it on the ground and a second hit with the stopper that shot out prematurely as the rocket was being set on the ground . Maybe we did n't get the stopper tight enough - who knows ? In hindsight this toy makes a better cork gun than a rocket .
2 #### This product consisted of a plastic bottle , some ply - wood , some cellophane , and some silvery paper . The cellophane and paper were for " decorating " the bottle , but were very difficult to apply - and the directions did n't help at all . Could n't complete the job at one sitting because had to buy an x - acto knife first . So we ended up with an ugly looking plastic bottle . Making it blast off was easy , just as we could have done with a plane plastic bottle . Very disappointing .
5 #### It took an engineer about 3 hours to put this together . It flew pretty well and was a hit at the birthday party .
5 #### Good set of straight track and authentic Brio means it does fit well together . I purchased these to solve the problem with the couple generations old collection of track and trains that I found , this being that with all the sets and parts purchased over the years there was a lot of curves but not too much to go striaght , so a couple of these sets solved that quickly .
5 #### I expect nothing less then a superior product from Brio . This Brio product is as expected . Like all Brio products I have purchased it is top notch ! Brio make outstanding high quality products !
5 #### We love brio , everything is great quality and has held up really well to hours of playing . We only buy brio !
5 #### Probably the most exciting pieces of trace you could ever buy !
5 #### My 4yo daughter got this for Christmas and we 've had several children visit since . EVERY SINGLE CHILD ( ages ranging from 3 to 7yo ) has spent time entranced by this easy - to - use toy . It has sound and movement to stimulate children , it is creative by nature as you build intricate gear structures , and encourages problem solving when the gears wo n't turn . Really a great toy !
5 #### I really enjoy playing with this toy with my kid , too ! The pieces hold her interest and she is able to move them around by herself for imaginative play . The piece that turns in the middle is kid friendly , as it depresses into the toy when too much pressure is applied which I assume helps to protect the internal gears . I think I will also get the magnetic / refrigerator version of this
5 #### The little scientist is happy . Read the comment above . n o no no no no non non no nono no
5 #### My son and grandson thought this was really neat and were looking forward to a rocket project together . It made a good Christmas gift .
3 #### I ffelt that $ 9 was a bit steep for 4 straight pieces . However , 4 straight tracks is plenty for the small amount of space and tracks my son has ( about 30 pieces on a 2.5'x4 ' play table . The set IS universal , but they are super snug on the Fisher Price Thomas and Friends - to the point of frustration for my 2 year old son .
2 #### This was a disappointment because they do not fit tightly with each other . The slightest bump and it comes up from the opening .
3 #### PERHAPS FOUR tracks is not worth the money . Otherwise the work .
5 #### Bought this for my 2 1/2 yrs old son ... He loves it . He learned the concept of speed ... Slow vs fast . As well as fitting the gears together . Even my 4 months old son loves watching the gears turning .
5 #### I bought this after seeing it at one of our early development classes for our Autistic 2 year old . He loved it at class and now loves it at home ! ! Our 4 year old ( who is not autistic ) loves it as well and it has definitely been worth the money . My only wish is that there was an accessory pack of extra gears that work with the board . It comes with 11 gears total , but it 'd be fun to have a different variety pack of gears that do different things . Overall , very happy with this purchase ! Great for a rainy day or any day at all really !
5 #### My three year old and 11 year old love to play with this ! I originally bought it for my younger child but my oldest ( 11yr ) enjoys playing with it too . Lots of fun !
5 #### We bought this drum as a Christmas gift for our 1and 4 year old boys . They absolutely loved it ! It is a nice deep / loud sounding drum and seems high quality . It has taken a beating from the kids and has held up over the past year .
5 #### This drum is almost 2 feet across and has a deep bass sound . My kid and the insane parent that bought it for her love it .... me , not so much . BUT it makes them happy and they enjoy it , so in a way I like it too ( just got ta keep telling myself that . ) A sanity saving trick is to put something like a pillow UNDER the drum , so its tucked up inside of it . It muffles the sound and makes it not so migraine inducing .
2 #### This toy is a disappointment , the kit is overpriced for what it contains & the function of the rocket is terrible . Building the kit went fine & is enjoyable ( which is half the reason to buy kits such as these ) & the theory of operation is sound . The problem we had with the rocket is the stopper pops out just as soon as you set it down thus there is no time for pressure to build and the thing just goes about 10 feet into the air . If I try to tighten the stopper it slips out of the bottle opening again & again . I 'm going to try to roughen up the bottle opening & the rubber stopper ( or try a different stopper ) to see if we can get it to stay in place - if this works the rocket should fly much better .
5 #### Wonderful addition to my grandson 's Brio collection . His imagination runs wild with his train set .
5 #### I ordered these long straights for my son 's new train set . I had bought him new Brio trains for Christmas , but most of the track pieces I purchased used off a neighbor , so they were a mix of various different brands ( Melissa & Doug , Thomas , and one other I do n't know ) . We needed a few more straights , so I went with these from Brio . At first I was disappointed by the price for only 4 pieces . But I have to say , the quality of these is well above and beyond the other pieces we have . They fit together perfectly and are easy to attach and detach . The Brio trains roll easily along these tracks -- not so with some of the others . The other track pieces can frustrate my 2.5 - yr - old , but these are much easier to use , less frustrating , and therefore more fun !
5 #### Brio is reliable . I started a Brio train set for my daughter 34 years ago . Now her son plays with the set . While creating a route for his train , he ran out of track . His great - granddad said , " Wesley , you 've just learned an important fact about trains -- you never have enough track ! " So I thought why not add track now ? Brio track from 34 years ago still works with today 's track . When Wesley received the new track for an Easter present , he clutched it excitedly and said , " Thank you ! Thank you ! I needed more track ! " For the next few years , his presents for special occasions will be -- more track .
5 #### This track is very well made . Younger grand kids like to chew on it , but the wood is very well made and would be hard to damage it . I ca n't see any reason it wo n't last for years . Works perfect with Letter train and Brio trains , easy to connect and disconnect .
5 #### BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market . These are a must have for any extended train building . We have several sets of these and my son uses almost all of them whenever he is train building . Great pieces .
2 #### When I saw this I immediately thought of my grandson and how much he would enjoy it , but after opening it and having him play with it I was disappointed . The gears do not always move as they should and it seems expensive for what it can actually do . It said it was educational but as a former teacher I do not see how that is . I would not recommend this to anyone .
5 #### I got this as a gift for my nephew . He loves it . There are so many different ways to play with this . Tomy makes good quality stuff .
5 #### Really nice and solid . all around its awesome sound and part top quality .
5 #### Seems like a nice quality tom . I 'm happy i did n't go cheaper .
5 #### Beautiful , really a work of art , and the sound is wonderful as well . It rivals a true professional instrument .
5 #### A good quailty child 's drum . It is getting lots of use !
5 #### The preschool aged kids love playing their drum . The mallets are soft keeping the volume down a bit .
5 #### Highly recommended drum . My grandson loved it , and so do I. Great quality , very colorful and durable .. comes with two padded drum sticks .
4 #### I bought this as a gift for my grandson and tried it out for myself first . It is a great size for anyone of any age - bigger than toy size and smaller than parade size . It is good looking and the colours are very bright and cheerful . The mallets are perfect . The drum itself makes a great sound whether soft or loud and since my grandson loves to bang on drums - what kid does n't - the sound of this particular drum is quite pleasant unlike other drums he has . My grandson will love it and if he does n't , I 'll update this review , but so far I think it 's great and would definitely recommend .
5 #### This is a wonderfully creative toy . It is colorful and well made . The board is magnetic and the gears are lots of fun . The seller was prompt and the package arrived in great shape .
5 #### My grandaughter keeps very busy with this unique toy . She 's 14months and I know this is not in her age group , but , with supervision it gives together time and keeps her little mind going .
5 #### This package together with the other Brio track expansion sets are essential to get after buying the typical Brio starter set . This is the way to enhance the fun and educational value of that first investment in a Brio train set as a bit of extra tracks allow for a lot of new track layouts . This is what Brio is great for - allowing your child to discover and explore new layouts . This set contains four long curved tracks , enough for a 180 deg . turn . The tracks are very robust and you would need to be pretty violent to break them .
4 #### Do n't get me wrong . I love this toy . My two autistic sons and " normal " daughter love these gears . But a change is necessary . As a reviewer , you may not think much of this needed change . But the company has not realized that the " on"/"off " switch is not that . It is one way or the other on either side , and then in the middle is the " off " mode . ( On the left of the toy , there is a switch for fast or slow " . ) I would have to guess that 75 percent of the purchase of this toy is from people with autistic children or therapists for such . That being said , the " on"/"off " switch should be just that , a choice between " off " and " on " . My two ( autistic ) sons are never able to figure this switch out . And they are far away from each other on the spectrum as far as the disorder is concerned . Other than that , batteries last long and the toy gets much use . Thanks for hearing me out .
5 #### This is probably my baby boy 's favorite toy from Christmas . The only thing is that he likes to leave it on . He is extremely smart and as soon as he sees us turn something on he knows how . It is cool to watch all the gears turn and he loves magnets , plays with the ones on the refrigerator all the time , so this was a perfect choice for him !
1 #### Had to return this drum due to an overwhelming chemical odor . I wo n't be giving my small child a drum off - gassing stinky chemicals , thanks . Off to look for a more responsibly manufactured product .
5 #### This drum is amazing , if you 're willing to have a large drum in your house that has a loud boom . :) We have a strict " not after 6 pm " policy on this instrument !
5 #### This drum is awesome ! My 2 year old loves music and this drum has a very nice sound and has so far stood up to her playing . It seems to be well made and the decoration on the outside makes it cute for kids .
5 #### Very good quality drum . The Mallets are absolutely cute . It sound like a professional drum .
5 #### This is a nice gift for a four or five year old well made and after they outgrow it it is decorative . It 's a work of art and well made .
5 #### Great product nicely made . Great timely shipping . My niece enjoyed this drum for her 2nd birthday !
5 #### I have had this toy for eight years and is still played with . My son who loves electronics plays with this toy .
5 #### Gave this to my ( then ) 2 year old . First without batteries in it , and she loved it , playing with the moving pieces by themselves was fun for her . Then we added the batteries and got it moving . She loved it ! Now , another review said their 3 year old was bored after a few days . I do n't know of many toys that a 3 year will play with for days on end . What you do is the popular technique called " hide it for 2 weeks then bring it out again when you need an hour to yourself " . There is NO other toy like this one . Nothing out there that does what this does . Now , my 1 year old and now 5 year old play with it still . Talk about durable ! My year old is sitting on at as I type this . I think she hopes she will spin like the gears . :-) Children love to connect the pieces and watch each one do their unique thing , flip flop , ding a bell , clickety sounds , spin around , move side to side etc . The best thing ... it takes up little space and there are no small parts to worry about . I love playing with it and I 'm in my 30 's .
5 #### We received this as a gift when my youngest son was a year old . He is now three and rarely a day goes by that he does not play with it . My husband I enjoy playing with it too . Our second son is almost a year and they have been fighting over this toy recently . It 's educational and captivating for children and adults ! By far the best toy we own ( and we own alot of toys ) .
5 #### This is an awesome item from Brio ! We are always happy with Brio . We like the quality and simplicity of Brio train products and so does our little toddler . Please see Brio product reviews on YouTube channel SOMDVP .
5 #### We have had our Gearation for at least 7 years and it is one that consistently comes back out of the toy closet . It is not really a day to day toy but one that goes in the toy rotation . It has held the attention of children from ages 3 to 10 and has certainly stood the test of time for durability . It is easy enough to manipulate for children of varying ages . It has two speeds for the gears to turn and the direction can be changed from clockwise to counterclockwise . Children must figure out how to assemble the gears ( in an infinite number of possibilities ) without having them lock up . It is fun for kids to see what happens with each gear as it becomes part of the works . All the gears have cool features : some flip over , others have googly eyes that turn , some make noise . The motor is pretty strong and can turn the majority of gears if they are placed carefully . It is pretty easy for kids to carry from one room to another using the handle and the parts stay put since they are magnetized to the board . I would highly recommend this toy .
5 #### My two and a half year old has been playing with this toy over three days now and he just loves it . As he has figured out how to play with it on his own he has gained a sense of accomplishment and it is good for fine motor skills as well as learning consequences ( if the gears do n't mesh , they do n't turn , etc . ) . It is brightly colored , the sound can be annoying but no more annoying than most other toys . I highly recommend this toy .
5 #### This is absolutely the best toy we own ! My autistic 2 year old sons are playing with it constantly . I have to put it away occasionally , so they can play with other toys too . As soon as I bring it back , they rush to it and fight for gears . I also bought an amusement park addition and now 2 sets of refrigerator gears . If you only buy one toy for your toddler , this is it ! ! !
2 #### There are lots of positivie reviews about this toy , which you can refer to hear all the good things this toy has to offer . Here are the I do n't like about it : 1 . It 's makes noise that is appealing to children but very annoying to the adults in our family . 2 . There is no place within the toy to store all the gears and pieces that come with it , so they end up easily separated and strewn around and lost easily . UPDATE : This toy lasted two and a half months before the motor that turns the gears broke and the toy stopped working for good .
5 #### Brio tracks are classic and never disappoint . With tracks on both sides the curves are able to go right or left , adding flexibility to the track design .
5 #### Good quality . A great addition to my grandson 's train set .
5 #### Brio tracks are great . Whenever we are unable to complete a circuit , it is for lack of curves , so adding more curved pieces to our collection is always helpful .
5 #### BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market . Another must have for train extending . We have about 10 sets of these . It makes it really easy for our son to build whatever he wants . Another great product .
5 #### Do you want to make another circle ? A circle of tracks under a bridge ? this is the set to get . They are sturdy and have held up to my children playing with them many years over and over again . These are the basics of train track building . If you have these and a few extra pieces you can make quite a nifty train track for your train .
5 #### My baby loves it ! ! ! He 's had this since 8 months old , and has been beating on it constantly . By around 1 years old , he turned it upside down and slid in it butt first .... He played a little in there and then when hr realized he could n't get out , he starting frowning and building up a cry!~ He was n't hurt as I was watching him closely . It was too cute not to snap a pic . See picture posted ! LOVE Remo Kids ! ! ! UPDATE : 03/03/2015 at 22 months he is still playing with it . He now hits on it with his hands while daddy plays guitar . Sometimes he hits it on the right beats ..... On a side note , I had to stop him from stepping on it a couple times . I also had to muffle it a bit with a small blanket because he is bigger with stronger arms and with the mallet it could get quite loud . I just really do n't want to disturb my elderly neighbors . UPDATE : 02/7/2018 This drum is still an essential part of my my childs playroom ! He is 4.5years old and now , he could actually play nice beats to troll songs ! Please invest couple dollars more and get the one with two mallets ! Tried the other version and you could tell the difference in the sound quality ! I have been gifting this along with hohner kids xylophone for all 1 year birthdays ! Just an awesome product that grows with your kid !
2 #### I was a rock musician during the fun days , so I know what a decent drum is supposed to sound like . Kids wo n't know the difference , but this drum has an annoying metallic sounding resonance , somewhat like hitting a large tin can . I purchased this based on the raving reviews , and it is completely puzzling how so many people would miss mentioning the resonance ( are all the reviews real ? ) . I know this is a kid product and not for professionals , but the product description talks about the " enhanced low - pitched fundamentals . " The drum sticks are nice though . I will try the larger diameter Remo Kids gathering drum to see if perhaps those do n't have the ringing overtones .
5 #### We bought this for our son as a Christmas gift . Six months later , it has held up beautifully ( I mean , SERIOUS banging going on with this thing and we 've had NO issues ) . It 's a drum . It 's loud . But it makes a really nice sound ( not too high pitched ) . I highly recommend it !
5 #### My four - year - old son wanted a drum ( and a violin ) for his birthday . We settled on this one , and he loves it . It is well made , and is not flimsy . The mallets are easy to hold and are sizeable . This is definitely a good purchase . As an aside , my 9 - month - old daughter also loves this drum too , and instinctively knew how to use both mallets to drum on the drum already . Very impressed with Remo , and will look at other products offered by them .
5 #### This drum is lovely , sturdy and does the trick . It was my nephew 's birthday gift to arrive -- he is 4 . He was ecstatic and wakes up to play it in the morning . My sister recently asked me to find him a music class ! This is a must for a kid who loves music , dance or for entertainment at any party . Get this , a few maracas and whistles ! Adults can join in too !
5 #### Grandson loves this toy drum . Very happy with purchase . Was not sure it was appropriate for a two year old , but it 's a hit
5 #### Sturdy , plastic drum . It makes a great sound . Durable . My son uses it daily for 4 months . Hits it with toys etc and there is no wear
5 #### This toy is great for my 2 year old . He loves to connect the gears and watch it go around . We searched all over locally for this and could only find it online , well worth paying the freight ! It keeps him happy for a long time :)
5 #### I brought this drum for my one year old for his birthday . He s a typical baby who loves to bang things so I decided a drum would be perfect for him . As I browsed around Amazon , I found many baby drums , but all of them looked like toys that can outgrow within a few years . When I saw the Remo drum , I knew I wanted to purchase it . Its something I could see him using through his adolescent years . Its not baby looking and that s what I wanted . The drum is very lightweight and comes with two sticks . Now , if you have a child who likes to put stuff in their mouth , I would nt recommend this product . I m not sure what the top parts of the sticks are made of , but they have a weird smell that I would not want in my childs mouth . Overall though , he loves the drums .
3 #### This is a sturdy piece of equipment which is important . But I am quite disappointed in the quality of sound . The size is perfect for my three year old grand children . Wish I had actually gone shopping in the stores where I could have been able to hear what I was buying . I think it is a mistake to think that quality of sound does n't matter to a three year old . My intention is to capture their attention not dull it . So , no I do n't recommend them . I did n't send them back , but should have .
5 #### All the kids seem to like it . It is a nice quality drum that has a good sound . I bought it for my autistic grandson .
5 #### I got this for my 2 year old 's birthday and it has been a huge hit ! It is very well made and sturdy and the sound quality is quite good . I saw the same drum in a teacher 's music supply catalog for almost twice as much with no mallets included . I am very happy with the purchase and would definitely recommend this drum !
5 #### I purchased this drum for my niece , who is autistic . It 's superbly crafted and the artwork is stunning . It has a more soothing sound than " cheaper drums " and she just loves it !
5 #### If you do anything besides build a simple circle you will find you need these . We bought two sets of these because of the two innies and two outties pieces . We needed more of those types of pieces . They are absolute musts for any family who enjoys building elaborate train tracks . These are sturdy well made and have been strong enough to hold up through countless set ups , tear downs and hours of play . Well worth the money . Enjoy .
4 #### This set of assorted short tracks is hard to avoid if you want to create a track layout of even an intermidiate size . The male - male and female - female pieces will provide a dramatic increase in the number of layouts possible as you can now overcome the problem of curves returning to the starting position . This is a must - have for any Brio enthusiast .
2 #### We got this puzzle as a gift for my son . The knob size is good but the shapes are much too complex for a 12 month old to line up . My son understands what to do with the pieces but all the little edges and corners make it much too difficult for him to fit it where he goes . He ends up mad at the toy . The pieces are very thin as well . I would recommend this but only for a child around 24 months old
4 #### We received this as a gift when my son was 3 , he LOVED it . He took it to preschool for show and tell and all the kids wanted one . The gears are really easy to move and manipulate . My son loved the fact that you can change directions or make it go faster / slower . He would rearrange the gears and then sit and just watch them . It is great for spatial skills , you have to be able to line up the gears with the opposing gears to make them connect and spin . It allows you the opportunity to discuss magnetics as well . Great toy ! It fell out of favor around age 5 though ( thankfully his 2yo old sister now enjoys it ) . So I would say it is best for ages almost 3 - 5 .
5 #### These seemingly hand made rooms of furniture are delightful . My granddaughter loves making rooms for them . We have the little 7 person family too .
5 #### This bunk bed set is really wonderful . It gets a lot of play from our two year old granddaughter . We love the simplicity and durable structure of the set . It should last a long time . Totally happy with it .
5 #### This has been great fun for my 5 yo daughter and has even held up great to my very rough 2 1/2 yo boy ... not something I can say about several other wooden doll house products I 've purchased . I 've gotten several more from Plan Toy because it works wonderfully for her Fisher Price Loving Family dolls / dollhouse .
5 #### I had just refurbished my daughter 's dollhouse for her daughter 's third birthday and was looking for some unbreakable furniture so that she could enjoy the dollhouse now . This will be perfect ! It 's cute , rugged , just the right size for small hands , and unbreakable . The classic style and plain wood ( I do not plan on painting ) will go with the current and future interior design of the house , and the little touches such as doors that open and chair pads make it more grown - up and realistic . I do n't know whether my granddaughter or daughter will appreciate and enjoy this more .
5 #### This set of doll house furniture from Plan Toys is simply lovely . The set includes the bunk bed with mattresses and pillows along with the desk , stool and a toy box . It also comes with a ladder that is not attached to the bed and the toy box opens and closes . The best part is that it is natural and free of any chemical laden paints and is made from recycled rubber wood and is therefore non toxic . Compliments the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Plan - toys - Victorian - Dollhouse / dp / B001RRWWB0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Plan toys Victorian Dollhouse</a>&nbsp;beautifully as well as the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Plan - Toy - Doll - House - Doll - Family / dp / B0001VVB9C / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Plan Toy Doll House Doll Family</a > !
5 #### Came close to buying this drum elsewhere for nearly double the price . This is the exact same drum offered elsewhere for big money . We use it at home when dancing and playing along with music . Well made , good sound .
5 #### Quality drum ! Got this for my year old boy for Christmas and he loves to bang it . The quality of sound or tone or whatever musicians call it , is wonderful and deep ( ? ) ! I do n't know , I just know my husband who is a drummer is impressed with the sound and the quality and my little guy loves it . Also ? This drum can take a beating ( literally and figuratively ) ! It 's held up to my rough boy who has thrown it , stood on it and used it as a chair . :-)
5 #### This is worth the extra money compared to other kid drums . The quality is very nice , and it does n't sound irritating or harsh to me at all . It 's very sturdy and has a pleasant sound . I recommend it !
4 #### Good solid , sturdy drum . It can really take a beating from my 2 yr old ! He loves it . Has a bit of a tinny sound , but it does n't bother us .
5 #### These are n't professional bongos , and they 're not low quality toys either . They sound great and stand up to use by kids . A wonderful activity .
5 #### This was our little ones Christmas gift and she was 10 months old . Daddy has his own Remo 's and wanted her to have a nice quality drum . The outside is colorful though its a little wacky and it 's not all that easy to make out all the animals . She did n't use the sticks right away as she did n't quite know how but now that she 's almost 14 months , she can . She loves this ! I accidentally had 2 in my cart and ended up giving it as a gift .
5 #### It 's sturdy , and attractive . The mallets are sufficiently padded that they do n't do much damage when applied to surfaces other than the drum . It 's not a very loud drum and it has a nice tone . I 'm much happier to listen to my child bang on rather than listening to him use a pot for a drum .
5 #### This is a great drum and my 3 year old and 2 year old have such fun beating away on it . The sound is good - not too loud or soft and the drum sticks are solid and just right for small hands .
5 #### Not only does my 2 year old granddaughter loves it , but the entire family loves it ! What an awesome drum .
5 #### I bought this for my 3 year old grandson who enjoys playing with this , but it is my 11 month old grandson who appears to really enjoy it even more . He has the biggest smile when he is making his own music .
5 #### Fun toy and bright colors . Well made . We just drew a target on the sidewalk with chalk and played a game . Easy to pack for travel .
5 #### Aweeee some ! My grandchildren loved this gift . They are age 1 and 2 1/2 and they love pounding on it ! Sound is amazing . They crawl all over it too . It is sooooo well made .
5 #### This is a very nice drum for a child . Excellent quality and very durable . Has an excellent sound for a toy .
2 #### The bags did n't have enough beans in them . Disappointed .
2 #### too cheaply made . 2 of them came unraveled the first time we played with them and there were little white pellets everywhere .
5 #### Bought this , along with other Motion type toys , for my grandchildren for Christmas . . . they love being able to do creative play .
5 #### Well made , attractive . Like the sticks , as they produce a gentler sound than just wooden sticks . This replaced one from Toys R Us with a top seemingly made out of paper which was ripped the day after it was given as a gift . It 's a waste to produce such cheap items . This one will last .
5 #### My son uses this drum at his music class so we got him one for home and he loves it . He also uses it to help him stand up so its pretty sturdy and durable . Definitely recommend .
5 #### My baby girl loves this drum . I got it for her when she was about 7 months old and she immediately took to it ! Ca n't wait to get more Remo drums for her !
5 #### Bought this drum for my sons first birthday and he loved it . He is normally sensitive to loud noises , but he really got into it . Super cute and fun babies . We had a baby playgroup at our house and the 1 year olds were all over it , climbing on it , banging on it with their hands . My son is now almost 2 years old . He still bangs on it a couple of times a week and he STANDS on it . It 's well made , sounds great . Super entertaining . Note : This is a large drum , so it 's not the easiest thing to store . But it makes up in fun .
5 #### My son squealed with delight when I took the drum out of the box . The sound is good . It holds up really well . The drum sticks it comes with have padded heads on them . It is a good size drum so I would recommend this for class room play as well . The pictures on the side are pretty cool too and my son likes pointing out the animals . All around a fabulous buy that I do not regret at all .
5 #### Get ready to dance ! My grandson loves to keep the beat while we sing or listen to music . It is fairly loud , but not so that you ca n't talk or sing along . Big enough so that he ca n't miss with the mallet ( which is not heavy ) . After trying a couple of different drums , this one is the best .
4 #### They are still fun ! ! Nothing fancy about these bean bags . Well made and durable . Fun for a four year old .
5 #### Exactly what we needed for extra activities for busy preschoolers . I would definately buy them again . They were all working and have not had any problems with them .
5 #### I initially bought these for my cat but they are a little big for her to play with . My kids took them and have made up several games to play with them . They really enjoy playing with them .
5 #### This is a wonderful , high quality drum for kids . They make professional drums and these are the same quality . My daughter has loved it since she was 9 months old . It is worth the extra cost , she will be using it for a long time .
5 #### Great for young kids ! Who did n't love playing with bean bags as a kid ? A great product to have around the house and let the kids or you come up with games , who can balance a bean bag on their head the longest ? Make up a toss game so kids can practice their aim . Or try something as simple as playing catch with them ! The possibilities are endless !
4 #### A little pricey but good enough quality . I like the hidden seam type if that matters to you , but these were available for free shipping and arrived on time .
5 #### Its amazing how much fun kids can have with such a simple toy . My three year old and I played for over an hour with these when he got them . You can play hide the beanbag , catch , throw the bag in the trash can , etc ... They are very durable and have survived being hidden in the sandbox ; the sand just shakes off .
5 #### a total thumbs up item : great price , terrific quality , nice sound , perfect mallets , and really nice wrap - around rainforest design ! do n't hesitate if you 're contemplating buying this item - it 's entirely worth it !
5 #### Got two for grandchildren and as young as 10 months , these little guys love to drum and feel the rhythm . I have the larger djemba and play with them .
5 #### I bought this for my 3yo daughter and was not surprised ( I read the reviews ) when it arrived and was a " real " drum . I also know someone who has a tambourine by this maker . It is also of excellent quality . It comes with two " drumsticks " so that is also great ! The only thing I might do differently is buy a " set " of Remo instead of just the one . She does n't play it very long because well , it does n't change sounds ( unless you place your hand on top , as we 've experimented and discovered ! ) , but that has nothing to do with the quality , sound , or durability of this particular drum , which is crazy - good .
5 #### Got this for my kids for Xmas . Lots of fun . I ordered an extra mallet so all three of them could play it at the same time . Like the drum , the mallets are also well made . These come in different sizes , but get the big one . This is n't a cheap feeling drum . It 's solid . My toddler even climbs on it . We play cards on it . It looks cool hanging on the wall . I love beating on the the thing . The sound is deep and rich . In fact , I play it more than my kids .
5 #### Excellent drum for all ages . Super high quality and extremely durable . I love all the Remo instruments . You ca n't go wrong .
5 #### My 3 year old loooooves this drum . A frien who is a professional musician also commented " wow , this is a REAL drum "
5 #### Now this was a big hit for my nephew 's Christmas ! What can you say other than wonderful things ! 1 ) it 's a Remo , so high quality ! 2 ) it 's beautiful ! Artwork is stunning ! 3 ) sounds amazing ! It was the best gift and well received !
5 #### This is a great drum . It is extremely sturdy ( My child likes to sit on it as well as play it ) , and fun to play with . The mallets and drum seem like they will hold well .
5 #### My three year old loves this , and it is very sturdy . It holds up well to being dropped , sat on and stood on . And it is fun to play , as well !
4 #### I thought this would be larger , even though the dimensions listed are accurate . It has n't interested my toddler even though he loves these in music class . However , it is well - made and makes a significantly better sound than the plastic drums normally aimed at that age group .
5 #### As a musician and music teacher , I purchased these because I trust the products that Remo puts out . This was no exception . Now I 'm not expecting to get a concert sound out of these , but they do n't sound bad at all ! They use their durable ( if you treat them properly ) synthetic heads . These are not tunable and mine are very high pitched , but my three year old son thinks they 're fantastic . These are the perfect blend of toy drum and a " real " instrument . Perfect for young musicians .
5 #### From the look and weight of it , you can tell this is a high quality drum . The sound is great , my music loving toddler loves it and now my older child is requesting the bongos for herself !
5 #### My son loves instruments and this one did n't disappoint . It has a great sound and the mallets are really nice too . I plan to buy more instruments from this line . Good quality as well .
5 #### Great drum for kids , small enough for 2 year olds to carry , great quality and sound ! The pattern on it is nice and not too bright .
5 #### I got this for my 3 year old son for Christmas . We went to a heritage festival and they had drums kind of like these there . My son is a very strong Italian boy who can overpower me sometimes .. I could n't imagine getting him drums so he can break them in a matter of seconds . Let me just say , I am completely blown away at how well made and sturdy these are ! It 's very attractive for kids as well with the pretty picture . My son is 51lbs and he 's jumped on this and it does n't even look like it 's giving in at all . I ca n't believe it . My 5 1/2 year old daughter loves it too . It does n't give you a headache even with them bashing on it nonstop . I even like to play with it when they let me . For anyone with a sensitive head or with rambunctious children this is the drum for you . I truly love this product ! ! !
5 #### Great drum really nice and looks very durable . Includes 2 drumsticks . I think it will hold up well to my toddler .
5 #### This was for my 7 yrs old who wanted to play around with Bongos . These are perfect , great sound , great quality and are very sturdy . We are not musicians by any means but I purchased a few and took them back . These are by far the best quality in this price range .
5 #### We 're giving this to our 11 month grandson for Christmas . We;re very happy with the construction and we know he 's going to love the sound . He 's at the stage where he wants to bang on everything !
5 #### Nice little drum . My kids like it but they are still pretty young . I think as they get older they will use and love it even more . Nice looking , well made , great fun sound . I would buy this again . My boys received this as a gift last Christmas they were less than 1 yr and 3 1/2 yrs at the time .
5 #### My son loves his music class , esp when the teacher brings out the drums . These bongs are among his favorite , so I bought them for him for Christmas . They are a fine sound for kids -- obviously not adult bongo quality , but way better than the plastic drums other companies make for kids . Nice size , too
5 #### I highly recommend any of the Remo drums . We have this one and another one . They are great quality and have lasted through the beating my sons give them .
5 #### Very sturdy , built well , durable , and has a great sound ! I definitely recommend it . My son loves it and ca n't put it down ! Might be too small for a kid 8 years or older though .
3 #### Just ok . The price is good for such a large drum even if is for children . I expected a deeper and louder sound .
5 #### it is a big loud drum I bought for my niece to exact revenge on my sister for years of crap . I ca n't think of a better way to " send my love"- I 'll be buying a trumpet for her next birthday .
5 #### BOOM ! BOOM ! My kids ( and all of their friends ) love this drum . We originally saw it in our music class . It 's high quality , sturdy , sounds and looks great . We love it . I see why it 's called a Gathering Drum . It 's like a magnet for people and fun . Sturdy , well padded mallots come with it as well .
5 #### My daughter and niece both loved this co - operative game . It was a great buy ! I would recommend this for any preschool age children
3 #### The kids have a good time playing this , I just wish it were made a little better . The pieces are all a medium thickness cardboard and holding up okay . It would be nice if all of it could be made out of wood . I know that would make it more expensive , but I think it would be worth the extra price .
1 #### I bought this game because it promised a " green " experience for the entire family . i must say , i was highly disappointed . is it called " green " because you are dealing with vegetables ? So be it . My family could not find any interest in this game , not even my four year old whom we bought the game for . I did not find the added value of this game . do n't waist your money on this .
5 #### Our 3 y / o loves this game and we enjoy it too . It 's pictorial , so no number or word recognition is required , and the cooperative aspect makes it so much more enjoyable than Candyland !
5 #### Love Love this toy ! great buy Highly suggest it ! Gave it to our 1 year old for her birthday . It took her a few days to really figure it out but now she just bangs on it with a huge grin . After 3 months she still has n't tiered of it . not too annoying either !
5 #### Really nice drum for kids . The price is right . Will take some abuse . Maybe you do n't want to turn the tikes loose to hammer this thing into oblivion , but , if adults play along - perfection is attained . Our ( grandson ) tike is 2 years old and can produce a 4 count when accompanied by an adult . The fundamentals of music and math rolled into one fun experience . However , the supplied mallets may be easy on the ears of adults but they produce a dull thudding sound . Try real snare drumsticks . Really cheap ones work great . I really like the Zildjan 5A - dip sticks - yup , even for baby drummers . Toddlers have a great sense of what works and what does n't . The drum head is real polyester . It has a clear skin on the bottom and a " goat like " skin laminated on the top . Get some sticks and rock out with the little ones . Absolute , 100 percent recommended buy . As opposed to my thumbs down of the Remo 22 wide x 21 high " gathering drum " .
5 #### I am very impressed with the quality of this drum . It has a very nice sound , varying sound depending on where on the drum you hit . The picture around it is also very nice and rich in color . My baby is 9 months and loves to hit this drum with her hands . It comes with two sticks but she gets scared when i use them , so we stowed the sticks away for when she gets older .
5 #### Very well made , nice sounding and the kids love it . Comes with 2 mallets . Excellent for the beginner who is getting into the drums and the sound of music ! Makes a great gift for the grand kids ! Cloth sides with colorful animals adds a very nice touch !
5 #### Love this drum ! It is so durable and has a great sound . It comes with 2 drumsticks as other reviews have stated , so do not buy an extra drum stick !
5 #### If your child is interested in music / drumming , these are fantastic drums . REAL instruments made of the same materials used in professional models . Sturdy enough to take a beating from a toddler , but nice enough to display in your home and be used by the whole family . I consider the REMO Kid 's percussion drums to be a great investment and ca n't wait to add more to our collection .
5 #### Having used the Remo Kid 's Percussion line at a toddler music class , I was impressed with these REAL instruments that help to encourage children to create music . I was excited to bring them into our home and my son has enjoyed them ever since . These drums have real drumheads and sturdy bases , making them ideal for the rough - and - tumble play of toddlers . While we 're working on learning how to treat our instruments properly , it 's nice to know that these are able to take a beating and still look good as new . I 've even found my son STANDING on his bongos and they did not break or tear . The cost is high , but you wo n't need to buy them again- making these Remo drums a great value if you 're looking to invest in long - term toys that will see your kiddo through their childhood .
5 #### This is really a fun little drum . The sound is actually kinda nice , and not as loud or offensive as many children 's toys . The animal artwork on the sides is really nice , and my daughter has fun pointing out the animal faces she sees . The size is just right for toddlers . Also , the drum sticks are nicely padded balls on the ends of short sticks . In fact , the sticks are toys in and of themselves .
5 #### I ordered this through a wish list as a gift to a 1 year old boy . the drum was packaged well and is a good size for a kid . comes with 2 mallets , I think . the box was sealed so I could not see inside but I can hear the mallets moving about . the box has a peak through window so you can see the drum and the fabric . looked really nice to me and felt like a good drum even an adult could use . I hope our little cousin loves his gift and drums on it all the time . hopefully his parents wo n't hate us :)
5 #### From the moment it came out of the package until the present day I do n't think this drum sees one day where does n't have some use . Was a good purchas , e good quality . And the children absolutely love it . Basically it 's a professional drum at a very good price . Unless you hate drums you will not be disappointed
5 #### I bought this for my kids ( 3.5 and 9 months ) after using the same model in their music class . It produces a rich tone and is very sturdy which is important for use by little ones . The mallets are a nice addition so you can hear what it sounds like with a mallet vs your hand .
5 #### My son started playing one of these in music class . He loved it so much that we had to get one to have at home ! It 's very well made , has a great tone , and the mallets are well made too .
4 #### This drum is well made and has the feel of a real drum . My 1 yr old loves to drum on it , without the sticks , we 've put those away until she 's older . Great Quality , sturdy , stands up to her beatings . A little bigger than I thought , but my daughter does n't seem to mind .
5 #### This is my first of many kids instruments that I will purchase from this company in the future . The workmanship on this drum is sturdy and is just beautiful , the colors and design are of vibrant colors kids enjoy looking at . I had purchased a less expensive a few months ago and the sound to me was horrible and it did not last very long before it fell apart . My grand - children ages 19mo , 3yrs and 6 yrs just absolutely love playing on this drum . We play all kinds of music and nursery rhyme songs and they find a way to incorporate the drum .... so cute and I love it that they get enjoyment out of it .. their smiling little faces tell it all . Although I am not a professional at musical instruments by any means , I can pretty much tell by looking at it that this one will be durable and not fall apart like the other I had purchased . I do enjoy the sounds that the children can make on this drum and that s all that matters .. that we are all having fun and enjoying this instrument .
5 #### The 3 year old loves his drum , and so does his sister , parents , friends .... It came with two mallets but know this family , I bought extra mallets so everyone could get in on the action ! Highly recommend ! Price- incredible , shipping , very well protected .
4 #### These are the drums that we use at Music Together . But at the class we use the gathering drum . I did n't want one so big so I got this one . Pluses : It 's very sturdy and you can drum using the mallets or your hands . I can drum with my toddler . She loves it . Cons : It 's pretty loud . Not sure if it 's because we have hardwood floors and at Music Together class they have carpet . It 's a great drum , but louder than I expected .
5 #### I use this drum in music and movement classes I do with babies , toddlers , and preschoolers . It can get a little loud when the older kids all bang on it at the same time , but used in moderation , it 's great . The babies like to crawl all over it , drool on it , taste it , and everyone else pounds on it , and it still looks and sounds great . Minor wear and tear on the drum face from so much use and from being dragged in and out of my trunk over and over , but nothing too bad . It 's low to the ground , so all of the kids can easily get to it and it 's actually a great height for the babies to pull up on and stand . Highly recommended for anyone looking for a drum with a nice , full sound that kids can play . Would probably also work great for adults , I 've just never tried that !
5 #### I purchased this drum for my 1 1/2 year old daughter after we used one in music class . She really enjoys it ( and the sticks are helpful ) . All of the kids who visit sit on it and pound other things on it - no marks or signs of wear . As she gets older I think it 'll just become more fun .
5 #### Bought these for my 1 1/2 yr old . He is too young to play them . But that 's okay I 'll keep them for later . They are really nicely constructed .
5 #### My drumming obsessed 20 month old son loves this drum . He bangs away on it with the mallets and his hands . It 's loud , but it could be worse . It 's well made , sturdy , and is a quality product .
5 #### If you have a toddler that loves music I would highly recommend this drum . My nephew loves sitting on the bottom stair and literally pounding away at this . It has a lovely booming tone that 's properly pitched and not " tinny " or annoying in the way that kids musical instruments can often be . It takes the pounding and keeps on going too , there 's no worry that it 's not solid or he or it are going to be damaged . Comes with two mallets and really wonderful . Highly recommend it for any 12 - 36 month old .
5 #### My 3 and 1 year old sons love playing this drum . They play it with both the mallets and their hands . The sound has a deeper quality and tone , making it not as obnoxious as other toy drums they have . We 've had it for 2 months now and it is holding up great . I 'm happy with it .
4 #### Grabbd this for an extra drum on African Bell Carol.its not a boomer but it has sufficient tone to be a functional instrument in a classroom or concert setting .
5 #### My daughter is 2.5 and this was by far her favorite Christmas present . She uses it daily , and it has been holding up great despite the constant pounding . Ca n't wait to get more styles !
4 #### We got this butterfly garden for my daughter 's 8th grade science project . She is thrilled about it and gives it a big two thumbs up . Butterflies have n't come yet , but will get here after vacation for us . You can have the butterflies sent whenever you want . I really liked that part .
5 #### We are continuously adding to our home collection of instruments . Both of my children enjoy playing this drum . It has a nice sound , the mallets are comfortable to hold , and it is the perfect size . Even my husband and I enjoy playing it , using the included mallets or our hands . I 'm not a big fan of the pattern on the drum , but I guess they are trying to appeal to kids .
5 #### It 's loud ! Know that going in ... quality drum and will sound throughout the house . But it is nice sounding and for the money this seems to be a quality drum . My son loves it and plays it more than I would like :)
4 #### Love this drum , but pay attention to age recommendations . I purchased this for a 1 yr . old , but the mallets used to do the drumming , are long wooden ones . I quickly realized my mistake as Baby can only play this drum with one - on - one adult supevision . It 's too easy to fall onto one of these mallets and cause permanent damage to the throat , vocal cords , etc . The warning was there in the description , but I did n't thinkt this one through . Even a three year old should need complete supervision , It 's alright , just make it be a family or group experience .
5 #### We purchased this game many years ago , when our teen boys were young . They enjoyed it very much and spent hours playing this with their dad . The other day , I had it out to give away ... and they ( and my husband ) immediately rescued it saying I could n't get rid of it because The Secret Door was one of their favorite games . Seems we 'll be hanging on to this to play with our future grandchildren . The game is well made and illustrated with interesting detail . It is very simple to play with nothing to read , so even younger children can enjoy this game . While it is basically a memory game- you turn over tiles and try to match them , there is an element of urgency since you are working together against the clock ( grandfather clock tiles ) to find all matches . I liked that fact that it is cooperative . It took a bit of getting used to since my boys were used to competitive games , but playing cooperatively made for a calmer experience and no one was angry at the end- even if the ' clock ' did chime 13 .
5 #### We were playing with these at music class and my 10 - month - old son was in love with drum time . We decided to get one to have at home . He loves this drum . It sounds pretty good . He likes to bang it with his hands and the two included drumsticks . He also likes to turn it upside down and have us drum on the top while he feels it from the inside . He likes to know how things work and feel . We would buy this again in a heartbeat . He is now 18 months old and does n't seem as interested in it since he started walking ( at 16.5 months ) , but he still pulls it out occasionally .
4 #### Nice little drum , has a good sound , may take this on camping trips for campfire jams . Mallets are pretty wimpy , would look around for sturdy options if you plan on using them frequently .
5 #### Great drum . My 3 year old can stand on it and it does not even show any signs of distress . Love how it came with 2 mallets . Did n't love the design at first but it has grown on me and now I actually really like it . My girls all love it . 3 year old plays with it as well as my 1 year olds . Fun for everyone . Sounds great playing it with mallets or hands .
5 #### We bought this for our 21 month old grandson . It was an instant hit . He picked the mallets right up and played ... he loved it . The bottom is skidproof , the sides have colorful rainforest animals and the mallets fit right into little hands ( and big too ) . He played the drum all day and got it out again in the morning . Very high quality , looks great sitting in a room , an excellent choice for this age .
5 #### We just received this today so this review ca n't speak to the quality of the drum over time . We are very happy with it . It seems very well made and came with 2 " drumsticks . " It has a very nice rich tone to it . We bought this for our 2 year old and I can tell that this type of sound will be much easier to listen to than him beating on most cheap toy drums ( of course this is not an all the time toy ... we will only get it out when we want to play it and then put it away . Great for outside play also ) .
5 #### This drum never fails to attract the kids who come to share playdates with my grandson . It is beautifully and brightly decorated , big and solid , and it is a natural kid magnet . It has a beautiful tone when banged on by an infant or a toddler or one of the grown - up visitors who ca n't resist picking up the very sturdy drumsticks that come with it . It 's also strong enough to be danced on by the liveliest toddler .
5 #### I got this for my two year old granddaughter for Christmas so she has n't gotten it yet . But my own review is that this drum is made very nicely , looks and feels like a ' real ' as opposed to a ' toy ' drum . It came with two tom tom sticks , also very nice quality . I think this was a real bargain .
5 #### I was amazed at the size and quality of this Floor Tom . My granddaughter loves to drum on anything so I know she is going to love this . So colorful and the sound is wonderful
5 #### I bought this for Christmas for my daughter this year . I got the large size so she and my son can use it together . This is a very high quality real instrument drum .
5 #### We first saw this drum in the larger size at my 1 year old son 's kindermusic class . He absolutely loved it ! The drum is of great quality and makes a great sound . We purchased this smaller size mainly due to price and it is just as great as the larger size . The mallet is a good size , but my son prefers to just hit it with his hands and you sitll get a good clear tone out of the drum . The pattern on the side is very nice and helps blend in with a play room setting .
5 #### Compared to what else there is on the market , the Remo company has made good quality , sized down , affordable instruments for toddlers . I am really pleased with this drum which I purchased for my granddaughter 's 2 yr birthday . She is very interested in music . I figured I rather get her a real reproduction versus a plastic junkie drum . Gave this to her for her birthday and she has played it every day for the last month . She loves it ! ! At her party , she would n't open her other gifts because she was playing her drum .
5 #### My grand - daughter knew just what to do with these drums . She loved , as did I , the colorful outside jungle pictures around each one .
4 #### I would say the quality needs to be improved . It 's made like a cheap cardboard game . But , I have to say , my 7 year old daughter and 4 year old son still love this game ! It is a matching game with a twist . Before the game starts , you randomly pick ( from the pile of game pieces that are upside down ) 3 of the game pieces and place them under the cardboard door . Then you try to match all the pieces before you flip over all the clocks . When you think you have figured out which pieces are under the door , or if you have uncovered all the clocks , you make a guess . If you guess all pieces correctly you " save " those pieces from being stolen and win the game . Cute concept . Fun concept . Not sure how long the game with last quality wise .
4 #### Very cheaply made , little cards are hard to pick up , but overall a fun game and my son ( now 7yo ) still likes to play it
5 #### great toy ! Even though it is not intended for babies , my son has no problem playing with this floor tom . It is great to expose your children to music at an early age . My 9 month old tries to mimic the pattern that I play for him . He loves to play this with his hands and with the mallets . The bonus is that the mallet is too big to fit in his mouth . At this age , babies put everything in their mouths , so you must be careful . I am very happy with this purchase .
5 #### We could n't be happier with this . We got it for our 8 month old for christmas and he 's been obsessed with it ever since . Very well made .
5 #### My 1 1/2 yr old LOVES this drum ! It is good and sturdy and looks like it will survive for years . I decided on this one after I saw the same one in his toddler sunday school room , and it has survived a lot . Comes with two mallets , and the bright colorful drum !
4 #### They had this drum at my baby 's daycare and he loves it there so I bought one for our home . He loves banging on it and it is a great quality item - will last a long time .
5 #### great game ! this is the second " cooperative " game we 've gotten and we are really liking them . this one is a matching game , with the pieces being different valuable items , jewelry , golden goblet , painting , etc . you blindly pick out 3 pieces and slide them behind the secret door . then you take turns flipping pieces over to try finding matches . when you flip a piece over , its either a valuable item or a clock . if its an item , you flip another piece over to try to find its match . if its a clock , it goes up along the top of the board - once you get a certain amount of clocks , 12 I think , you lose the game , time has run out . the point of the game is to figure out which 3 valuable items have been hidden behind the secret door , by flipping pieces over and figuring out which ones you do n't have a match for . we 've played the game probably 6 times and have only won it - figuring out what the 3 pieces are before we flipped over all the clocks - once . its fun though . and its cooperative , so you can help each other remember what item is where . my 7yr old son and I love playing it .
3 #### I have similar games and I had higher expectations . Along with an annoying email they send to get 5 stars , this game was a disappointment . My students played this game once and were done ! They will play other cooperative games all day long , but not this one .
5 #### A drum was a last minute item that Santa decided to add to my 2.5 year old son 's Christmas haul . The toy store was sold out of one seen earlier in the season ... thank goodness , because this drum is GREAT ! It 's only slightly more expensive than the one at the toy store , but the quality is fantastic ! It 's very kid friendly and colorful , and the sound is so great that the adults ca n't help wanting a turn ! I highly recommend this product . Like I said , this was a last minute Santa item ordered last week . But , Santa is an Amazon Prime customer , and this favorite gift arrived in plenty of time for the big morning !
5 #### When I taught Pre - K years ago , I had these in my classroom . Now , as a homeschooling mom of 3 , I still love this drum . My 7 month old even enjoys playing this durable drum . I ca n't say enough about how fun it is to play together as a family of 5 ! :)
3 #### Great product ! But be aware that you receive a voucher for caterpillars and have to pay and additional $ 7.95 for shipping for those .
5 #### Durable enough for a practice tunnel for agility dogs and my grandchildren to play in . Nice length , well thought out fasteners . I purchased this again so I could add to my practice agility course .
5 #### Fun for my four and seven year old . I enjoy playing also .
5 #### You would n't think this simple , kinda chintzy , game would be a family favorite but it 's actually quite fun ! The graphics are laughable and the cards are dreadfully thin and flimsy which makes me wonder how durable they will be , but the concept is actually a really smart one . The players work together ( which is a refreshing change to the competition aspect of other games ) and the idea of having to beat the clock is what makes this so fun . It 's essentially a memory game but again , it 's the idea of having to find matches before midnight that kinda makes it intense . We play many rounds of this during our family game night . And the secret door is really whimsical . Our daughters like to open it with a resounding " creeeeeeek ! " So cute !
5 #### This game is sort of like a cross between memory and Clue ( though much less complicated and with theft , not murder ) . My husband and I play it with our five year old daughter and we all really enjoy it . As others have mentioned , this is not the highest quality board and the cards are tiny and flimsy and would have been better had they at least been laminated , but keep everything in the little Ziploc bag included , keep out of reach of toddlers , and be sure to count your pieces when putting this game away so as not to lose anything and you 'll be fine . I did n't deduct any stars for this because I look at it as a good way to teach your children to be careful with their things and I 'm pleased to see that the game is manufactured in Canada and NOT in China . Overall , a fun game for family game night .
3 #### Cute concept , but it 's pretty cheap materials ( paper cards ) , I 'm going to need to laminate these so they will last longer . It 's basically a memory game .
4 #### I like this game because it uses simple logic to plan how to deal with ice and snow storms . Also , the fact that it is cooperative , makes it a great game to bring up conversation about why or why not to do something . If you 've ever lived in the snow belt , having a plan to shovel out is helpful , so this game helps young kids to start learning these skills . I also love that a bag is provided to put all of the little pieces so they do not walk away between games . Amy
5 #### I purchased this drum for my 4 year old son who has cerebral palsy . It makes a very pleasant sound when banged on . It also makes an interesting sound when scratched with your fingers . It has encouraged him to work on finger isolation due to this . It was an added bonus for this . The colors are very bright and true to the photo . It is very well made and $ 30 I paid for it . There are n't many toys that I can say that about . My son is very rough on toys ( chewing , banging , etc ) and it has held up very well . He has had this toy for approximately 6 months and it still looks brand new . I 've noticed some people reviewing it saying they only got one mallet , but mine came with two . I highly recommend this drum to anyone with kids .
5 #### I got this for my son 's first bday . He liked the sound right away . Helped him develop coordination - Three months later , he can hit the drum with the sticks as well as his hands . Very nice sound . Very high quality . Made well . My son likes to sit on it and bounce up and down - makes a nice little chair for him too . We like playing it as well . Love it ! great deal !
5 #### i bought this for my nephew ( 2 y / o ) . it is awesome ! ! it sounds so good and has a real deep sound . i purposely bought it along with a set of kids bongos to drive my brother crazy . i m 28 years old and i find myself playing it everytime i go over his house . A year and half now and it is still holding up to the punishment of a 2 year old boy , a 5 year old girl and a 10 month old boy . Def a good buy .
5 #### I bought this directly from seller , not through amazon . Bought it when there were about 1 , and now 1.5 years old . Nothing bad to say about this at all . durable , sound is great . my kids either jump on top of the drum and dance , sit on it , or turn over to sit & play inside ... and drum still looks like new .
4 #### This game looks pretty flopsy . Everything is low quality paper BUT the concept behind it is fun and we all really enjoy it . It is a unique game and it 's a fun low stress game where we can help each other . I would not recommend as a gift as it looks pretty low quality , but otherwise would recommend . My 4 year old and 7 year old enjoy it .
3 #### The concept of this game was pretty good . I have a six year old and he enjoys playing it . It is like memory with a bit of a twist . I was disappointed with the quality of the game . The game board is small and flimsy and the pieces are very thin .
4 #### Idea is great but quality of pieces and cards could be better
4 #### As a homeschool family I bought this to help my son learn his multiplication tables . The product is good over all but it would be better if the answers showed up clearer when the button is pushed . The answer is a little hard to see .
5 #### This product is very good quality . It 's exactly what I was looking for . I chose this product , because the tunnels in the toy section of the department store are cheaply made and I need something durable . I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good quality tunnel ,
5 #### I bought this for two of my Grandchildren at " Christmas " and they love it . It is made of pretty good quality material also .
4 #### Bought this for my 15 month old son to use at the beach . It was the perfect size to bring in our suitcase . Easy to set up , secured it on a windy beach with a backpack and book inside the tent .
3 #### So I like this tent in concept - bought it to take my little girl to the beach - but in reality unless you have someone to help you or hold your baby this is a real pain to set up . I tried setting it up on my wood floor in my house and the rods scratched the floor at one point trying to get them into the little slots .... I ended up not taking this to the beach with me because it was easier to just put my daughter on a beach towel and give her a bunch of sun screen and not stay out for too long .
1 #### I bought this for the beach . The issue it 's very flimsy .
5 #### Love it ! Super easy to assemble . Baby keeps cool at the beach or park !
3 #### This drum is extremely high quality and the sound is great for the price but I find that my child was senselessly banging on a drum and then just got bored of it after a while . I think for the same price parents should consider the alternative toy " Toysmith Parum Pum Pum Drum " . The quality on this Remo percussion is 10x better but the playtime on the Parum Pum Pum Drum is exponentially better of kids . There 's more musical gadgets and doohickeys that come with the Parum Pum Drum and although it does n't have a better drum sound , my eardrums and sanity gladly welcomes the more soother and subtle sounds .
5 #### My son received this as a gift for his 1st birthday and it was the biggest hit at the party with the other toddlers ( 9 months-2 years ) as well as parents . A few parents said " this is so much nicer than the toy drum my kid has . " I like this drum because it sits off the floor so the sound is good ( versus a djembe , which needs to be on its side to play ) . The sound is really good with bare hands or with the mallets . He also likes to roll it around on its side , and that is fine too . It says this toy is for 3 years and up , but it seems safe for a one year old . The only small part I noticed were two staples holding the ribbon around the top of the drum together . They are really tight in there , and I do n't think a kid could pull them out , but I 'm sure those can be removed , since glue is also holding the ribbon . The mallets might also be dangerous for babies ( if they put it in their mouth or poke themselves in the eye ) but the mallets are n't needed to play the drum . The face of the drum seems a little thin , so I hope it holds up to the abuse my son is sure to give it . I think that it will . Overall , this was my favorite toy . Beats any battery operated toy any day . It teaches fantastic coordination skills . I highly recommend .
4 #### THEY DRUM IS GREAT BUT THE PICTURE IS VERY MIS - LEADING . I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER THINKING TO SPEND THE EXTRA MONEY AND GET 3 DRUMS LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWS . SHOULD HAVE READ THE DESCRIPTION BETTER . YOU ONLY GET ONE DRUM . ITS A GRET DRUM BUT ONLY 1 FOR $ 50 . I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BEEN SCAMMED
5 #### This percussion is like a real one , just made for children . Excellent quality . Love the sound . My son loves it . Will be very difficult for him to break it ( and he is a professional in breaking stuff ) .
5 #### My now 3 year old daughter has had this drum since she was about 6 months old . It is super sturdy ! ! She loved it then , and loves it now . It has a very pleasant sound , even when she is banging away I usually do n't mind . It seems to bring out the rhythm from her heart ! My 7 month old son now loves it too . We just sit him in front of it and he pats and hits away , also with rhythm . We love this little drum , and it just dawned on me it is the perfect baby gift , especially if your friends are at all musically inclined . The whole family will love it , and it will last for years to come . SOLID ! !
5 #### My son loves it I managed to get the drum on sale for Christmas nice sound good quality sturdy colorful what more can I say its a Remo I would expect nothing less than quality two mallets came with it nice instrument can not wait to purchase more my son has really opened up to music with these and even when he is banging away the drum is not annoying
4 #### Seems a lot harder to push the buttons than I remember . Fun way to learn !
5 #### Toy from the old school that still works so well and the kids love working with this
5 #### We love this game at our house ! It 's easy enough that my 4 year old is able to understand and enjoy it ! It 's fun for the whole family !
5 #### We love all the family pastime games . They are different
5 #### I purchased this for my son 's 5th birthday party to meet a theme requirement . I found it durable and well made . The kids loved it .
5 #### This was bought back in December as a Christmas present for my 19 month old son who is now two . He loves to play in his tunnel - crawling down the hallway between his room and the living room . This tunnel is a blast when he has his little friends over for play dates . They play and squeal for what feels like hours . This tunnel is a great value for its size and quality . My husband has a great time playing , too ! I 'm sure we will have many years of wonderful fun as our family grows !
3 #### I ordered this as a Christmas present , and I wo n't lie . It 's VERY tiny for a boardgame , so tiny it fit in my mailbox ! Plus , it is very cheaply made . Everything is cardboard , even the tokens . I 'm sure it 's a fun game but I expected better .
5 #### I purchased this for my 5 year old son and it has quickly become one of our favorite games to play . I agree with other reviewers who talk about the quality of the game itself . Our board is also warped ( we 've been able to bend it to flatten it some ) and the pieces are simply cardboard . However the board is very appealing to look at and the game play is excellent . It is interesting and complex enough to keep adults and kids entertained . It seems to be the right amount of challenge for my son and he loves the idea of getting his friends and family safely through the storm and helping them run their errands . This game is actually one of the few games he 's willing to sit through . I paid twelve dollars and just ordered another game by this company and I 'm sure I 'll order more in the future .
2 #### I 'm sorry I really , really wanted to like this game . I have hesitated to buy it . I am a Speech - Language Pathologist and I am " known " for the great games I bring to my sessions . I was disappointed long before I showed it to any of the kiddos I work for . The game is cheaply made . :( Very poor quality ! The game board is warped . The pieces do n't all pop out and I 'm guessing this is an issue because there is note that says not to force them but to have scissors to cut them with . REALLY ! I often like the kids to help me learn a new game . If I had done that with this one , they would have torn the pieces . The board with all the pieces is very visually difficult . I live on an island in remote Alaska and was so excited to get this game . Running errands ahead of a storm or hoping the ploughs and sanders was out is something the kids could relate to . I 'm sorry very disappointed
4 #### This game is fun . There are a few different game suggestions that make the game harder , which you will need . So far we have n't lost a single game . The game has a cheap feel to it . The board is fine , but the cards that come with it are cut out . The cards seem to hold up though , so far none are damaged . My kids are 6 and 7 .
5 #### I have bought every game that this company offers & I love each one . This one takes a bit longer to play then the others , but it 's just as much fun . I believe game play has been covered . Yes the pieces are small & not heavy cardboard . However we have n't had any problems with them & we play the games all the time . My oldest son has autism & a game really has to be interesting to keep his focus . He loves & plays all of the Family Pastimes games . He quickly loses interest with a regular roll the dice & move type board game . Please also check out all the other offers from this company . My boys are ages 5 & 7 . They can easily play all the Family Pastimes games . As stated the older one is special needs . I was so happy to finally find a set of games that he enjoys so we can do something together as a family . I suggest these games to those who have children who are high functioning autistic & ADHD . ( of course I suggest them for normal functioning children as well )
3 #### I was hoping I 'd be able to nurse baby in here but it 's too small . Overall though it 's a good size for just baby to hang out in
5 #### We bought this drum for our son for a Christmas gift and it might just be his favorite this year . We wanted some kind of drum that our son could experiment with because he loves music . Many of the solo drums that are available in places like Guitar Center have sharp nuts and bolts on the underneath that can cut up some fingers . We liked this drum because it has nothing like that and is very safe . It is also very durable and seems like it will last a long time and take whatever abuse our son can dish out . It sounds great and he loves using the included drum sticks or just his hands to play it . We are so happy with this product that we are going to get some more Remo drums of different sizes , they are awesome !
5 #### I bought this drum for my grandson . My daughter was amazed at the quality and beauty of the drum . My grandson loved it from the moment he saw it . Beautiful product , thank you very much .
5 #### The Remo drum w / Mallet is an extremely durable drum . A friend of mine got it as a gift for their daughter when she was one . She is now four and has a little brother . The drum has been used on a daily basis and has genuinely been loved and played with . I totally disagree with the reviewer that gave this " toy " a 3 star review . Any " toy " that can survive three years of play with two toddlers and loved that much is not a " toy " in my book ! I have seen the children use the mallets or sticks with the drum . I have even seen them stand on the drum . At the end of the day , we put our marching band instruments back onto the shelf and give them a rest ! A truly memorable gift and I am here tonight buying it for yet another little one 's first Christmas . A gift that shall be enjoyed for many years and not one that breaks on Christmas day . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! !
3 #### The issue with this is that the buttons are difficult to press down and the answer beneath is very faint and hard to see . I bought this to combine with tablet apps and flash cards . I 'd skip it .
3 #### Pretty hard to push down and the numbers are really faint . Great concept but not very useful for my kids , unfortunately
5 #### I bought this to help my autistic 8 yr old with his math homework . He 's learning through the repetition !
2 #### love the concept , but the numbers scrape off the keys VERY easily and then they 're unreadable . Trash
4 #### My 5 - year old enjoys playing this game . It 's a fun ( and more advanced ) spin on the traditional memory game . I love how it 's a collaborative game , so you do n't have to keep playing round after round to ensure everybody feels like a winner . The only reason I am not giving 5 stars , is the poor quality of the board and the game cards . They are made of thin cardboard and simply wo n't stay flat .
5 #### This game is simple and fun ! It 's different each time you play , and there is n't a winner or loser , which is helpful for my son . He loves solving the mystery over and over again !
4 #### Got this game to take on a weekend cabin ( no tv ) get away . My 4 & 1/2 year old son , hubby and I really enjoyed playing it . It is memory with a twist and clue combined . The cards are not sturdy ( hence the 4 stars instead of 5 ) but i think i will laminate them to increase their lifespan .
5 #### One of the most fun cooperative games ever ! It 's easy to learn , and suspenseful in a non - scary way .
5 #### THIS IS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER , IT IS VERY CUTE AND SEEMS TO BE OF VERY GOOD QUALITY . IT WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DAUGHTER SO THERE IS NO GUILT FOR THE NOISE IT MAY MAKE ! MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES MUSIC AND THE PRINT IS ADORABLE !
5 #### My son ( now 18mos ) loves this drum ! The sound quality is excellent for a toy drum , and it is extremely durable . It 's the perfect height for a stool , and my son sits on it all the time and the skin has n't drooped or worn at all .
5 #### Simple set up , decent quality for price ! Very portable !
5 #### Easy to set up and pretty stylish . Could do with some hooks to secure to the ground as an extra safety .
5 #### Great gift . I have purchased this for my own kids as well as two of my nieces . My oldest niece still sees generations of these butterflies in their yard 10 years later . A fun and educational activity that is really engaging for kids . My only complaint is that even though the website says there is a free voucher for caterpillars but you have to pay $ 8 - $ 30 for shipping which bothered me when I thought I was giving this as an all - inclusive gift .
1 #### Its not a voucher if you have to pay 7.95 . I regret buying this as a gift .
2 #### So , I miss read it . There are no caterpillars with this . But , it is also NOT a kit . It is the cage and a green thing with no instructions on what it is .
5 #### I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter . She loves it . Mostly memory matching , but we both enjoyed it .
3 #### It 's a great cooperative game . I imagine with as flimsy as the materials are that they produce it with , it wo n't hold up will with young children .
1 #### As others have pointed out , the materials are inexplicably low - quality . The board does n't lie flat and the pieces are so flimsy that it 's hard to handle them and they skitter all over the board when we 're trying to play . They 're also a little small . The real mystery is how you 're supposed to play . There are a dozen " time cards " and once you 've turned them up , that 's it - you 're done . If you 've matched some cards already , fine , you know those are n't the ones that are hidden , but for the ones you have n't had a chance to see yet ( because you - by pure chance - turned up time cards first ) , you 're just guessing . There 's very little room for reasoning out an answer . We LOVE logic games , just do n't see the point of this one .
3 #### Hard to see the numbers once you press down
5 #### I found none of the incorrect answers as stated in some other reviews . These are very durable as my 7 grandkids play with them daily . They are a big help to my 2nd and 3rd graders who are memorizing their multiplication tables and the younger ones just love pushing the buttons down and acting like they know the numbers . They all enjoy them .
5 #### Had one of these when i was little . My niece needed something to help her with math . Perfect !
5 #### We bought this for our daughter 's first birthday . She absolutely loves it ! Double fisting drumsticks , she has earned the nickname bam - bam .
5 #### Easy to put up , easy to take apart , big enough for my baby plus her curious cousins lol I used it by the pool so put a blanket to make it soft , kept my baby safe from bugs and the sun , yet allowed her to see everything and get that nice summer breeze making her sleep outside so comfortable , actually made me jealous at times lol
5 #### My kids LOVE this drum . With this drum a great time is had by all ! It satisfies a lot of needs , beating stuff , making loud noises , & jamming like a fiend ... They have a great time and are learning about musical basics ( rhythm - etc . ) It is sturdy and holding up well . Not the most resonant tone , but decent . Just plain fun , we need to get more .
5 #### Bought for four year old , used by older kids as well . This drum is very durable , it has taken quite a beating ( no pun intended ) and is in perfect shape still . It has an attractive look to it and a good sound as well . It 's a quality instrument for children at a great price . Would definitely recommend if you are growing a collection of children 's instruments for home or daycare , etc . UPDATE : 2 years later and my son is still using it . It 's held up perfectly despite the fact that he uses all kinds of things around the house as drum sticks ( including his feet ! Other parents have commented on it in a positive way , it 's attractive and the patter on it is a little different than what you might find in a department store .
5 #### I use this in my counseling office and have given it to a friend 's children . They all love it and want to play it again and again . It 's wonderful to watch kids play cooperatively rather than competitively , though it may take a few minutes for some kids to get the point .
4 #### none of the " let 's be now " approach . Simply by playing the game , children learn that cooperation can accomplish a lot m ore than competition .
4 #### The Secret Door is a game I have in my gifted classroom . This is definitely a winner . I could see families enjoying this game , as well . The game pieces are a bit subpar in quality , but the game is so different from typical board games that I can look over this problem . I would recommend this game for a gifted classroom and for families .
5 #### Granddaughter love this . A fun way to do your times tables . Easy learning .
4 #### I am loving the cooperative games in therapy with kids who have difficulty playing games , and ca n't deal with losing . Max the Cat is my favorite with younger kids though .
3 #### I thought this game would be better made ; mostly consists of very small cardboard pieces . But it 's OK for the low price . Played it several times on Christmas and is good that it is a cooperative game , especially for the younger kids who get easily discouraged with games that are competitive .
5 #### These games are the best ! They have really helped my little ones cooperate , instead of compete . If you want games that have a positive impact on your children or your family , these are absolutely the way to go . We can sit and play a half dozen of Family Pastimes ' cooperative games with only very good feelings at the end of game night , which has a lasting positive effect on my children 's relationship with one another and on my sanity as a mother . Another nice aspect of these games is that they have a nice narrative quality . We especially like this little game of mystery and memory , which is a race against the clock . It 's a favorite of my daughter , who enjoys Nancy Drew and mysteries . It is true that these games are not the sturdiest ; They require children exercise care and caution . You have to expect them to put the game pieces awat nicely , but we have had no problem with that , even with children who are n't always perfectly well behaved . The boxes themselves , though , are actually very sturdy and of much better quality than you 'd find from more mainstream companies . Also , if you get a bunch of these Family Pastimes games , they stack beautifully and are quite inviting for children to chose from . Likewise , I find the homespun aesthetics of these games and the artwork quite appealing , much more satisfying than some of the more overproduced stuff out there .
1 #### I totally agree with the other reviewers : the quality is very poor . damage the card in the beginning . very easy to lose small cards . very cheap made . does not worth $ 12 . The idea is fun . But there are other better games at this price(I mean quality ) . BTW , there is no way to contact the seller or manufacturer . No phone number , no response . Do not buy this . Buy something made in U.S. At least you can talk to someone when there is a problem .
5 #### Wow ! ! ! I got this for my daughter for Christmas . I have n't given it to her yet , but I had to try it out . What a great sound ! Very impressed with the tone and the construction for the price . Highly recommended ! ! !
3 #### As many other reviewers have mentioned , the quality of manufacture for this game is really poor . The pieces are made of very thin cardboard with no coating over the image side for added strength / durability , unlike most cardboard game pieces . When you initially receive the game the pieces are all stuck together as part of a thin cardboard page and you have to pop the pieces out . Unfortunately , when popping them out they very , very easily rip and many of ours now have rips on the back . It would be easy for someone playing the game a lot to realize which cards have what ripped backs , therefore taking away some of the excitement of the game ( you 're not supposed to know what each card is until you turn it over ) . The game is pretty inexpensive ( we paid $ 12ish for it ) , but we 've bought other games for comparable prices that were far superior in construction ( not falling apart day one ) Our daughter is 7 1/2 an she likes this game . She 'll play it alone or with others . I do n't know how long it will last due to the poor quality of manufacture , but for the time being she 's happy . SUMMARY : Young kids like it , but it 's very poorly made .
5 #### We have played it only a few times . I bought this game for my 5 year old son with not so good memory to practice it . We do many varieties of memory games as long as my son loves it . This memory type game was a hit with all 3 of my children : ages 11 , 8 , and 5 . They played it many times and we 've had it only for 2 days :) . The only bad thing I have to say is it 's durability . Board is good , but the little cards are the type you punch out , they have little nobs on sides and cards are thin . To make this game last longer I glued all cards onto cork lining with an adhesive backing . It works great , cards will last longer this way .
4 #### This has been great for my kids , but some of the plastic buttons have stopped popping back out when pushed down . Disappointing , but only a minor issue after several years of use .
5 #### This is one of my kids favorite toys of all time . The drum itself is very durable . Both of my kids have stood on it - and beat it like you would n't believe and it still looks brand new ( besides the crayon marks all over the top ) . Last Christmas , I bought my kids many instruments and this is by far one of the best purchases that I made . My now 1 - year old son has loved playing with this for the past 6 months . At first , he would only use his hands to beat it and now he uses the mallets . My daughter also loves to play lots of songs for me . Great purchase !
5 #### My husband bought this for our 2 year old and she loves it , makes a wonderful sound that 's not irritating , it 's actually very nice to listen to . Only problem is that our daughter uses it on occasion as a step stool or a seat , which it 's definitely not meant for , so watch the little ones !
5 #### I bought this for my 10 month old . She loves it ! It sounds so much better than the toy drums that are out there . I do n't mind the banging as a result ( it 's definitely better than pots and pans ) ! I do n't think it 's super loud though but maybe I can tolerate loud noises . Great quality . The mallets are not appropriate for babies b / c there is a twisty wire holding the cover in place which could be taken apart and swallowed , so I did not let my baby use the mallets for now . But she is able to play the drum just fine with her hands .
5 #### The kids love it,,it is the READING TENT in the playroom
2 #### I did not realize that this kit does not include live caterpillars ! Super bummed
5 #### This is a great teaching tool and easy to travel with .
5 #### Helped my child memorize multiplication tables without " boring " flashcards or whining . My child enjoyed this like a toy . My child is very tactile .
2 #### Bought this for my five yo who plays it in his class . The overall compostion of the game is so cheap . It is like it was made on a copy machine . The cards are paper thin , and will not last over time . After setting up the game , many of the cards were already bent . Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated . Maybe I 'm impatient , but I just did not get it . There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made . I 'm just not sure that this is one of them .
2 #### We 've had the game for almost a year and we 've only played it when it arrived . Frankly , my 5 year old daughter and I did n't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews . Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy ( has a home made feel ) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things . My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software , which we love . So , this game is not much fun , not well made , not very stimulating , yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it !
4 #### I guess it 's the theme , but I like this game alot more than I should . It is definitely a kid 's game , and it is n't something I would play with just grown - ups , but still . I like finding all the little treasures . My six - year - old son has Pokemon cards , Rat - A - Tat - Cat , Guess the Pokemon Game , Castle Keep , Sorry Sliders , Incan Gold , and this game . Of all of them , The Secret Door is my favorite . The treasure and clock cards are tiny and thin , and the board is pretty small , so if you need top of the line components you might want to steer clear .
5 #### Used on a beach vacation . Great place for our Grandson after he fell asleep while playing the in the ocean .
5 #### Grandchildren love these so much they even quiz each other with them ! ! So glad I ordered them ! !
3 #### Numbers are a little difficult to see , but for price it was n't a bad purchase .
1 #### Not great , 4 year old has a hard time seeing the answer . 5 yr . old , had a hard time seeing the numbers .
3 #### Used it one time , and it broke . There 's a string in side of the pole and it just snapped , making it useless . Up until this happened , it seemed to be a nice beach tent . It was plenty large enough for our 12mo old ( 25 pounds , 29 " ) to nap comfortably .
4 #### Its a total pain in the butt to put together but it is a decent tent for the price .
5 #### My daughter got this for Christmas in 2014 and she still loves to play in it . I guess it is the hiding place aspect of it that kids love . She takes her toys in there , books , iPad , anything . I can count on her to hide in the during the day and keep busy . It is so easy to put together and take down . I have done it about 20 times and it is not a hassle at all . It is extremely small when stored and you can take it anywhere . Definetly would recommend .
3 #### it good for taking places for your little kid but its easy to cheat off of .
5 #### I had almost the exact same toy as a child to help learn the multiplication table . So I bought this for my daughter .
5 #### Bought for a co - worker to share with her neice
1 #### wonderful idea yet the numbers are slowly rubbing off making it not useful .
3 #### More on the expensive side once you consider you still have to pay $ 8 to have the caterpillars shipped to you . Figured for the price it would include everything .
5 #### This was purchased as part of our homeschool butterfly unit . My 5 year old loves watching the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly . The butterfly habitat was great quality . The caterpillars were purchased separately but arrived alive and all survived .
5 #### 8 yr old grandson works well to help with math facts
5 #### We decided to buy this tent last minute before our recent beach trip . I could n't be happier that we did ! ! It was SO nice to have as a little escape for little ones on the beach . I 'll admit my 7 month old was n't able to nap for more than a few minutes in there , but that was n't a surprise based on his sleep habits at home . He did really enjoy having a nice , comfortable , sand - free place to play with his toys though . Even my 3 & 5 year olds went in for a few little breaks from the beach action . One of my main worries in ordering this tent was that it would be a pain to pack in our checked luggage for our flight - it folds up SO small . I think someone in a review mentioned " about the size of a loaf of bread " - exactly ! And probably no heavier than bread either ! It assembles with the simple two criss - crossed poles , much like other play tents we have at home . The mesh screens seemed to keep the sand out even on a super windy Florida day . We did put small coolers in there with the baby as an extra safety measure , so he did n't take flight in the wind . On a normal day I think a baby 's weight would be fine . All in all , ca n't recommend enough , especially for a beach trip !
5 #### This is great for the price . Easy to set up and take down . Not very stable , so a child does need supervision when playing in it .
5 #### Worked perfect for our 6 month old at the beach !
2 #### The assembly instructions are unclear and I could not get this thing to look right
5 #### My son is in 1st grade and was curious about multiplications . Great toy to get him thinking .
4 #### Hoping my son can memorize this . It helped my daughter a great deal.when she was little .
1 #### Waste of money , u have to pay 5.99 more for the insects
5 #### Very fun activity that the whole family can enjoy for weeks at a time . Would recommend this to anyone with children or interest in butterflies !
1 #### a wonderful idea yet the numbers are slowly rubbing off making it not useful .
4 #### I had one of these when I was little , and wanted my son to have one . He is in Kindergarten and they are working hard on math currently . I absolutely love this toy / learning machine , but I wish the numbers below were easier to see . When you push the buttons down the numbers are really faint below . We both have 20/20 vision , but often are squinting to see the answers . Regardless , I think it still serves its purpose .
4 #### Love these ! ! ! So simple . No batteries needed . Great tool for learning
5 #### this was a gift for school for are grandchildren
5 #### my son loves this I love that it has addition and subtraction on one board . we practice while I cook , clean , drive , this keeps my son interested and I ca nt wait to see improvement in his work .
3 #### I had one of these as a child . The concept is really fun ! My kids ( 1st and 2nd grade - and even their 3 year old brother ) like it a lot . The only really bad thing is the number problems are starting to wear off . We used it for a day or two before it happened , but their fingers pushing the buttons ( which is what the toy is designed to do ) have worn off the math problems rendering the toy pretty much useless . Too bad . It was a really fun idea ! I 'll probably go back and rewrite with a sharpie then cover with clear fingernail polish , but really ? The one I had as a kid lasted for years and years !
4 #### Used this on the beach for our toddler on a Caribbean vacation . It was easy to set up and put away , and it kept out the sun . She mostly played in it since she did n't like the sand .
5 #### Even my older kids climbed in to play with their baby sister . It has enough room , yet is compact enough to fit about anywhere . Construction seems good so far . Easy to set up . Just like any other kids tent . I love it !
4 #### Flimsy , hard to put together , and does n't stake into the ground . This is fun for play but do n't take it anywhere windy and do n't expect it to last long .
4 #### Only giving a 4 because I was expecting the butterflys to come with but u have to by those seperatly so now we have to wait tell next summer and order the catipillars
5 #### Works great ! Just what we needed to help our children learn their multiplication table !
4 #### Ok does its job . But it 's a little hard to see the answers clearly . I thought the answer would have popped up . But you need to push it down to see through the plastic square to see the answer .
2 #### I was very excited to get a non battery educational item for my grandson . I guess in my memory of years ago this was a better product . The concept is great , easy to use . BUT you are suppose to press down and see the number . It is so faint you can hardly see it ! I mean you could n't have used a very dark black ink so it would show up ? I would rather it be battery operated and lit up ! I have to send it to him now as too late to return as I leave for out of town tomorrow . Did I get a dud ? Did everyone else 's come with a dark number you can see easily ? As much as I like the concept I would definitely by pass this toy . Which is a shame because they could have fixed so easily .
2 #### I bought this because I remember wanting one when I was younger - and I thought it would be better than flash cards since- flash cards tend to go missing or bend and tear . However , the writing on this toy runs off over time from the oil from fingers . I had to re - write a few and put clear tape ontop to keep it from rubbing off . I only had it for less than a month and I had hoped it would last longer .
5 #### I bought this for my 5yr old 's . The kids had fun playing with game . They seem to be learning and they like that they can use and check their own answers themselves . I had one similar ( multiplication ) when I was a kid and I loved it & remember learning my times tables for it .
5 #### We love this game . My kids played it when they were growing up and I bought a new one for my grandson . I love when the kids come up with creative ways to use objects to over come the obstacles to waking the princess . I 've played this game hundreds of times and I still never mind when a little person pulls it out of the closet and asks to play .
5 #### The kids love this game . Had to chat with an Amazon customer service rep and they were fantastic !
4 #### My girls love playing this ! It is smaller than I expected and the pieces are n't even as thick as cardstock . They enjoy saving the princess though ... :)
5 #### My daughter got this for her 5th birthday . We played it 5 times in a row the night she got it ! It is a great game - the rules are somewhat fluid leaving room for creativity and story telling . After playing through once we both understood the rules and had a great time trying to rescue the princess . Since it is cooperative , younger children wo n't get as frustrated when they " lose " as everyone has lost together . There is no reading required so anyone can play .
4 #### Our girls love playing the game . After the first game or two they loved coming up with imaginative stories for using the tools to solve the obstacles .
5 #### Daughter loves this butterfly kit . Every larvae turned into butterflies .
5 #### This is recommended to any bug lover out there .
5 #### I love this product . I do math stations in my classroom and my students love to play some multiplication games . A lot of times , my students will answer a math multiplication card on a board game and if their partner disagrees with the product given , they 'll check it on the board . It 's such a life saver . My students did n't like having to look the answer up on a chart or a table . They prefer checking their answer on the board . Some reviews have complained that the buttons stick , but that has n't happened . I hope to Purchase more next year .
4 #### Very good buy for any school age child to help with multiplication numbers worth every penny
2 #### I really had high hopes for this toy , but the numbers rub off easily .
5 #### My kids are loving to practice their math home work . It helps me so that I can still ask them questions or they ask me while they have to answer in hand . so we can practice while cooking diner or on the road .
2 #### I bought a few of these games from this company due to all the hyped up reviews . Very cheaply made , not that great . There are a lot better games out there .
5 #### From a parent 's perspective , this is a great game that teaches cooperation and creativity . The players must work together to rescue the princess , rather than competing against each other to win . The mechanics are very simple , as befits a game made for the 4 - 6 age range . It is fairly easy to win , but you can still easily lose on a few bad rolls . In addition to the cooperative play and creative use of certain items , there is also a memory aspect to this game that I 've found the children tend to do better at than the adults . It is very educational and a good introduction to cooperative gaming and teamwork in general . From a gamer 's perspective , it is interesting to see the seed from which cooperative games like Battlestar Galactica and Arkham Horror evolved . The mechanics are simple , but very sound . The Night Cards are not so different from the Night Counter in Last Night on Earth , or other games that tick down to conclusion , and the players must use creativity to win or lose as a team .
1 #### Returned the item . Spend the extra money and buy the learning resources or lakeshore learning brand . You ca n't see the answers on this one because your fingers are in the way since the number is under the plastic cover ... even little fingers . The other versions numbers are on the sides of the keys when they pop up .
4 #### Used to have one of these growing up . Bought my son one when I saw it . Only thing that is bad ... is that like the other reviewers said I wish the answers were a little bit more clear .
2 #### Chipping off paint on the buttons . Before long all the equations painted on the buttons will be scratched of just from normal use . :/ disappointed
1 #### Caterpillars arrived already dead . Habitat was nice though , bigger than I thought it would be . My daughter was disappointed that she was watching a dead bug for so long waiting for something to happen . LOL
5 #### I 'm so glad I found this online ! This learning tool was a great resource for me as a child . My youngest daughter was struggling with her math facts . Using this toy , she has increased her confidence in her math skills . Flash cards were n't working for her . She is more of a tactile learner . Great toy !
5 #### Foggy answers but does he job . Plastic is hard to see through .
2 #### I ca n't get excited about this and never see my kiddo use it . It is hard to see the sum when you push down the button . For a kid working with these low numbers , fingers or manipulatives seem to be more useful . That said , maybe we just have n't found the right use for this yet .
3 #### The answers are somewhat difficult to see . Make sure you are under bright lighting . The idea is a good one . It did n't really help my child much but I am working with developmental problems . I think that for the average child this would be a nice " take along " item for the grocery store visit to keep children occupied and learning at the same time .
5 #### What a great way to keep a baby out of the sun on the beach ! This is a " must have " for future vacations !
5 #### I love this thing . I filled it with pillows and blankets ( i keep it in my livingroom ) and my baby crawls in there and rolls around laughing . he loves his fort lol .
1 #### Bigger than expected . Also is much more time consuming to setup that I thought . Returned .
5 #### Great purchase for my 8 year old entering 3rd grade . He was so excited that it was a game board for learning his multiplication table . I had this as a child so I was excited they still sell it over 25 years later .
4 #### Love this thing ! It 's a great educational toy for in the car . My daughter spent quite a bit of time looking at the numbers , and then started using it as parts of other play situations . It became a computer for ensuring proper information when playing doctor , among other things . My only beef , the numbers underneath are a little hard to see . But I really appreciate the non - electronic nature of this toy . No batteries , no noises and lightweight !
1 #### You can not see the answer through the plastic . Bad design !
5 #### My daughter was needing help in math so we got this . The most it is in use in the car .
5 #### I learned my math facts on t his toy 30 years ago ! It 's still a great toy today . This is a great quality and more fun than flash cards . Kids can practice on their own . It 's funny though because the first thing my kids did was push the buttons and say , " It needs batteries ! " They live in such a technological age that they think everything is going to blink and buzz at them ! Great price . Great quality .
3 #### This is a nice container for the caterpillars and easy for them to form their chrysalis but please note you get a card to send away for the caterpillars and you have to pay an additional cost . I was under the impression the code was enclosed and already included in price . That is not the case . For us it was n't a big deal since we found quite a few monarch caterpillars in the back yard .
5 #### Yesterday we let all five butterflies free ! I did n't expect all of them to live and turn into butterflies , because of some reviews I read . We 're definitely going to do it again !
5 #### Love it but do n't love having to order the living larvae - though it makes sense . Allow time to receive and then send for the living larvae .
4 #### Adorable .... easy to put together ..... 14 month old LOVES it ! ! ! We actually bought it for the beach and noticed it did n't come with a way to anchor to ground . If this is your purpose in buying , then bring your own way to secure it .
1 #### really ? My son did n't care for . He played a bit and I thought he would keep playing but he has not touched since we got it and the only time he played . I think it should have some type of sound to catch kids attention and keep them interacting / entertained .
5 #### saw this at school being used so got one ( and the multiplication one as well ) for home . - no batteries , press down and answer is visible - good organization of numbers so kids can see a pattern of answers - another good way to introduce math to kids - solidly built . i do n't see this one breaking easily . would recommend again .
5 #### My daughter was having trouble with memorizing her addition and subtraction equations . I used this very item when I was a child and it worked wonders . When I found it I was so thrilled to get it for her . She uses it everynight to help enhance her math skills . Very durable product , it has been dropped several times and is still in perfect condition . Item is fairly big to take to school , but we have a special bag that we carry it in . It is easy to read . On the tops of each button is the actual equation and then you simple press down to read the answer . Great product !
5 #### This has ALWAYS been a great learning tool . I used it for both of my children and now my grandchildren ...
5 #### An old school tried and true teaching tool ! Had it in school when I was in elementary and I 'm now helping my daughter with her multiplication table with this . My daughter can press on the button and see the answer right away or think about it a little before looking , its a good security blanket because she knows the right answer is there so she will make the extra effort to think about the answer first .
5 #### This is a great tool for my daughter to practice with . It has helped her tremendously . We recommend this for kids that need help learning their addition / subtraction facts .
2 #### I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction . He has only used it four or five times . He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway . I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years .
3 #### The answers are difficult to see when you press the buttons . It is a good learning tool and I would still recommend it .
5 #### Perfect for the beach ! Lovely product , and compacts to the size of an umbrella with a case to throw over your shoulder . I love how you can see through the mesh at the bottom . Easier to check on the little one and let some air in .
4 #### Pretty good for the beach . May fly away if not anchored Properly
4 #### I love this tent ! I bought it to take on a trip to the beach . The description does say it is UV protected but I have heard mixed things on this fact . My son is 9 months so I applied sunscreen as well as used the tent . I purchased a battery powered fan to help with the airflow during the summer and put it outside of the tent . I also put a few heavier toys in the corners both for play and to help with the tent as it seemed to be light and I did n't want it to blow away . For the price of the tent you ca n't expect it to be perfect but it assembles in less then 5 minutes and it is small and lightweight and easily stored in the vehicle so you have it when you need it .
5 #### This was a gift for my granddaughter on her 7th birthday . At this point the caterpillars are still growing . It is very exciting for the whole family . Well run company . They ship so that you receive the caterpillars in 2 days .
5 #### This works perfectly with all the other tracks my son has . It does require an elevation block that is not included
5 #### BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market . I would highly recommend having at least 2 sets of these pieces . My son uses them in his train roadway building every time he makes a train roadway . A definite must have .
4 #### I have rated this item a little bit lower because it does not come with anything else besides these two train tracks . These two wavy train tracks need something under them to build a hill / bridge . It would be nice if you could buy a set with blocks that could be used to hold up the pieces . We have used a small blocks from our own block set to hold up the pieces and that worked fine . These are sturdy pieces that have been through three kids playing and playing and stepping on them and setting them up and taking them down and so on . They have made our train tracks much more fun . Well worth the money . Just be warned you will need something to ' hold up the hill / bridge ' . Enjoy .
5 #### This is an awesome buy ! My baby fell asleep for 2 hours at the beach . Very easy to put together .
5 #### my toddler loves this , her own little hide out .
5 #### I highly recommend this product . We purchased it for the beach . It was perfect . Not too big , not too small . Very easy to install and break down . It is the perfect size when it is popped out and when it breaks down it is not too big so it is easy to store . I would recommend this for anyone who is heading to the beach or to the ball park . Perfect to keep your baby safe from the sun !
4 #### It 's simple , it 's nothing special . But my kid is really obsessed with railroad crossings so it makes him happy . Decent price for Brio I guess . Sturdy and cute .
5 #### Who knew that my 3 year old son would be addicted to railroad crossings ? It 's his favorite part of the track .
5 #### Brio makes excellent quality additions to wooden railroad train sets ! A great buy ! Granmie
5 #### Arrived on time packaged carefully & my four year old Autistic son loves it so it 's a win win
5 #### I did n't purchase this for fun value , but , it 's educational value is awesome ! Even my 4 year old walks around pretending it 's a calculator all the time ! He 's learning and is having too much fun to know it . Good purchase !
5 #### This was great . I really liked that this one zipped up unlike others that just had a small velcro piece . I would just freak out if a caterpillar got out . We were able to have a number of giant swallowtail caterpillars / chrysalis in it . Thought if I bought the 15.99 one it would n't have the vouchers for caterpillars but it did . So that was a surprise . I think this is the best one on the market .
5 #### So much fun ! This is a great product . Both of my kids loved watching them from the time they were tiny , til we released them . I was a little worried about them being in the jar , but it was fine and a pretty quick process for the transformation .
4 #### Our granddaughters loved this . I wish I would 've read a bit closer though - no cocoons were enclosed just a voucher for " free " cocoons that I had to pay a quite high shipping rate for . If I would 've paid better attention , the girls would n't have had to wait another week for their complete git .
4 #### Love it , for my g.daughter . I had one for her mother when she was little , helped her , also .
5 #### It is as described but the red rails snap off . We have already lost . Not the products fault . My 3 yr old just has to take everything apart
5 #### Brio ca n't be beat ! I expect nothing less then a superior product from Brio . This Brio product is as expected . Like all Brio products I have purchased it is top notch ! Brio make outstanding high quality products ! This is awesome ! My boy loves it and I ca n't help but love it as well . Brio is much better then the Thomas train series , from my perspective . The tracks are not compatible . We have decided to go with Brio track and anything that connects with the track must be Brio as well . The trains from others vendors like Thomas work with the track , but not with all products . For example , the viaduct is too short for other vendors and the trains wo n't pass through .
5 #### My son ca n't live without his railroad crossing . This has brought him hours of enjoyment . He has played with it nearly EVERY DAY since it arrived . He can place anywhere along his tracks ( works with Ikea brand tracks ) . He lifts the arms up and down , stops cars , moves trains . It has really been a great addition and enhancement of his imagination and play .
5 #### This is the second time I have bought this . It is a bit annoying that you have to pay another 7.95 to actually get the caterpillars . So save the habitat and just order the caterpillars .
3 #### The box looks as if it has been opened and resealed with tape . I do n't want to open to check since it 's a birthday gift but I 'll be updating and sending back if all the contents are not inside and/or in perfect condition .
2 #### This is easy to put together , a good size , easy to transport / store , but the opening is Velcro ! ! Why ? ? ! As soon as your baby can crawl / stand they 'll push right out of it . This is really only good for a sleeping baby because once your child is old enough to want to sit and play in it willingly , it 'll be too small . Really wanted to like it ... Going to take it to the beach and see what happens , but I think it 'll be a waste .
3 #### A great , educational toy . However-- the answers are hard to see and the numbers wipe off easily and quickly-- so you are left with a bunch of blank squares . Wish it was better quality .
4 #### I like it , an okay product . fun for any kid and a learning experience also a life experience
2 #### Uh cool voucher , where are my caterpillars thought that was included voucher means send money
5 #### This was so much fun ! All of our caterpillars became butterflies . The kids all loved it and we will definitely do it again !
3 #### Product is nice , but I believe this is very expensive for what you get .
5 #### Product was delivered fast and just what we needed as we were missing some pieces .
5 #### This is a well design and rugged choice . It is durable and almost unbreakable which is a plus with younger kids .
5 #### Just as described . Great addition to our wooden train set . But you have to be able to construct some type of road as well as the train track .
5 #### My kids are loving this ! The kit came with 5 caterpillars and they have gone into their cocoons in just a weeks time . We ca n't wait to see how beautiful they are .
5 #### We loved this for a fun summer experiment ! It all happens fast , so not much waiting is involved , which is good for little ones . Our butterflies are emerging today and we 've loved watching it all happen ! Nature is so amazing !
3 #### Very well done if only they manufacturer can find a way to fasten the gates on more securely .
5 #### Nice addition to the wooden train set for my grandson
5 #### We had a wooden one that held up well but ultimately my almost 3 year old did break it , and was devastated . Had this 1 month now , love how the plastic arms pop off is too much pressure ( or stepped on ) and easy to pop back on . Not sure how long they will pop in and stay snug , I am sure if anyone can wear it out it is my boy ... but so far so good .
5 #### My grandson loves to run his electric train into this arm . He then will " talk " to his train and tell him to say please to allow it to pass . Great toy for the imagination and an excellent addition to his track ! Well made and sturdy is standing up to my four - year - old grandson !
5 #### This is a very cute railway crossing component to add to your wooden railway sets ! The nice thing across all of these wooden railway products is that they are compatible to one another ! And they are very good quality ! I would not hesitate to purchase additional BRIO products !
5 #### This railway crossing was purchased to add to my Brio set . It fits perfectly and is easy to use . There are no lights or sound , but the rails go up and down easily .
5 #### We bought this for our trip to Outer Banks NC and annual OC NJ trip . It is a fabulous beach tent . It is very sturdy and roomy . We fit two kids ages 2 and 7 months in it . ( Although my older child had her own princess tent ) This is great because it 's well ventilated and includes the cushion mat for the baby to lay on . The door velcros closed and the tent keeps out sun and sand . We put a water weight or a bag inside to weigh it down and it worked fine . I reccomend this tent !
5 #### Bought this for a trip to Aruba to protect my 9 month old from the sun . It was compact and light weight . Very easy to set up and withstood Aruba 's windy beach . My daughter had so much fun playing in it plus we used it to store our cooler so the sun did n't beat down on it .
4 #### Very nice and handy - although the base is crinkly so my baby is always trying to pull at it - overall serves it purpose for such as cheap price . I would only add a different bottom and possibly some loops to use some spikes or something to help anchor it to the ground .
5 #### Best tent ever . We bought this for a cruise and it worked great . It was easy to pack and worked great at the beach . Very inexpensive and kept my baby out of the sun .
1 #### I used to have a great multiplication board when I was little . The board had plastic slides that I could slide back to reveal the answers . I bought this board for my son , but it was too hard to see the answers . The buttons are about the size of fingers , so as you press a button down the answer is hidden . It was not really helpful at all .
2 #### Growing up I had a keyboard like this to learn my math facts and loved it . Bought one for my daughter and we received it today . I would give it 5 stars for the idea of it , but out of the box 3 of the buttons are pushed in and wo n't pop out . No way to pop them back out . She was still happy with itm and the general idea . Disappointing .
5 #### adds dimension to our constructions ! strong pieces , good value - perfectly compatible with our non - brio set .. Will probably be getting some more of these in the future . Good price ( i think we got 2 boxes ? ) . Fun stuff , going up and down things ! You can flip them over for alternative fittings . We also got the brio 2pc track riser set as supports for these but one of those promptly split in 2 .. we found we are just as happy propping these on our mega blocks since they seem just about perfect height for balance . Makes for an interesting and fun colored interaction - trains and blocks ! very happy !
5 #### I expect nothing less then a superior product from Brio . This Brio product is as expected . Like all Brio products I have purchased it is top notch ! Brio make outstanding high quality products ! This is awesome ! My boy loves it and I ca n't help but love it as well
5 #### Bought this as an addition to Fisher - Price Thomas The Train Wooden Railway Elevated Crossing Gate . It fits well and great price .
5 #### Great product ! Brio always provides high quality items at a fraction of the price compared to the Thomas Wooden railway .
5 #### Must have these pieces to add to the wooden railway .
5 #### I ca n't wait for our grand baby to open his birthday gift . He loves all things pertaining to trains !
5 #### My 3 year old grandson is a wooden train lover . I bought this railway crossing for him for his birthday . He loves it !
5 #### Update : All 4 butterfly 's are now ready for release ! This was an amazing experience for her ! Great gift for a birthday party ! She was so excited
4 #### I got this toy to use in my church nursery for my toddler Sunday School class . They love it ! We use it to act out Biblical Voyages , such as Moses crossing the red sea . This is one of their favorite toys ! They love chasing each other through it and hiding in it . It is easy to clean up , just collapse it and tie the nylon ties closed . It has been smooshed , jumped on , and used by a LARGE 10 - year old , and no damage has been done ! I am very happy with this item . It is 6 Feet long , the picture on this site shows two tunnels locked together - take the picture , divide it by two , and that is the product you are purchasing
5 #### Great tent , perfect for beach and outdoor grass areas . Great size for babies and toddlers . Love the small bag in comes with , did n't know it would be so light weight and portable . I 'm totally recommending this :D
4 #### This Toy has helped my daughter with her homework . She is now learning her multiplication table much more easily and effective with this Math Keyboard ! She finds it fun while its allowing there to memorize her times tables . I give it a 4 rating only because the numbers do n't appear dark enough like the one I had when i was growing up but none the less you still can see it and it makes the child focus harder on the answer . This is a wonderful learning tool .
5 #### bought this for a grandchild that says he hates flashcards . have not given it to him as of yet . Hope he likes it as he plays a lot of video games . we will see .
5 #### Easy to use . Crossing gates easy to use . Good playful experience in teaching use of actual RR crossings .
4 #### My 3 year old LOVES it . He takes of the plastic crossing guard thingies , and puts them back on . The painted road has already started to flake off a little ( after than less of a month of playing with ) . Granted he plays roughly with it , and likes taking his trains with him to take a bath sometimes , but I expected more durability from a Brio toy .
5 #### My 3 year old LOVES this train crossing He plays ROUGH and this toy holds up well I will buy more without question
5 #### My grandson - age 4 - is fixated on railroad crossings and loves this product .
5 #### My son loves it ! We had gotten another railway crossing and the arm does not stay up . This model is much better !
5 #### Perfect spring activity with kids or with any ages .
5 #### This was the perfect experiment with my grand daughters . They watched them from eggs to being hatched to letting them go .
4 #### nice addition to any track set ; wish they created a higher hill ( you ca n't have a track going underneath it ) ; wish they came with supports ( instead of having to buy those separately ) ;
5 #### Nice 2 pack of ascending tracks . We use Sureclip tracks to connect them , or use them with Brio / Thomas bridges . Highly recommend the Brio " Stacking Supports " which you can use to make extra tall sections with several ascending tracks .
5 #### Ordered as replacement pieces due to dog chewing previously purchased ones . Worded perfectly .
5 #### Great tent for the price . Super easy to put up . We have it in our toddlers room .
5 #### Fits perfect with our Thomas tracks ! My child loves it !
5 #### My 5 year old loves this ! It 's a little pricy considering it 's just 1 part for the track , but it 's worth it . Perfect for the kid who has a wooden track and loves to use trains AND cars ! My son loves to create a city " inside " his train set , and now he can use the crossing for cars to go over it ! The red barriers move , and they will snap in and out of the joints , so it would be hard to really break it .
5 #### My sons love this product . They love playing train and playing with the level crossing !
5 #### So far so good . We are waiting for our butterflies to hatch but everything is moving along as it says in the directions . It is very interesting for us to all watch as a family .
5 #### my 4 yo is extremely excited for his caterpillars to arrive so that we can watch them grow and use our butterfly garden pop up house . We have also ordered the praying mantis house for him as well . such a great product and company !
5 #### My grandson just loves this toy . He is a beginning walker , but prefers to pull it while he is crawling . The sounds just delight him , and they are cute !
5 #### My daughter received this as a gift for her first birthday . There she sat surrounded by toys and this was the one she could n't wait to play with . A few months later she still likes to drag it around . The ducks are adorable to watch " waddle " and the little song is so cute ( I occassionally cathc myself or my husband singing it later in the day ) .
5 #### Great addition to our grandson 's track set . at 5 and 3 , they spend hours playing with their trains and tracks -- wearing their engineer hats , of course .
5 #### My 3 year old son plays with this all the time and sometimes he does n't even bother to connect it to the other tracks . He loves playing with his cars back and forth over this crossing
5 #### Both the connecters and track lines fit great with the Thomas The Train track my kid has . Also a great add - on for the kid that also love hot wheels cars .
5 #### The perfect addition to my son 's railroad so he can make his cars and trains interact . He loves it !
5 #### 6 years later and my now 6 & 9 year olds still play with the tunnel
5 #### excellent material and stands up to a 4 year old and 1 year old
5 #### Learned of this from a friend and these guys delivered exactly what I wanted and the descriptions were great so I got the model I wanted .
4 #### My daughter went through these with a breeze and learning very fast especially the 7 , 8 , and 9 tables . She has become more accurate in less than two weeks and her teacher also sees improvement in her work . Highly recommend .
5 #### This toy is a favorite . I love the tune , it 's stuck in our heads and we all bob our heads along to the quacks . My daughter also walks around the house saying " wack wack wack " and also does it whenever she sees a bird of any kind . It has really cracked us up ! The red connectors get bent easily , so watch how you leave it in the box , but it will fix itself easily too . The ducks did fall over a lot in the beginning . She would actually get mad at me when I righted them for her . As a result our ducks have no paint on one side . But now she does it herself and manages to pull them along just fine . It was very loud when we first got it but I think the batteries are dying and I 'm very sad that I ca n't figure out how to replace them . I used to dread putting the toys away because something would hit it and it 'd start quacking , amplified by the toy bucket , and wake everyone up . Sometimes the string gets wrapped around a wheel and does n't get pulled enough to quack , but my daughter will supply the sound effects just fine . She loves to push carts and drag stuff behind her so I 'm sure this will last ... but I miss the quacking !
5 #### My three year old requested a railroad crossing to go with his train tracks at his grandma 's house . We picked this one because it was cheap , but looked like it would hold up well . We have the IKEA train tracks , but this fit just fine . My kiddo loves it . He really wants two of them so that his cars can drive through his tracks ... and at this price , we 'll likely be ordering another one soon . I would recommend .
5 #### Grandson loved it , wanted to set the train up right away .
4 #### Kid loves this . These add ons are expensive but the moving pieces ( the gate , the signs ) seems to add to the pretend play . It 's fun to watch him play with this .
4 #### fun to have around and install on a set of train tracks . used various toy cars , from hotwheels to large and i mean large vehicles to cross this railway even when the toys could n't fit through .
2 #### I got this crossing to supplement my son 's ( rather large ) train set . The red arms of the signal come off , very easily . Which is fine , but we have a younger son as well so these are causing a choking hazard , and a sibling fight , constantly .
5 #### My daughter loves this for her railroad set . it fits the Brio and Thomas Railway sets perfectly . Sturdy and cute !
5 #### This is a MUST have if your child plays with both cars and trains at the same time . Fits nicely into the the Thomas and friends track system . Kids play with it for hours !
2 #### It is so small . Do n't buy it . The butterflies wo n't be able to fly around in it . I purchased this product several times over the past few years and it used to be bigger and better . I am so sad at how small and expensive it is now . I love the quality of the product , but the size has just gotten ridculously small .
5 #### My 1 1/2 year old and his puppy love playing in this together .
5 #### Kids love it , bought it for my daughter at age 1 so she 'd have something to grow into instead of a toy she 'll out - grow . Older brother 3 , and sister 5 love it too . Seems very durable and folds nicely for storage when not in use . Great product , will definitely get you use out of the investment . Does require some space if setting up indoors , but most kid toys involving activity usually do , at least this provides the ability to collapse and store when you tire of it .
5 #### Purchased this for my 2 yr . old grandson and he just loves it . He loves to look through window . My older granddaughter loves to go through it too .
5 #### Arrived on time the box had a tear in it but contents were not damaged . Granson ca n't wait to put butterflies into it . We may even order more caterpillars !
4 #### Nice tent for the baby 's first day at the beach . He was 6 months old at the time and this tent was great !
5 #### This tent is great ! My husband assembled it easily and we used it on the beach for our baby . It 's a pretty good size .
3 #### Good baby tent for the price . Not ready for windy days . Setting it up and keeping it in its place is a challenge . Quality looks good and is very small ( once packed ) for easy transportation .
5 #### We used this for our 8 month old baby at the beach . The tent held up GREAT and the cushion in the bottom made it very comfortable for him to play on his tummy since he could not yet sit up . Our beach was slightly windy so we put our beach bag in there with him because it does not come with stakes to be tied down . We did n't want baby to fly away . We went tout the beach in October er so it was n't super hot . The tent has two mesh sides for air to pass through . Our baby was fine , but on a hot day without a breeze , I could see it getting very warm inside . Overall , it was easy to assemble and disassemble . It did exactly what we needed .
5 #### I got this for my 3 - year - old and 1 - year - old . They can pull the signal arms off but not put them back on ( easy for an adult ) . Compatible with Imaginarium and IKEA wooden tracks . My boys enjoy staging scenes where cars get stuck under the signal arms and hit by a train , and this works very well for that !
5 #### brio for trains is the best i have ever bought for my 4 yera old son . he loves this item
5 #### Great quality . Have older sets of train parts that have been handed down through numerous families so very durable and the kids love them . Ages 2 thru oldest grand daughter of 9 .
5 #### Children are also pleased I purchased as a birthday present to children . Because it is a birthday once a year , children and me happily , I now also feel happy
5 #### This tent surpasses any other tent we have had . Sturdy and easy to put up . great size for tall 2 & 4 year olds .
5 #### Excellent for my pets ! Dog , 2 kitties and litter box trained bunny ! I have a mini Aussie who can run through it and my sister 's dogs are larger but they can still turn around in it and go through it . It is a huge hit .... My dog 's 9 years old & experienced in agility courses . Loves this for playing at home ... sometimes all the pets are in it together . :) & it 's not scary for any of them , sinceit has a couple of mesh windows .
5 #### Perfect size for our grandsons ( 4 & 2 ) We bought the tent too and they have all kinds of fun crawling through the tunnel and playing in the tent . Good quality material and construction
5 #### Fits perfectly with our Pacific Play Tents Sante Fe Giant Tee Pee . My 3 year old son has so much fun crawling through this ( and throwing things through it ) .
3 #### This is a cute toy -- the FIRST hundred times you hear it . With each successive LOUD repeat , though , you will find your sanity slipping away . Do toy manufacturers think we 're all hard - of - hearing ? A child might give the fun rating here 4 stars but an adult would probably give it 2 . I think the suggestion of putting tape over the speaker area is a good one . It really is cute .... but be prepared to have " quack quack , quack quack , quack quack quack quack , quack quack , quack quack , quack QUACK QUACK " running through your head at the oddest moments .
5 #### Fun family game . The mat on this one is really nice .
5 #### We are loving our Deluxe Sequence game . The board is rolled up , but it unrolls well and stays flat . It 's a very fun game .
5 #### I found this to be a really great product . I would definitely recommend it to others , a very happy purchase .
5 #### I learned my math facts on t his toy 30 years ago ! It 's still a great toy today . This is a great quality and more fun than flash cards . Kids can practice on their own . It 's funny though because the first thing my kids did was push the buttons and say , " It needs batteries ! " They live in such a technological age that they think everything is going to blink and buzz at them ! Great price . Great quality .
4 #### Great habitat but caterpillars are an added expense . It claims the caterpillars are free and the $ 7.95 covers shipping . But , it 's a disappointment after paying for the " kit " .
5 #### Easy to assemble and take down . Perfect for the beach .
3 #### Worked at the pool . No anchors for the beach where wind was an issue .
5 #### Best $ 20 toy to wear out your kiddo ! Pay up for the one with windows too - our toddler LOVES that aspect !
5 #### My 10 mo . old grandson loves this . Folds up easy . Good construction . Would purchase again .
5 #### This play tunnel is well worth purchasing . It is holding up well and my year and ahalf old grandson loves it .
5 #### Love this game it 's a lot of fun to play with 4 to 6 people .
5 #### Wonderful gift for our twins . Ca n't wait to grow our butterflies this Spring ! Package arrived quickly and is in great shape !
3 #### The description was n't clear that this would n't come with the caterpillars . The rep in the phone had to walk me through where to find it as it was n't in the normal discription . Since this was for a lesson I could n't wait the additional 2 - 3 weeks to get them . Did like the kit though . Just a big hassle .
5 #### I purchased this for an 8 year old who was having trouble with multiplication . Great help in working with multiplication problems , and now does good . She had previously used one like this for addition and subtraction that had helped her when she was younger . Best part - no batteries required , so learning does not stop when batteries die .
1 #### I bought this for my son to help him learn his math . The answers under the buttons are very light and most are impossible to see . Complete waste ! ! !
5 #### My grandson has had so much fun with this tunnel and so have I !
4 #### This is a really cute toy that my son will get use out of for a while . I love how easily it collapses and can be stored away . It 's a little long for my living room , but I like that you can choose to release the velcro on just a few sides to make a semi - circle if a 6 - foot tunnel is too big .
5 #### This collapses so easily so it 's very easy to store without taking up too much room and my son just loves it . It looks like it would be very easy to connect to other ones as well .
5 #### At first she did n't want to go into it , I 'm thinking maybe because I bought the blue , which probably looked dark inside to her and there was a bit of trepidation which would not be unusual for a child of one ! Of course it was cold in January around her birthday so it was first used in the house , which of course effected the light situation even more so . I was going to purchase the light green one at first , then realized that in the summertime , my daughter would probably put it in the yard for her to play in and I did n't want it to show dirt so easily . I looked at other brands and styles and saw that the worst complaint was that the wires that give strength to the tunnel were a bit uncomfy on the knees , so I looked for a style that had extra padding over the channel the wire was fed through . It 's held up well so far and even if it only lasts 2 - 3 years , it will have provided the fun that was intended !
5 #### This is wonderful for our 18 month old grandson . He likes to crawl into it and ' hide ' to play peek - a - boo . We also toss a ball into one end and try to make it pass out the other end . Grandfather can even fit in halfway , which tickles him . There are two see - thru areas ( one at each end ) and it folds up to put away when our grandson is n't here . I recommend attaching the Velcro tab to a chair leg or something else so the tunnel will stay in one place . It also has an attachment that might fit some play tents , but we do n't use it that way .
5 #### Hours of fun . A friend has the reg version . This one is much easier to see and the board and chips are much better . Like having the ability to flip chips to white when you have a sequence .
5 #### Only way to take babies to the beach ! Life saver . So quick and easy !
5 #### Great alternative to flashcards & helping kids get those multiplication facts down . I had one when I was young as well ... a great learning tool~
5 #### I searched to find one of these multiplication table toys like we had when we were young . This one works great and has helped our younger children recite their tables .
5 #### I searched and searched for these , after remembering my sibling had one YEARS ago . Finally found them here , and my ( at the time ) 4 yr old was head over heels . She 's been practicing multiplication and subt4action with these ever since , and I could see the results , after a few days . she actually LIKES doing math now .
5 #### This kit was an awesome learning tool for the summertime . All the caterpillars we received turned into butterflies . My son , who was 5 at the time , did n't like the maintenance much , but he loved releasing them . We were worried about 1 that was almost caught by a bird , but it added to the excitement :)
5 #### Lots of fun for my grandkids . So exciting to wait for the day they hatch .
5 #### Best game ! Looks confusing but it is very easy and fun for the family . My kids favorite .
5 #### the price was great compared to all the other websites and it will attach to any other play tunnel and tents that we have .
5 #### My son plays with this tunnel all of the time ! We bought it for him when he was a year old and now he is two . At the moment it is setup going into a small tent , which he thinks is so much fun . My best tip for this tunnel is to put it away on occasion . It is pretty big so when I notice he has n't played with it for a little bit I pack it up . When I bring it out a week or two later it 's like he has a new toy .
3 #### It 's probably not even in the suggested age range , but we thought the baby might enjoy crawling through this tunnel . He did , but then he would try to stand and the tunnel would start rolling -- not very safe . Of course did n't have it attached to a tent , so that could improve things . Just a word of caution .
5 #### My daughter loved this - we purchased in summer . The kits gives you a code to order the caterpillars when you are ready . They arrive in a cup and you are told to make sure you are home so that they do n't stay in the mailbox and over heat . We accidentally left them in there for 2 days - and prayed they would live . All five lived and became butterflies . These are NOT monarch butterflies , but painted lady butterflies . They are gray and brown , not brightly colored . We had a great time watching them , feeding them , and letting them go .
5 #### She is waiting for her worms to arrive but it seems to be exactly when she wanted . It was for my great granddaughter who is 3 years old .
5 #### saw this at school being used so got one ( and the addition one as well ) for home . - no batteries , press down and answer is visible - good organization of numbers so kids can see a pattern of answers - another good way to introduce math to kids - solidly built . i do n't see this one breaking easily . would recommend again .
3 #### This would be great for kids trying to learn multiplication tables , but it 's really hard to see the answer even when you push the button all the way down - because the transparency of the plastic is pretty poor . It affects the functionality pretty badly because you can barely see the answer on some of the boxes .
5 #### My daughter found this fun and helpful for her multiplication tables , just as I did when I was younger . .
5 #### This product was purchased as a Christmas gift . The receipent of the product liked it . I was happy with my purchase .
3 #### The eggs are a little hard to open & the carton cracks easy if dropped , but good for the price .
5 #### Awesome . My granddaughter loves these . She 's 2 . Great gift .
5 #### Daughters 2.5 and loves them . Great size , like the case , and she learns !
5 #### I got this for my younger boy 's first birthday ... chose it so his four and a half year old brother could also have fun . They immediately crawled through it after opening it and played for hours . It was when they entered at opposite ends and bonked heads that I finally had to put it away . It 's a super fun toy but usually ends up bad at my house . have boys have loads of boy energy . They love this thing .
4 #### Great item , but be aware that the fabric used has a slight chemical smell . I think because of a fire retardant used . I just aired the tunnel outside for a bit and the smell disipated .
5 #### This was an immediate hit in our house . We have 3 little girls ... a 3 year old and one year old twins . This tunnel is hours of fun . I just leave it out in our play room all day and they laugh and scream and play in the tunnel throughout the day . They laugh with each other play hide n seek and other games together . It really helps teach sharing and taking turns . The see through mess windows makes my girls laugh and laugh and laugh . The material is very sturdy . It has been put to the test by these three . The padding on the rings is not super soft or cushion like , but it is fine . This is a simple idea that keeps every entertained . Love the color . Easy to fold up and put away . Fits in Pacific Play tent but does not have an attachment where it stays securely .
5 #### I purchased this play tunnel six years ago , when my first child was a toddler . He absolutely loved it . Fast forward six years and it is now the favorite toy of my third child . In fact , all three of my kids STILL love this tunnel . It has held up incredibly well after hundreds of hours of use . Best purchase I have ever made for my kids !
5 #### Item works well . Easy to set up and keeps the bugs off my daughter .
5 #### Adorable shade tent to my granddaughter . It was pretty easy to set up .
4 #### My daughter and I play with these . They are good quality , but there is a limit to what you can build . There are way more of the little pieces than the big ones so not a lot you can do with it . For the price though , compared to the authentic ones , I was very pleased with them .
5 #### This was a HUGE hit with our 1.5 and 4 year old ! We did a lot of observing and were very excited as the caterpillars build their chrysalis , and then again as they hatched . It was fairly simple to care for the caterpillars and butterflies . We released the butterflies within a few hours of hatching .
5 #### My daughter was having trouble with memorizing her multiplication equations . I used this very item when I was a child and it worked wonders . When I found it I was so thrilled to get it for her . She uses it everynight to help enhance her math skills . Very durable product , it has been dropped several times and is still in perfect condition . Item is fairly big to take to school , but we have a special bag that we carry it in . It is easy to read . On the tops of each button is the actual equation and then you simple press down to read the answer . Great product !
2 #### The first day owning this toy my daughter suggested from the back seat that there was an error in the facts . Sure enough , the top left button , which should read 1x1 = 1 , in fact reads 1x2 = 1 . The button to its right does read correctly , 1x2 = 2 . My 8 year old caught the mistake . I 've posted pictures above to show you this error . As other reviewers have stated , the answers can be difficult to see . The translucent buttons are a little too opaque for easy reading . At least my children 's fingers are smaller than mine and they are able to move them out of the way to see the answer . Also , the fact is simply painted on top to rub off with repeated use . I also posted a picture to demonstrate the view of the answers . We 'll have to exchange this item for one of better quality .
5 #### Simple tool for practicing multiplication facts ! What else is there to say , .. ? Can go for rides in the car , lay on the couch with it , outside on the hammock . I like it !
5 #### I bought the Small World Toys Preschool Multiplication table long time ago for my daughter , it was fun for her to learn the multiplications and at the end I sold it in a Yard Sale and now I just bought it again for her son or my grandson and he is enjoying it too .
4 #### I had one of these growing up , my mom made me study with it often and it was a great tool to have . I was so excited when I found this for my own kids ... The only problem I have is the answers are harder to see when you push the buttons but it does get the job done .
2 #### These eggs are just poor quality . I bought them for my 20 - month - old son for Christmas , but I can only get about half of them opened . The colors are not very vibrant , and the plastic container ( the reason I chose this version of this product ) is just very cheaply made . Overall , I am disappointed with this purchase , but the seller was very gracious to refund my purchase price , no questions asked !
5 #### Perfect . Although you 'll have to open for your child . It 's a bit hard open and close for little ones .
5 #### Got these for grocery store play , which they work great for , but also love the multi use for matching , shapes , and color recognition !
4 #### I ordered this for my son 's 2nd birthday . I ordered this particular one because I liked the idea of the carton to sit / store the eggs in . I like the carton and it is sturdy , but it is kind of difficult to open the latch . I 'm sure my son will figure it out soon , but it is n't something he could easily operate right off the bat . As far as the eggs , I do like them and think they are neat , but I was a little disappointed in the quality . Because of the quality , they are a little difficult to open and to push closed . Overall , I am satisfied and my son loves to play with them . The only reason I gave this toy 4 stars is that with a little improved quality this toy would be much easier for a small child to operate . It is great for learning and coordination , though , and is definately a great toy for small children .
5 #### Fun game- my 9 and 12 year old enjoy playing it .
5 #### Nice game to play with adults or children or combination of both .
5 #### This tunnel folds up neatly and can be toted for the kids to play with in the park or anywhere you have a few square feet . Great classic toy .
5 #### My son and my nephew ( both 2 years and some change ) have had one of these each for about a year . They both occasionally pull it out and giggle hysterically at each other going in and out . How they play with it has changed as they have gotten older ... but it 's still a hit on a rainy day . It 's made well . Some people say it 's small ... but that 's if you as an adult are getting in it ... in that case ... yes .. it is too small . Leave the tunnel to the little ones .
5 #### I bought this for my 1 year old grandson 's birthday , it was a hit at the party and will be well used by him for a long time . The other babies enjoyed the tent as well .
5 #### This has been a great help to my daughter . She likes it , and we like that she can practice on her own . We have seen an improvement in her memorization of her multiplication facts .
3 #### Same as with the Pluses and Minuses tablet . The answers are difficult to see when you press the buttons . Would still recommend .
5 #### had one as a kid , now my kids can use it , no batteries and silent in the car great . easy to share
3 #### These where not what I remembered having as a child but then again what is . These where easily breakable and some did n't even come with correct notches in them to properly build houses and what not . We where not impressed at all . You get what you pay for .
5 #### This is a pretty good set . Everything works well together .
5 #### Nice building logs . Better quality and heft than most of the others available . We had a different set ( the classic brand you think of when you think of building logs ) and they were lightweight . Structures constantly toppled . This are what you want to buy - they hold up to play , structures are stable and well thought out . Would definitely buy more to expand the creative potential !
5 #### We 've used this quite a bit over the winter . I 'm not sure it 's our favorite game but I would recommend and buy it again if that made any sense .
5 #### We love this game in our house . So much fun . This is the updated version of the game , instead of a board , it is a mat , basically the same game though . Great game of strategy and teamwork .
5 #### I bought this for my 9 month old son when I noticed how much he loved playing with a box another Amazon item came in . As soon as we got it and popped it open , he IMMEDIATELY crawled through it , laughing the whole way ! His only issue with it is that he somehow thinks he should be able to poke his head through the mesh " windows " in the tube -- a testament to their durability is that he has n't yet , in spite of much trying . :) It is an awesome thing to play " peekaboo " in -- he finds it hilarious when I will crawl outside the tube from one end to the other while he sits inside . Because it packed up so nicely , we brought it along to a family reunion , which included my 11 month and 3 year old nephews and 1.5 year old niece . All 4 children loved it -- we even have some pictures of three kids trying to crawl through it at the same time . It was nice to see , since all his cousins are older , that we are going to get many years of use out of this play tube !
5 #### Both my 1yr old and 4yr old loved this ! The only downfall is that it does take up a good chunk of space .
4 #### My three - year - old loves these , he is obsessed with Easter eggs ! Very good value , the only improvement would be if the carton were easier to open .
5 #### Arrived quickly , my 3 year old plays with them everyday with her kitchen set , she has not problem opening the eggs and matching them and putting them back together .
1 #### Blue container is hard for children to open as well as the eggs ! One egg has already broken , the inside shape came out . Very disappointed !
3 #### While my grandaughter loves to play with thsee eggs , they are too difficult to pull apart and the toy . Arten looks like it 's going to break easily enough . I gave it 3 stars because of the difficulty of pulling apart . But it 's still a good toy for your little ones !
5 #### I set this on the kitchen table for my 3rd grader , along with the addition / subtraction version for my younger daughter in kindergarten . Every morning they have fun taking turns quizzing each other . Seriously , they actually have fun with this every morning ! Maybe it 's the competition of being able to answer as many right as possible , maybe it 's fun for them to push the buttons , I do n't know why and I do n't care . All I care about , is that they are having fun learning their math facts at breakfast ! By the way , do n't believe the other reviews that say you ca n't see the answer when you push the buttons . I can not believe people are actually having trouble seeing the answers ! Either they need glasses , or they have the strength of my one year old who can only push the buttons half - way .
5 #### I love a learning toy for the kids that does n't require batteries ! There 's nothing to maintain , or break . I bought it for my 9 year old to solidify his knowledge of his multiplication facts , and as an added bonus my 7 year old is learning some too . Just a good toy to have around ; it 's a great visual . The fact that you have to press down on the key to see the solution underneath gives them a chance to think of the answer first instead of just reading a printed times table . Definitely satisfied .
4 #### I bought this to help my grandchildren learn to multiply better . I hope it works . It will if they actually use it . It shows a problem and when you press the key it will give you the answer . The idea is to guess the answer before you push the button . I 'm crossing my fingers that it will help and that they will have fun using it .
5 #### We loved watching all of the caterpillars turn into butterflies . I was concerned about one of them due to the amount of blood - like fluid that was on the paper , but they all survived to be released . Just keep in mind that you have to pay shipping for the cup of caterpillars separately .
5 #### Love this and the kids had a great time . These little guys love watermelon when they first hatch . All of them survived .
5 #### I bought two of these for my grandchildren and both of them enjoyed watching the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly !
4 #### Really liked this - would have liked it to be bigger and to have a carrying bag - but other than that - love it .
3 #### Got this to put my sun in outside the sleeves that hold the poles are shredding after about a months use . We quit using it anyways because my sun is crawling now and tips the tent over trying to escape .
3 #### They are blotchy and not uniform in color and have some splinters . But my kids have never had the real deal , so they do n't know what they 're missing .
3 #### Not what I remembered similar logs being . Slippery and hard to use for my child . Ended up in a box , neglected . Maybe in 2 years ( age 5 then ) ?
3 #### They do n't give you enough pieces to build the house they show in the picture on the box or in the instructions .
5 #### Make sure you are in town when they are supposed to become butterflies ! We have ordered caterpillars 2 times before and had wonderful experiences . I recommend doing this with your family . I just warn to pay attention to the time frames from when they close up to when they are ready to get out . We were out of town for two days and I thought we had plenty of time left so I did n't hang the lid inside the net cage . The butterflies all emerged in the little cup and only 2 survived . I know that sounds like a duh ... but I made a mistake and it was very sad so I hope my mistake will help someone else .
5 #### This is a wonderful homeschool science project . My children were captivated by the opportunity to raise their own butterflies and watch them go through their metamorphosis . Well worth the money for all the educational and entertainment value it holds for children and their adults .
5 #### Very educational and fun for my son who is preschool age . We were lucky enough to have all caterpillars come alive and survive all the way through . They started off super tiny and grew into huge fuzzy caterpillars before cocooning and emerging as beautiful butterflies . My son loved to feed them with the pipette and watch them move around until they could flutter . On his 4th Birthday , a week or so after they all emerged , we were able to release them with his friends and family . We did have one whose wings were busted , so we left him on a flower petal by the door . Hoping to order more caterpillars again in the future !
3 #### My Grandma has some original Lincoln Logs and my kids really enjoy playing with those when we visit . So , when these went on sale we decided to get some . We purchased two sets so we would have plenty of pieces to be creative with our buildings . Overall this product does what we need it to do . But to be honest the quality is subpar . It 's still a great toy , but some of the pieces do n't have a precise cut or consistent sizes so your log cabin might end up a bit skiwampus . Also the finish on the pieces is thin and ideally would have a second coat or a higher quality stain . Again , they get the job done , just do n't expect 5 - star quality .
5 #### This is a great set my kids play with all the time . I like playing with them as well . This is a family fun activity where we can make castles and farms together while making stories up .
2 #### Cheaply made and poorly stained wood . I would not purchase this item again .
5 #### This was a throw back to my child hood . I had a blast playing with my 3 year old !
5 #### Perfect for the whole family . This is a great team game , have not played one to one . It is funny as a team and creates a lot of laughter .
5 #### The most loved toy we own who would have guessed .
5 #### Good quality item for the price - purchased for school carnival prize .
5 #### kids loved it with the diff shapes and colors
3 #### The container is very hard to open . I like the eggs but I would n't buy again .
1 #### Sorry to say , this product is not friendly for little fingers . Extremely hard to open , both the blue " carton " box and the eggs .
4 #### I thought there would be more light behind the buttons you press for the answers . Kind of hard to see the answers but the kids are using it so I guess it works and does keep their interest .
5 #### My twins and their friends have so much fun playing in this tunnel . Also it is compact enough to take on vacation !
5 #### I got this for my daughter 's 1st birthday . Not only was the shipping fast ( I LOVE Amazon ! ) but she loves her tunnel . So easy to put away and to pop out . This seems very durable . My daughter LOVES going in her tunnel . This is the perfect gift for a crawling baby / toddler . Love it !
5 #### Got this for my son when he was just starting to crawl - he 's 6 and he still loves using it for things . Not a single tear , rip , frayed seam , nothing . This has stood the test of time .
5 #### This is probably the coolest gift you can give a child . I ordered this on my amazon account for my mom to give our 5 year old daughter on her birthday . The process of watching this was magical . We were able to release all 10 butterflies on my daughter 's birthday . We liked it so much , we have ordered a handful more ! ! ! SERIOUSLY the best gift to give a child ! ! ! !
4 #### I must 've been sleep deprived when I pulled the trigger when these were featured as an Amazon Lightning Deal item , because I thought they were Lincoln Logs . They 're actually pretty good quality logs - very sturdy and have withstood my 2 year old 's abuse . The wood are finely cut / pressed and after a thorough inspection , can say with surety that there are absolutely no splinters or any dangerous bits poking about . I 've caught my dogs chewing on a couple of them so if your kids end up neglecting the logs or relegating them to the abandoned toys section , they work pretty good as doggy chew sticks .
3 #### Difficult to put together even for adults . It took my mechanic husband about 20 minutes to build the house on the box . I would not recommend this for children easily frustrated . 114 sounds like a lot of logs , but they are mostly the small size . The kids seemed to like the larger , easier to handle ones . The delivery was very prompt though .
3 #### We had a set of these years ago that we loved . Many of the pieces were missing and we were thrilled to find another set . They are as they appear in the picture with different shapes and colors inside each egg . However they pale in comparison to the set we had before . The case is flimsy and the puzzle eggs are poorly made . Some of the eggs are difficult to separate and some will not stay together . I would not order them again .
2 #### these are way too hard to open for my 2 year old . The first time I tried to open them , I had to use a butter knife to pry them apart . Have not really loosened by much after a few weeks of play .
4 #### My 2 year old loves these eggs . Plus it helps with learning shapes and colors . But the eggs and the little container are hard for little hands to open . Seems kind of cheap , but good toy for the price .
4 #### a little hard to open for adults and little people
4 #### Great tent for indoors or outdoors at the beach for keeping little ones out of the sun . Well made and easy to take down and put up . Great purchase .
1 #### when my child was in it and would crawl forward the whole tent tipped over , scaring my little guy . He was too scared to get into it ever again
5 #### This tent is a great size . I 'm using it now to put his toys inside . However we will be using it outside alot .
2 #### I should have read the description closer as this does not have UV protection . Pretty useless for the pool or outdoors . Will just let my toddler play with it as a play house
5 #### My daughter is 20 months old and just got this for Christmas . She absolutely loves it . It 's well built and I like the small windows so I can see her inside of of it . The only bad thing is it takes up a lot of room , so its a bit cramped in our 1 bedroom apartment . However , the smiles on her face make the lack of space well worth it . It 's also easy to put away and take out again . Just be careful when you open the velcro straps because it does spring out .
5 #### The giggles never stop . She never get tired of playing in and on it . She thinks it makes a great drum . Good thing it is very sturdy . It easily collapses for storage .
5 #### I bought this fun tunnel for play with my three dogs : a lab mix , a boston terrier , and a bluetick coonhound . Within a few minutes , using treats and applause they were all going through the tunnel enjoying themselves immensely . They range in age from almost one year to 7 years , and from about 65 pounds to barely 20 pounds . It 's perfect for all of them ( although naturally I am not leaving it out all the time or the youngest might chew it to bits . ) You can see them on flickr .
5 #### Love this game . The deluxe version is a plastic mat rather than cardboard . I would like the mat a little better if it was a little smaller but it is still good .
5 #### My son just loves these ! He started playing with as soon as he got it !
5 #### super fun , durable and lots of hours of fun !
2 #### Overpriced and extremely hard to take apart . Surely no small child could get these eggs apart by themselves .
2 #### These are really cute and I love the education concept , however they are a little hard to open . I have a four year old and one year old and they are always coming to me for help " Mommy help . Open these . " It can be a little frustrating when you ca n't open them yourself and they are " patiently " waiting .
5 #### My son loves this toy . He got it at about 16 months and loved it right away - he is 19 months now and still loves it and so does his 2 year old cousin . I am happy because someday when he does n't care about putting the shapes together it can just be eggs for his play kitchen . The carton is hard to open , so we just do n't snap it shut .
2 #### Small packaging , plastic outer part broke within 2 days and is extremely hard to open
3 #### My two year old could take these apart and put these together just fine but could not close the case . I also have a feeling the tap that keeps the case closed will fall off soon . These are cute but he did n't continue to play with them . I like toys that kids play with long - term . He has other kitchen toys he prefers much more .
5 #### What an adorable gift ! I purchased this for a little girl who just celebrated her fifth birthday . She was ecstatic ! Her mother thought it was a really neat gift , as well . I mentioned it to one of my girlfriends , who went out and bought one too ... but for her two year old . I think it would be a great gift for all sorts of ages . I may just get one for my two year old , too .
5 #### I ordered this butterfly net to house caterpillars we found in our garden . So I will update more once we use the voucher and receive the caterpillars . As for the net , it seems to be exactly what I thought it would be . The quality is exactly what I would expect for a kids toy . My 6 and 5 year olds are enjoying checking in on their cocoons every morning . :)
5 #### My 5 year old neice loved to watch the butterflys grow , it was nice to have indoors so she can see the changes everyday . upon opening the box you ll find a voucher for the catepillarswhich will take some time to arrive so do n't get this if you excpect to grow them within the same week
5 #### This was very very cool ! ! Fun way to watch every stage of growing ! ! Very easy to take care of ! I would def . buy this again ! ! !
5 #### I do daycare and my kiddos were in love with this project . Such a fun time to watch the changes , and then release the butterflies .
5 #### Awesome tent ! Super easy to put together , lightweight and compact when packed up . Great for using for indoor play ( pretending to be camping or whatever ) and outdoor use as well . Its really lightweight when assembled so use rocks or something heavy inside it so the wind does n't blow it away if no one is in it . We 've had this for years and its still in great shape .
5 #### Love our tunnel ! the only bad part is this extra flap thingy that I guess is for attaching it to something else . It gets in the way , otherwise it is awesome . long enough for 3 girls to fit in and then play peek a boo throught the mesh windows ! ! ! LOVE IT !
5 #### We got this for the kids ( 3.5 and 8 months ) for Christmas , but I do n't know who enjoyed it more : Uncle Phillip , the cat , or the kids . It was rolled in , jumped on , worn , clawed , and chewed on . It 's durable and easy to collapse . It 's fun to pop it out when the kids are bored and then put it right away before bed . I could really use about 3 of these , velcroed together end to end in a big circle with the kids trapped inside . It might give me a minute of rest !
5 #### I bought this toy when my son was just over 6 months old and crawling . The tubular construction is padded so it is easy on the knees . Another thing that made it a great choice is the peek windows that allow the child to see you or crawl towards where they hear your voice . My son is now almost 5 and it is still one of his favorite toys . He and his friends pull it out and have a blast . The best thing is that it is so well made that it is still in great shape . My son was a late in life child so we are able to buy just about anything we want for him , and we do . ( Although we do rotate and give to charity quite often to keep him from having too much ) So when I say this is in the top 5 of all the toys ever .... it is saying something . So much so that I am ordering another one for our 7 month old nephew for Christmas .
3 #### Buy a milkweed flower and do n't waste your money
4 #### The closure on the carton is very flimsy . I can see it breaking in the near future and the eggs are pretty hard to open but my son still loves it !
4 #### There was mixed reviews on this toy , so I thought I 'd share my thoughts on this since I just got it today . Pros- FUN toy for my 2 year old to learn shapes & matching them up together . Also great eye - hand coordination . So far , my daughter is loving it ! Con - the box is a bit hard to open and close . Once I figured it out it 's a bit easier , but near impossible for my 2 year old . I figured I can eventually throw out the container and put the eggs in something else . Overall- glad I bought these ! Like I said , my daughter likes them ! :)
5 #### Excellent product ! My son loves matching the shapes and colors .
5 #### Used this a few time when we went out with baby , then it turned into a play tent as she got older . Worked great for added protection from the sun , then she had a blast with it as she got older ! It has really held up well for the 3 years we 've had it , too !
4 #### I have n't used it but once . It came in handy , and the mat that it comes with is great for that comfort from hard floors !
1 #### Bought this for my grandson and he loves it .
5 #### My 3.5 years old at the time I 've bought this set loved it and played with it . Now he is 5 and still like to make more sophisticated construction on occasion .
5 #### Best game ever , love this version . My old sequence game has the regular cardboard game top and it 's getting worn out . I wish the company would sell the cards separately as mine are getting so worn
2 #### Good idea . Bad design . The eggs are hard to open ( even for adults ) . The case is cheap plastic . The latch is tricky to use . My child wants to like this product , but she keeps getting frustrated .
5 #### These eggs are a HUGE hit with any child I have seen play with them . I will buy more .
4 #### The eggs are difficult to get apart and whilst younger kids may be able to match the shapes they do not yet have the dexterity to get the eggs apart and back together again . My daughter is four and has difficulty getting the eggs apart . She does use them in her pretend kitchen though . The colors are nice and they look like real eggs - so it is basically a good product , but if you are thinking of them for a two year old think again - they will only get frustrated . Better to wait until they are older unless you can assist .
5 #### Who does n't love Frontier Logs ? These must be a part of every child 's memories . Everything was as advertised and was a fast delivery .
3 #### They are okay but they were advertised as Lincoln Logs and they are a facsimile . I think it might be considered false advertising ! All in all , they work for a youngster .
4 #### Our grandson loves to build with this set we recently got him . He became familiar with these at a hospital we visited . We saw he liked them . I have a Lincoln Log set when I was a child & incorporated along with other toys while playing which he seems to do on his own . it has a lot of the small log pieces , so I would recommend keeping everything together in the box when playing is finished so that the next time the child wants to play with it , it will all be there !
4 #### Good value for what you get . Pieces seem strong and durable , but 2 or 3 of them are slightly damaged . It 's like corners were broken off on original cut or something , but they 're all smooth and do n't really affect the logs or the building fun . If I could rate 4 1/2 stars I 'd have done that because the " damage " really is n't much , but still warrants a non 5 - star rating . Other than that , they 're just like the classic lincoln logs so no big surprises . Value seems really good to me , compared with other logs and also compared with what you 'd get for this price when buying some legos .
5 #### Best birthday gift for a 4 year old boy . He LOVED it . What an amazing idea .
5 #### Great gift - my niece is still enjoying it . Gives her something to check on each morning - and helps environment . She is excited .
5 #### My toddler loved this- it will defend become an annual tradition
5 #### I bought this for a beach trip for my 9 month old baby at the time , but we never got around to assembling it while we were there . I just recently broke it out for playtime for my now 14 month old in the basement and ... wow ! I 'm so confused as to why I let it sit around unused for so long ! ! It 's a snap to put together - even for the directionally & manually challenged . My daughter likes it - one thing I can say is that when closed up , the airflow is obviously a bit stuffy , but she can easily tear down the front flap when she wants - she quite enjoys it . ( I have not yet used it outside so perhaps the airflow factor is a good thing in the cooler weather months . ) I will say that if you are using it on slick or tile floors , to watch the smaller kids getting in and out of it - she 's slipped up on it a few times as the mesh becomes almost hazardous against the slicker tile flooring . I can fit inside of it with her at the heigh of 5'6 if I sit / crouch .
5 #### I found this easy to put together and it was perfect for the beach . Enough room for my 1 year old granddaughter to either stand or lie down . The only down side would be that it does n't come with anything to secure it down , so I bought separate stakes , but other than that , I loved it .
4 #### Got this for our grandson for shade at the beach / park . Works well , but there could be a bit more shelter from sunlight on the sides . Overall , a fine pick , though .
4 #### Cute tent we took it to the beach for our daughter to sleep in the only thing i wish i would have gotten one that popped up alot of assembly
5 #### Tunnel is great for multiple kids cuz nobody is fighting over different parts . Entertains for a good long while . Folds up easily & small & stores out of sight . Very durable - we drag kids around the house in it - no tears .
5 #### Every bit as good as Lincoln Logs , and at a way better value ! Yes , kids CAN break them , but only if they 're playing with them like out - of - control beasts . These stand the test of time . Refreshing change of pace from the electronic , blinking , noise making , cheap ( but expensive ) plastic toys . It 's nice to buy toys that DON'T do all the imagining FOR the kids . Too much built - in detail in most toys today teaches the kids to depend on OTHERS ' imaginations , and retards their OWN creativity and problem solving . two thumbs up for frontier logs .
3 #### I never cared much for Lincoln Logs when I was a kid , but I thought my kids might like them . You never know , right ? But it seems the same thing is true now as it was when I was a kid : Lincoln Logs are great if you like building log cabins , and only log cabins . And my kids do n't seem to be terribly excited about building log cabins . As to the toy itself , the pieces are not constructed very cleanly , so the pieces do n't hold together very tight . It 's a decent toy , I guess , but just not our brand of fun .
3 #### Product is fine . I felt duped because it did not come with the caterpillars . It does come with a coupon to purchase the caterpillars . But that 's little compensation for an 8 year old opening a birthday present . Needless to say , she and I were unhappily surprised at the same time . I have since used it to catch a fly in my house , and set it free .
5 #### We have now grown butterflies with this for 2 springs and it is in good enough condition to hold onto it again for next spring . You do have to buy the caterpillars each time which are ridiculously overpriced . But I enjoy it and so do my kiddos .
5 #### This is our second purchase of this kit . I ordered 2 this time so that each of my kids ( 7 & 9 ) had their own to use . Clear instructions and everything you need to grow your own butterflies . Great learning experience for my kids . Highly recommend this .
5 #### My 4 year olds learned about butterflies in school this year . They have been obsessed with the little insects for about 9 months now . This butterfly habitat is great for them to see the life cycle up close , with all the instructions on how to keep them alive ! We have bought this for several birthday gifts for friends and family as well . It is always a big hit . I like that you choose when to get the caterpillars , so that if you have a vacation planned , the little guys are n't frying in your mailbox waiting for your return . The instructions are easy to follow and they guarantee that at least a portion of the creatures will form a chrysalis and emerge as butterflies . Every one we have purchased has been successful for all 5 , so far , so I have not had to contact the company if there is a failure .
5 #### Birthday gift for my 4 year old granddaughter --- SHE LOVED IT
5 #### I got this for my almost 3 year old son 's birthday- he 's absolutely thrilled ! The eggs are kinda hard to pull apart while it 's new , but once the initial stiffness wears off , this is the most awesome toy- I knew after watching my son go for this same toy in every home , school or office we visited that had them , that this would be one of his favorite Christmas presents ... and it was and still is !
4 #### The eggs are great and will likely be a staple toy in the play kitchen at our house for a long time . The case broke really quickly though . I love that the eggs are fun for pretend play and that there is a shape and color matching element as well .
5 #### My MIL had some of these from when my husband was just a wee one and the grand kids still love them so I was thrilled when I found them . the kids love the puzzles and also play pretend kitchen with them .
4 #### My kids got these in their easter baskets this year ( 2 & 3 ) . They have fun playing w / them and matching them up . The carton is hard for them to open & close , so I have to help w / that . Cute game .
5 #### My kids ages 2 1/2 and 18 months LOVE this tunnel . We got it for the kids for Christmas and keep it put away and bring it out about 3X a week in the evenings when we have had a slow day and the kids did n't get any energy out . They go CRAZY , they play and run and scream and crack up ! My husband drags them through the house super fast and they sit in it and laugh their butts off . You can play peek a boo , or roll balls through it , the possibilities are endless ! It 's by far the BEST gift . The kids do n't fight over it , no one gets hurt , it does n't break , it 's SO cool ! It folds in no time and folds so small , it does n't take up any room . BUY THIS ! ! !
5 #### My 8 - year - old son has been using ( and abusing ) this tunnel for six years now . He does n't just crawl in it ... He also throws it around the house and yard , walks around with it over his body like a Mummenshanz puppeteer , and bends it , hooks , it , stuffs it , and otherwise tries his darndest to wreck it . And you know what ? The tunnel has held up perfectly . No rips , tears , holes , broken hoops ... It seems almost indestructible ! Definitely one of the best investments I 've made in my son 's play life . Since I first wrote this review , my daughter started playing with this tunnel . She 's five now , and is just as rough on the thing as my son is . Still holding up , still great fun .
5 #### We used this for our son at 7 months old . Just have to make sure you have something heavy inside otherwise the wind will blow it away . Otherwise , it worked for us .
5 #### This was a very fun activity for summer with my preschool - aged boys . The net cage is high quality . The instructions are clear and easy to follow . We ended up adding on an extra cup of caterpillars at a discounted price and 10 out of 10 are now butterflies . I could not be happier with the experience ! ! ! ( Side note : while there is an included voucher for the caterpillars , you will have to pay a $ 7.95 shipping fee . Not a big deal , but I was not expecting that when I placed the order . )
4 #### This is great for memory and also can be used for thematic play . We use it to crack and pretend that we are baking . The pieces are a little tight but kids can separate the egg halves . The eggs sometimes can stuck in the case if they are put in there separated .
4 #### My one year old loves eggs , so when I found this I thought it would be a great toy for her . And I was correct , she took to it right away . She loves her eggs and has hours of fun taking them apart and putting them back together . It helps her with her colors , matching skills , and shapes . Also , it helps her with her hand eye coordination . I give it 4 stars because some of the eggs are a bit too hard for her to pull apart and some that come apart with barely a touch . The round shape had to be glued back in . Overall I recommend this toy .
5 #### My girls love this . It looks great in their little play kitchen and it is educational as well . I tried to reduce the poor quality plastic kitchen toys and use good quality products instead . The shapes are easy to put together & they look realistic .
5 #### The garden is very nice and will keep all the butterflies very happy as you watch the process .
2 #### This is basically the net cage , a pipette , and a half price voucher for the cup of caterpillars . THE PRICE OF THE CATERPILLARS IS NOT INCLUDED . They have n't even told me how many I should expect . But . My 5 year old is super excited now and I pretty much have to buy the caterpillars for " a small $ 8 fee for shipping and handling " .
4 #### We bought this for a camping trip . Great to contain my not yet crawling infant . Wish the velco for the screen was a zipper . If that was the case , this product would have gotten a five .
5 #### Took it to the beach for naps for my 9 month old granddaughter . Worked well for a changing zone ( less movement due to fewer distractions ) . My daughter sat inside to nurse her because of fewer distractions when inside . We did set it under a canopy to keep temps down . Easy to set up and take down .
3 #### My 6 month old loves being outside so I decided to buy him something he can relax in whether at the lake or in the front yard . This tent was easy to put together and fits what I need it for . The only downside is the mat it comes with , its pretty flimsy and does n't quite fit the bottom of the tent and is not what is pictured . It does n't have stars on the bottom it 's just plain green , which is not a big deal . I remember reading the description and it saying it had a carry case which I did n't get one so not sure if there was supposed to be but I just kept the box and when I need to transport it just load up the box which is thin and portable . Not quite what I expected but for the price and it 's purpose it 's just fine .
5 #### Caterpillars came in time as expected and all 5 survived . They are very lethargic for the first 2 days I even thought they were dead but they perked up . My son loved watching them grow !
5 #### My daughter informed me she needed eggs for her kitchen . I bought these simply because they opened . . . but , she is going to go crazy when she realizes they are like a puzzle too . ( she loves puzzle and to organize ) Ca n't wait to giver her these for Christmas !
5 #### I bought this for my 2 year old to help her learn her shapes . She loves it and it does a great job serving its purpose . A must have .
3 #### The concept of this toy is great ... the sorting / matching and pretend play -- all of my kids 5 , 4 , and 1 love this toy . I do wish the quality of the product was better -- then I would give it 5 stars all the way . The case is filmsy , and more importantly the eggs are really hard to come apart - even for me . They do n't always seem to align up right when you stick them together ( for me ) and I attribute it to poor quality .
5 #### We had these eggs 30 years ago when my children were babies , and I was so happy to see that they are still available for my grandchildren to play with . Perfect for kitchen play , these span a wide age range .
5 #### The squeaky egg set comes apart instantly , the eggs are very shallow . These eggs are bigger , stay together longer , there are actual shapes that matter . The squeaky ones have a shape only on the bottom of the carton which is just annoying . More to do with these eggs , and we have chickens so good play eggs are important !
5 #### My son just loves these eggs ! I really like that he has to match up a shape and a color to get the eggs put back together . One thing that I do n't like about other shape sorters is that kids can shove the wrong shape through different holes and then you completely miss the point . With this sorter , the only option is the RIGHT SHAPE ! Otherwise , the eggs just wo n't fit together . Great idea !
5 #### We loved this experience so much and we are already planning on doing it again next year ! All around an amazing experience for kids and adults .
1 #### The caterpillars are free , but there is a $ 15 S&H fee .
3 #### This is such a fun and amazing project that me and my seven year old did together . Its amazing to start with teeny tiny catepillars and see them turn in beautiful butterflies . The reason it gets 3 stars is i found it expensive . You buy the habitat for $ 17 and then wait for it in the mail . When you recieve it you then get a voucher for catepillars and spend $ 8 online to buy them , and have to wait for them to arrive . Its sad because if we want to do this again i will have to pay $ 15 plus shipping to buy more caterpillars .
5 #### My daughter 's friend was excited to receive it on her birthday .
5 #### Got this for my 5y / o grand daughter . We are near the time for release of the butterflies & I know that will be bittersweet for her .
5 #### Infant tent was easy to assemble . The size is perfect for infant ( ours is 6 months old ) Would recommend for quality & price .
5 #### Excellent game for family play and friend entertainment . Highly recommend
5 #### My granddaughter loved this garden . Caterpillars ( 5 ) came quickly .... and all turned into butterflies !
5 #### Our 5 month old loved this when we went to Mexico . It lets a great breeze through and is sturdy
4 #### Bought this for a beach trip with a toddler and an infant . Did what it was supposed to do , however not as easy to setup as I 'd hoped . I 'll give it this -- very well made . I 'm sure we 'll use it again , especially now that I have it figured out . The instructions were a bit lacking , and quite honestly probably what made it difficult for me to setup . Do n't over - think the setup and you 'll be okay . Just do it . It 's not all that difficult after the initial setup . Might try setting up a time or two at home for practice before needing it out " in the field " , so to speak !
5 #### Kids love science , and they love to watch things grow . Great product to watch butterflies emerge from their chrysalis . Highly recommend for school aged kids .
5 #### Worked exactly as expected . All 5 of our butterflies hatched . Only one was not able to fly away . I would and will buy more butterflies and do this again !
5 #### We purchased this tent for a recent beach trip with our 2 year old . The assembly was super easy and it folds up small enough to fit in my beach tote . I would suggest planning to place something heavy in the bottom to avoid being blown by the wind when the child is not inside , but otherwise , it 's perfect !
5 #### I 'm never a good judge of the size of things when I look at the spec 's I 'm a more visual person so I was really wondering if this was going to be big enough for my 8 month old nephew . But when it arrived I was quite happy and surprised by its actual size . I 'm a medium build 160 pound women and it fits me and the little guy with some room to spare if I 'm sitting cross legged . Its extremely easy to set up and take down and light weight to carry around the yard with him on my hip . I bought this one because it also has a thin foam mat insert and not many of the others had that . I do wish that it was a little thicker for when we 're on hard ground but I usually just put a pillow in behind him as well . It keeps him well shaded and visible while we work in the garden . My only complaint is that I wish the door zipped up instead of having velco because it only took my nephew 5 minutes to learn how to pull the door open and reach out to grab a handful of dirt which is what we did n't want him to do . But if we put his back to the door and spread out all his toys infront of him it usually keeps him busy .
5 #### I purchased this for my daughter with my grand daughter to use while on beach vacation . My daughter loves this tent . The well ventilated play tent is the perfect place to shelter a baby to nap or play under the sun at the beach . It 's quick and easy set up .
5 #### This whole process was so fun ! All 5 of our catepillars turned into butterflies , my 3 year old was thrilled . We 'll definitely be doing it again !
5 #### Works great . Just do n't make the same mistake I did ( my own fault ) - you have to order the critters separately .
5 #### Amazing ! ! Easy steps to follow- all five caterpillars turned into butterflies . We even got to watch two of them actually hatch ! Watched them for about a week , then released them . Could n't have asked for anything better !
5 #### great family game a big hit here - easy to learn how to play
4 #### This is a functional play tent for our little ones ( have a two and a half year - old and one - year - old twins ) and for the most part , we 're liking it . Set - up is a snap and takes maybe 5 minutes . The tent itself holds its shape well and the included pad provides decent padding on the floor of the tent . The only issue we have with it is that there 's not much weight to it and if only one child is in there and stands up , they could actually tip it over ( luckily it was within arm 's reach ) . We 've largely taken care of that by adding additional padding underneath the included pad and positioning , but it would have been nice to know about beforehand . All - in - all , it 's a nice play tent for the price and fun for the little ones .
4 #### Does n't contain child , just Velcro closures . But cute for the beach to keep them out of the sun . My boys seem to like going in and out the most . Keeps sand out of the food if they eat in there instead of on a towel .
2 #### Wish we 'd known that the cost of shipping the caterpillars adds another $ 7.95 to the price . The size of the habitat has also decreased by 50 % size we last purchased this set , which was about 5 years back . Overall , a beautiful experience . However , in my opinion , a very small pop - up net should not cost $ 20 .
2 #### The price keeps soaring along with the butterflies ! I 've purchased these kits for our kindergarten class for at least the past 10 year but based on the increase this year - Caterpillars went from $ 5 to $ 7.95 and the kit went from $ 12 to $ 19.99 - we will do more of a Do - it - Yourself Science project . It 's definitely not worth that price !
5 #### This was SO much fun , and worth the experience with our kids .
5 #### We loved this ! ! ! All of the butterflies hatched . A really cool project !
5 #### We tried out a tunnel at a Gymboree class and she loved it . I like the mesh so I can see what she is doing without sticking my head in . I have it propped between pillows so it does n't roll as much . My daughter is 7 months old and it looks safe , I am not sure what small pieces they are referring to on the warning label . My sister gets in the tube with her and chases her out . It folds down easy and does n't take up a lot of space . Using it indoors when we are forced to hibernate for the winter !
4 #### < div id="video - block - R1YZJSHEQZ8BMM " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1CCtImMwlS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/61r8gWszCsS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">The Pacific Play 6 ' Tunnel is fun for kids and house pets alike . Our daughter loves to crawl through the tunnel so that she can " explore " the other side - and so does our cat . The tunnel is lightweight and can collapsed so that it takes up very little room during storage ( see the video ) . it takes less than a minute to open and collapse the tunnel - so set - up and clean - up is a snap ! Pros - You can see through the tunnel , so it does eliminate a potential hiding place - Set - up and clean - up is a snap ( although be careful when you " uncoil " the tunnel it does unleash with a bit of force ) . - Takes up very little room during storage - it is fun ! Areas for Improvement - The mesh can snag - not too big of a deal , but you should expect a few snags . Final Verdict - A nice option if you are looking for a tunnel for your child to crawl through ! 4 Stars
5 #### So excited for my grand daughter to use . It 's great
5 #### Bought it to take camping when our baby was 9 months old . We used it for outdoor naps . Roomy and comfy . Great way to keep baby safe and out of the sun .
4 #### Great for beach or playing in the yard all day . Nice coverage , pretty easy to get up , not really a " pop - up " though . Will not keep all bugs out but will keep most of them away . Great for if you are working outside in the yard and the infant is playing or the baby wants a nap . Then they can get fresh air and you can get some work done . Also good for beach , travels small , but there will be sand inside and again , not a " pop - up " so if you are on a beach in the sun , get ready to sweat .
1 #### The Description Says It is for kids up to two years old , but my child easily tips this over at sixteen months by pushing on the walls , not safe at all . If the tent had not been sitting partially under my kitchen table , my kid would have slapped his face right into the tile floor . Reading one of the other posts about this product containing lead , it 's going back for sure .
4 #### I really like this tent , but we broke it after just a few months ' use . I like the removable mat ; it 's thick & offers lots of cushion . The price point was good for us . We used it in the living room , the yard , and the beach with our ~1 year old . Unfortunately , one of the plastic tubes of the poles bent and now the tent does n't work quite right . I will investigate getting a replacement . Given that as an adult trying to be careful , I easily messed up the pole , I 'm not sure how well this tent would stand up to abuses by older kids . It 's a cute tent , but be careful when you 're setting it up & taking it down .
3 #### I bought this to protect my son while he napped on the beach . It worked really well but it was a but challenging to assemble
3 #### I did a bit of research before I purchased this tent as well as read quite a few reviews . I finally settled on this . I promptly took it camping with us after recieving , It was handy for play reasons and is extremely durable . I would compare it to a cheaper version of an adult tent for quality sake . My only complaint would be that there 's no way to zip the tent , lack of a zipper . Instead it seals with three strips of velcro , which does n't work well when your camping . I would have liked to zip it . For this reason we mainly use this tent to keep goods such as food , or other camping items . It 's not waterproof , but I had n't expected it to be . It would be appropriate for a play toy as one would purchase it for .
4 #### We love this tunnel ! ! My kids love it & it is big enough for Mama & Daddy to play in it too . We 've had ours for a year & a half or so . My only beef is the velcro straps that are used to keep it closed can snag the mesh if not very careful , but so far no holes from the velcro , just very slight snags ... I may cut it off & tie it closed w / something else that does n't have the snag risk , however , I have n't yet done so because I honestly do n't want to leave something separate laying around when the tunnel is in use ... just a choking hazard & something to lose . I may end up taking the hook part of the velcro off of the closure strap & adding KAM snaps to the straps instead . We bought two of these as gifts after seeing what a big hit it is w / our kiddos !
5 #### Bought this for my kindy this year so we could watch the lifecycle of a butterfly . It was amazing ! The net is easy to clean , very lightweight and portable , and the perfect size for 4 or 5 butterflies !
3 #### It is easy to assemble and dissemble . Ingenious : sticks with elastic straps inside them . It is fragile . The wind knocks if off immediately . My baby likes to stand up , and for doing that , he holds one of the walls and pushes himself onto it so that he can stand up . So , I have to sit him down every time he attempts this because he will fall over inside the tent making it to roll somehow . Lots of fun right there , but I did not buy this for this kind of fun . It is very frugally made , but it is something you can carry easily , assemble easily , you can isolate your kid in to play with toys , even leave your kid sleep inside . So , it is a an OK - Good item . It serves your purpose . Besides , the colors are fun , the fabric protects from sun ( need to move that side after the sun ) . I still have it , still use it , so , it is a good buy after all .
4 #### My little guy ( 10 months old ) screams when I try to put him in this in our backyard , which is a big reason I bought this , to keep him protected from sun and bugs while his older siblings played . I even put a blanket down in it and tons of toys . So keep in mind that if your baby is mobile they might not think much of being ' trapped ' . I will say for some reason he did okay in it at the beach , once , and my older kids love it so it was't a complete waste of money , it just wo n't serve the purpose I bought it for .
1 #### This tent is really cheap , and I dare to say it 's dangerous for kids , it arrived with brown stains ( like it was used ) and one of the poles set was broken , it went directly to trash because I do n't want to return it and make them able to send it again to another kid . Awful , awful , awful ! ! !
5 #### Put this out in the hall at my son 's first bday , and all the kids LOVED it , walkers and crawlers alike . It folds down easily enough to take it to a friend 's house , and even more sensitive kids are n't afraid to get inside since it 's transparent . Even my 15 year old cat likes to play in it . The velcro for the storage straps can get caught on the walls of the tunnel if it is latched carefully , but so far no holes .
5 #### I actually ordered these to protect my sofa from my dogs -- they've got full access to the house and yard when we 're away ; but after two sets of destroyed sofas , I decided something had to be done . So I ordered these and placed them on the sofa and it keeps them off ! Cost much less than the Sofa Savers at Petco !
5 #### Our son loves playing with this . He loves going back and forth in it and playing with his toys dragging them with him through the tunnel . Ca n't wait for our new baby so they can play together with this .
1 #### This was slightly disappointing ! I opened the box to get the Boucher so I could send off for the caterpillars and hopefully receive before Easter and there was n't one !
5 #### Easy to put up , great for indoor play . My 1 year old son loved it when he received it , and still does 6 months later . My dogs also like to think of it as a big dog house . I sometimes remove the tunnel and collapse it to save space , so that 's really a nice feature . It 's a cute way to give the little ones a small space of their own while still being in the room with you . Also has helped some gross motor skills with crawling through the tunnel and learning to duck in and out of the front door . Would recommend to someone who has the space to have it inside in a play area .
4 #### I wanted a tent I could easily pop up & take down for my toddler bc we live in a small house . This tent is very easy to assemble , and has also done just fine with my 7 month lab puppy bolting through it .
5 #### My 2.5 year old and 11 month old love this tunnel . The closures are easy enough for my oldest to undo and it folds up small enough that I store it underneath my youngest child 's crib ( which is currently on the lowest mattress level . ) Great product !
5 #### my son absolutely loves this tube it is very easy to put away and to store away . it is made to last ca n't wait to bring it outside
5 #### I have a 10 month old grandson and a 3 1/2 year old grandson and I wanted something for both boys to be able to play with either by themselves or together . The Fun Tube is just the right toy for this . The 10 month old crawls through easily and the 3 1/2 year old crawls after him and vice versa and lets them play together for a while and seems to break the age difference down . They play wonderfully together with the Fun Tube ! ! The tube itself if very durable and is big and long but it can quickly store away easily into a small , flat circle that keep together with Velcro strips . It can be used outside or inside and is very light weight . Lots of fun for the boys !
5 #### My grand daughter is 16 months old and loves this tube . She sits in the middle of the tube and giggles .
4 #### I gave this to my 1 year old for his birthday and his 4 year old brother seems to be just as entertained by it . It had a very strong smell when it came out of the package , but it seems to be airing out quickly . Folds up easily and takes up very little space .
5 #### I have not even opened this yet , but I will update you as soon as my son goes to play with it ... but it shipped and we recieved within two days or ordering it ! Hope my soon to be one year old will enjoy this as his first birthday present !
5 #### really enjoyed this set . the first set of butterflies did n't hatch , but the company quickly sent out replacements at no charge . the 2nd batch yielded 5 butterflies . the kids loved waking up each morning to check on progress . would recommend .
5 #### Did n't like the fact to send out mail plus $ 5 for larva , but anyhow we captured our own and watched the whole cycle . It 's smaller than I expected , we had about 7 caterpillars and was a bit cramped for them . Regardless , it 's neat lil cage net for them:0 )
5 #### I prefer this butterfly net over other brands ( where the drawstring net has to be hung on a base with a hook ) . So much easier to use this ! Price is great too , such great value . This is great for classroom , the kids are enjoying seeing the butterfly 's life cycle ! Insect Lore has never let us down ! !
5 #### We 've used ours a few times now ( order the caterpillars from amazon , they 're cheaper after using the initial coupon ) . My boys love it every time !
5 #### Ordered 12 of these for favors for my nature - loving daughter 's butterfly birthday party . The guests loved them , but will have to wait to order the butterflies . The butterfly habitat itself is a good size .
5 #### 3 or 4th time ordering . A must have for Spring .
3 #### This tent is easy to construct and holds togethers very well for the price . But I quickly discovered it was designed for younger , less active children than my 15 month old . First , she put all her toys into it and started pushing it over with one of her push cars , that seemed innocent enough , but before long she was in it herself pushing the walls and rolling around the playroom as if she was inside a giant gerbil ball . Foreseeable misuse ? She also enjoyed pulling the poles out , so that she could wave them around and poke at things . If she could , my toddler would give this product five stars and title her review , " Great Fun , " but from a mommy 's perspective , it was not safe . We had to take it down .
5 #### I purchased this for my infant son to use while on a beach vacation . When it arrived I put it up , by myself , in my living room . The assembly is simple with only 2 poles to insert into the pockets on the tent- it probably took me 5 minutes total . The pad that you lay on the bottom is a really nice feature as it will provide a comfortable place for my baby to lay instead of having to lay on the hard ground . Taking the tent down is just as easy . The tent and poles fit in the provided storage bag , but the pad ( which is like a kindergarten sleep mat ) does not fit in the provided bag , so you will have to fold it up and find somewhere else to put it when you take the tent somewhere . This is not that big of deal , but I thought I would mention it . The entry door to the tent has a velcro closure . It does not come with any stakes or anything else to hold the tent in place , except the weight of whatever is inside . This is an easy fix- I am just going to bring some camping stakes that we have with us in case it gets windy . The colors are cute and the tent seems to be of good quality . It will work perfect for what I needed it for and I am glad I made this purchase .
4 #### We took this tent on vacation with us for our 9 month old son to use on the beach . We needed something to contain him and keep him out of the sand . Super portable and fun for him and his brother to play in .
5 #### We love this game ! We 've given it as a family gift too and it 's a hit every time . Even though it 's a real game of strategy it 's easy to pick up and the games do n't last too long . We play it often . Highly recommended family game .
4 #### If this is a cushioned surface I 'd hate to see what a non cushioned surface look like . I 'd also like to see 12 players crowded around this tiny little board . That WOULD be a sight . Four players max . I think I 'm going to glue to a hard surface
5 #### I bought this for my grandson 's second birthday , and it was a big hit with him . I 'm sure he could have used a smaller tent , but I knew his sisters would try to get into it too , so I went for a pretty big tent for a 2 year old . He loves to crawl through the tunnel to get into it . His older sisters like to take a book inside and read to him . The tent is easy to assemble and move around . It 's study and the colors are great . Very pleased with this product .
5 #### This tent is so much better than a lot of the other ones on the market . It does n't bend and fall over constantly like the cheaper ones . So far it is durable and really good quality too .
3 #### I purchased this ten for my twin grandbabies . I was disappointed that the tent is a bit flimsy and the seams tore open after just a bit of play . They do , however love climbing through the tunnel .
1 #### As soon as I open the box the smell was too much ! Did not even took it out of the box , that can not be safe for children !
5 #### My daughter loves playing with this . It is sturdy and kid proof as well . Kids have fallen onto it and it springs right back into shape ready for action . My favorite part is that it easily folds flat for simple storage . The clear mesh made her a lot more at ease about crawling through the tunnel I think .
5 #### I bought this in addition to the tent , but this tunnel is just as fun by itself . My one year old loves it .
5 #### This is a wonderful product . Our entire family enjoyed this project . Our children , 5 , 7 , and 2 even used it for a long time after to collect other bugs and observe them for a few days and then release them . It did get a hole in it because of a stick used for a katydid habitat . But I 'm planning on ordering another one to replace it . This time maybe the bigger one . It is really a great way for kids to observe and learn about nature .
5 #### We had so much fun doing this ! My kids LOVED releasing the butterflies in our backyard once they were ready . Very fun process . Did n't take long to get the caterpillars ( or whatever they 're called ) at all . My sons teacher did it and told me about it , their entire class loved it too !
5 #### I experienced this life cycle when I was 5 and in kindergarten my teachers got it because we were learning about the life cycle of a butterfly I loved going to school to see how big they got over night then the special day that the cocoons hatched some of the parents came ( including my mom ) we all stood outside and the teachers opened the net habitat thing and we watched them fly away but it was 4 years ago so I do n't remember if the life cycle happened fast
5 #### Great experience watching the life cycle of caterpillars to butterflies . My daughters were in tears watching their butterflies fly free !
5 #### Bought this for my autistic nephew . He loves it and will sit inside for quite some time providing his mom a break . Worth every penny .
4 #### This is great ! Lots of fun and super durable . It 's durability may be its only drawback because the wire that provides the structure for the tube is uncomfortable to lay on . But that is the only drawback . It does n't slow our girls down much from enjoying this fun tube !
5 #### My granddaughter ( 4 ) really enjoys this tube . It became her " chrysalis " and she became a " butterfly " ( her Mother is into butterfly herding ) . She also likes to walk around in it with her head sticking out so it 's on it 's way to being a costume of some sort . She liked it so much I bought one for another of my grandchildren and am awaiting feedback . The tube lends itself to a lot of imaginative ideas and creative games . I had seen similiar ones in a preschool setting but not as colorful . I 'm glad I got it for her .
5 #### Love this game ! Super easy to learn and super fun to play . I 'm a heavy board gamer , I was surprised to see a game that I find in a typical toy store THAT interesting ! You can play this game with almost any number of players , and its replayability is still as interesting as the first game . Highly recommended .
5 #### I do n't know why people believe this tent tips over . My son has tried ... and tried ... and tried - from all sides ! It holds its own very well against my toddler . We use it inside as a little play tent and he loves it . He will drag his toys inside and play . I put a blanket at the bottom ( which may be why it does n't tip over ) and he will sit in there for quite some time . I consider it his little home away from home - at least until he is old enough to have a real tent . Very easy to put together and break down . Instructions are simple and they even provide a little storage bag .
5 #### We love the butterfly garden at our house . This is the second one we have bought as the first one was used so much it developed holes . We love watching butterflies grow and putting all different kinds of bugs inside our very own butterfly garden !
5 #### Great butterfly habitat . All the butterflies that were delivered lived and we were able to release . We also raised some monarchs who 's eggs had been laid on our milkweed outside .
5 #### Love this game , only wished I had gotten the Jumbo model , it is Larger writing . Product was new and came in great condition
4 #### Love this ! Got this for my daughter 's 5th birthday , as she is obsessed with butterflies and it 's such a great way to learn about their process . When we received the box I was grateful that the mail in voucher reminded that as soon as it is sent the live larvae will arrive shortly . We were just about to leave for vacation so we waited to send it in . Once we did , we received 6 larvae and 3 of them turned into butterflies . My daughter loved checking in on them and watching their progress . I was a little nervous about transferring the lid to the pop up habitat but found this helpful video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zt20TOkBCXY . The transfer was fairly smooth but one did fall off in the process and , as expected , did n't transform . Overall I would get this again , in fact my daughter has asked for this exact gift for her next birthday .
4 #### Got this for a winter corriculum for home schooling , the only down side is you have to order the catpillers from another web site and it 's another 5 dollars
5 #### The butterfly garden is such a wonderful , up close and personal way to really observe the stages of a butterfly . It 's difficult for younger children to understand just from a book . This brings the " ahah " moment to a child in a fun way and fascinates them ! This one was a gift for a special needs boy . Look at that smile on his face !
5 #### We took our 9 month old baby to the Jersey shore this weekend and the tent arrived quickly and worked out great . It sets up easily and I like that it comes with a pad for the bottom . My baby girl enjoyed playing and sleeping in it both at the beach and in our living room when we set it up the first time after it arrived . We were really glad to have it to protect her from the sun AND the biting green flies that were really bad this particular day . They were biting all of us , including the baby , and we quickly got her in the tent and velcroed it close . We all wanted to get in it at one point , we were getting bit so much ! The mesh sides allowed the breeze to get in there and it was shaded nicely . Baby seemed to keep cool and comfortable .
5 #### We just got this tent and set it up , I am very impressed ! Good quality , easy to set up , love the side vents and the front velcro closure . Also love that the bottom is waterproof . We plan to take this camping and will be on beaches , I think it will be great with a blanket in it for baby naps . Love that it will keep the sun off and the bugs out . Love the price too ! My only negative is that I do n't like that it says Lil ' Nursery accross the top , I wish it was blank , or said something else . Or just had a picture or something . Oh well !
5 #### This is a really fun tent ! It fits all three of my kids at the same time . They love to take it outdoors and play with it , which is nice with the SPF protection on a hot and sunny day . My eight month old loves to play with it too , which is useful since its been too hot for him to be in the sun ! Its also very easy to put up and take down , and comes with a bag to store the tent . I only wish it were available in more colors rather than just purple / yellow ! Overall a great buy ! Glad we got it for our beach trip .
4 #### As described , however , I wish it came with some type of tie down or method to secure it . We do n't have a lot of storage space , and have been leaving it outside , but I have to use rocks to keep it weighed down . I put my 4 month old in it on a blanket if I am going to be gardening for a while so that I do n't have to leave her inside and use the baby monitor . She gets to be outside in the fresh air , but is protected from the sun . Update- used this again at around 8 months on a camping trip . My daughter sat and crawled in it for chunks of time and it kept her safe and off the ground . Now she is walking and summer is around the corner . I can see her still using it as a fun play tent in the yard . All in all , a good baby purchase with multiple uses , which is nice when most of what else you buy is being discarded every few months ! Update again ! - My daughter is 14 months old and walking ! We have this outdoors in our yard and she enjoys going in and out when she is playing . I plan on taking it on a camping trip in May for her to hang out in .
5 #### My daughter loves this project we do every year !
4 #### Ordered the catepillars and did the 14.99 shipping so that I knew they would come alive . Ca n't wait to see how they grow .
5 #### This was a lot of fun for our family . Its a bit of a process but in the end it was a nice lesson about life and change . You must make sure to follow the instructions very carefully since these are living creatures and depend on your care to survive . I would highly recommend for a family project , for homeschooling or in the classroom .
5 #### This product was perfect . We received our caterpillars . The students loved watching them transform . We were able to go to our playground and release the butterflies . It was a wonderful experience for my students . Great quality kit .
5 #### I read so many of the reviews on this Butterfly Garden . I was buying either way but I wanted to be prepared for how many Caterpillars would be dead upon receiving the shipment . I was so happy to see that all the tiny Caterpillars were alive ! We have loved this product so much we have bought them as gifts for all our kids ' friends . They are so much fun and a neat learning experience . I highly recommend getting this for your kids .
5 #### 7 year old had this in his preschool few years ago and all the kids loved it . Now he wants one for the caterpillars he finds ( which i think are moths ) . I m sure we will order a batch with the included order form too
3 #### It 's just a pop up netted container . I did not expect much more but was annoyed that the " certificate " to mail in for the butterflies and food requires $ 8.95 fee . Not the $ 5 in the description of the product . Upon further review of the product listing I see a $ 7.95 fee indicated ( although the $ 5 is still on the listing as well ) . Well mine just arrived and I need to pay another $ 8.95 to get the butterflies now ....
5 #### We loved ths tent . Our toddler is the type that needs structure and when we travel he has a hard time sleeping . The tent gives him the structure that he needs and loves . He used it for nap time and for sleeping at night . We used the pad from our pack n play that he out grew to give him more comfort .
2 #### I had a set like this when I was younger and I knew my son would love it . We ordered this as a birthday present . It arrived on time , and caused a great deal of excitement ; however , there was no caterpillar voucher anywhere in the package . I even dug the box out of the garbage to double - check . It took me over a week to get in touch with InsectLore to have the situation rectified , and when they finally sent the caterpillars another week later , they arrived dead . After contacting them about this for FOUR days in a row , and sending them a million pictures of the caterpillars to " prove it " to their sales representative , they repeatedly told me to " keep watching them , they 're fine " , even though they were clearly dead . On the fifth day , I finally received an email code for a new batch from a completely new customer service rep , however , by the time this got worked out , my son had really lost interest in the idea . So now I have this mesh container collecting dust in the back room and an email voucher unused in my inbox . Maybe next year .
3 #### During our annual trip to SoCal , our son was just starting to crawl at 7mos . I picked up this tent so he 'd have some refuge from the sun and could nap inside . I had also hoped he 's be able to play as well , but half the time he was interested in pushing against the mesh walls , which withstood his efforts , but I do n't think they would have if he was a month older . This is definitely a good tent for the immobile or barely mobile baby to hang out in if you 're on a beach vacation . I suppose if you hold on to it long enough , it 'll make for a good play area when they 're a little older and do n't want to pull up on everything . Decent quality of construction and ease of portability .
4 #### Its cute , great for outdoors and inside ... I have it set up inside my daughters room and she loves to crawl in and out of it . But ... it does nt have stakes or anywhere to use stakes ... so ca nt use it on a windy day without something weighing it down ... besides that its great .
4 #### We got this tent specifically for the beach since our pediatrician recommended we do n't use sunblock until baby is 6 months . Until now , we were taking our big , bulky , adult camping tent and setup was a huge hassel . This play tent is simple to setup and it does block the sun very well . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the velcro closures are cheap and the netting is very thin . Our baby is stil little , immobile and not able to pull on the tent material . I am sure he will be able to bust out of this easily once he can pull himself up and push .
5 #### This is an absolute favorite game of mine , and I play a lot . This Deluxe version is really nice ! The roll up mat beats the heck out of the folding board original version I also own .
4 #### Grandsons will love this when they get to open it . I did n't realize that they got to let the butterflies go when they were done . So they wo n't get to open this until springtime so the butterflies wo n't die since it 's late fall here now .
5 #### Kids loved this activity and still use the net after releasing the butterflies . Very durable !
4 #### pros : great product , we got all 5 butterflies , my girl was watching it every singe day the see the progress , the butterflies were beautiful . we kept everything ( needed to wash it in the washer ) so we are going to do it again in spring 2016 ! cons : needed to pay extra money for shipping of the larva , which I think should be included in sale price ... nobody like to receive gift that they have to add $ to it .....
5 #### This was pretty impressive . Be aware that it does not come with caterpillars . It includes a certificate you use to order them online for a small fee ( $ 6 ? ) . They arrived quickly , but it 's delayed gratification if you expect to start growing immediately . Those caterpillars really know what they 're doing . We kept the grow jar in the kitchen and they all grew into butterflies -- 5 or 6 of them . Only disappointment -- the ingrates did n't linger upon release at all . They were outta here .... I 'm sure some of you with kids can relate .
5 #### Ordered as a gift for my daughter 's boyfriend last Christmas - something he said he played when he was younger . He loved it ! It is a great game for young and old !
5 #### We spent the summer doing a different learning project each week ( I have a 5 and a 3 year old ) . This was a very good learning experience ! Note - you have to use a code to order the caterpillars separately , so do n't expect to open and start , unless you order the kit directly from the original company . The kit was easy to follow along with and all but one butterfly was successful . Two things I was not prepared for - the blood when the butterfly emerges and one butterfly was born with a deformed wing and was unable to fly away . That was hard to explain to the children . The only con was really that all our butterflies emerged at night , on different nights and the kids really wanted to see it . I set up a time lapse video on my phone to record it .
5 #### My son loved this product . The only thing I would say is beware of the season when you purchase the item . The caterpillars are shipped to you when the season is to right . So keep that in mind when you order this item . My son was very upset because we did n't get our caterpillars because it was to hot . But the good thing is we were able to find some on our trial and put them inside this butterfly habitat .
5 #### we had so much fun with this -- several friends have used it since we did . every kid should get to grow caterpillars to see how interesting it is .
5 #### This was smaller than I expected . It has a zipper to close it , which I like better than the velcro tab on my other enclosure .
5 #### This was my daughter 's favorite " toy " over the summer . We raised many , many , MANY caterpillars in it ! The ones that came with the garden did really well . I was not about to spend $ 20 or whatever to order more , though , so we found our own outside . Just know if you find your own that caterpillars only eat one type of food , so you need to feed them whatever plant you found them on .
5 #### Great customer support . My daughter loved it , received 6 caterpillars and all turned into butterflies !
5 #### I took this on a plane packed in the checked suitcase back and forth to the Outerbanks and it was untouched . We still use it in the yard and just to play in the kids room .
4 #### I bought this when my daughter was barely 1 in hopes to use it at the beach or outside with her . We never used it until she was about 1 1/2 and I set it up in her room to play with which she found entertaining . However , a friend has borrowed it several times for her 4 - 6 month old . It works great for her to use in the yard while hanging out with friends & family ... kinda a bug - proof , crawl / roll away proof , semi - shaded playpin !
5 #### This was a really gross fun thing to do with the kids .
5 #### Gave this to my daughter for her 4th birthday . She loved it ! We had to use our voucher that came with it to order our caterpillars . This built up the anticipation of the whole thing . Once they arrive they are already in a cup with food . All you do is watch them , easy ! Once they form their chrysalis you move them into the net habitat . This was a little tricky , we rigged a couple branches to attach the paper disk to rather than pinning it like they suggest . My daughter checks on them many times a day . Anxiously waiting to see her butterflies !
5 #### We have purchased butterflies for our butterfly enclosure two times . Our son loves watching the caterpillars grow into butterflies ! The only hard part is letting them go ! He always gets a little sad
4 #### This was really fun for my kids . I was happy with everything except for the deceiving " free butterflies " that you get to pay an additional $ 5 to ship .
4 #### We keep this tent in our back yard as a break from the sun / wind . It needs weights or it will fly away . But my girls used it a great deal last summer , we hope to get more use from it this summer .
5 #### Just as all the other reviewers said , it 's great . Serves it 's purpose and it 's fun too ! Easy to assemble and carry
4 #### The toy is great but description deceiving box is non sealed cardboard box , useless for future storage.love the toy glad I bought it , description should be changed .
5 #### I was a little worried about buying this because of the age range from the reviews , my son is 9 years old . But I bought it and he loves it , he uses it with his john deere logging equipment and builds a logging company . Great toy and it is made of real wood , not plastic .
5 #### LOVE this ! ! ! So great to watch them grow and release , we ca nt wait to do this again .
5 #### Purchased the butterfly Garden and a cup of caterpillars . This project is AMAZING ! ! ! Our 3 yr old grand - daughter LOVED to watch the transformation . We read & followed all the directions and had 6 beautiful butterflies to release ! Highly recommend ! I like how this enclosure is soft , it did n't scratch my coffee table . It is light weight , we could move it around easily . And it is collapsible , for easy storage until we use again ! Love it .
5 #### My daughter LOVED seeing the process . She ca n't wait for more butterflies . It was quite disgusting for me to help her hang the chrysalids . Beware ; they wiggle . I had to enlist the help of my oldest child .
2 #### The loom is a bare - bones loom , and the instructions are difficult even for an adult to understand . My daughter weaved about 8 lines with my help and just lost interest as you constantly need to rethread new yarn because it comes in strands rather than a continuous loop . Waste of money .
5 #### My 10 year old daughter wanted to try it out . This is just the right size for her , easy to use and sturdy enough . A good toy . cheers --jsd
4 #### It 's a net basket , it holds butterflies and other small insects . It 's easily accessible for placing the animals and their food needed . We have raised 1 group of butterflies so far and this worked great . All items are easily visible through the mesh . It is as pictured and ours came wit ha certificate for a free bunch of caterpillars ( + S / H ) . We have not used that yet as we already had some ready for use .
1 #### Arrived in box not damaged , but inside the package there were many broken pieces and very rough edges . I gave this as a gift and it was just outside the return period when it was opened and discovered to be faulty . $ 22 wasted . So many better building options out there , stick with the original Lincoln logs for the best value and quality .
5 #### These logs were just as good , or better than Lincoln Logs ! ! ! Grandkids LOVED them ! ! !
4 #### I purchased this hoping my elderly dad and my grandchildren would play with it . Sadly , no one has shown any interest . I built the structures shown on the front of the box trying to get them motivated to no avail . The kids did use some of the small logs to fill up the back of the toy dump truck . The pieces fit together well enough . The set contains a large number of the really small logs and very few of the longer pieces . That 's standard but disappointing . The logs arrived with a paint or stain odor . I found that troubling since it is a toy .
5 #### Great blocks my daughter loves them . Not made like when we were kids but not too bad . I wish I bought the bigger set though .
5 #### We chose these over Lincoln Logs because you can get more pieces for the money . We had a set of these already , so we knew what we were getting . They are almost like the Lincoln Logs . Also , both grandsons already had just a small set of these , and we wanted to purchase more to give them more play options .
5 #### good for educational play its a little old for my 4 year old but the older nieces and adults enjoyed helping with it
5 #### We really loved it , no complains . I am glad I read the reviews and knew that caterpillars should be purchased separately . We ordered them and the came within 4 days , pretty alive , will see how they grow . I am ordering another 2 for gifts . Very happy ! Amazing product ! UPDATE 4 weeks later : We ordered the other set for us . got 7 caterpillars , 1 was dead which leaves us at 6 caterpillars forming 6 cocoons and 6 alive butterflies ! We let them go today . Very exciting ! Will order another cup of caterpillars !
5 #### So much fun ! My 7 year old loved it !
3 #### I got two of these as gifts for kids , and then layer realized their parents had to send $ 5 to get the caterpillars and food . I 'm embarrassed to have gotten something that you have to buy more of to complete the gift .
5 #### This is such a great idea ! It was very informative for my niece , and she spent hours every day hanging out with these caterpillars and larva as they grew into butterflies . She loved releasing them into the wild , and learning about the development of them . I also love that you can order additional larva in the future to watch more butterflies grow .
5 #### I bought this when my son was very young . It 's great for camping trips or any time that you need to spend time outdoors . It provides a safe place for them to play and nap while protecting them from the sun , bugs and dirt . Works great in the house too as a play tent . Easily kept in any car for those last minute trips .
4 #### I think my granddaughter will enjoy this . We have not used it yet , it is a Christmas gift - but it looks very sturdy , and she loves crafts , and I believe she will be able to do this and enjoy it .
5 #### My son ( 3 years old ) has adored watching his caterpillars grow ! It 's the first thing he wants to do when he wakes up and wants to show everyone he sees ! Our caterpillars came safe and we even got an extra 6th one . Very fun for the whole family .
5 #### Shipping was really fast . We received six caterpillars . They did n't move much so I could n't tell how many were alive . I drew lines on the outside of their tub where each one was so I could see if they moved . It turns out all six made it alive . They grow really fast . It was fun to watch them , but I wish we could have held them . One day five of them went up to the top and made their chrysalis . The next day the sixth one did it . About a week later five of them hatched . It happened really quickly . We did n't even get to see it . We put fruit in for them to eat . The next day the sixth one hatched . We kept feeding them fruit for a few days . It was tricky changing out the fruit without letting them escape or squishing them . Then we took them outside to set them free . None of them wanted to leave their little house . Eventually five of them flew away . The sixth one hung around and let us hold him for awhile . That was nice because none of the others wanted to be held . We ca n't wait to order some more caterpillars and do it all again .
5 #### Wonderful gift for my 4 year old whouse LOVES butterflies !
1 #### This toy was very dissapointing for my son who loves Thomas toys and the show . It is poorly made , do not mistake it for the other train sets of Thomas that you are used to . This is a cheaper version , and the wooden cars will not work with this track . I do not mind that it is plastic , what I do mind is that it does not work . It did not even last 1 hour with my son and I before it was completely unusable . The pieces were poorly made , do not fit together properly , and do not work . Keep looking for a better Thomas set .
5 #### We got several board games for Christmas this year , and have really enjoyed trying them all out . This game is definitely one of the BEST games so far . It states for ages 8 + on the box , and I feel that 's about right if you 're looking for a family game . We 're just a couple in our late 20 's , and it 's challenging enough for us to enjoy . It 's great as a 2 player game . The rules are very simple , only took us about 10 minutes to get it all figured out and start playing . If you get this game , you 'll want to play game after game after game after game ! We love the use of the Jacks in the game too , a fun little twist . Overall , Sequence is a keeper , and we 'll be enjoying this one for years to come .
5 #### This is a really fun and easy game . I bought it for myself , gave it for a gift . Now I am buying it again to keep for myself .
5 #### I normally buy two or three new board games every year as holiday gifts , and we often find a new favorite each year . This one is no different -- once you know the gameplay , this game moves fast , is easy to follow , and is a lot of fun . We do not like games that require us to " overthink " everything , yet not be so simple as to insult anyone 's intelligence . Think of this as sort of a variation on tic - tac - toe or bingo . Keep in mind that the game requires two or three players , or teams with players in multiples of two or three ( two or three teams of two players each , for example ) . The " board " is actually a vinyl playing surface that unrolls , which is actually a nice alternative to an actual game board . It comes with two nice sets of cards also -- material quality is quite good .
4 #### Works great for a baby that is not yet mobile . Now my baby will sit in it for a few minutes with some toys , but wants to be out with everyone else . This was great when she was smaller though .
4 #### We used this a lot when our daughter was n't moving around a whole lot -- now that she does ( 8.5 months ) we do n't use it as much . A great buy for the price , though .
5 #### My 28 month old grand niece loves this . We tried it out in the living room before the we went on vacation to the shore . It works great in both places . It does not even sway in the breeze ! She loves to play and nap in her tent ! I ordered this through Target , which had a link to amazon . It took over three weeks to be shipped . Five stars for product , one star for shipping .
5 #### How can you not love this ? You get to see the process of life right in the comfort of your own home . This is a great little project to do with your young children . My son LOVES this thing , especially when he gets to set them freeeee !
5 #### My students LOVE this . I use it every year .
5 #### My kids simply loved this experience as did my husband and I. The kit arrives with a code to send off for your caterpillars so do n't expect them all at once but this is for the welfare of the insects so I 'm fine with that , Also be prepared for an extra $ 5 postage charge to get your caterpillars but I still think its worth it . 5 very hungry caterpillars arrived and it became a daily event for us all as a family to sit and review their development . This will teach your kids more about the life cycle of butterflies and metamorphosis than 100 books or art projects or videos on the subject . 5 beautiful butteries emerged about 2 weeks later and we released them all into the garden . Highly recommended and the garden can be reused with new caterpillars in future so even better value for a classroom
3 #### This product is a nice idea but when you go to send away for the caterpillars you have to pay a hefty shipping and handling fee on top of what you paid to purchase the product . It should all be included in one fee .
5 #### Always one of the first games we grab from the closet ! Easy to play for two or four players . Lots of fun with a nice mix of luck and simple strategy . Great for non game people since it only take a minute to learn .
4 #### With the humidity here in NY it 's hard to offer much help to a baby like mine that does n't like the heat , but this does offer some relief . I keep it in the car so if I go to someone 's house and we are bbqing or whatever I can set this up in the shade and let the baby sleep . It folds up very very small into its own little drawstring bag so it 's not a big deal to carry along with you . It is large enough to fit a few kids -- my nieces age 3 1/2 and 1 1/2 can not stop fussing over my 3 month old and they get in there with him and poke at him when I set it up . It is very easy to set up , but I would suggest you bring a big towel or pad to put at the bottom because the vinyl / plastic / nylon ( ? ) it is made out of would not be comfy for baby on the ground .
4 #### I bought one of these tents last year when our daughter was 10 months old , and we wanted to work in the yard . Unfortunately she was a little weirded out initially by the tent , and us zipping her in . I then decided to move it indoors , and then get inside with her , and then play with her . It has never gone outside again . She and all her friends love playing with the tent . I think she would go inside it again if I had put it outside , but it was easier to keep it inside . The one concern I have with these tents is the siding . It is good that you have mesh ( so you can have some air flow through the sides as well ) . When we first used the tent , it was in the middle of the HOT TEXAS summer , and honestly , she was not getting much airflow into the tent . If you do n't have a good breeze , those tents seem like a hotbox ( just without the direct sunlight ) . I would recommend using the tent indoors before using it outside ( especially for those under 12 months ) , and make sure you have some air - flow . Educational value of 2 stars because the children learn how to zipper the door open and closed . These things are pretty durable , good sized , and easy to break down and pop up . I really recommend , as long as you take precautions .
3 #### This toy is a favorite in our house , but only when I have time to sit down and watch him play it . Being only 3 1/2 he is not able to fix the trains himself when the come off - track . So mom has to come to the rescue . This toy is more or less to just watch , if you want a more interactive toy look elsewhere .
3 #### My three year old son loves watching the trains and " scoop truck " go around the track and do their various tasks . It is very facinating to watch , however , not alot of interactive play . The instructions are poor - at best - and requires a patient adult to learn how it goes together . If the engine comes off the track , it requires the same adult to get it back on task . Plan to spend the time with your child while s / he is playing with this . The little balls will definately get lost and they end up in parts of the track they should n't be in . The slightest bump makes the engine come off the track which means you have to constantly keep curious hands off the track . We were prepared for this because we had a similar item a few years ago so it was no surprise to us . As long as you are ready for what this toy requires , then you and your child will have fun watching it . The Thomas characters are adorable and very exciting to a " fan " .
5 #### A great starter loom . I wanted something I could try out weaving with and this was a great choice . Small enough that it does n't take up considerable room but big enough to create adorable wall hangings . A great buy for the beginning weaver !
5 #### My niece was absolutely ecstatic when she got this for her birthday . She loves butterflies as much as I do , so I knew she would love this when I bought it for her . It 's a perfect size for her to grow a few butterflies at home that I 'm sure will intrigue her for hours .
5 #### This is a very nice product for the price ( we got it on lightning deal ) . Daughter enjoys using it .
4 #### I bought this for my grandchildren as birthday presents because I thought they would really enjoy actually weaving a piece of cloth . They first had the potholder loom and that was a big hit so I thought this would hit the spot . I also purchased extra yarn for more weaving possibilities .
5 #### Great net ! Our first set of caterpillars did n't make it but I sent them back and amazon mailed another cup right away ! All 4 caterpillars turned into butterflies ! My boys ( 2&4 ) loved the experience ! We will do again in the fall when it cools off !
5 #### I bought 5 of these . Seriously love them . 5 Caterpillars come quickly(certificate is in garden - you pay 5 $ to have them shipped ) . One batch of caterpillars only produced 4 butter flys but such is nature .
5 #### Got this for granddaughter 's 10th birthday ... she was ecstatic !
5 #### 2 year old grandson loves it . Have ordered two rounds of caterpillars already
5 #### This is absolutely amazing . My grandchildren ages 5 & 7 watch them morph into butterflies . They were set free in the name of my recently deceased sister , what a heartwarming event .
3 #### I purchased this set used , but in excellent condition . My son is almost 2 and loves this train set ! ! I have to agree with the reviews that complain about the " no hands - on play " . It is difficult for my son to just watch the engines do their thing and not interact . He wants to be involved , but as I said , he still loves it and constantly wants my husband to set it up for him . I am sure he may get bored with it eventually ( as he gets older ) . I think my husband enjoys it more ! :) One reviewer stated that it is difficult to set up according to the instructions . My husband had no problem setting it up ( and we did n't have the box to go by ) , but it does take a few tries to get it going smoothly and in the right directions to work . Overall it is a neat toy , but kids may lose interest quickly . It may be more exciting with the other set attached .
1 #### We got this train for our daughters 4th Birthday and when we took it out of the box the main train that pulls the rest was broken . We tried to figure out how it goes together and never did so she has not got a chance to play with it ! The box was in great condition so I really do not know how it was in so many pieces when we got it ! I am not happy about that , but as far as fun ... can't say due to it never working ! ! I hope others that purchase this toy have better luck that we have had .
3 #### My mom bought this for my son . It never really ran right , would n't stay on the track , & the pellets go everywhere . He would get frustrated & so did I. We put it away the first day & no one ever asked for it again , thank goodness .
5 #### Excellent learning tool for kids and grown ups ! What an amazing experience this was to do with my kids . Highly recommend this and will do this every year in the spring with my kids . Bravo !
5 #### Once you figure out the assembly , it 's a really neat little tent . It keeps the sun and wind off my baby and I get to enjoy the outdoors .
4 #### We liked this little loom . Be aware though it does take time and practice . The hardest thing to do is not pull the yarn on the side too much . You have to be very careful or else your project will start out ok and then get more and more narrow . We did order the Harrisville Designs Wonder Wand and that made it much easier to do the weaving . One thing I do wish Harrisville would do is to PLEASE put up an instructional video for kids on how to tie off the end of the project when you are finished . I think it would be help them sell their product to put up some youtube videos for it , as well as help kids learn how to finish it off .
2 #### My son received this toy as a Christmas gift , and we were disappointed with it . Once out of the box , we were frustrated with the number of small parts , such as the tiny plastic balls which are used in the loader . These could be considered a choking hazard for younger children . Also , there is very little room for " hands on " play . The trains merely move around the track by themselves . My son became very frustrated with this and wanted to push the trains himself . I had to tell him that he would break it if he pushed them . I recommend that you purchase one of the excellent Thomas wooden train sets . They are much better than this set and allow for much more interactive play .
2 #### it was not clearly described that you have to remove one heddle then reinsert it onto the warp . my granddaughter has difficulty in doing this step .
5 #### I 've now seen four people ages 5 , 7 , 27 and 67 become intrigued with weaving thanks to the Harrisville small wooden pegloom . The kit gives adequate instructions and helpful suggestions for first time weavers . The yarn sent with the loom is of deep primary colors . Surprisingly , the pegloom is sturdy and can even survive inventive little boys !
2 #### Thomas and his friends , Percy and Terence , they load , fill , scoop , haul , and dump their cargo of " rocks " around this bustling construction site . The vehicles move backward or forward , it is automatic when your child chooses which area the engines will go to next . A chute that dumps the load of rocks into Percy 's tender and Terence will load Thomas with rocks . It was fun to look at for the first 30 mins but then my 30 months old son gets tired of it . There is no hands on interaction except controlling the loader to go forward or backward . I do n't think it is a good , stimulating toy for my son ! ! !
5 #### SAVE THE BOX : excellent to store loom and tools in , and for the times when you need a lap - table to work . Purchased this for a 9 - year - old who wanted one : they love it . I would not invest in one for a younger child unless they have tried it enough to know that they want to do it : It is a slower , more patient craft , but very relaxing . It also keeps one busy for quite awhile . I would definitely recommend getting the wooden spacer ( looks like a wood comb ): it really does make it easier and takes the tedium out of the process . The additional colored yarns are beautiful , but cheap yarn from a craft store will do the trick , especially until the weaver becomes experienced enough to really start planning pieces . It 's good quality yarn , just expensive for beginner projects . Really fast to set up : it arrives as shown , all you need to do is knot the yarn at one knob and then wind it across the loom as you loop it over the pegs . Then you are weaving . Instructions are clear and easy to follow . The only problem is that now I want one , too .
5 #### A wonderful loom kit for beginners and more experienced weavers alike ! The loom comes in a box that is reusable for storing your project and the smell of fresh wood waffles out when you open it :) Very well made , comes with instruction booklet , project sheet , plastic tapestry needle , two shed sticks , stick shuttle , quality warp string and enough quality yarn to complete the project on the project sheet . We also purchased a set of three Vidal Sassoon Purse Hair Piks to use as beaters for our loom kit ... they're PERFECT , do n't snag and are rather affordable too :) Relaxing and FUN to learn / make ... this lap loom kit is easy to use and wo n't let one feel daft over which is warp or weft :D Highly recommend for younger and older folks alike !
5 #### we bought this for my daughters 5th birthday . She absolutely loved it ! The only thing is that you need to send in for the butterfly larvae right away ! The wait was hard as she wanted to set it up as soon as we have it to her . The caterpillars all arrived alive and everyone one of them hatched into butterflies . Very cool experience and releasing them was neat as well .
5 #### My children , 7 and 10 , love the Insect Lore Butterfly Gardens . This is the second one they 've had . I especially liked that this time around you could order the caterpillars online instead of mailing a postcard which made the wait for the caterpillars even longer . But the caterpillars arrived fast . The kids waited with baited breath for them to form a chrysalis and turn into butterflies . It took 3 - 4 days longer then the instructions said for them to emerge but they did eventually !
4 #### I would give this tent 5 stars except for two reasons : be careful if your child tries to pull him / herself to standing while in it because it can tip over . Also , I wish it had a shoulder strap to make carrying it easier . It is featherlight though so even without the strap , you can stick in a bag and carry it that way . Overall , we love the tent and it is the best value for the money spent !
5 #### I bought this as a gift for my mother , who played her original sequence game enough that it completely wore out . The original version which she had was n't poorly constructed , she just played it quite frequently for years and years . This version I can see lasting much longer than the original version . The build quality is similar , but the board is more mat than board and will definitely last much longer . The cards are still standard playing cards , and as such will wear over time . The chips are plastic , and I like the " King " sides of them making sequences stand out easier . A great version of a great game that will last much longer with frequent play due to build materials . Possibly the best version of the game , as I know of none better .
5 #### I ordered this for my kids ( 7 and 10 yr old ) because they love nature . As indicated in the description , the caterpillars do n't come with the cage , You get a certificate for the caterpillars . I went on their website and entered the code for the caterpillars plus paid $ 5 shipping and handling . I did n't pay the extra money for the faster shipping . I live in VA and it took about 4 - 5 days to receive them . The first shipment only had 3 living caterpillars so I did a live chat with their costumer service on their website and told them about the problem . They apologized and indicated they would sent out more caterpillars immediately . They came as promised and there were 5 this time , all living . It was a lot fun to watch the caterpillars grow and turn into chrysalis and then waiting for them to emerge into butterflies . The kids , 7 and 10 yrs old , enjoyed watching each stage and feeding the butterflies sugar water . After 3 - 4 days , we released the butterflies , except for 1 , which had a damaged wing and could n't fly away . This was definitely worth the purchase !
5 #### DOES NOT COME WITH CATEPILLARS HAVE TO ORDER THEM . LAST ONE I BOUGHT CAME WITH THEM .. EITHER WAY REALLY GREAT PRODUCT
4 #### Easy and fun , great science . Nothing died , no kids cried .
5 #### Absolutely loved this ... really needed just the caterpillars as family already had a kit from previous years . But caterpillars so expensive it was just as cheap to buy new kit with caterpillar certificate . Had a lot of problem dealing with the Insect Lore company , though . No website , no telephone customer service on weekends ( weird ! ) and really poor service . Would not deal with Insect Lore company itself anymore . but happy with the kit though Amazon that came from elsewhere , even though it was an Insect Lore kit .
5 #### We successfully grew all five painted ladies and released them ! They were beautiful and we will do this again
3 #### Got it as a gift and did n't know that I need to add $ 5 to mail the butterfly larvae . So this butterfly garden " kit " comes with the net basket - that 's it . VERY similar to a dorm laundry basket . Have n't tried it yet but i 'm sure it will be a good experience for my child . The 3 stars is for the future experience with the butterflies . -2 stars for the inconvenience . My child was excited to see the gift and want to try it right away but had to wait .
5 #### This doll is so beautiful . The reason I wanted it and bought it was because of her raven black hair and her beautiful red lips . She is just so pretty . I 've never seen a barbie doll like this before and that is why I had to have it . I 'm so glad I have it . The only regret I have is opening her but her costume is so pretty and her bodice is nice and velvety and I like how she has long raven black hair . She is just a gorgeous doll . If you have the means , I definitely recommend that you buy this doll and showcase her off as a proud owner ! ! Love it !
5 #### If you are looking for a fun game that requires strategy then I highly recommend Sequence . It is great fun , easy to learn , and provides hours of entertainment .
5 #### We got this bed for Christmas and our little car guy loves it ! ! We have n't had a problem with him falling out , but we used his crib ( without the front rail ) as a toddler bed first and after several nights of falling out , Eric found the boundries of the bed . Every child will probally fall out until they realize where the edge is . The bed is so adorable , but I wish that it came with more stickers . You can buy them for $ 30.00 , but it would have been great if they were included . Overall Eric loves it and ca n't wait to go to bed ! ! It 's a great bed for little racers ! !
5 #### We recieved this bed as a hand - me - down from a friend 's child who used it until he was eight ( would not give it up sooner ) . My son recieved the bed at two - years - old and is now four . This bed is durable ! The bed we have is twelve years old and looks brand new . It is so easy to wipe clean . My son feels that his bed is special and just adores it . He sees " regular " beds other places and feels so proud that his bed is a blue race car . I have a feeling he 'll want to stay in this bed until his feet are hanging off the end . Five stars !
5 #### Recently bought this for my son and he LOVES it ! Now , it was n't such an easy transition for us from crib to bed but that has nothing to do with the bed . We are still trying to get him to sleep in it but he is young and feels a little scared not being in his crib but it 's just a matter of time . My son loves to play with it and read his books on his race car bed and loves to bring people in his room to see it . It was easy to put together and very well made . Our crib matteress fit great there are very very slight gaps but no big deal at all and I just stuffed some baby pillows anywhere I felt that there was a tiny gap . It 's a really great bed and there is no doubt in my mind my son will love it for quite some time . I had also considered the fire truck bed by step 2 and SO glad I did not get that one . My son likes me to lay down with him at night and read him a story and there is no way on earth either my hubby or I would have fit in that one , this bed I love it 's ultra comfy !
4 #### I bought this bed for my son when he was about 18 months old because he just would not sleep in his crib . It did take a little elbow grease to put together but not too bad . He slept in it perfectly from the first night and never fell out . I used the mattress support from his crib instead of a board ; there were no boards at my TRU and the salesman suggested I use the mattress support . I do n't know why that is an issue . My mattress fit perfectly and there were no gaps . This is a great toddler bed , however my son is now three and he is constantly hitting the sides at night . i feel he has no room to move in it . I am disappointed because I was expecting to get lots more use out of it ! From the other reviews I read , this does not seem to be a common problem . Perhaps my son is just a restless sleeper ! !
5 #### I am a teacher and this was a perfect addition to our butterfly unit . The students loved keeping an eye on the butterflies and watching each stage of metamorphosis . We released with the other 3rd grade classes and the students loved watching the butterflies take flight .
5 #### Fun for the whole family ! Do n't buy the caterpillars just wait for your house to arrive and use the coupon for 5 free ... You will have to pay $ 5.00 s / h but well worth it . It was an unbelievable transformation and such a learning experience for the grandkids . Also bought the book to help them see what was going to happen to our caterpillars . Below is a picture of our 3 Painted Lady butterflies in their house , enjoying fresh fruit and flowers .
5 #### So much fun for both kids ! What a fun way to learn about nature and understand life . They enjoyed watching the caterpillars eat and grow . Such a neat process to view and especially when they turned into chrysallides . The letting go part was fun too , even though the kids were a bit sad it was over . The only negative thing i can recall , was when they arrived in the mailbox , there were ants ALL OVER the caterpiller container , it could have been the food inside attracting them , not really the companies fault . I think the ants were just attracted to it , they may have been in our mailbox when it arrived .
5 #### We used this in our homeschool and my daughter loved it . What a treat it was to watch this process !
5 #### This truck is very well designed . My grandson love it .
5 #### Prompt delivery . This is third one of these that my daughter has ordered . It 's a nice kit and all 5 butterflies made it through the entire life cycle in ever kit .
5 #### kids loved it and we can use it more than once .
5 #### You have to play it in multiples of 2 or three . It is very fun for adults and children . It makes you think . It has a very durable board . It wo n't ruin . GREAT GAME ! A must have .
5 #### My daughter is still pretty young , but I am sure as she gets a little older she will play with it more . In my opinion it was money well spent . I was just concerned however on where it was made ( ie China etc .. ) I could n't figure it out for some reason .
5 #### We purchased this for my daughters 4th birthday . We loved it so much . All 5 caterpillars turned into butterflies . The kit comes with a certificate to order your caterpillars . You do have to pay $ 5 shipping and handling when you order them . Very worth it .
5 #### Another favorite truck for a 3 year old child . The magnet is nice and strong .
3 #### Really cool but the shipping on the butterflies is expensive if you want to make sure they arrive alive .
5 #### I used this with my classroom of students . We kept a diary of the changes every day as we watched our butterflies go through their life cycle . It was great . All 5 of the caterpillars hatched . :) I will re - use the garden next year , and just order the caterpillars .
5 #### This was a great way to start educating the kiddos on the life cycle of the butterfly . We followed ALL of the directions and all 5 of our larvae hatched into beautiful painted lady butterflies . Just be sure to release them within a couple of days of emergency from their chrysalides .
5 #### Arrived exactly as described , and works well with the Insect Lore Liv Butterfly Culture .
3 #### Great . No pegs , but knew that before I ordered .
5 #### Great idea for a little guy and the size of the pieces fit in his little hands just great . He really likes it
5 #### A good learning puzzle for children to put together , due to the picture is right beneath each piece . This adds to their success .
4 #### Good but I got it for the reason that on the picture shown it shows behind the puzzle piece its blank , but the one I got it has the pictures behind it . Good puzzle but misleading picture .
5 #### he loves it knobs are easy to grasp for a 2 year old . quailty great will last a long time nice size ,
4 #### Sequence is a enjoyable game for all ages . Deluxe sequence is the best format , because you do n't fold the board , so it does n't have all the folds to deal with .
5 #### We got off to a kid - distressing start with our kit , since the company said they would email us when the caterpillars shipped and we never received the promised email , which meant our caterpillars were housed in the metal mailboxes baking in the sun for who - knows - how - long before we got our mail . The caterpillars all survived , however , and we were able to release all five butterflies . This was a pretty cool project -- I may have been even more excited than the kids . My one frustration was that our caterpillars did everything in about 2/3 the supposed minimum time frame , so from the time we received our caterpillars to the time they emerged as butterflies was about a week . I guess this was fine from the kids ' perspective -- not much waiting -- but I was trying to emphasize how we learn about creatures by observing them , showing my kids that our critters were just as described in the booklet because scientists had studied and learned about this kind of caterpillar and knew how it would behave . So much for that lesson .
5 #### I did n't realize that the butterfly 's had to be ordered after this package arrived , otherwise I would 've opened it prior to giving to my daughter and had the caterpillars ready to go , but it gave her something to look forward to .
5 #### Kids love to see the stages of caterpillars becoming butterflies . Best part was releasing them . All 5 made it . I enjoyed myself !
5 #### Very engaging for my daughter ( age 5 ) . She was interested in learning about the different stages of the butterfly and was excited to wake up each morning to check out any differences in the habitat . Also great for exercising patience ! She loved releasing the butterflies at the end , and asked to do another round since the habitat is reusable . Would recommend as an alternative to electronic toys !
4 #### Bought for my sons kindergarten class . They LOVED it !
5 #### we had a fantastic time with this ! Love the entire process , great idea for older preschool / school aged kids .
5 #### Love love love ! We just set our butterflies free . My kids had a great time watching and learning about the life cycle of a caterpillar and butterfly . For someone who is bug - squeemish , this was n't so bad
2 #### Warning this does not come with the caterpillars or food . You will need to mail in a certificate and $ 5 . Not worth the money .
3 #### its a game that goes by quicly but my children really enjoyed it . I never played it before I purchased this game but the kids loved it
3 #### Saw this game being used on a tv programme and thought it was a great idea . Reviews were a bit hit and miss and I can understand why . Takes quite a while to set up each game , squeezing the last cube into place is hard . When you turn the block over and try to bang out cubes nearly always more than one drops out . Keeping strictly to your chosen cube does n't make any difference . The hammers were very light so again , kids had to keep banging a cube before it would drop out . I also thought it was expensive . The product is really flimsey . Having said all this my grandkids enjoyed playing the game and trying not to knock the polar bear into the ice . Would n't recommend .
4 #### My 2&3 year old boys love all these big metal Tonka construction trucks , and all the children at the park come running for them when we bring them .
3 #### It 's too small to put a plant in . Because once the catapillars get bigger they eat more . So it 's a little easiest to have plant in there with them .
4 #### fun game . a little hard to fit the ice skater guy In the cube and make him stay up
5 #### Super fun game . We play this often . My son is 7 and still enjoys it .
5 #### My granddaughter loved this . It is fun to play
5 #### Loved this game as a child and my kid loves it too . We bought it and took it on a weekend trip where several families stayed in a cabin . The adults were playing this after the kids went to bed . The only problem is that I lose patience with reassembling the cubes . It takes as long to set up the game as it does to play it .
3 #### My daughter loves this games . I however do n't . It 's poor quality and I get annoyed having to put the ice blocks back together over and over again .
4 #### Toddler loves it , but he 's done breaking the ice in under a minute . Set - up takes longer than the time he plays it , and requires an adult to wedge the plastic ice cubes back into the square frame . It gets old quickly putting it back together over and over again .
2 #### So I guess this is a decent item but comes with draw backs . First one died which was hard to tell my 5 year old . While the process of watching all this is fun it is terrible when you put the time in and are not there to see them hatch . You have to except that you are basically buying a caterpillar that will become a butterfly when you are at work and your child will be angry he missed it , upset when they have to leave and confused when one " just keeps sleeping " . Not worth it if you ask me .
1 #### The code to receive the live butterflies did not work . When I tried to contact the company- it was impossible to get someone on the phone and got no reply from the email I sent . Waste of money .
5 #### Still playing this game . If you do n't own it yet SHAME ON YOU ! i play it with my 4 year old a couple times a week ! FAMILY FUN !
3 #### Nothing like when I was a kid cheaply made
4 #### This game was one of the cornerstones of my childhood . 30 years later , my two and six year old love it as much as I did .
5 #### A classic . Great for youngsters who are just getting into game playing and the 2 year olds who ca n't help but touch and pound out the ice . It also builds hand eye coordination and dexterity .
5 #### Just like I remember playing as a kid . Same hard plastic ice and mallets . Fun game , sometimes the ice pieces seem loose so you can just move them to a different area and it seems to help them fit more snugly . The little character that stand on the ice cube does n't stay put very well but that does not affect the over all fun of the game .
5 #### It does the job . I just wish they made the games like they used to when I was growing up .
4 #### I had this when I was a kid and got it for my children hoping they like it as much as I did . They did ! They had no idea what it was but after playing it they had a ton of fun . Has earned its place in our family game nights !
5 #### Our soon to be 11 yr . old Grandson wanted this as a birthday gift . We were so surprised to see this on his wish list as opposed to something techy or electronic so of course we got it for him . We used to have this game at our house for all the kids to play but we gave it to some kids that used to come to visit that did n't have much . The Grandkids have been missing it every since . we are glad to see some of the Old school games are still around .
5 #### Bought two of these and gave to my grandchildren ( two families ) . The butterflies hatched and we let go . My 4 yr old grandson shed a few tears but all of the kids ( ages 2 to 6 ) had a wonderful time watching them turn from caterpillar to butterfly . They are ready to order more !
4 #### Grandkids ( ages 4 and 7 ) were fascinated . We received 5 Painted Lady caterpillars . Kit includes everything you need . One caveat : while you can get the caterpillars shipped to you for additional $ 5 as advertised , they highly recommend 2 day shipping for $ 13.75 . We took this option as we wanted to make sure we got healthy specimens . Addendum : Shortly before we released the 5 butterflies they laid eggs on the flowers we placed in there ! Bonus feature ! Circle of Life .
5 #### Great hand strengthing game for little ones when setting up the board ! We enoy this one on game night for our family !
5 #### Bought for my soon to be 3 year old granddaughter . She is loving it just as I did when I was a kid .
4 #### Cute way to teach little ones . My three year old loves watching the caterpillars . It 's probably a bit overpriced for what it is - a mesh pop up habitat .
5 #### Kids love having a place to hide , and tents like this one let you provide a safe place to hide that you can still keep an eye on . It 's not a terribly rugged unit , but for the intended age group is sufficient ; just do n't try to use it outdoors . It 's best used on a carpeted surface in a family room or living room . I like the vent on the top- a good safety feature that keeps air flowing in- but you still want to keep a close eye on kids in ANY play structure , particularly the younger ones .
5 #### This is a fun game for 3 years up . My grandson kinda wanted to just break all the ice once we put it all together . Once we played a few times and with patience and coaching he finally understood the premise of the game . Helpful hint . Every time you put back in box make sure to count them . Otherwise if you lose one then the ice wo n't stack back in very well . Oh and my grandson somehow related this game to the movie Frozen . I think because of the start of the movie where the men are breaking ice .
5 #### My husband and son have become quite competitive with this game . It has held up great , and my four year old loves it .
2 #### I was highly disappointed in this . While the netting was great , there is a false advertising that there is a voucher inside to claim your larvae . Yes there is a voucher inside but you have to pay additional shipping costs above all the money already spent , just to get larvae .
5 #### Play therapists use this game to teach social skills like taking turns . My 3 year old can play this game . We play it all the time along with Pop the Pig . Candyland takes too long per game with two people . This is fast and easy to set up . An adult is required to set it up since it is too tight for a typical three year old to set up .
4 #### loved this game as a kid ! purchased it for my 4 year old . My only issue is that it is too hard for him to put together on his own . Not a huge problem to have !
5 #### a classic that my son loves to break and I put back together . Lots of fun ! ! !
3 #### Cheaply made but I expected that given I own similar games . It 's a fun one for my 3 year old so I 'm still pleased .
5 #### Another great " old " game that kids love to play . If you played this years ago - you will have the same fun . The hammers are a little on the flimsy side but otherwise good game and well made .
2 #### 3 minutes of setup . 30 seconds of fun . I loathe when the kids pull this game out .
5 #### Kids are so excited ! We have been watching the caterpillars grow bigger every day . It 's amazing how fast they grow ! ! ! It 's been 4 days so they should be creating their crysalyuses transform soon ! We ca n't wait !
5 #### What a blast ! ! ! Educational , easy , and fun ! My son and daughter love this and so do I !
5 #### My granddaughter loved this butterfly garden . I sent for the larvae early so she could have them when she received the habitat . She is enthralled with the entire experience and it is worth every dime and more . Highly recommend - plus she has the coupon that comes with the habitat to get another batch of larvae and repeat the experience .
3 #### Does n't seem right to charge an additional fee for the caterpillars that are to come with the kit . $ 5 on top of the price already paid . That information is n't stated when ordering .
5 #### preschool class loved this hope to use it again soon
3 #### it should be more clear that you have to pay another $ 5 to get the caterpillars
5 #### Gave this to my son for his 5th birthday and he had so much fun playing it . He thought it was funny when the ice would break and make the bear fall down . And he loves breaking the ice with the hammers .
5 #### We love playing this game with our 4yr old ! She played it with her 2yr old friend and they had a blast . Putting the ice pieces in can be hard so an older person will need to do that . Great game at a great price .
4 #### I do n't understand the appeal , but my first grader LOVES this thing . Ca n't stop playing it , and it actually gets him really would up . It 's cheap and they love it . What 's not to like ?
4 #### So much fun for young kids . We played this endlessly when my kids were toddlers . Very fun game that kids do n't tire of easily . Easy to play and set up and a quick game when you 're looking for something fast to play . Even kids a little older can play with younger siblings / friends / cousins .
4 #### So this game consists of a plastic table that is hollow in the inside and you place the " ice " blocks into the middle . They are all held in my friction between adjacent blocks and the pressure exerted from the tabs on the edges of the plastic table . Pretty clever if I do say so myself , wish I had thought of it . So , once the blocks are in place ( which takes a little bit of time ... maybe 2 - 3 min ) you put an ice skating bear on the special block and then take turns tapping out different blocks and trying to find loose blocks that wo n't cause the whole thing to collapse ( and dunk the bear in the lake I guess ? ) . Overall a pretty active game that my 4.5 year old son loves playing . He does n't really get the strategy of the game much but likes wailing away on the blocks with the little hammers that come with the game .... meh at least he has picked up the concept of " turns " . Overall a pretty cute game that is well made and worth the price . It 's not going to be hours and hours of play time but we bring out occasionally and have a good 20 min session of fun . I try to make my reviews engaging and useful . Please click the helpful button if you thought this review was worthwhile . Thanks !
3 #### I got this for my 4 year old . She loves it . It is one of her favorites . My 6 year likes it just as much . We play a game pretty much every day and my 6 year old is great She loves a variety of games and I have found very few she does n't like but it is harder to find ones that my 4 year old truly enjoys . Being barely 4 her attention span is n't great and she gets bored quickly . Not many games hold her attention . This one is a game they love to play together . My kids would play this for a couple hours straight . Problem is that the parent has to put all the pieces in and 30seconds later the game is over and you are doing it all over . Very frustrating . It would be nice after prying all the cubes in to make the ice rink it would last a little longer than 30 seconds . But the kids love it .
5 #### My daughters can not stop playing this game . The price for this old school game was exactly as well .
5 #### This has been really fun . Yes there is a $ 5 fee to get the caterpillars . We had one arrive dead . So 4 butterflies . Then one caterpillar knocked down another chrysalis and it died . So only 3 . That is how life works , so it 's a good view of reality . A great activity for fun or school .
3 #### The more I play " classic " board games from my childhood ... the more I realize they were n't that great . The problem with Do n't Break the Ice is that it takes a while to set up , then takes a very short amount of time to play - especially with a younger kid ( or kids ) who will just want to break the ice as fast as possible . Then you have to set it up again , and repeat , and repeat . It feels more like a chore than a game . I suppose it 's somewhat interesting to tap out the little ice blocks , until only a thin couple rows are holding up the bear , but there are other " dexterity " or " balance " type games I like wayyyy more - Rhino Hero , Animal - Upon - Animal , even plain old Jenga . I 'd suggest trying something else ...
5 #### Family favorite for a 22 month old and 3.5 year old .
5 #### This was a gift and my grandson loved it ! ! !
5 #### This tent never ceases to please . I 've had one of these , or very close to it , for decades while raising children . It goes up in minutes and can be used inside the house , in the child 's room even , it 's not that big , but very roomy and useful . Also quite sturdy and can be used outside as well . For the price it 's a miracle .
5 #### Our family loves this and gets one every summer .
2 #### I have not used my butterfly gardens yet , but I have high hopes that it is going to be amazing . The negative review is because the enclosed certificate is basically useless . I ordered 3 of these and 3 of the Ladybug farms and my certificates did not work because you are not allowed to bundle the certificates with any other products . Ie - Maybe the certificates work if you redeem them INDIVIDUALLY with no other products , but otherwise no go . This is a problem if you are buying more than one because you need to have them shipped 2nd day air . Obviously , if you do n't bundle the order , you 'll spend more than the certificates are worth in shipping . If you do standard lead - time , from the time you order until the time you have a hatched butterfly is about 5 to 8 weeks . I just dropped another $ 150 on actual bug larvae in addition to the gardens / farms I purchased .
3 #### Made well for the price but not that fun to play .
5 #### Got for my 5 year old granddaughter . We had a lot of fun playing . There was a lot of giggling too
5 #### My 4 year old loves this game . It is also interesting for adults for a little while .
4 #### A classic game that my 3 yr old loves to play . I will likely be buying the other sets offered by Hasbro for the 3 - 5 yr old range due to how much my son loves it . The build of the game is a little cheap , mainly the frame . I can see it holding up for a while , but eventually breaking under use .
5 #### Kid already love it just waiting for the caterpillars to come !
5 #### This was really neat and he caterpillar customer service was great !
5 #### My kids loved this so much , we bought a second one and took it to their elementary school class , so the other kids could experience it .
5 #### Cute tent and fairly easy to set up and take down . Plenty of room for 2 year old , toys and grandma .
5 #### I gave this to my grandson and he loves the game ! ! !
5 #### purchsed as a gift for a child at a Christmas party but did n't arrive as expected , arrived late and was n't able to give .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for my daughter 's upcoming birthday . She asked for board games this year and since she will only be turning 6 , I wanted to find games that are not too complicated and are fun . I had this game when I was a child and I loved it , so I am sure that she will too .
5 #### Our kid is just over 2.5 years old . She KINDA understands the game ... but she does n't get the concept of winning . She just gets excited when all the " ice " breaks . But she absolutely LOVES it . It 's kind of a pain to keep putting back together after each round - so parents will grow tired of this quickly , but your kids will love it !
5 #### My kids seem to enjoy this . They like catching bugs and putting them in it to watch them move around and eat .
5 #### What a great game ! My four - year - old boy loves it . It 's fast so it keeps attention while teaching strategy and how to take turns . I highly recommend it for your preschooler .
5 #### The kids love this game- especially my 4 year old . You have to set it up for them after each turn if they are young , but other than that it 's a great game ! And fast shipping
5 #### " Guess Who " has a lot more going for it than the ubiquitous Gameboys . For one thing , you actually have to TALK to your opponent to play this game . For another , you develop questioning skills in order to " one - up " your opponent next time . Most of all , there are no levels that get beat , thus requiring purchase of yet another game cartridge ! My boys have passed many an hour on the road playing this game , and it has inspired many a creative effort on their parts to try and come out on top . Sometimes they go for most obscure clue , others , the quickest round . I have also used the game with students who are cognitively delayed to teach questioning , and language disabled kids to help them focus on pertinent information . Of course , they are simply told we will be playing a game . Heaven forbid that they might learn something ! This game has been a classic for years with good reason -- it appeals to many on many levels . I will never forget the first night our two boys were in separate rooms across the hall from each other -- playing " Guess Who " through their walkie - talkies !
5 #### This game is so much fun . Just as I remember it .
5 #### Super cute little tent . My 1 1/2 yr old great grandson loves it and that 's what really matters . I would n't take it camping but as a toy it is really cool . It 's easy to put up and down and we 've used inside and out .
5 #### I put it up in the bedroom and my grandchildren love it
5 #### For the $ 11 I paid for this , it has easily become one of the best gifts my small five year old received during this past Christmas . Basically , you receive a kit that includes a butterfly habitat , a small instruction manual and a voucher that you use to order your caterpillars . You then go online , enter the coupon code from your voucher at the Insect Lore website . You have to pay $ 5 ( which makes the total cost for your butterflies about $ 16 ) for shipping to most locations in North America , but about four to eight days later , you receive a cup with five small caterpillars inside . ( with the included food they need to grow ) And then , over the next ten days or so , you watch as they transform into the chrysalid stage and then move them to the habitat . About three days later , they emerge as butterflies and the look of delight on your little one 's face will produce emotion on yours . After that , you feed the butterflies a sugar water diet for the next few days until you release them . Might sound a bit corny , but it is a great learning experience for a small child . My little guy had a great time watching them grow and develop from caterpillars to chrysalids to butterflies . Easily a five star product .
5 #### great product , worth the money , we had a ball watching them hatch and letting them go .
1 #### Beware : this is NOT the older version of the game that is pictured in this seller 's ( BuyforLessUK ) 2nd and 3rd photos . ( The version where you pick a card and all the peopl flip up or collapse down flat . ) If you want the older version , you will be disappointed . The version I received is the one pictured in the first photo ; it has doors that open left to right and two rows of faces at the top of each board . I loved the original version of this game as a kid ; that 's what I was hoping to buy here , but this was not it . Good luck .
3 #### The new version is cheap and kind of annoying to open and close . Also , there are only about 5 women to chose from . On the other hand , you can swap out the people for animals or some other pages that you can download from their website , but expect poor image quality and images to choose from .
1 #### dumb game ... tap one block a few at a time fall ... takes about 3 hits with the little hammer and all fall down !
4 #### My boys absolutely love this game . They received it as a gift when they were 4 and a year later , it 's still one of their favorite games . It 's a pain to put the ice back in after they play and it 's too difficult for small kids to do on their own . But , it 's an easy game for small kids to play .
5 #### Purchased this with tunnel . It 's my daughter and her friends favorite thing to do at our house
5 #### So far so good . My destructive kids have n't broken it yet !
5 #### This was very fun to watch the butterfly 's grow !
5 #### Lots of fun ! Just keep in mind if you 're gifting this that they will have to pay to get the butterflies . I think it was $ 5 with the certificate inside .
5 #### My 4 year old daughter absolutely loved every minute of this from receiving the live caterpillars and watching them squirm around in the cup for a few days , to watching them disappear into their chrysalids , and then watching them slowly emerge one at a time and flutter around happily . She would literally stare at them for hours , and she loved gently putting her finger under their feet and feeling them tickle her as they crawled around on her hand and up her arm . Releasing them was bittersweet as we had grown quite fond of them , and did n't want to say goodbye - but it was nice to see them fluttering up towards the sun , and they hung around our back yard for a while . We would see them every now and then in the yard until it got cold . We will DEFINITELY be purchasing more caterpillars next season , and doing this again ! HIGHLY recommended for toddlers , or butterfly lovers of any age .
4 #### Just the same as when I was a kid ( 20 years ago ) . I worry a bit that the tabs holding the two frame pieces are going to crack over time due to assembly / disassembly of the frame to get it in / out of the box .
5 #### Bought this as a gift for a friends kid and he absolutely loved it . He had never seen the game before and thought it was so much fun .
4 #### Great game . Wish it had a better box for storage . The base is hard to pull apart for take down .
5 #### Classic game , 3 year old grandson has fun playing .
4 #### My 4 yo enjoys playing the game . It 's a little difficult for him to get all the ice cubs together when setting it up , so I always have to help him with the last few . He has a lot of fun knocking them all down . While it is a fun game for the kids , I have to say after a couple rounds I get annoyed with putting it all back together and suggest we move on to something else ;)
5 #### This game is a classic . Kids love it ! Excellent memory builder .
5 #### Our family loves Guess Who ? We purchased this one NEW , rare for our household ! ha ! Our preteen daughter at that time , liked the idea of this version because you can go online and print different sheets . So , this opened up many new games for our son and daughter to play . I buy Guess Who ? board games to use in the classrooms . The ideas are endless . Words , pictures , concepts can be placed on the playing pieces and how players guess is open ended , depending upon the skills being taught .
5 #### This is seriously the coolest thing ever ! ! We have grown 4 rounds of butterflies from larvae thus far . I have 4 boys ages 2 , 2 , 3 , and 5 and they all LOVE watching their butterflies grow and then releasing them once they 're grown . We 've also given 3 of these as gifts and have been told what a great gift they are ! !
5 #### my 3 year old loved this~ def buying again
4 #### This is the 2nd time I 've bought this item , this time I bought 4 and gave them as Christmas gifts . My 4 year old loves to watch the transformation and it 's a wonderful way to teach her about nature . One downside is you still need to spend an additional $ 5 to receive the caterpillars in the mail , It 's not clear when you buy it and a way of getting more money out of you .
4 #### My sons got this as a Christmas gift from my mom . It 's a little frustrating to put together the first time- but after you do it once it 's a piece of cake to take down and put back up . More than enough room for two kiddos to lay in . Makes a great gift ! I also had my mother in law purchase a tunnel thing to go with it- as seen in my picture . Hours of fun !
5 #### I bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter and it did not disappoint ! It is well made and I was surprised at how big it is ! She has more than enough room for her bed pillow , blanket , stuffed animals - it looks like a ' real ' pup tent ! Definitely recommend it !
4 #### I used to own the old version of this game and I think the construction was a better design . Sometimes new does n't mean better . Still , I like the concept of the game and it 's a great game for language practice for my speech students .
5 #### Great game for kids and parents to play together . No plugging it in , no batteries necessary . a good old fashioned game .
5 #### this is a great version of Guess Who . It 's got several boards not just people but characters and even items to guess . Makes it more interesting and gives more options than the normal game . This was a real hit in our house .
5 #### This is a very good teaching aid type game for preschoolers and my grandson still plays with it several years later
5 #### This game is one that all ages can play . What great fun but would be better if it had more pages to alternate .
4 #### My daughter loved watching the butterflies change but I do n't like the fact that you have to pay $ 10 + per year to reorder the butterflies . So she has turned the butterfly garden into a toy carrier , which makes her happy .
4 #### These butterfly gardens are great . I 've had a 100 % success rate with the shipped butterfly larva . We 've done this a few times and it never loses its thrill . However , the larva gets expensive - it costs as much to buy larva as to buy the whole kit , which is annoying as these " gardens " are perfectly resusable . I wish the larva was available at a more reasonable price . " The Butterfly Guy " gives suggestions for obtaining your own butterfly eggs free and in the wild .
2 #### Disappointed . Lasted 11 days . Stitching in seam came apart and can no longer use
1 #### Note the pictures below which show the doors lifting UP and the individual card for the mystery person --- then note the box cover shows doors opening sideways & a slide card above --- so what am I purchasing --- I chose the box that showed the old - fashioned product ( doors opening up ) and individual cards --- how do I know what is in the box ? ? ? ?
4 #### Point of the game is to figure out which character you opponent has drawn . You ask questions to eliminate people . For example is it a man or woman , do they wear glasses etc . pros : our speech tutor recommended it for our son because you have to form questions to try and eliminate . I like that he has to come up with a full sentence . The kids have to use both broad questions and more specific questions . cons : Not the first game my kids would pick to play - but they will play it . The cards sometimes slip out of their slots - and it was a pain to put them all in when we first got the game .
3 #### This game is cheaply made . Part of the plastic stand snapped off the very first time we played . Also , the little blue windows shut SO easily on their own ( mid - game)that it is easy to lose track of which characters were legitimately eliminated through your questioning and which ones were accidentally " eliminated " because of the self - shutting windows . Lastly , the somewhat goofy pictures make it hard to discern details ... especially on the pets side of the playing card . There are even a couple of animals that my husband and I ca n't even tell if they are cats or dogs ! Needless to say , this is quite confusing for young players . I do n't think I 'd buy this game again .
5 #### My 4 and 10 year old both enjoy this game as well as my husband and myself . Some children 's games are just not enjoyable for adults but this one is more fun than many . Easy rules . The hardest part for young children to learn is which peple to flip down after you ask a question . This game uses process of elimination and grouping like features such as facial hair , glasses , female / male , hair color , hat , and eye color . Overall a fun game ! I like that there are people of light and dark skin but would be nice to show people of different cultures .
5 #### fun game to play with my kids ... I always loved it when I was a kid
2 #### Too expensive . $ 20 bucks just to buy the screened " habitat " , and then $ 5 to get larvae shipped to you .
5 #### My girls loved this . Larva came when I wanted it to . This is a great gift . I would recommend this product .
5 #### My 2 year old grandson loves this pop up tent . He can use it inside or outside and it is a good " escape " . When his sister gets a little older , I 'll get one for her . It 's nice to have a " private place " . Can also be " carefully " used on top of bed .
5 #### So easy to set up and take down . My granddaughters and my cat love this tent !
5 #### They deliver the caterpillars quickly . It is a joy to watch them grow , morph , emerge , and then fly away . A great way to bring Science to life .
5 #### My son has enjoyed this so much we have done the process twice with the butterflies . Its really worth it just to see the excitement in the childs eyes when sees his " own " butterflies for the first time .
5 #### Got this for my sister for her birthday . We used to play it when we were little . Even though we are in our 20 's , it was a lot of fun to play . Must have if you played it as a kid or have kids ! !
5 #### Great game with my 4 and 2 year old . It takes a while to reset it after each game , but not too long . They are patient to wait , and love playing it again . Hours of fun .
5 #### This was as ordered for 4 year old . Not for camping outside but easy to set up and does n't take up too much room .
3 #### This is such a great idea for a game , but it 's so cheaply made it 's hard not to break pieces just putting it together , let alone to hold up to kids actually playing with it . I loved the idea of it , but being so flimsy , it just did n't last long in our house . I miss the days when games were made with better quality .
4 #### I remember playing this game with my best friend when we were little , so of course I had to buy it for my son ! ! This game is great for little ones because it teaches them how to pay attention , look for detail , and search for clues . It 's not even a hard game once you play it a time or two , and that 's always great so that you do n't always have to sit and read the directions every time you play the game . The only drawback to this game , is that you have to keep up with all of the pieces - we lost one of the people pieces , and so we had to sort through the other color to find that same person to take them out of the game . It would be nice to have a back up set of people pieces or something , but we know how to improvise , thank goodness :)
5 #### Plan on only using it once .. When they come out of the cocoon they are all bloody and gross .
5 #### fun , quick project . We raised them in the summer so that we could release them into the wild . This was an interesting away to watch nature develop . My child love science and we came up with the plan to make a simple journal the changes she saw each day with words and pictures .
5 #### Lots of fun for the kids - they love banging out the ice cubes . The noise can get on this mom 's nerves after the 6th or 7th round but then I just tell them they have to go to the basement playroom . ;-)
4 #### The child loves it . I 'm not a huge fan of the way a friend of his plays with it ( crazily and violently ) . It ruins the happiness of owning the game .
3 #### bought as a Christmas present for one of my kids . It 's fun the first couple of times but then when everyone figures out the game , it has n't been played since . Do n't expect to play it again after the first couple of times .
5 #### My daughter loves it . Perfect size . Easy assembly and breakdown . Also easy to clean .
5 #### LOVE this product . Hours of fun for little ones . Easy to assemble .
5 #### This was a xmas gift for my great grandson , but we just got it set up today . Easy as pie , and he loves it . Bigger than I somehow expected , which is good ; room for a friend .
5 #### Great learning toy . You do have to order the caterpillars and pay additional shipping . ( The bugs are free with the . certificate they give you , but shipping is not free . A great learning experience though . My 10 yr old granddaughter loved
5 #### awesome tent . has survived lots of rough play . very easy to put up
5 #### This was a gift for our almost 4 year - old ; he loves it . Indoors , it 's a perfect fort or play area , and we may use it outside once the season changes . It 's simple and quick to put up & take down on my own .
3 #### My son age 3 enjoys this game . It reminds me of when I was a kid and still seems to be the exact same game . My only isuues is the quality of the game and how it is made , it could be made better but honestly it 's good for the price !
3 #### My son 's are 3 and 1 and love this game . Only complaint I have is it is made more cheaply and is flimsy . I also do n't like that you have to put the two sides together rather than it being in one solid piece . I would buy it , but look for an older model .
5 #### I do n't know what to say here . My kids just love this game ! It 's so simple yet so much fun , building suspense . My little ones are knocking out the ice cubes and I 'm sitting there making them nervous with my sound effects ... lol . We have a blast with this game !
3 #### This is a classic game I remember from my childhood . My young son played this game at a friends house and fell in love . We picked it up for his birthday , and as expected he loved it . The complatint I have about this product now is that it seems to have been redesigned . The table now breaks down into two pieces to be stored in the box , as the box is too small to fit the table in one piece . Fitting the two pieces of the table together and taking the two pieces apart is not something that a 3 year old can do on his own . For this reason I gave it 3 stars .
5 #### Thank you ! Quick shipping and fun product for kids in therapy !
2 #### Its a good concept , but I do n't like games that take longer to set up then they do to play . You are done playing this in less than a minute and it takes about 3 minutes to set back up .
5 #### Easy to put together and the kids love it . Small enough size that I can put it up in the living room or the bedroom so they can play - two toddlers can fit inside for pretend camp - outs .
3 #### My one year old adored this tent , but she snapped the tent poles within a few months !
4 #### Our son loved this tent ! Great quality and simple style , easy to assemble . Highly recommend !
5 #### Worked so well , we had 9 successful butterfly hatching 's in this and we are saving it for next year
4 #### Fun homeschooling project ! We got our cup of caterpillars in the mail , 4 out of the 5 made it to chrysalides and we had 4 butterflies come out yesterday . We will let them go tomorrow . My kids loved watching the process and learning about metamorphosis . Great tool .
5 #### Highly recommend the Butterfly Garden - 3 time Customer with Great Results - But Do n't buy the Ladybug Land it 's cheap looking and the Larvae arrive DEAD !
5 #### Overall pretty happy with this kit . You have to order the caterpillars online , but it is easy and they arrive quickly . The kit comes with a voucher for them so you just pay $ 5 shipping cost . My kids loved doing this . They watched the butterflies everyday and were so excited to let them free . This provided great educational opportunities and we will probably order this again on a bi - yearly basis . I did n't keep our habitat , because it gets kind of yucky when the butterflies hatch , but if you clean it out you can just order the caterpillars from insect lore and reuse your habitat .
4 #### I played this game as a child and enjoyed it . I recommend this for a young age group ( about 4 to 12 ) with adult supervision as it teaches kids deduction skills . All other ( older ) ages will enjoy the game the first time it is played but will be bored by about the third time .
4 #### Like most toys made now as opposed to when I was a child it is not a durable . The game is still the same , and my kids have fun playing with it . They are 4 and 6 . My 4 year old understands it with a little help and my 6 year old was able to catch on right away . Because of their attendtion span they are only able to play about 2 or 3 times before they lose interest so the length of the game is good .
5 #### Love this tent . My toddler get so much out of it . Easy to set up and tear down . Great size .
5 #### This tent stores so many toys and we use it for our movie nights . So much fun . It 's good practice for our kids as well because we are a tent - camping family !
5 #### Kids love it . My 1 1/2 year old will spend all day in and out of this thing . Great little play piece for the kids .
5 #### Bought for a two year old who loves to crawl through the tunnel . Have not assembled the tent portion yet .
4 #### This is a great game . The idea is simple and fun . Encourage some analytical thinking for the kids . Very affordable . Somewhat frustrating is the initial assembly required . It will take at least 15 to 20 minutes to finish setting up the game . You will need to manually remove each card and insert to each individual holders . You may also need to use additional transparent tape so they wo n't slide down . Construction of the plastic is not very sturdy .
3 #### The ice cubes are various sizes which means some are easily knocked out or fall out . Fun for about 15min .
3 #### Got this for my 3 year old . She has trouble hitting just 1 square with the mallet , & is more likely to knock out several pieces at once . Also , the pieces fit so tightly ( by necessity ) that neither she or her 4 year old sister can set up the game on their own & they ca n't put the polar bear in without pushing out pieces . It 's easy enough for an older child or an adult , but I was hopeful I could set them up to play together & then be able to fold laundry or something , but after 2 minutes , they need it set back up . It 's fun to play it with them , though !
5 #### My 4 year old enjoys this game . She laughs hysterically EVERY SINGLE time he falls through . It 's a little loud when all the ice breaks , and there are lots of pieces to keep track of , but the belly laughs make up for it .
5 #### My 2 year old LOVES this game . He can play it over and over again . My only complaint is that I get sick of setting it up . :) But he loves it so I set it up over and over again .
5 #### This tent is very similar to the adult tent we had for camping -minus the stakes to hold it into the ground and the size . I did have a bit of difficulty getting the last pole to go into place , but with some umph it fit . The seams are sewed together very well , and the fabric is great quality making it difficult to rip . As with ANY toy , it 's possible to break . That 's where teaching children to respect what you buy them comes in handy . Ya ca n't blame cheap fabric if your child takes out a pair of scissors and cuts it up . You ca n't blame defects in the poles if your child uses them as fighting swords . With that being said , this is a great toy , made with great quality , and it 's a good buy as long as you do n't have a destructive little monster to contend with . I bought this for my 4 year old son , and it 's held up pretty well . It 's also great to take outside on sunny days , because it has air flow . I can sit inside the tent with my 6 month old grandbaby while the breeze comes in , but the sun does n't . It 's a great buy , but once again be aware it 's possible to break if you have an extra " playful " little person .
5 #### We love the Insect Lore Live Butterfly Garden and get one every year ! It is so cool to watch the butterfly from caterpillar to butterfly ! Amazing gift !
5 #### Released them in honor of Grandpa that had passed away . It was awesome ! Grandkids loved it .
5 #### My daughter was able to watch the metamorphosis of a caterpillar to a butterfly . It was incredible . Even as an adult I was fascinated . There 's one thing to know that it happens , but it 's an entirely different experience to witness it .
5 #### Granddaughter loved this , great learning experience . Then we let the butterfly go outside
5 #### This is the second Pacific Play Tent we 've purchased . The first was bought about 5 - 6 years ago and has been enjoyed by 3 very active children - and it 's still going strong . It sets up and comes down quickly and easily . This one was for a birthday gift and was an instant hit . Not only does my grandson enjoy playing in it and crawling through the tunnel ( over and over and over ) , he now happily takes his afternoon nap in it .
5 #### Well made product . Our one year old loves it . He 's 25lbs and 32 " tall and he , myself ( a bit heavy ) and my hubby and 35 lb dog can all fit in it .
5 #### Really cute product . We have it set up inside . Ca n't wait to set it up outside to have my toddler play in it
3 #### The game , we love . The box is came in ? NOT AT ALL . Seriously , they ship it in a box TOO SMALL TO HOLD IT ONCE IT 'S ASSEMBLED ! That and taking the side pieces apart every time is SURE to end up with them getting broken . So for the sake of able to ship a smaller box they force you , the consumer , to either live with breaking it down every time or having to scrounge up something else to store it . Do n't get me started on the Jenga box likewise too small ...
5 #### Love it ! Same as I remember from when I was a kid !
2 #### Just an ok game , it takes longer to set up than to play .
5 #### My kids never got tired of this game . They played it frequently for years . It 's retired because they out - grew it , but now I 'm introducing it to my grandson , . I ca n't wait to get to play it with him .
4 #### This game is a lot of fun and both my 6 year old and 4 year old love it . The kids love to play it and it is good for them to learn to ask the right questions and really notice different features of people . This game is very poor quality though . I would have rather paid more money and got a better quality made product . It is certainly playable , but the flaps of the people are always coming off or getting stuck . It does not ruin the game and is really just annoying more than anything else . I would not let it stop me from purchasing this game , it just would be nice to have it made a little better quality .
3 #### The game is fine as outlined by most reviews on here , but the manufacturing leaves a lot to be desired ( like so many things nowadays ) . I remember playing the 80s version and it was built to last and fun to use . This is flimsy and cheaply made .
4 #### A little more difficult to get that last pole in that the directions indicated but still a good purchase for my granddaughter to play with !
4 #### Very cute , but not as easy to put up as I had hoped . I really takes two people to do it .
5 #### This is great ! It is soooo sturdy ! Made of really good material . It is the best one I have seen . I know it is going to last forever ... een with all of my grandkids using it frequently . Great for indoors or outside . The tent is do sturdy it could even be used as a kids tent for camping .
5 #### My 1 - year - old grandson really enjoys this tent . I ca n't say as to it 's longevity since we 've only had it for a couple of weeks but it 's a fun fort for him . It seems well made and I love the fact that it very easy to take down and put away when he 's not around . It takes about 5 minutes to put it together or take it down and takes up very little space to store . I 've read a couple of reviews that said it lasts about 8 months before ripping or other fabric issues like torn seams and I 'm okay with it lasting that long for the price . Toys like this do n't last forever . He plays in it more than with any other toy . All in all , it 's been a great play space .
5 #### Thank you ! Went above my expectations . Great quality and it has the typical bottom that even adult tents have .
5 #### Great game , the only issue I have is that once you out the frame together it is too difficult to take apart and put back in the box
4 #### This is a fun game but I would n't recommend it for someone under five years old . I bought it for my friend 's three and five year children . As soon as I had put it together , these two little devils smashed through the ice ( and my fingers ) without realizing they had to take their time ! It takes some patience and someone as young as three years old does n't understand that word . Oh yes they had fun smashing and throwing the ice cubes around the room . Now can somebody tell me where I can get replacement ice cubes since I suspect some of them will be lost ?
3 #### Love the game , but it looked like it came to us used . The box was all damaged and there was tape everywhere . Gave as a gift and was kinda embarrassed .
1 #### This is a great game . I remember playing it as a kid with another child who spoke French . Lots of fun , easy to play , not determined by chance , teaches children how to group into categories and narrow down choices - wonderful . Unfortunately , the new edition is very shoddily designed . The cards are flimsy , and they fall right out of their holders when they 're flipped ( or sometimes when they 're * not * flipped ) . Ultimately , the game is almost totally unplayable ! This is very disappointing to all of us . I 'm going to go see if I can find a vintage copy of this game , and I 'll be contacting the manufacturer about this as well ... though if I have an experience similar to that of a previous poster , I 'll probably get brushed off .
4 #### This game is fairly easy to set up but it seems to lose the wow within a day or two . The characters once in awhile slip out of their slots when we are trying to set up the game to play , when we try to put the characters from resting position to sitting up . It has taught my son however to reverse his thinking about what to look for in each character . It does cause children to think more . Its a simple enough game to be able to play it with a wide range of ages . It seems to travel well aswell since there is not allot of small detached pieces .
5 #### My daughters loved this and we will be using it again !
1 #### not sturdy , the poles broke through ... ended up seeing the same on group on for half the price ... did n't buy it since knew what poor quality this was , we returned it
5 #### Grand daughter loves it and the ability to adjust the size of project to make is wonderful addition to this easy to use lap loom .
5 #### Item arrived on time and what I was expecting to receive .
5 #### Great game for younger children . Great Christmas gift and it has provided hours of fun for younger children . Even the younger ones can participate which makes it really nice to play as a family .
5 #### My 4 year old love this game . It 's fun and easy , requires no reading so great for the younger ages .
4 #### Even though Do n't Break the Ice is n't as popular as some other children 's games out there ( think Candyland ) I think it is a classic and should be just as popular ! It is a simple , but suspenseful , game - kinda like Jenga , but horizontal . Setting the game up is n't too fun though , as you need to turn the thing upside down and tightly pack all the ice cubes in there ... then turn it back over and push the ice skater into the ice without breaking the ice . Children any age can enjoy playing Do n't Beak the Ice , although they might need an older child or adult to set it up ( which is why I knocked off one star ) .
5 #### Was gift for my granddaughter . She plays in it everyday . Love the mesh at the top for ventilation . Enough room for her and mom in the tent with room to spare for some toys . Highly recommend
5 #### This is the greatest thing to keep kids occupied while other kids play sports .
5 #### Present for my 7 year old son . Really fun and simple game . I believe it teaches kids to pay attention to detail . I found my 15 year old daughter and her 17 year old boyfriend playing it and they enjoyed it . There 's only one set up and that 's putting the faces in the frames when you first get the game . Now when my son wants to play , we get it out of the box and start playing . Each game goes really fast , too .
4 #### This brilliantly simple game is great for teaching children the process of logical elimination , which is a cornerstone of sound thinking . Furthermore , it passes the most basic test of any childrens ' game , and that 's that they 've played it once and they want to play it again . That does n't happen every time , and can be a sting to the pocketbook when it does n't ! That said , be sure the game is set up before the kids see it . It takes about an hour to : read the instructions , detach the plastic card holders from the injection molded plastic trees ( be careful not to break anything ! ) , slip the face cards into the card holders ( do n't bend those cards ! ) and then read the rules of the game . If you open the game new in front of the kids , they 'll get all excited and then bug you incessantly until you get the game put together . Not fun . However , once it 's put together it can be a lot of fun . One little non - essential things we 've found does n't work is the little plastic game score keeper for playing a series of games . That is flimsy and keeps falling apart . Still , a fun way to gain a certain kind of thinking skill , and for a good price too !
4 #### This is a wonderful game that I recently introduced to my 5yo , and have fond memories of playing when I was younger . My only complaint is the poor quality of the boards . We have trouble with the plastic picture holders not opening or closing completely , and coming off when we * very gently * flip open pieces at the start of a new game . It 's quite frustrating having to deal with the poor quality of this great game , especially when this problem * never * occurred with the older version(s ) . A wonderful teaching tool and fun game , but be prepared to deal with the poor quality .
5 #### I was so glad when my little sister got this game for her birthday ! Unfortunaty our version was n't like the version I had when I was young . For some reason the people stand did n't open or close very well . So while for some you could smack down , others you had to jiggle and wiggle to get to lay flat . Not only that but when we would start a new game , you 're soppose to be able to just flip the board over and all the stands would flip out . Well for the red board they did n't flip so well , in fact only a few would flip up with out help . That could have been my fault when I put the pieces together . The game was still fun , althought it was hard teaching my six year old sister not to exclaim out loud that she 's glad of who she got because she likes her hat . Although I did n't have a problem with her picking her person instead of doing it randomly,(like you 're soppose too ) I still love this game and forever will .
5 #### My oldest daughter received this when she was about 5 . That 's a great age to get this . We love this game . It 's a fun game , even for the adults who have to play along . We can play this for hours on end if the kids feel like it and not tear our hair out . Great game to help build a child 's thinking skills . A wonderful gift for to have handy for ages 5 - 8 , or so . They 'll play it for years .
5 #### I used to love this game and always lose . I had fun recently teaching my 4 year old how to play . She loved it and it is a game of elimination . It also helps with noticing different characteristics and colors . Downside : Had to put the darn board together ..... that took like 30 minutes out of my day .
5 #### this , was the best thing i ever bought , kids , love this
5 #### Took a while to receive because of extreme heat in California but when it finally arrived grandsons loved it . All butterflies came out .
5 #### This is such a fantastic experience for a child ! The box arrived . Inside the box was a certificate that we had to use to order our caterpillars . It was such an amazing experience to see the caterpillars transform into a cocoon and then butterfly . We had five butterflies total . All lived ... and we let them all free . Each one , my son put his hand in the garden cage and a butterfly flew on his finger . he then took his hand out . Three of the butterflies just sat there almost in a trance hanging out with my son . It was so cool !
5 #### Out of all the Christmas presents , I think we 've had more fun with this tent ! My son and 3 Golden Retrievers play in it ! We love the durability ! Great product - highly recommend .
5 #### This tent was the biggest hit at Christmas with my 2 and 4 year old boys . The tunnel is totally separate so you can put it with this or separate . The construction is durable , the bottom of the tent is a waterproof tarp . small enough for the living room ( temporarily lol ) Great purchase ! !
5 #### This is a great gift for all ages especially for my preschooler and her toddler brother . Great size for indoor play- and ca n't wait to try it outside too . The tent is sturdy and I like that the construction of it requires the child to crawl through the tunnel before reaching the tent . The tunnel does separate easily from the tent though . There is also a door on the side so adults can fit . The best part is the carrying bag so we can put it away neatly when it is not is use . My kids love this item and I think we will be using for many years to come . I would strongly recommend this product to a friend .
5 #### I bought this for the older kids / babies to play with at my sons first birthday . All of the kids enjoyed playing with it , and it held up just fine even with the windy day at the park . Made for some great photos too !
5 #### Arrived fast and have become a great addition to our family game night collection . All of the kids , extended family , and friends have enjoyed playing this game .
5 #### Cute game that we can play with my 2 year old . We all enjoy it .
5 #### My grand kids love it . I bought another previously from Amazon a few years ago for a different grandson and it is still in good condition even after all his rough housing . Great product .
5 #### Toddler loves this ... loves to pretend camp . She naps in it . Her parent set it up in the living room after Christmas and it was perfect . They were n't sure how it would do outside ... they did n't have a safe way to test it .
5 #### Over one thousand reviews have been posted so I 'll make this quick . My son loved this ! To see the amazing handiwork of God right in your room ( not that it could n't be seen already)is astounding . The net cage is nice and a good size . The entire caterpillar to butterfly event went off without a hitch . As I said in the title - read the directions . If not you will have problems . The company sent me timely emails to remind me of the transformation my insects were going through . Right now we have 5 butterflies that will soon be free to fly outside . The entire experience was wonderful . Highly recommended
5 #### Our 5 year old is an insect lover , so we bought this butterfly house for her birthday . It was a hit ! We watched the caterpillars grow , transform , fed the butterflies .. Let them go ! It was amazing ! We will get a refill next summer . The house is collapsible and kids take it everywhere they go , along with a butterfly net , to catch the insects . It is one of the most played toys in our house . It started tearing on top , from excessive use , but actually it is pretty well made and sturdy .
5 #### Gave it to our 4 year old and the 1 year old baby loved it too . It was easy to set up and the tunnel was easy to attach or not . Using it indoors for now .
5 #### It does n't get any more fun for my 2 year old , I 'm 32 and I think I enjoy it as much or more than he does , I can not say how much this product was worth the purchase
4 #### My 4 yo loves this game ( although he thinks he wins when he breaks the ice lol ) - hard for him to reassemble and difficult to store pieces
5 #### This is such a great game for young kids . My 2 and 3 year olds love it . They play it over and over again , and it easy enough for them to set it up by themselves . I highly recommend this .
5 #### My son loves this game ! Lots of fun for the 4 year old age group and older .
4 #### I remembered this game very positively from my childhood , so I looked forward to playing it with my daughter . All in all it 's very similar to the one I played as a child , and the game play was still very enjoyable . However , I had to lower the rating to only 4 stars due to the lowered quality of the game itself . It now comes in a two - piece frame rather than as a single piece , and just felt lower quality altogether . Hopefully it will hold up to repeat playings the same as the one I had as a child did ! So far it has done well , though , and I do recommend it if you 're interested ; it 's a fun children 's game .
2 #### When I saw other people playing with it , I thought it was going to be tons of fun . but then when I bought it it stunk . I played it for one or two days with my brother but afterwords it 's gathering dust in my closet along with Connect Four , Battleship and stuff like that . Do n't get hypnotized by this toy ! ! ! DON'T BUY IT ! ! !
4 #### I thought my daughter would love this- but it has n't gotten much use ... If your going to get a lap loom though this is the one .
5 #### A nice little loom , easy to use . I showed my daughter ( age 11 ) how to do the weaving and how to read the pattern -- she was soon able to work on her own !
3 #### My son absolutely loved this . He seemed put together well but did n't last too long . My son would drag it from room to room and after a few DAYS one of the poles bent and it was done . I gave 3 stars but almost gave it 2 because it broke so fast . I realize that it was not meant to be used as my son was using it but really ? Three days ? ! !
5 #### This was a very sturdy tent and easily put up . It was actually of a higher quality than I anticipated . My grandson loves it ! The carrying case
5 #### A couple teenagers were playing this when I was little and that 's how I found out about this game . I 've bought it since then and played it a lot with all ages . Usually when I 'm playing with teens , I 'll play the more complex version that includes having 2 face cards instead of just one . Most of the time , the 2 people have totally different features and you have to try to narrow it down without flipping down the wrong people ! So try the variations as well .... you might discover something !
5 #### I have owned Guess Who since I was a little girl and still have my original game . I still enjoy playing it . As it is more of a game of guessing and remembering than a child 's game . It challenges your memory . I just have a blast playing the game . I looked at the new one recently as mine is now getting a little battered and it seems the same although some of the characters look different . But , it is expected to change some over the years . If you are looking for a game you can play with a family member this is a great game ! And it is enjoyable too !
5 #### My daughter loved this ! We ordered the caterpillars using the coupon in the box . We received them and in no time we grew our own butterflies . Great product !
3 #### This is very cute , and arrived promptly ; however , it should be much more clear in the title or top of the item description that you have to pay an additional $ 5 to get the caterpillars sent to you . I did order them , but I found it very annoying .
5 #### I love this . My kids love it . Great gift idea !
2 #### there are NO LOVE BUGS in this kit . Very disappointed in the advertising
5 #### Very simple game for younger kids . The blocks are held together tightly by a restrictive plastic boarder . The object of the game is to knock out a cube of ice at a time without making the figure fall . Easy to set up , easy and quick to play , and fun for the little ones .
4 #### Great old school game for your little one .... My 4 year old loves it .
4 #### I bought this for my 10 year old for Christmas . She had a little bit of a difficult time understanding the instructions . however , she does love it . she just needed help learning how to do it
5 #### This is a good , sturdy loom . It fits on your lap , but when I am weaving , I like keeping the box underneath the loom , or else the frame will easily slide .
4 #### I bought this for my twins when they first stared crawling ( 8 mos ) because I noticed the were trying to get into small enclosed spaces and hang out . ( under the table , in the closet , in an empty box , etc . ) . I thought they would like a tunnel but tried this item b / c it had the tent too . They immediately loved both items , and still do now that they are 12 months . I expect that as long as it continues to hold up against them , they will get a lot more use of it over the next year . -the tunnel is not attached . It can be placed into one of the round windows of the tent or used separately . -easy to set up and take down as needed . -meant to be used indoors only . -tent has 2 small round entrances an 1 large flap entrance . - large enough to fit 2 kids up to 4 or 5 years old .
5 #### I purchased this for my son when he was 5 . He still uses it ( 8 years old ) . Nothing has ever broke on it- very durable . He has dragged it around the house and even outside . This is probably the most durable toy he has had . He loves the tunnel the most and many times just uses the tunnel . We play games in the tent often . He loves to watch tv from the tent or read books in the tent etc . When it goes up- it stays up for a few days . Excellent design !
3 #### They played for 15 minutes or so and have n't looked at it again since . I just think they 're too young ( 2 years ) . Easy to assemble .
4 #### Nothing wrong with the game , but did n't really hold the attention of our four year old . And he broke the " hammers " the second day .
5 #### My 4 year old loves this game ! ! ! ! It is so fun , and does n't require too much coordination in order to be fun for little ones .
5 #### Are you kidding me . I do n't even know how I ever survived without this . I 'm more excited than my daughter to watch the process I think ! I did think that ordering the caterpillars online and paying more for shipping was kind of a let down . Not that it 's not worth it , but it meant I had to coordinate another shipment and get the credit card out again etc . Just something to keep in mind .
5 #### Bought this for our 3 yr . old grandson 's birthday -- he loves it . It is pretty sturdy and frankly I was surprised that the quality was as good as it was for the price I paid . Fun gift for little ones .
5 #### This item was reasonably priced and now my grandson and I go camping in the game room .
5 #### Mechanical switches are a great enhancement for a set of Brio ( or other compatible ) tracks when using self - propelled , battery powered engines . Wood is high quality with clean millwork .
5 #### the red piece moves easily and these fit well with other brand assorted tracks . We have a variety of brands and Brio is my favorite for our extensive wooden train set . Never had a problem with it not fitting with other pieces .
5 #### If you have the small curvy pieces and the extension pack and if you have the pieces with the two innies and two outies , this would be the next set of train pieces I 'd suggest . They are fun and add a whole new dimension to your track building . They are also neat because you can switch the track and control where the train goes . Sometimes the plastic gets a bit sticky and we found a little bit of pam spray or olive oil will keep it operating smoothly . As all of the Brio pieces are well made , this one is too . Well worth the money . Enjoy .
5 #### My kids , ages six and ten , love to play this game together . Finding something they both enjoy happens about as frequently as a total eclipse of the sun , so that ought to tell you something right there . The plastic frames are a little flimsy for my taste , but you can play this game even if you are missing a card or two , so I anticipate getting lots of use out of this one .
4 #### My son ( he 's 2 ) received this tent as a birthday present .... and he loves it ! I love the bright colors too . The tunnel simply inserts into one of the two holes in the tent , and stays put pretty well . The doors have velcro on the bottom to keep them shut , but nothing really to tie them back with to stay open . My neighbors , nephew and husband love the tent too , and makes for hours of fun . Our house is now the " cool place " to go do ! I have to agree that I would n't bring this tent outside either ... the floor seems like it could be ripped pretty easily by something sharp . But it works great on the carpet , and have n't had any problems with it yet except keeping everyone out of it !
5 #### Got this for my daughter 's 2nd birthday- she immediately crawled right in . She loves to go through the tunnel and has little dinners for her dolls inside .
4 #### My 9 year old son asked for a loom for Christmas . We had visited a factory and he saw the big , mechanical looms , and also a few hand looms ( but big , with floor petals , and 5 feet tall ) . Obviously we were not going to pay $ 1000 for a loom for our 9 year old son , so we were looking for something . This one is nice . It is strong , and has kept him entertained for hours . Does take some work , not stepping on petals and sliding through the thread , comes with two sticks , one you leave in , and one you put back in every other time . Comes with the materials needed to start , and shows you in the instructions how to add different things . Makes one piece of cloth , maybe 12 - 18 . Not huge , but keeps his hands busy . i believe I saw in the instructions on how to make a longer piece , but we have not gotten to that yet . Too complex for a 5 year old ( our other son ) , but for a patient 9 year old , it works great . I also think for an adult , it would be fun , maybe the more complex designs .
5 #### my husb has great childhood memories playing this game . ca nt wait to introduce to my kids
5 #### A fun gift to give a child a bit of a challenge !
5 #### My 4 year old sons fav game ! It makes for hours of entertainment ( and hours of me building it ! )
1 #### This is pretty much my least favorite game that my children have ever owned . First of all , it is a serious pain to set up , because you really have to work at getting the " ice " to fit in there . Little kids can not do it . Then , they bang on the friggin thing making the worst , most annoying sound other than nails on a chalkboard and incessant whining ) . This sound literally goes through my bones and I have a high tolerance for kid toy sounds . Not surprisingly , this game has mysteriously disappeared . FOREVER .
5 #### Got this for the kids for Christmas , packed perfectly . No complaints yet , will see how it goes on X - Mas day
5 #### Bought for my 4 year old 's birthday . He LOVES this game . We play over and over and over . Would buy again if something ever happened to it .
3 #### My family has used this at the beach a couple of times , but it does n't seem to be worth the hassle . If it is a windy day , the stakes do not stay in and the whole tent can blow away . There are better made options out there . That being said , this could be a fun tent for indoor play .
4 #### Not bad at all for the price . Just remember it 's a play tent not a camping one . Pretty sturdy vinyl type material with amazingly quick set up . Just insert the poles and it 's ready . My son loves it .
5 #### Came as expected . You have to pay $ 5.00 to actually get the butterflies ( Should be noted when you 're purchasing the kit ) . If you are stuck at any point , the company has many videos on YouTube to help ! My son loved them !
5 #### I used this with my kids for years . I bought the ordered the first batch by mail order . All of our crysalis opened and black morph swallowtail butterflies survived and we released them into my butterfly garden . Late that summer / early fall , we found small caterpillars on my dill and parsley plants . When they made crysalis , I collected a few and put them into the thoroughly sanitized empty habitat . I kept the habitat in my shed so that the caterpillars would remain dormant until spring , as they do in the wild in my area . I brought the habitat into the house in spring and repeated this cycle over and over without needing to purchase additional butterflies . My kids also use the empty habitat to hold fireflies in the evenings , to observe bugs , and hatch cocoons we find . Durable and an excellent value .
5 #### My son LOVED watching his butterfly habitat grow and change as we awaited the butterflies . We ordered the caterpillars separately and enjoyed watching them grow and change in the butterfly garden . For several days we kept them in the garden with a vase of flowers after they had become butterflies . We plan to make this an annual springtime tradition , and I will order a second garden for my favorite kindergarten teacher . Highly recommend this product , just be aware that you order the caterpillars separately from this garden .
5 #### This is basically a game of elimination . You ask a yes or no question like Does your person have blond hair ? Your opponent answers and so on until one of your identities is discovered . Iknow from that it sounds a little boring . Trust me it 's not . I 've played this game for hours at a time before . Best of all it helps children to think logically and form relevant questions . A great gift .
5 #### Santa brought this tent and tunnel for my son in 2003 , and it was an immediate hit . He is now 3 years old , and still enjoys playing with it . Last week , he took it to a fun day at school , where three classes of active kids gave it a try out . It stood up admirably , and went back into its storage bag proud and intact . It took a huge amount of abuse and shrugged it off . I was deeply impressed , because I never expected it to last this long . Several teachers and parents asked me where I got it from , so I guess they were also impressed . It stores easily in the handy bag , and the tunnel when strapped up takes up little space . It 's light , portable , affordable and fun . One of the best toys I have ever purchased on Santa 's behalf .
5 #### This game is very special as it recalls my own children playing this game . I love memories ! !
5 #### This is a Christmas gift . I think my little one will love it ! ! !
5 #### Love the game as a kid and love playing it now with my kid .
5 #### I loved this game as a kid so I got the new version for my 4 year old son . He has so much fun breaking the ice . It takes longer to set the game up than to play it but it is really fun for the whole family .
1 #### this is very popular with teachers , however unless you live in california , where these larva are shipped from , as soon as you release the butterflies they will die . these butterflies are not from the northern or eastern parts of america and they will not survive . yes the children get to see the life cycle of a butterfly but you raise these butterflies to just to kill them .
5 #### ANOTHER CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR THE GRANDKIDS .... THIS WILL BE LOTS OF FUN FOR THEM TO GO IN AND OUT .....
3 #### This would have been a 5 star rating if the tent design was that with the boy pictured . It 's not . There is no zipper closure at the door and there is no velcro to hold the tunnel to the tent . The reason I ordered this particular tent and tunnel was so that they would be compatible and would stay in place . That is not the case as there is no velcro to hold the tunnel in place . It 's not a problem now as my son is only 1 but as he grows and goes through the tunnel with more force I would anticipate it being a problem . So Mom is disappointed but son is loving it .
5 #### Great toy for small children . My 4 year old can plays it very well , but my 22 month old just loves to make the bear fall . It is a fun game for them anyway . The game does require help from an adult beacuse setting the game up , putting the ice blocks into place , is a bit difficult since the blocks have to be packed in tightly .
5 #### This is my second Break the Ice game . The first one lasted almost 5 years before a tab broke making it impossible to keep the ice cubes in place . When the kids were ages 3 & 4 and I had to help them get the ice cubes in . That was annoying because they wanted to play with it so often ! By age 5 no help was needed . We adjust the rules a bit regarding number of taps when the kids were little . Now each player gets to tap on one ice cube till it falls out . That is also an adaptation of the rules but fits the enthusiasm of the players . Note - I still need to help them pull the frame apart when it is time to put the game away .
3 #### This game literally takes less than 3 minutes to play a round . It takes longer to set up cubes into the mold . My 6 year old loves it though . It comes with the blue mold in 2 pieces that you have to put together to play the game and we ca nt get ours apart so when we store it , we ca nt put it back into the box .
5 #### given as a gift , did n't actually open or use
5 #### Perfect . Just what I wanted . Kids love to play this game
5 #### My two year old loves this game . I did n't think he would be able to play but I found out he had been playing at school so we took the chance and got it for him at home . He asks to play this , discovery garden- best game ever for this age group , and smurfs to the rescue every day . My one year old also likes smashing the ice cubes down .
2 #### The poles broke the very first time we set this tent up . A definite disappointment . Note : if you do purchase this tent , it 's larger than most kiddy play tents . Make sure you have room .
5 #### My children love to play in this tent . I does take up a lot of space in my little living room . I feel the quality of the tent is good . Very happy with this purchase .
5 #### Bought this product twice . It worked perfectly and it was not very costly either . All the caterpillars turned to butterflies each time . The kids had a lot of fun , watching the caterpillars growing up at a fast rate , then forming the cocoons , and then transforming into butterflies . We released the butterflies outside . Note that first , you would receive only the net and a form . You have to send back the form or fill something on a website to have a container with the caterpillars mailed to you .
4 #### AWESOME concept and the price is great for what you are getting . Be advised , as everyone will say , that you do NOT get caterpillars with this set , you JUST get a coupon to go to another site and order them . It is a HUGE disappointment to kids , to get the netting and stuff to use but not have the caterpillars . I suggest hiding it until the caterpillars come . The instructions are easy to follow and we had such a great time watching them grow . You have to be invested in the process though because you do need to switch them carefully to the net and then feed them . I would love to do it again !
5 #### Bought this for my 2 year old . WE HAD A BLAST ! ! ! ! He absolutely loved every step of the process . He woke up every day excited to see the change in his " babies . " This is a MUST for every child .
5 #### Have been having lots of fun with this one , 5 year old and 3 year old love it !
2 #### This only OK . It 's a pain to assemble and the game is over pretty quick . OK as a entry into family games .
5 #### We got this for my three year - old to sleep in while staying a hotel . She had outgrown the whole crib set - up but is such a restless sleeper , she can not sleep on a bed or even the floor without ending up 15 feet away from where she started . We got this so she 'd have a semi - contained area to sleep in . The set - up is pretty quick and easy . We set it up once at home to test it out before our trip and that 's when we found that the string that holds one of the poles together came out of the end piece . I contacted Pacific Play Tents as soon as it happened as we were only a few days away from our trip and explained what happened . They sent me out a replacement piece , no questions asked , very promptly and we had the new piece in time for our trip . Awesome customer service ! The size of the tent was perfect for our daughter and it makes for a nice indoor / outdoor play tent or shade for outdoors . The ventilation is good and the Velcro flaps / door are a nice size . It folds up very easily and quickly and fits nicely into the provided pouch .
5 #### My kids have gone crazy in this tent . I pull it out when they 're bored and we use it in the house solely . They fill it with toys and dolls and pillows and have a great time . It 's big enough to hold two energetic toddlers and built strongly enough that I 've had this for quite a long time now . Small enough to set up in a kid 's room , or in my case , in the middle of the living room just for some extra fun . This has been a great purchase . Love the crawl through opening on the other side , too .
5 #### We got this to use inside as a fort for our granddaughter . She is 16 months old and she loves it already . Getting her ready to go camping with us . Seems to be well made and goes up and down easily .
4 #### This has been a great toy for my 3 and now 4 year old . It is a good opportunity to socialize and practice turn - taking . I have no trouble assembling it . Children may benefit from cues not to repeatedly hammer at the game .
5 #### My daughter purchased this game for the boys she babysits . She wanted to get them a more traditional game to play . They loved it !
5 #### Fulfills needs perfectly ! Nothing is better than this product at the moment . Highly recommended to anyone its low price as well !
5 #### Adults , kids , whoever . Everyone loves Do n't Break the Ice . The younger ones just want to destroy it but the older kids and adults act like it 's so serious . What is that dude in the middle ?
4 #### My three year old nephew refused to break the ice because he does n't want the polar bear to fall . So now the kids break the ice while the polar bear is sitting on the table watching .... it 's fun for the kids because they simple like to smash things .
5 #### I bought this game for my son and he absolutely loves it ! He loves that he gets to hit the ice cubes without getting in trouble for hitting and destroying stuff . He always laughs so much during the game !
5 #### This things is amazing ! my kids love it and we even ended up buying more cups to grow more butterflies , so neat to watch them turn to butterflies and release them . My cats loved it too :)
5 #### This was so much fun for my 3 and 6 year olds ! Every day was a new " observation . " Sad to release them but a good life lesson .
5 #### This was an amazing experience to share with your child about evolution of life .
5 #### this is just like a camping tent , sets up just like it too . the only real draw back is that it is big and takes up a lot of space and is n't really made to breakdown twice a day , it can it just is a bit of a hassle .
5 #### 2 different preschoolers have loved this tent and its attachable tunnel . Good play space for when a person just wants to do his own thing , yet keep track of other family members .
5 #### Great value . So very tough . My son likes to roll it around the room like a hamster on a ball and it looks new . Great weight of nylon too .
5 #### Its just a net and coupon to have caterpillars mailed to you . This is the cheapest I ve seen this product . My Daughter and I love doing this together ( she s 5 )
5 #### I bought this for my granddaughter for her 3rd birthday . She really enjoys playing it . Good game to have and share those special moments ..
5 #### So good to find these wonderful games from the past , and see how much my 3 year old grandson enjoys it ! We need more of these great games , easy to play and fun for hours . Really would like to see these instead of so much TV , and hand held games , etc .
4 #### Reading the reviews I am left with the impression there are alot of lazy parents out there . Personally I play WITH my daughter on the floor and I remake the ice every time . If you do n't like that then buy them some sort of technological board game . My daughter loves to pull this out of the game closet and play , sometimes she plays properly and other times she changes it up a bit but we all have fun playing it . She loves to help me set it back up although she ca n't put the final pieces in because they need to be forced in quite a bit
4 #### Just like the old version when I was a kid . It is a fun game with a quick winner . JUST REMEMBER YOU AS THE PARENT HAVE TO PUT IT TOGETHER EACH TIME ! :) Takes longer to put together each time than to play the game . Fun all the same though !
5 #### Very easy game to play . Our 5 y / o has a ball playing it . No complaints . Her older brothers will even play with her .
3 #### I was a little disappointed with this game . We had missing pieces , but we make shifted some sticks to hit the cubes out with . It 's a time consuming set up . Not a favorite .
5 #### I bought two of these so my grandkids would have a cool place to play and sleep when they visit here . I set them up in the living room and the boys were ecstatic . They play almost all day in them , and when I told them they could SLEEP in them , they were overjoyed . Relatively little money for so much fun !
5 #### Good old fashion fun . A classic does n't need changing . All family members can have fun playing this game . Everything was delivered as promised .
5 #### My kids think the objective is to break the ice - all of it as fast as possible- so that 's just what they do before yelling " I win ! ! " Then they ask me to set it up all over again . So much fun for them- not the most fun to me . But I do love seeing their smiling faces ! !
5 #### Kids have loved this for years . I purchased for my grandson and remember playing the game with my daughter ( now the mom ) when she was young . Always go with the tried and true --- you ca n't go wrong . Great experience and delivery .
5 #### Trying to get the kids to play more board games than electronics , and this was one of the ones we got recently for the littles . They have really enjoyed it , great classic game .
5 #### Very cool . We bought this as an easter gift for our kids . All 5 of our butterflies survived and it was so cool to see them grow ! Great for fun and homeschool .
5 #### Was able to release 5 butterflies . My son had a ball watching the transformation :)
5 #### This was an incredible experience ! My siblings watched the process and loved setting them go . All 5 turned into butterflies , but the 5th one fell from the lid and finished growing on the bottom , causing it 's wings to form permenantly bent . Other than that they were beautiful and something I would buy again ! ! !
5 #### I purchased this for my 6 year old granddaughter and it provided a great learning experience . Every day we 'd check the progress then would research more about the different stages of the butterfly 's evolution . GREAT learning tool !
1 #### I do not recommend this tent . It smells like the costumes from halloween in the 80 's , it 's HUGE and not well made .
5 #### Break the ice is a real fun game to play , you put everything together and try to break the ice without knocking someone down . It is good fun to play on all day .
1 #### I got this game cause I remembered playing it when I was younger and just loved it . So I got it for my kids . I put all the ice in and then realized it did n't come with the big block of ice for the bear to sit on . Still waiting for Hasbro to send us a big block .. otherwise what s the point in playing the game .
5 #### This was a gift for my 10 year old baby sister . It was a huge hit and the butterflies were beautiful . A great way to learn about nature . Using the coupon to order the caterpillars on their website was easy and the container arrived right on time .
5 #### My daughter loved this insect kit . We learned about the stages of the butterfies . She was sad to let them go . We ordered the tadpoles too . Great summer learning !
5 #### My 2 year old grandson loves it , set up easily . He loves climbiing and out and bringing in his toys . I 'm sure he will play with it often .
3 #### Super fun classic game . But the level of quality in today 's manufacturing of this game is not so great . For example , my game had these problems : - The two parts of the base do n't fit together very well - 3 of the springs that hold the ice blocks in place were bent such that they barely hold the ice in place - The polar bear does not fit well into her ice block - she is difficult to get to stand up and falls over easily I 'm guessing they 've cut corners over the years to keep / bring the price down . And in 2013 the quality is suffering noticeably . It 's still fun , but the plastic is so cheap that it barely works as intended .
2 #### Not really a lot to do for kids , would not buy it again . Would not recommend it . I was very disappointed
5 #### The game has n't changed since the 80 's . My kids ( 6 & 3 ) love it a fits a game my husband and I enjoy playing with them . Simple , not a ton of rules or instructions .
5 #### This is a great game to teach strategy . My family and I have already played it about it about a thousand times
5 #### Just what I wanted for a reinforcer with students . This game requires hand strength for assembly . It also provides opportunity for kids to practice grading the amount of strength needed to hit single toy ice cubes . The product came on time .
4 #### This game is fun and simple enough that even my 2.5 year old can sort of catch on ( although she really just likes pounding the ice cubes and the " strategy " part is lost on her ) . Having said that , it requires a ton of set up and it only takes a couple of minutes to play . The set up can only be done by a grown up or an older child so you are constantly setting the game up so the kids can bash the cubes down every minute or so . As you can imagine , this gets old fast . I would still recommend it in spite of this caveat . I just hope we do n't lose an ice cube because it does n't come with any extras ... UPDATE : My four year old son is getting the hang of setting this up on his own and I think will be able to do it without assistance fairly soon .
4 #### Perfect game for lively toddlers . This game has n't changed in design since I was a kid ... which is good . Most games / toys are made cheaper than they used to be ( see Mr Potato head circa 1976 vs Mr Potato head circa 2013 for example ) . ' Do n't Break the Ice ' is good fun !
5 #### The kids really enjoyed watching their caterpillars turn into butterflies .
4 #### this is a little too large for the living room but it is big enough for momma and baby to get in a wrestle in some what ( and I am 5'10") ... it will be great for backyard slumber parties next year !
5 #### Well this is a no brainer . I bought this for a 4 year old 's Birthday party . I just remember having so much fun with this game as a kid . The children at this birthday party just went crazy for this toy . Everyone wanted to play with it and we had to start a line . Still fun !
4 #### Better than the origin version that I played with as a child ! Much sturdier ! My 3 - 5 year old grandsons loves it and are learning to take turns by playing this game .
5 #### I had this game when I was a kid so I had to buy it for my son when he was old enough . It 's pretty much how I remember it ! It 's been great at teaching my son to control his hands to hit softly so he does n't knock down all the cubes . Plus he learns how to anticipate which will be good to knock down and which will make a bunch fall down . The only downside is that it 's hard to get the last few ice cubes in place so I have to help him but otherwise him and his friends play well together on their own . He 's 4 .
5 #### I grew up playing this game and now I 've bought it for my kids . I have two boys 1 and 3 and they both love it . Neither get the point of the game but it 's fun to just hammer out the blocks or in the case of my one - year - old punch them out over and over . My one complaint is that it does take longer to set up than to play .
4 #### This game is a classic and can be used with picture cards before each turn or as a way to practice turn - taking .
4 #### My three year old son received this tent as a Christmas gift . I had asked for a smaller one , but my dad insisted on getting this one . It 's really cute , and seems to be made of durable material . I 'm able to set it up by myself in under five minutes ( though not without some serious wrangling ) . It also folds down to be super compact , so it 's easy to store away . My one complaint is that it is way bigger than most play tents I 've seen -- it takes up most of the available floor space no matter where we set it up in our house . To be fair , we live in a small condo with somewhat small rooms , so if you live in a house with good sized rooms , this may not be an issue for you . That said , my son certainly seems to be enjoying the tent . When I told him I was thinking about exchanging it for a smaller one , he said , " No ! I can fit a lot of toys in there ! ! " So , I guess if he 's enjoying it , we 'll keep it . :)
5 #### My daughter loved this tent when she was 4 years old . We had many camp - ins in the livingroom with her tent . The tent was easy to set up , take down and store . I 'm not an outside person , so we never stayed out overnight with it . However she enjoyed being on the porch during day with it .
1 #### Expensive and a little bit of a scam , with the mail in voucher for the caterpillars , PLUS $ 5 additional shipping charge . Do not recommend .
5 #### Last year my granddaughter received the ladybug habitat and we watched them change from larva to ladybugs and then let them go in the garden . It was wonderful and these products are well made and serve as a wonderful way to educate children . Loved it ! ! !
5 #### One of the most fun / addictive marble style board games out there .
5 #### bought this used & it was n't missing any pieces . my kids still love to play a year later . thanks amazon for offering used !
5 #### Classically fun game . My kids loved this years ago , and my grandkids are just as happy to play it . Takes an adult to set it up , but the fun the kids have makes it worth the trouble .
5 #### Bought some for some of my students . They had blast playing it . Held up better than I thought it would/
5 #### I had this when I was a kid and loved it . Now my girls have fun playing and this game is fun for all players , whoever wins wins and whoever looses gets to break the ice . It 's a win win in my home since my 3 year old likes it when the ice breaks !
1 #### I bought this game after reading so many postive reviews . It is cheaply made and just no point to it unless you are a frustrated person who wants to hammer the same cube and make alot of noise . Wish I could understand why so many reviewers liked it so much . Someone enlighten me so I do n't feel I wasted the money .
5 #### I bought this for my son 's 6th birthday . He loved it as much as I did when I was a kid . Great game !
5 #### The newly sprung butterflies were placed in their butterfly house to grow and mature so they would be ready for the world . And the house was perfect .
5 #### I purchased this for my six - year old son and it was amazing ! Albeit , our first order of caterpillars were DOA , ( There was a hot spell going on in California so that most - likely caused the problem -- not the quality of the caterpillars . I contacted the company and within less than a week I had a new shipment that were ready to go at no cost ! It is amazing to watch how quickly the little babies grow into large caterpillars and form chrysalides and within a week we had five beautiful baby butterflies we released outdoors ! It was an amazing educational experience for my child . I highly - recommend this .
5 #### This kit was absolutely amazing . The instructions were well documented and the transformation was really a quick process ( compared to the tadpole one we did at the same time . ) The butterflies were beautiful and they were very calm when we released them . They even climbed on my kids arms and hands and they loved it -- this was well worth the experience they received ! I will do this again for them ! !
5 #### We used to play this as children - but I 'd forgotten how much fun it was ... and reasonably simple to learn all over again !
3 #### My kids are still a bit young for this game but my 6 yr old niece absolutely loves this game .
3 #### Quality of board and materials was subpar . Just not the game I remember playing . However , we still enjoyed the game !
5 #### My girls had a great time watching their caterpillars grow . It 's a nice little tent to have around for any other little creature they collect as well .
4 #### Games for younger kiddos are pretty hard to find . " Do n't Break the Ice " is one of the few that our kiddos love . You can play a different variation each time to hold their attention , and its a wonderful way to work as a family to build skills of focus , concentration , and " good sport " values . As expected , with the lower price point does come some quality issues-- this is fairly sturdy , but not durable enough for years and years of play . If one piece breaks , the whole game is essentially useless . Overall , its a great game and will amuse most kiddos .
3 #### The game is as others have described but I do n't think anyone mentioned how loud it is ! We bought it for a 5 year old and this is a very noisy game . She wo n't tap with the mallet - she bashes ! Excited kid plus plastic mallet equals a lot of noise .
5 #### Love this game - just like when my kids where young , too ! I purchased this for my 3 yr + grandson ..
5 #### Fun ! My 3 year old grandson wants to play it over and over and over ! ! ! ! He then used the ice cubes to build things !
5 #### Tried and true game always a lot of fun . The kids love the idea of breaking the ice . It 's a little hard for them to set it up . Needs an older child or grown up to put together . But still loads of fun . Would recommend
4 #### ... but it 's a toy for him not me , so it gets 4 stars . It seems like kind of a beginner type spy kit , pretty wordy but he is a good reader so he likes it . It 's nice that there is a zippered pouch for the pieces .
5 #### My daughter loved this spy kit . It has tiny binoculars , fingerprint kit , magnifying glass , and a booklet for all your ' evidence . ' So cute .
4 #### My eight year old granddaughter loves this spy kit . I had told her my story of being recruited by the CIA , and my son who is a computer architect was recruited right out of college . Neither of us elected to go to the CIA , but to my granddaughter it sounds exciting . She has only seen stories on PBS for kids about spying , so she has a little inkling of what it means . This kit is a nice basic set . It can be carried by the handle or looped through a belt . Unlike real spies who have no carry along kits , this one is perfect , The kit contains a black nylon case with binoculars , magnifying glass , fingerprint powder , brush , flashlight , secret marker pen set and a printed spy guide . The set is also winner of the Dr. Toys Best Vacation Toys Award , All set up for a spy adventure . Recommended . prisrob 11 - 30 - 17
5 #### Kids had fun with it - was super easy ordering the caterpillars online . It was a great science project to do with the kids as summer started .
5 #### we have been doing this for years and this year 2014 was just as great . Its a tradition , everything arrived as promised
5 #### WE LOVED THIS SO MUCH ! ! I used to do this when I was a kid & now I did it with my three young daughters . ALL five of our caterpillars turned into butterflies & we just let them go the other day . GREAT experience & learning lesson Will definitely order more caterpillars next spring !
5 #### My granddaughter loves this game and now that I can set it up in a minute she likes it even more and she laughs when she plays it .
5 #### I work with children , and ALL of my kids love this game ! From 3 years to 11 years , they just ca n't get enough of it . It 's great to work on turn - taking and they just love the suspense of when the bear will fall .
4 #### Here 's how you know this toy can go the distance : we played it in our hotel lobby . The hotel keeps games and puzzles there for guests , and this game ( despite all the little ice blocks , etc ) has stood up to many families . The blue frame snaps together without a problem , snaps apart easily for storage . A clever 7 year old can do that . Loading the ice takes some persistence , but your kids can learn to do that independently . The game itself is a no - brainer : You have to keep at least one strand of ice stretched across the frame . Best strategy is an early attack at the seams of the ice so multiple blocks fall , leaving your opponent with fewer choices . Fun toy .
5 #### Arrived on time good shape and old game I played growing up taught kids how to play and set up was really fun
5 #### This is a classic fun game . We 've always enjoyed this , and we 've revised the rules for the toddlers to play . When we play with the toddlers , we simply go in order of the scorecard ( ex : our first roll is to get as many one 's as possible , then we write the amount on the scorecard ) . Sometimes for a little variety , when playing with adults , we revise the rules again . We 've taken one scorecard and played " blackout , " where we finish the entire scorecard and make it one game ; we 've played it the same as we play with the toddlers or young childred listed above ; and we 've played it the normal way . Yahtzee has always been a great family game , and it does improve math skills . Make your children add up their own dice and/or scores . Best of all , put away the calculators ! ! Enjoy ! !
5 #### My niece is into spy 's right now so I bought her this . She loved it .
5 #### Great gift for my 7 year old girl who is into the spy scene right now . She loves it . Price was right as well . I definitely recommend if your kiddo is into being a spy .
5 #### We love this game . We have been looking for a replacement for the one we have worn out . I am so glad to have found one ! !
5 #### This was a gift for a friend who remembered it from years gone by --- she was thrilled with it --- condition like new . Thanks for a good deal .
5 #### This game is timeless ! I loved it as a kid , and still enjoy playing it as an adult . My second - grader loves it as well . It 's a game that 's easy to learn , easy to play , yet still challenging enough to be fun for everyone . I highly recommend it !
4 #### This is a fun game , I remember playing when I was a kid . It is a bit hard to get the " ice cubes " set into the base . It requires some muscular hands and fingers , so an adult needs to be near at all times to do that if the players are younger and lack the dexterity . Every time someone makes the polar bear fall that person is out and you have to set the game up again .
5 #### My 6 year old just loves this game ! So much fun , easy to setup and the playing time is short so keeps the child 's interest . We have played it for hours
5 #### Bought this for our preschool grandkids and their parents took it over and had tournaments . Great multi - generational toy . The man on the ice is more wobbly than the older set from 25 years ago- but still works fine once you know to be careful- and after all that 's the point of the game .
5 #### just as it looks great ! ! ! ! Fast ship , just as described I would get this again if I had to for sure
5 #### Bought for my 4 year old , but the entire family including my parents ( in their 70 's ) enjoyed playing this over and over .
3 #### I purposely purchased from this seller over the prime version , because it showed the black / red dice and nice compact holder ( portable ! ) . However , I received the basic Hasbro Classic Yahtzee with regular dice and just the shaker and score sheets . Disappointed .
5 #### My mom turned my tween onto Yahtzee so I felt inclined to have a set at my own house . It 's a fun and somewhat educational game for family game night .
4 #### Hammers and kids . Breaking stuff and kids . What could be better than mixing the two into a game of taking turns and hitting things with hammers ? Promotes hammering skills , I 'm not kidding - its hard to swing a hammer in a semi - precise manner . Cute ice cubes double as stacking toy , smashing hot wheels into , " play ice " for " play drinks " etc . If I had one gripe , the game takes some skill in setting up , my 5 year old can put the cubes into frame , but ca n't install them all in order to play the game . The red skater tends to not sit well in the center cube too .. ok that s two gripes .. but not enough to kill the gameplay . It does promote taking turns .. and its impossible to cheat .. A great kid 's classic .
4 #### This is easy enough to put back together , a consideration since the intent of the game is to break it apart . We have played it probably 50 times , each time building to the " thrill " of someone breaking the ice . Good for 3 year old with adults to put back together .
4 #### My nephew and I enjoyed this game . Just like back in the day when my family played it . In perfect condition .
5 #### We received this game 2 years ago . My daughter , at the time was 3 , loved just banging away at the cubes but after a few times , she began to understand the game . We played it religiously for a year , and then more sporadic ... but she always enjoyed it . Now my son , 2.5 has discovered it , and he LOVES it so we are back to playing it more religiously . For my now 5 year old daughter , it is teaching her more about strategy and how the pieces all fit together . My son is learning about taking turns , sharing , and of course loves banging away at them towards the end of the round . Great game ... lasting fun , easy to explain , teaches many different lessons !
2 #### This game fails to hold interest for my three and five year old girls . It 's a classic and they 're still excited to play when we bring it out , but they tire within two rounds , which only last about 30 seconds each . Left to their own , they would just like to pound all the ice cubes out as fast as possible , but since it takes a minute or so for an adult to setup , it 's not really fun for anyone . There 's never any surprise or challenge as to which cube will cause the bear to fall , so it basically feels like a complicated plastic tic - tac - toe game . On our set , the plastic is poorly finished , so the bear does n't stand / skate in the slot he 's meant to . Perhaps it 's better to wait till they are old enough for Operation or Kurplunk . For now , PopUp Pirate is the family favorite . If you have other suggestions , please leave a comment .
5 #### My husband said he thinks I like this as much as the kids , and I said , I think I like it more . It would also be a great gift for elderly people ( our friend had a " pet " ladybug and we thought she 'd enjoy it too ) . Super successful . We sent for the caterpillars and they arrived just as advertised . We successfully launched five butterflies out this spring . A terrific project that we 'll do again .
5 #### This is our third time buying one of these . I bought it for my 5 year old son who also did this in his preschool class . It 's very exciting to receive the caterpillar then watch them transform right in front of you ! Great purchase , we will do it again next year :)
5 #### This game is a hit at all family gatherings . I love love the container for the dice . Comes with a bunch of the score paper . Very easy to read . instructions included are very easy to understand . box keeps game nice and new
4 #### This a fun game for family night . It 's got everything pictured plus the scoring pad .
4 #### It is a great system but does not compare to the original . Bought as a gift and she enjoys it !
5 #### Family game night fodder . Everyone likes it and the 7 year old can play .
5 #### My grandsons loved this game as it is fun and challenging to play . They thought it was funny to set up the game to make someone else lose , meaning me . The only problem with the game is that it does n't last long and then you have to reassemble the pieces of the game again . The objective is to tap out a piece of ice and make sure that the whole sheet of ice does n't collapse and make the skater fall . It is a very cute action game that involves skill , strategy and luck . One of my grandsons used to cheat by tapping down two or three pieces of ice and then removing a different one altogether . His goal was to set you up to fail . We have had our game for about 14 years and it still looks like new . We have had a lot of fun with it and it is always worth a few laughs .
4 #### I use this game as a reinforcer during group speech therapy . It takes a little bit of time to set up but is fun and the kids can take turns popping out cubes of ice . Not my favorite game but the kids like it enough .
4 #### If an older child or adult is around to setup the game it is a great game . Takes about 2 minutes to set up . Pros Simple game concept , try to knock out an ice block without making the red bear fall . Kids like making the bear fall , so games last a few seconds . Hammers are fun to knock the ice cubes out with . Spare ice cubes in case you lose a couple . Cons ( still a great buy ) Setup Blue plastic frame is 2 pieces and requires assembly . Ice cude installation 32 single cubes surround a 4 cube square holding the bear ... Which requires help . They fit very tight so the last cube is difficult for children . Placing the bear on top of the 4 cube can be difficult , our bear tips over sometimes . When dismantled requires thought to fit it back in the box ... Put blue frame in first , then hammers , then ice cubes .
5 #### One of my families favorite games . This includes shaker cup , dice and score pad .
5 #### Awesome game ! The grandkids are learning to play it .
4 #### I received the standard version of Yahtzee , which comes in different packaging than the " Classic " edition pictured . Both have dice , cup , scorepad and instructions - but mine has standard white dice with black pips rather than the deluxe black and red dice with white pips that are pictured . Considering the good price , it is n't a deal breaker , but I would have preferred the deluxe dice advertised .
5 #### This is one of those projects every kid should get to do multiple times . My kid 's love learning about the butterflies . Being able to see the process is priceless . You do have to send away for the caterpillars - and it cost an additional $ 5 to process .
3 #### I loved this game when I was a child , but now the marbles are plastic and the holes are not deep enough to hold the marbles very well . The concept is still fun , but the construction has suffered from the changes .
5 #### This is the one game my entire family can agree to play on " Game Night . " My 6 y / o particularly likes that he 's able to beat his teenaged sister and his parents on a regular basis . Great , clean family fun ... just like it 's supposed to be !
5 #### This has always been one of my favorite games as a child and now as an adult as well . I got this game to play with my grandchildren when they sleep over and we have already had more than our share of game nights and fun with it .
5 #### Really like the colors . We do n't use the shaker but the dice are nice as well as the score keepers . Good price .
5 #### I was always more of an Ants in the Pants fan myself but I recently played this with my young nephew and he loved it ! It requires less coordination than Ants in the Pants so he enjoyed it more . For very young children it is a game that they need an adult for since they often do n't have the patience or coordination to put the ice back in . That just means that it 's a good game for when playtime is also parent - child bonding time .
4 #### Purchased for my two daughters to play , 8 and 4 . The 4 year old ca n't put the ice together , but both kids enjoy playing the game !
1 #### I have a 3 year old and it can be difficult to find games that are n't too difficult for her but still fun for the rest of us . My kids , ages 6 and 3 , were totally excited to play this game as was I until we discovered that you spend more time putting the cubes into the frame than you do actually playing . It 's a real pain to put all the little ice blocks in the frame and honestly the last row of blocks is too difficult for the kids . Then , all the kids do is take turns hammering out cubes until the bear falls . My kids seem of pretty average intelligence and this game provided almost no challenge to them or even learning as far as I could tell . They both knew exactly when the bear would fall and that 's really only fun once or twice . I think we played it about four times in the past year . I hate to be down on any kind of game that brings the family together or gets kids involved in something away from the tv / computer , but this game is just annoying to set up and dull to play .
1 #### Cheap Made n China . More suited for 4 - 5 year olds who do n't care .
5 #### Great spy case ! My daughter loved it and carried it around wherever she went .
5 #### Got it for my godson ( 11y ) and he loved it ! Totally recommend it !
5 #### Very fun toy . Works great . My 6 year old son absolutely loves it . He can do it by himself . Very little help .
4 #### Kids like the game , altho it 's difficult for the 5 - year old to set it up for the next round of the game ...
4 #### A cute , simple preschool toy that I like because I can play with my child or she can play with it alone . It can be challenging for the littler ones to learn how to set it up at first , but it 'll come with practice . A nice , safe way to bang away .
5 #### This is a very exciting game . My kids discovered this game in their Sunday school church . They have been playing with it every week and it is a lot of fun . I can compare the excitement you get when playing Jenga when it is about to fall , you know it is coming except you do n't know if it is gon na happen on your turn . This is a classic toy / game , it has been around for many years and it does n't get old . The game is set up with blocks of ice in a square frame . You place an ice skater on top of one of the blocks and the players start hammering down one block at a time . The object of the game is not be the player who hammers the last block that will make the ice skater fall down . It is a very simple to set up and likewise very simple game to understand that even a pre - schooler can start playing in no time . The game is made by Milton Bradley . It is rated for 3 years old and up . It can be rated as 3 year old to 100 because there is really no limit in age to enjoy this toy . Another plus is that this is not a very expensive game .
5 #### I rated this game for my 4.5 years old . He loves this game , he thinks hammering down the ice cube is fun . Unfortunately , the mallet is a flimsy cheap plastic rod , it was easily bend and almost broken to two pieces . My son does n't care , he said he still have one mallet and can share that with us when we play the game . But if that one is broken , too , then we need to find a substitute .
5 #### 2nd time doing this . We love them ! Fast shipping of caterpillars too ! I think it 's easier to just order this kit every time ( and almost the same price as caterpillars are $ 5 with it and $ 15 as a refill )
5 #### Bought this for my daughter and she loves it . I will say though , I am always under investigation for something . :) she is a good detective with this fun toy .
4 #### I gave this to my almost 7 - year - old for Christmas and she loved it . The binoculars and magnifying glass actually work and it seems to be better quality than many kids toys . The fingerprint ink is not great and we actually have n't " dusted " for fingerprints yet because it looks like it would make a mess . I think if she were older she 'd have more fun with the files and cards .
5 #### My grand - daughter will have hours of fun playing detective !
4 #### This is a game I played as a kid and really enjoyed it , so I 've passed it on . It 's a bit of a mess at first and cleanup can be tricky but overall it 's a great game for kids .
4 #### This is one of my son 's favorites - going on a year now . He plays it a few times per week . Not only is it fun , I find it a bit educational . We count the squares as we 're setting up the rows , and there is strategy involved . I knocked a star off because of the noise factor - perhaps the hammers could have a little padding to make them less noisy ?
5 #### We gave this a s a gift for a little boy that was turning 5 . The whole family LOVED it and I will be purchasing one for my own children when they are a bit older . GREAT EXPERIENCE !
5 #### Bought this as a gift for a friend 's kid and he LOVES it . Ironically he is now learning some of this in school and it tops in the class because he has this to practice with at home . Fantastic for a kid who loves science . I need to get one for my own child , too .
3 #### Overall , this product is okay . I think it looks a little cheap and the spiral wires are pretty tight , which makes it difficulty for younger kids ( or older adults ) to use . I tried to use this in therapy for following directions but the immense fine - motor skills to pull back the spring to fit the wire in proved to be too difficult for both the kids and adults I tried it with . If fine motor skills are okay , this might be an okay options ... especially if they are interested in electronics . It does not come with a battery , which is expected nowadays but still important to note . There are three different lengths of wires but the colors of the medium and long wires look the same ( reddish ... where the short ones are blue ) . I still use this from time to time , but not very often . However , I purchased the actual Snap Circuit kit and found the materials to be much higher quality and easier to use .
5 #### I love this spy case i have it and I love doing the finger prints and figuring out who 's they were but you should put an ink pad in there that actually works . Sorry :)
5 #### What can I say about these except it made my 6 year old very happy ! Is it a quality product no but seeing your child enjoy it so much is priceless
2 #### There were several problems with items included in this case , which does n't properly hold the contents . My daughter was excited to get this because she is into Spies , however her interest lasted only a day or two due to the inadequate equipment . Maybe she 's a bit rough , but this was not well constructed , and was n't owned long before it went to the trash recycle bin .
5 #### was exactly what i expected and is approved by my little spy .
4 #### I had this game as a kid and it was a blast .. and it still is ! My daughter and I have been playing this since she was 2(she 's 4 now and loves it more than ever).It has tought her how to take turns and the laws of physics , on some level(I can see the wheels turning in her head as she figures out what blocks she can hit without knocking out the whole row).She is even quite patient as we put the ice cubes in the tray . It 's kind of annoying that it takes 25 seconds to knock out the cubes and 3 minutes to put them back . The hammers are a little flimsy(one of ours is a little bent).It really is fun though . Who does n't like beatin ' the heck out of something with a hammer ?
1 #### This is another that the kids all want when they see the commercial . It looks like it would be a blast . Do n't bother . It 's just not fun . It 's hard for kids to get the ice cubes in right & the little hammers are junk . With very little use , a couple of ours actually broke . I either put this away permanently or I threw it away . I ca n't remember which . This is junky garbage . Do n't buy this .
4 #### I bought this for Christmas for my 8 year old son . He has the ELENCO snap circuts , and he loves them ! He enjoys this , but said he feels like he is going to loose something due to the unattached wires/ springs . We have it tucked away , and I am sure he will use it more when he is older . I consider this a good purchase . STEM at its best ! I will use this with the Scouts for a den meeting . A Lot of sounds can be made- either by following the booklet , or just exploring on their own .
5 #### Great price . Fast delivery . Purchased as a Christmas present . As far as I know item was as described .
5 #### We have purchased 3 of these in the past . The dog chewed up the first one after it 's first use . So we got a few more for all the kids . I 've seen teachers use the jumbo size in the classroom . We ordered the butterlies and everything worked the way it should . Very fun to do with the kids .
3 #### My kids ( 14 , 9 , 6 , 1 ) did n't have any interest in this . I watched them more then the kids did and I was the one who ended up picking the flowers and spritzing the nectar . I would n't mind doing it again , but the refill caterpillars are too expensive and I do n't think it 's worth it . I 'll probably just let the kids put other insects in the habitat if they want to catch and observe some little creatures . Also , the little bloody juice that the butterflies squirt out when they come out , is really gross and it gets on the netting and is somewhat disturbing to look at and there is n't a good way to clean it with the butterflies in there . I would n't buy this again .
3 #### The shaker for the dice is very small . We do n't use it . Everything else was great .
5 #### Takes me back to my childhood . Arrived quickly in perfect NEW condition . Ca n't beat YAHTZEE for good clean fun .... Thank you !
5 #### My family has designated Sunday night as family game night and I purchased Yahtzee at a very good price off of a deal of the day . I had not played in years and forgot how fun this game is . In addition to playing the game , I let my children ( 6 and 8) keep score . I think this helps and gives them a practical application for the Math they are learning in school and teaches them how to strategize .. WE HAVE A BLAST ..... and oftentimes end up with multiple days a week as " Family Game Night " .
5 #### The product came on time and as described . I am glad I bought this ! I always research before I buy and this was a good deal . Retro . Kids love it .
5 #### Fun electronic playground . Keeps em occupied for a while
5 #### The kit contains everything you need to complete the life cycle . I ordered 2 containers of caterpillars . One was great , the other was small and ended up with deformed butterfly wings , etc . So glad I ordered 2 because the other one was perfect . The grandkids want to order more caterpillars so we can do it again . Great product .
4 #### My nephew had this on his Christmas list along with many other insect - related items . I love when I can purchase educational items for my nephews as opposed to toys they 'll quickly lose interest in . Of course , I love when I can get a great price on things they want ! Now that it 's getting warmer , I fully expect that my nephew will be both entertained and educated by this butterfly garden , along with his many other bug habitats .
1 #### I ordered this for my classroom . Love the pop - up house and the packaging . After getting the box , I got online and ordered the caterpillars . They arrived in a timely fashion but they were very dead . I contacted Insect Lore and received a quick reply stating that the caterpillars would be sluggish upon arrival and to please wait . I knew they were dead but waited the prescribed time and contacted Insect Lore again about replacement caterpillars . I have not heard back from them after contacting the company 3 times . Sad for my classroom . We will not have enough time before school gets out to grow another set of caterpillars now .
5 #### My daughter loved this kit - we watched the caterpillars grow from about 1/2 inch or so to 2 + inches , then form Chrysalides , then hatch out into beautiful butterflies . We also read " The Very Hungry Caterpillar " at the same time . She enjoyed giving the butterflies flowers from our garden to feed on , along with slices of fruit . They get kind of gross just before they turn into chrysalides , what with all the poop kind of mixing in with the brown slime of food , but other than that , they are really fun . Note : you have to mail the certificate away for the caterpillars ( because obviously Amazon ca n't keep them sitting on a shelf in one of their gigantic warehouses , they would die ) .
5 #### Ok , so this kit does n't come with the caterpillars in it , but I knew that at the time of purchase . ( You have to send in a coupon ( or register online , as I did ) and pay an extra $ 5 for shipping to actually get them ) . Living in a remote area of SE Alaska I was a little worried about the caterpillars arriving alive . We only get mail twice a week here , and I figured at least some ( if not all ) of them would die in transit or we would end up with butterflies trapped in a jar by the time they arrived . My kids and I were so pleased when we opened the box and found 5 LIVE caterpillars crawling around . That very night the first one crawled up and attached itself to the lid , so obviously they are all well along on the process , but that is no fault to the company . I think the others still have one more skin shed to complete , and there looks like there is ample food left in the jar . Some of the other kits were cheaper , but I am willing to pay a higher price for the quality product and service I received ! Thanks !
5 #### I have a 10 year old great - grandson that comes from out of town to visit me every summer . I live in the middle of no where and there is not much for him to do at my house . But he is very intelligent when it comes to putting things together , and he especially likes putting together anything electronic . He loved this 50 in One electronic set -- in no time at all he was showing me the different things he had invented . Needless to say he was not bored during the week he was at my house as this set kept his interest high and his time occupied . I am so glad that I bought this for him as it was exactly the right thing to get !
4 #### This is a decent set considering the price . On the good side , it 's got everything you need to introduce someone to the basic components used in circuits . It comes with a manual that is well - written and explains a lot about electronics and electricity . It goes through switches , resistors , capcitors , diodes , transistors , inductors , transformers , and speakers . The projects take you from basic light - the - LED stuff to building a radio and basic logic circuits . It really hammers the basics and theory , so some of the early projects are a bit boring for younger learners , but hey you can always skip ahead , right ? The biggest negative is that it 's made of cardboard , so it 's a bit fragile and flimsy ; the manual , likewise , is printed on cheap paper and gets torn up easily . Considering the price , I ca n't expect much . I bought this for my 10 - yo who expressed an interest in electronics , as an inexpensive way to see if the interest was more than passing . So far so good . We 've also used snap circuits with our older kids , but between the two I like this format better , especially for kids in the middle - school age range for whom snap circuits seem a little childish .
5 #### I purchased this for my 8 year old daughter . She received it today . This is one of the best toys she has ever received ! At first she was skeptical and did n't think she could do it , I read the first page or two to her and all of a sudden she said , " OH , I get it ! I can read that myself now ! " She wired the first LED light and then added resistors to see the difference . Then , she skipped some pages to get to something NEW to do ! She played with it for 4 hours straight , until I told her she had to put it up until tomorrow . She set her clock to get up early so she 'll have enough time to try out lots of stuff tomorrow ! She loves it ! The price is very reasonable . Most kids her age would probably need an adult to read the pages to them and explain things , depending on their reading levels . It is very easy to put the wires that are included in place for each experiment . There are springs on the circuit board , you just bend them over a little and push the end of the wire in between the coils . The coils are numbered and the instructions tell what number to connect the wires to . Even without reading they could do this , but she wanted to understand exactly what was going on . I recommend this for any child 8 and up that enjoys learning . * They do n't realize they are learning *
5 #### A fun dice game for anyone over about age 12 . I like it because it moves quickly and there 's no player number limit ( two up to whatever you wish ) . There are about equal amounts of luck and strategy in this game . Four people can complete a game in about 30 - 35 minutes . Its fun for the whole family - check it out !
5 #### On a whim , I bought this as a Christmas stocking stuffer for our kids ( 12 & 15 ) . Just a silly toy for the sock . Guess what happened ? We play Yahtzee just about very weekend . The kids love it ! Just goes to show you that you do n't need an Xbox to have fun . The classics never go out of style !
5 #### I received my first Rook set nearly 60 years ago . The game was easy to learn , and from the time I was young I was able to win my share of games . Not that I was especially brilliant . It 's just that Rook is a game that even a kid can do well at . So , it 's a great game for youngsters . But as I discovered as the years wore on , it 's also a great game for adults . This makes it a great game for family gatherings when three or even four generations may be together . Everyone can enjoy it . My original set wore out years ago . And we 've been through a few sets since . But it 's one game I 'll always have on hand . Plus , there are a number of variations on the basic game , which , if you get a little bored with playing the same game all the time , you can use to keep things interesting .
5 #### Shockingly even more fun than the Snap Circuits set we have . Seems advanced , but my 7 year old ( very mechanical ) loves it and it is very fun ! !
4 #### My granddaughter loves it although I do n't know why she wanted this instead of a doll ?
5 #### Great start for kids . I would recommend 10 years and up . My grandson is younger , but I am tutoring him with it .
5 #### We are really enjoying this game . We love having family game nights and this is perfect . We taught our 8 year how to play very quickly and he loves it . I personally LOVE this cup with storage for the dice , that is my favorite part !
5 #### Love it ! Just as much fun add the classic . The updated dice are nice .
5 #### My 6 year old daughter saw this on TV . She loves insects and I liked the science aspect . It was less expensive on Amazon so I ordered it here . I thought it came with the cup of catepillars but it came with a certificate to order them for only $ 5 . Not bad since they are normally $ 15 plus $ 5 shipping . This is so much fun . Both my kids 6 and 4 run to see how big the catepillars have gotten each morning . They can see them making silk , eating the food and all the poop . Kids just love to talk about poop do n't they ? I 'm looking forward to the butterfly stage where we have already been discussing what they eat and how we will feed them . I recommend this set to anyone with little children . Guaranteed fun !
5 #### I would recommend this product to teachers . Students get to experience the life cycle of a butterfly and give back to nature . :)
3 #### Once again , I did n't do enough research on this item . I wrongly assumed there would be more inside the garden than a mesh enclosure . While it is n't technically false advertising , it seemed a little misleading to me . I had to order the caterpillars separately and will need to mix up my own sugar water .
5 #### My son and daughter just loved this product . Even though it was more of an educational toy rather than something they could play with , they both seemed to really enjoy it . They were fascinated by the metamorphosis the caterpillars went through to transform into butterflies . I think its a great learning experience for children . Once the butterflies finally came out of the cocoons I allowed my children to watch them for a little bit before releasing them into the wild . Several cautions : 1 . The butterflies are extremely delicate , so to ensure your children do n't cause any damage to them or their wings , parental supervision is advised . 2 . The butterflies should only be released into the wild in appropriate weather conditions ( i.e. , spring / summer ) . 3 . The process takes some time . So kids will need to be patient . Overall I was very satisfied with this product . T.S. Charles Author of young adult book , " Consumed . " Available on Amazon .
5 #### Ordered these for grand kids . They came as stated . All went as it was supposed to . Turned the butterflies loose today and the whole experience was enjoyed by all . Will order more in future .
5 #### This is the game of all games for any little princess .
5 #### Awesome game . It is super easy and fun . Other than the small pieces , an advanced 2 - 3 year old could easily play and enjoy . This kind of game appeals to a braid age range 2 - 10 years . I bought for my 4 year old and she loves it .
5 #### This looks really cool ! My 8 yr old will love it !
5 #### I gave this to my son for xmas , it was on special so it was a great price at the time . He loves this kit and still plays with it from time to time and it 's now May . It 's a fun gift for a tween boy .
5 #### Brand new & exactly as pictured . This is my husband 's , his brothers ' , & his sons ' favorite game so we go through the Rook cards about once a year ( the cards are still in tact but look ratty so while the others do n't care , my 57 yr old husband does care to have a nice deck of cards ) . When I looked to buy some more in local stores , they were all sold out ! So I ordered 3 packs of Rook cards & my husband was delighted to see them arrive today . ( I hid 2 packs of Rook cards so I can bring them out next year & the next year after that when these get worn out ) . These cards get a lot of heavy use , so I consider them to be fairly good cards to survive a bunch of adult men playing several hours weekly with these . I noticed some reviewers mentioned the cards are cheaply made . Maybe compared to several decades ago but these look & feel exactly like the ones I 've bought over the years .
4 #### My son loves this . He spent all day messing with this . Teaches basic electronic principles .
5 #### Played this for years and is alway a crowd pleaser
4 #### The cup that comes with it , is a weird little holder . All of the dice fit in it , but barely . The dice are n't well made , but they work . I was hoping this would be the original , like other reviewers got , but it 's just like the picture . It does come with around 80 score cards , which is nice
5 #### Yahtzee was a childhood favorite of mine , and now I felt it was time for my family to own it also and pass on the tradition to my own family . This game has a nice storage spot for the dice to go instead of having them losely floating around in the box .
4 #### My kids had a great time with the Live Butterfly Garden . 5 Caterpillars turned into 4 Beautiful butterflies and one sort of gimpy butterfly that got stuck to his own cocoon . My only gripe is that you have to pay $ 5 for them to ship Caterpillars . I do n't mind the $ 5 , it would just be nice if they built it into the price of the Butterfly Garden . You have to go to their website and put in a credit card number and with the amount of fraud out there , that 's just one extra person getting their hands on my information . Why they ca n't just put a certificate with a redemption code in the box is beyond me .
3 #### The case is well made and looks really cool . The case holds all of the supplies but not too well . If the case is tossed or whipped around , items may fly out . This is a bit of problem for me as i have little ones who pick up everything and shake it ... which led to the whole contents on the floor . The case itself looks pretty cool and i 'm surprised my son did n't play with it as much . I do n't know if there were too many other things competing for attention on Xmas and this one just fell to the bottom of the pile . Maybe an adult needs to engage the kids first and show them how cool this ... My 8yr old loves detective stuff and has all sorts of spy gear stuff but this toy did n't catch . I 'll see if I ca n't show him how " cool " toy this and maybe update my review if actually plays with it . The shipping was fast and the price was very reasonable for the kit .
5 #### Alex toys is known for it 's quality products and this fits right along with all of the other high quality products from Alex Toys . I 'm a big fan of Alex and will for sure buy their product again soon .
5 #### My child and her friends are really into " spying " right now , so this seemed the perfect birthday gift . It was a big hit ! Favorite features were the coding and the fingerprint powder .
1 #### This is a trick taking card game , like spades or pinochle . The difference is that , while those games are actually fun , Rook is not . It 's basically pinochle , but boring . Buy a pinochle deck or play spades with a regular deck . More versatile and more fun .
5 #### This was both my daughters favorite game . I was thrilled to find it for our 3 year old granddaughter ! Such a simple , adorable game ! !
4 #### Granddaughter loves to dress up , even on a board game .
4 #### I purchased this game ( and others ) as a Christmas present for my daycare kids this year . We opened it today and spent a long time all playing it on the kitchen floor . I had 2 & 3 yr olds and 9 yr olds ( and me ! ) all playing . The very youngest ones got a little frustrated but I think with some practice they 'll get it . They all still had fun with it and did n't want to put it away . I think this toy is great for working on their eye / hand coordination and problem solving . They also had to use some teamwork to retrieve each other 's misses . Since we got it today I ca n't say much about the durability . The bottom is plastic and the top is cardboard . The cardboard is thick , but I can see it deteriorating over time .. especially with a daycare ! Overall I think this is one of those great simple games that every kid should get to experience .
1 #### We bought this for our daughter when she was younger . It was too frustrating . The ants are not made like they once were and it is near impossible to get them into the pants . We would cheat for her and pretend they went in after a long while of trying . Even we could not get them in . Plus the material is so cheesy that they break very easily . Save your money and buy a better game instead .
3 #### Considering how few multi - player games exist for very young children , " Ants in the Pants " is a boon for parents . Unfortunately , it may be more fun for parents than for the youngest kids . Making the plastic ants jump into the pants is fun , but my three year old son found it frustrating , getting no ants in after many minutes of trying . But he was dogged after I encouraged him to practice more . ( It 's difficult to assist kids in learning how to apply just the right pressure to control the jump of the ant . ) After a while he got one in , but by that time he was mentally fried . Since then he has shown little interest in the game . I personally find the game fun , so it 's disappointing that my son does n't . Obviously , you 're mileage will vary . My advice is that it might be a better game for kids four and a half and older . The game is fairly well made and the ants virtually indestructable . Other than the fact that you can lose the small ants , the game should last a while . Considering the inexpensive price , it 's worth a try . If all else fails and the kids bail , you and the Mrs. can play .
5 #### It was tough figuring out how to rate this because after it was purchased it was stored in a basement since the little owner moved from one state to another from a larger house to a smaller one . Which of course has caused disruption from normal circumstances . I gave it FIVE STARS simply because I did n't want to cause people to turn away for obvious reasons .
5 #### Books , you can never have too many books . Especially in a school setting . School , classroom and home ..... the more the better
4 #### I 've had some fun with my friend but you always have to read the instructions . We learned that after morse code did n't work .
5 #### This super game of Yahtzee makes a superb gift for almost anyone . Or , of course , you could buy it to play yourself . We did both .
5 #### It 's Yahtzee with a new , improved more compacted design . I loved this game as a kid and I 'm happy to share that experience with my kids ( who love it too ) . Just a timeless game that 's good family fun .
5 #### Reminds me of my childhood in the early 90 's . Bought this game to keep at Grandmas house for MY daughters to play with . It 's a bit pricey , but worth it to have the original classic version .
5 #### We have played Rook for 69 years , but the cards are hard to find sometimes . We gave these to our grand children and they LOVE to play .
5 #### I will recommend this type rook for my friends to buy . Very easy to read the numbers and tell the colors apart .
4 #### My 6 year old really loved this gift . You need to order the butterflies separately , and the shipping costs extra . It 's still a cute gift and you can re - order more butterflies . Definitely do n't use this in the winter , because you 'll have to let the butterflies go into an environment where they will not be able to survive .
5 #### This is a great kit to see the life cycle of butterflies . Kids had a wonderful time observing the entire life cycle . I even gave them as gifts for birthdays !
4 #### I was fun for the whole family . When we set the butterflies free , we kept it and got more for the next year . Its become a tradition .
5 #### I have bought this as a gift at least ten times , and every recipient , even the ones that are not children , have loved it and found the life cycle of a butterfly fascinating . They also loved the thrill of releasing them once they were full grown , so they could enjoy their life in freedom . Just so you are aware , when you get the set , you have to write away to get the larvae . Obviously , they ca n't store them in boxes that sit on shelves for months . :) Ordering is easy , and once they get there you will totally enjoy the process of life . 5 very big thumbs up !
5 #### Excellent christmas gift . our family has played it many times for our family game night . Even our toddler can sit around the table with it and throw the dice .
3 #### An old game that will give the grown ups and children hours of enjoyment . Not the best quality construction , but good enough for several years of playing .
5 #### Good gift for kids to play while learning too .
5 #### This is a great training set for people wanting to learning electronics . It teaches the basics of electronics through a lot of exercises . Also , it is at a reasonable price .
5 #### packaged as promised ! got this as a baby shower gift for one of my best friends because we played it growing up all the time !
5 #### How fun to see dads and neighborhood boys seriously playing this game with little girls , while sitting their quietly in earrings , tiaras , and jewels . As they were playing , they would forget , then another child would burst out laughing at them . It 's a lot of fun !
5 #### I 've done this with my kids before so I knew what to expect . When you order this it comes with a coupon inside that gives you the directions to order your caterpillars online through Insectlore.com . It 's $ 5.00 + free shipping to buy them . The last time I did this with my kids was about a year and half ago and since then they have updated the butterfly garden habitat ! Its really sturdy and made nicely .
5 #### Bought this set for my boyfriends daughter . She really liked it . And all of her butterfly 's hatched . She kept the four awhile but they started escaping out so she released them all . You can always order more caterpillars to hatch more butterfly 's
5 #### My 7 year old daughter got this for Christmas and ca n't wait to try it . We are goign to wait until the weather is right to order our caterpillars , but she is super excited and we read all of the info already .
5 #### I 'm hooked on raising butterflies . My grandchildren have all raised and released Painted Lady and Monarch Butterflies . That is one thing I am proud to have introduced them to .
4 #### Cards are plastic so take a while to break in . Quick delivery and good price . Great game to teach one to think strategically .
5 #### A classic game of cards has been around for over 100 years , since Parker Brothers first introduced in 1905 . As the story goes , it was a Southern regional game and replaced poker games in the bible belt for religious people . The rules are included in the nice storage box . The rules allow to set up a game for 2 , 3 , 5 or 6 players or for 2 teams of 2 players each . the 56 cards in 4 color schemes are really nice , themed to the game . The goal is to capture as many point cards as you can . The 2 black bird cards as wild cards . The game is related to many other popular games where you can " bid " , " trump " and " Trick - take " , it has bits from Hearts , Pinochle , Spades , Whist and Bridge , but easier to learn than Bridge . A very addictive game that can be played for hours and hours . Great for rainy days and cabins .

4 #### Rook is a good game for your brain . We play twice a week at the Senior Center so they do n't last too long .
5 #### I have been playing rock since I was a child .. it is a great family game and challenging enough that when you play as an adult you do n't get bored .. highly recommend !
4 #### I 've been playing Yahtzee my entire life -- it was a family favorite , and lately I had really been wanting to play , so I decided to purchase the Classic version hoping that it would be the same Yahtzee I remember from my childhood . It mostly is . The cards have had a little redesign , but ultimately they 're the same . My only problem with this game at all , really , is the weird plastic dice holder / shaker thing . I may be a little biased because I 'm generally anti - shaking - implement . I even hate the plastic cup that used to come with the game . But this new thing is just unwieldy and a waste . Maybe the logic is that you ca n't just put some dice and a pack of score pads in a box and call it a game ? I do n't know , but I 'd even take the goofy loud plastic cup back to get rid of this thing .
5 #### Got this as a Christmas present because I love the game and enjoyed playing with my Grandmother . Bought it for two of my grandchildren . Look forward to going to see them and playing it with them ! Just like I used to play with my Grandmother ! ! !
5 #### Yahtzee is one of our families favorite games and this more modern version is perfect . I like the dice holder so we do n't lose any when that box inevitably falls off the shelf or out of the closet like so many of the games do :) This is a classic game with a new look that our family just loves !
5 #### FABULOUS ! My 7th grade son is home schooled and we have been looking for some hands on activities that will lead him to know a little more about what interests him . It has kept him busy countless hours already and he is no where near done with it . Getting what must be an AM radio signal was his favorite so far . It 's complicated enough to keep a 13 year old busy and interested . He has been following the directions all on his own . At $ 16.99 it is a great value or what we got . I highly recommend it !
5 #### I received the Pretty Pretty Princess dress up board game , in great time , and condition , and for a great price . A fun game to play with your little princesses . :}
5 #### We love Pretty Pretty Princess ! It 's so funny to watch my husband play this game with the girls ... it 's a good photo opt . You have to earn all of your jewelry . It 's easy and fun !
4 #### 5yo granddaughter instituted a " girls - only " policy for the game right away . Unfortunate , because daddy and grandpa were both willing to don earrings and other jewelry ... pictures would 've been priceless . A quick play and fun for all . Unfortunately , Grandma won first game , but shethe little one got over it and realized how quickly play can turn ; won the second and third games . Overpriced , so minus one star .
5 #### I bought this " add - on " simply for the colors . The dice really look cool , to me . I bought the limit allowed , so I could give as gifts . Everyone loved the new style , it makes playing the game even better . The score sheets even have a little style . The sheets are a tad bit smaller over all , and the print is definitely smaller , so glasses may be required . The " older version " of the score sheet , had the back - side printed for player game totals,(which we never used ) . This newer version , is only printed on one side , so it leaves room on the back for doodles , or adding your scores . The little black and red drawer , is simply for storing the dice . However , if needed , you could use the black cup portion as a shaker . ( We just shake the dice in our hands , which is MUCH quieter . ) :-) Very happy with this purchase , and giving it as a gift , made others happy as well .
5 #### I have a friend who will be bedridden for over a month , so I got her a few old favorite games to help her pass the time . Her husband loved the idea ( because it would keep her from trying to get out of bed if her mind was occupied ! ! ) Now friends are coming over and playing the games with her , and they are having some good old time fun ! The game was on sale for under $ 5 ! !
5 #### I played this game often when I was little & I bought it to play with my daughter . I hope she will have as much fun with me as I did with my mother & siblings .
5 #### I bought this for my 7 year old daughter for Christmas and we 're loving playing it ! It brings back memories of playing this with my grandmother . Great for teaching math skills and strategy !
5 #### Great product , was as described . Will recommend to my family and friends !
5 #### Gift for my grand daughter . She loves it ! Verified all projects / lessons work except projects 45 and 46 , not a true flip flop and not a true touch circuit . Even with that , 46 n 46 are the only BS in the bunch , but the rest of the projects are valid , separate and distinct , and well explained . I have over 40 years experience , and went to month long schools that did n't offer the hands on and easy to understand explanations ( just omit the water anologies , it assumes the child knows something about hydraulics . If you learned hydraulics already like a diode being similar to a check Valve and a variable esister being similar to a water valve on a common house faucet , ect , you will clearly understand )
5 #### This is such a great little garden for kids who love watching nature and the whole process of caterpiller to butterfly .
5 #### Such a fun idea and product for kids , and very educational as well . Just make sure to do it in spring or when it 's not too hot or cold , those butterflies will die if not temperate ! All 5 of our butterflies hatched from their cocoons !
5 #### I was so happy to find this game after much searching ! I wish it were more available , as it is a great early board game for girls - as they go around , they have to collect and put on different pieces of jewelry . ( Especially cute for them to play with Daddy ! )
5 #### Several of my family members ( both young and old ) love board games . One of our favorites is Yahtzee . It is entertaining ( educational for the younger set ) and adds to family fun night . I bought this set because I could n't resist the shape and colors of the new dice ! The shape is unique and the colors are red and black with white dots . Feels like we are playing a new game ! Love this new edition of Yahtzee !
5 #### Oh so fun . Classic Yahtzee . My 7 year old loves this game , and we use it to help his math skills . It also helps us bond as a family and kiddo likes keeping score .
5 #### It is the original Yahtzee game with a shaker . I like the game and so does my family and the price was very good . The shaker could have been left out .
5 #### Love the game . I still like the barrel better , but I love the idea of the built in storage for the dice ..
5 #### This is such a fun game for the whole family . It is a game that even the young ones can play . If you do n't have it in the house , you should . Nice set too .
5 #### Any Yahtzee game deserves a five star rating does it not ? This game package is not exception . Yahtzee is a family favorite and I predict it will continue earning cudos for many years to come .
5 #### This is a great item . We have enjoyed our net with several orders of caterpillars . This is a neat process for children to witness .
5 #### My son loves this kit . He is able to walk through all the electronic projects with ease . It 's a great kit that the both of us enjoy .
2 #### I love Yahtzee , and for years , I had just used random 6 siders taking from other games , and printed the scorecards off the internet , but I was out shopping and saw this " classic " edition in the clearance bin for $ 7 , and thought , " The dice look cool and maybe its time to get a " real " version . So I bought it and took it home and we played it , and now I see why it was in the clearance bin . The black holder for the dice , that is supposed to act as a rolling cup is rubbish . It does n't stand up , so someone has to be constantly holding it upright or all the dice spill out . The dice themselves are cheap , lightweight dice that feel like you could crumble them in your bare hands , and I fully expect them to break at some point . It does come with a full sheet Yahtzee score cards ( yippee ) , and NO rolling tray . Even my moms " cheap " Yahtzee game from the 90 's included a really cheap rolling tray . Hasbro has redefined CHEAP for games , a bit too cheap for my taste . Someday I will just buy one of the Deluxe editions and be done with it .
5 #### gave as a gift to my newlywed son and daughter in law they are just starting out and love games so this was a nice start to their collection
5 #### Yahtzee is just a classic family night game . Lots of fun and easy for kids to understand . Rolling the dice is fun and makes noise .
5 #### Got this for my 6 year old son who is really into inventions . He loves being able to make different things with this set .
5 #### We 've had a great time learning together about electronics . The manual was misprinted , but I contacted the manufacturer who had a copy on their web site and also mailed us a replacement . Overall great product at the price .
3 #### This is a great game for the kids in my classroom . The are 4 years old and love it . I wish the price was better though and that is the why the rating is 3 .
3 #### Although rated for ages 3 + My granddaughter has a hard time flipping the ants high enough to get into the pants bucket . Nevertheless , we do have fun with the game and we do modify it som we can spend some together time . With practice , she will get there .
5 #### When I was 12 years old , I went to my grandparents house every day after school to play Yahtzee . Great memories that am now making with my grandchildren . Great game .
4 #### Yahtzee is a great game to play with kids . It is a good way to teach math and thinking skills . Although rolling the dice is chance , figuring out how to use the numbers on the dice takes some thinking . It is a game that a fairly young child ( my grandson is six ) can learn fairly quickly . It is good for a mixed group because it is not a typical " children 's " game . Also moves quickly from person to person .
5 #### Was a wedding gift , yahtzee is a classic game and great addition to any home . Perfect couple game for those starting out .
5 #### Good to have the old stand bys in the house , never know when the power will go out and we have to play games to amuse ourselves or kids .
5 #### This item was just what I need at the time . It arrived in a timely fashion and was well packaged .
5 #### Ordered this for chistmas for the gandkids because they lost 2 of the dice from the old game , we had that one for years . We play Yahtzee at least once a week .
5 #### My son loved this . It was packaged nicley and it came on time . I would buy this again for a present .
5 #### i would wait for the price to be discounted as it 's hard to justify a high price for what this product is made of . However , kids love it and it works perfectly .
5 #### Very simple design and delivery . My son loved it , and so did all my nieces . Great toy for any kid , just make sure to buy it at a time when you can release the butterflies when they 're done with their metamorphosis .
5 #### I got this for my daughter who loves jewelry ! I used to play this same game and I could n't resist it ! She is still a little young to play the game but we play with the pieces together . A great buy ! So happy to have found it ! Thank you Amazon !
4 #### I wanted to find a Christmas gift for my son that was n't just another action figure and something that was educational . He is naturally curious and this was right up his alley . When he did the first task ( a buzzer ) and it worked , you should have seen his eyes light up . It gave him a great deal of confidence . I like that some are easy for him to figure out so that he does n't get frustrated , but also that some are more difficult and challenge him to think or recheck his connections if it does n't work .
1 #### We bought this as well as the Elenco electric sets thinking it would be the same . It 's cheap , the parts and wires are sharp and it 's not even worth the shipping . The Elenco sets are great !
5 #### Bought this item for my son . He really likes it . He has learned to alarm his bedroom door so he can keep his little brother out of his room . Great learning tool with everything going electronic these days . He is learning the basic skills of how thing work and are put together electronically .
5 #### Once you get the Butterflies it is amazing watching them . The Grandchildren loved it . Nothing better than giving them some responsibility to take care of a living creature .
5 #### Classic game , played as a kid , now I play it with my own kids . Very fun and addicting ! Highly recommended
5 #### I gave a 5 star rating because my family and I like to play this game . Its a fun game . I ordered online from Amazon its less stressful then going to Walmart and deal with insanity . I highly recommend this game for family fun .
5 #### This is good for 3 years and up . Great grand kids loved it .
1 #### This is a frustrating game as it is sold as a child 's game , yet adults can barely get it to play correctly . The shoddy plastic used is thin enough to make the jumping difficult and is vexing enough to make my children refuse to play .
4 #### Great game for the price . My kids between the ages of 2 - 4 could play this easily . Would hold their attention for about 10 minutes then would want to play something else . Does take a minute to set up but nothing too bad .
3 #### My young boys like the idea of this game , and enjoy it for the most part . But the bugs provided with the game do have a tendency to not " hop " very well . My son gets frustrated when a number of them in a row do not pop , or pop backward or to the side . At that point , it does not become an issue of aiming for that pants , so much as making the pieces work . But when they do work , this is a very enjoyable game that illicits a lot of giggles when the bugs going flying . I also appreciate the fact that it is simple in its process , which makes it a great game for kids just learning about games and rules . For the price and fun , I would recommend this game . Just warn those that have children that are prone to excessive frustration , as our experience did come with some difficulties .
5 #### My little 5 - year - old loves this , after he practiced a little and got the hang of it .
4 #### this is a very cute game and the girly - girls love it . only issue i take with it is : part of object of game is to accumulate jewels that are like in color . problem : colors are not made to look the same on matching jewels . once your little one figures this out they will probably love collecting points in jewlery .
5 #### My four year old loves this game and it is an excellent value ! First , you get to adorn a crown and mirrored jewelry box with jewels and then fill it with the supplied jewelry ! Then you play the game over and over ! This is a simply a must have for the little princess in your life !
3 #### We bought this for a boy ( age 10 1/2 ) . He found it interesting for a while , but grew tired of it quickly . If you have a child who is really into tinkering with electronics , etc . , then this might be a good choice . Otherwise , it might become boring too quickly . Once the user gets a feel for how each of the included circuits , resistors , etc . work , then there 's not much left . As a parent , I will add that the guidebook which comes with this kit is very informative . It provides a lot of easy - to - understand introductory information on circuits and similar topics . My son seemed interested while we did a few of the lessons and projects together during some " father / son " time . I think this type of information is good for developing brains , since it gives children a brand new topic to analyze and absorb ; it also gives them a basic understanding our our " electrical world " . In summary , I have mixed feelings . If you have a child who shows a liking or interest in this type of toy ( assembling , testing , doing small projects , taking apart his / her current electronics toys to see how they work , etc . ) , then this might be a good choice . But , I can not pound the table and say this is a " great " toy . It 's a " good " toy for the right child . If you think your child might be the " right " child , then I encourage you to give it a try !
3 #### We got this for Christmas , for my 8 year old son who is a budding electrician . He loves circuits and is familiar with Elenco products . He was so excited to get this , and pretty quickly figured out how to use it . It is definitely one of the most educational toys out there for engineer - wannabes , and the projects were fun . But I am sorry to say that it is very cheaply made . The base is a thick cardboard rather than plastic , so it easily tears . In fact , we ripped the battery flap almost immediately , even though we knew to be careful . Nothing a little strong tape could n't fix , but considering that this toy is supposed to be tinkered with , it really needs to be made stronger to last awhile .
4 #### I love the book that comes with it . I tried one of those mail order courses , and it nearly crushed my love of electronics . I did n't try and for a while . I decided to try it with smaller kits instead . This starts off like that course did , and I seem to remember something from it . This is far better though . I 'm nervous about trying to start soldering . This kit does n't include soldering ( that I know of anyway ) . The durability is horrible though . It should be on a sturdier frame , and a better battery holder .
5 #### my kids are ten , eight & seven . they have loved playing this game . they caught on fast & we have had so much fun playing .
3 #### I got this for my 5 year old daughter .. first I thought wow what a great deal then you have to go the website and pay another 5 $ for shipping of the caterpillars . Which takes over a week . When we finally got them they went into their cocoon in 2 days . Then once they come out of their cocoon they bleed all over the place . My daughter was too young for this but we will try again when she a bit older .
5 #### My boys loved this and so did I this was well worth the money .. Very educational so much fun watching these grow l
5 #### My daughter and I did this together . We watched them grow . We watched them fly away . I watched her ask me 30 miles away at her grandmother 's house if those were our butterflies as some identicals flew by one day . Of course this is awesome . Try it .
5 #### Such a great experiment to conduct with your kids ! I used these when I was a kid and bought one for my daughter ( will bring out in the spring time ) . Do not get this as a christmas gift unless you child understands that they can not use this until the spring ! You can get the butterflies sooner , but they will not last long as adults and letting them go outside during the winter unfortunately will be futile for the butterflies . These are so much fun !
5 #### Great gift for kids . I have bought several and every time they have been enjoyed . I have not had any problem with the caterpillars arriving dead or not changing to butterflies . You do have to send away for the caterpillars though , they do n't come in the original box .
3 #### This is not quite the toy I had as a child . The pieces either fall out or hardly fit in . Disappointing and frustrating for a child .
5 #### Loved this game growing up , playing it with my young children ( now adults ) and continue enjoying playing this game with family and friends . This is an excellent game for all ages even those who do not games ! Definitely a keeper ! ! !
5 #### Great item for Christmas gift . My kids will love it . Arrive just in time . Excelent to play with the family at the Holidays !
4 #### I 've been playing this since I was a kid . My parents used to make their own boards by drying up the boards using bic pens and lined paper . My aunts would play this on weekends sipping coffee and gossiping . It 's great fun to play it now as an adult .
2 #### It 's too hard for a child to get the ants into the pants !
5 #### Love this game and it 's great to be able to be interactive with the little ones and hear them giggle :)
5 #### Great game , bought it for my grandson but the whole family loves it ! !
4 #### A little let down by the pieces just falling out so easily but still fun . Seems durable but the pieces do n't stay in .
5 #### I 've bought this for different kids and they all have loved it . Its especially popular to raise them in the spring / summer and release them in the wild . Then every butterfly in the wild must be the one that they raised . One family orders these yearly for some family fun and even after 3 years it is still a pleasure to do . Educational and fun for kids ! A strong recommendation !
5 #### Yahtzee is a classic game for a reason . It is lots of fun , it is simple to play , the rules are easy to follow . In fact , all you need is five dice and the game sheets . The little cup and yellow counters are just ' dressing ' on the side . This game is played by shaking five dice and trying to get points in each roll . You get points by collecting five of the same kind of dice ( five fives for example ) , a full house , counting all the ones you earned etc . Each time it is your turn you get the opportunity to decide how you will work towards getting the most points possible . This game requires the ability to add , to think logically , to enjoy yourself . If you can roll the dice , get five of the same number you may find yourself shouting ' yahtzee ' ! Well worth the money . Enjoy .
5 #### I bought this as a time - killer for use in my RV . A classic dice game , with no unnecessary additions or silly new rules .
4 #### There are actually people out there who have n't played YAHTZEE ? In the USA ? It 's almost hard to believe because this is such a classic in my family . I think this is our third set . Eventually the game does get a little shabby and it is nice to have a new one . It 's pretty simple -- 5 regular dice , a cup to shake them up in , a pencil , and score pads . Score pads can be purchased separately . The idea is to get the highest score by filling in points on the scoresheet -- one box each turn -- in categories like Full House , Small Straight , Three of a Kind . Sounds like Poker or some other card game ? It is a lot like that . We 've been playing it since the kids were little and now they are well into adulthood . It can be educational if you take the time to talk to your kids about the odds of getting a particular set of dice and how to decide which dice to re - roll . Not a lecture , please -- just a comment now and then !
5 #### Yahtzee is a really fun dice game that everyone in the family can enjoy . While the game is based on chance and the roll of the dice , it takes brains to decide which category you want to fill in . Should I use the 3 ones , for the 1 category or the 3 of a kind . What is the probability that I will get a better 3 of a kind or more 1 's ? These are the decisions that you have to make when playing Yahtzee . As the game progresses you usually have to decide which boxes you will cross out and how many points will you take for your Chance score ? It 's a fun game and I think it can be educational as well .
3 #### It 's your classic Mr. Potatohead and fun for kids . It 's just kind of a cheap product . The plastic is flimsy and the pieces do n't fit together perfectly , or easily . My two year old loves it , and really tries , but he struggles get the pieces in .
1 #### I ordered this for my almost 2 year old because he is obsessed with the one at daycare with the glasses . But the one we got had no glasses ! I feel very mislead !
5 #### Really great / fun toy for my 2 year old . I have two complaints , 1- I mine did n't come with glasses like pictured and 2- his bottom ( where you store extra pieces ) keeps coming off . Other than that it 's a great toy .
5 #### This was a hit when I was a kid almost 40 years ago and it 's a hit today . My daughter loves it , I think it even contributed to helping her to learn some different body parts .
5 #### Includes everything but the butterflies which you send away for ( $ 5 shipping as stated in the description ) . We have used this for butterflies caught outside and even a large praying mantis . The " tent " velcros flat so does n't take up much room so I can hide it from the kids as I am sick of having bugs in the house all summer .
4 #### butterfly did n't come out for the longest time we had to buy another Cajun overall i recommend this item its a good buy for nature lovers .
5 #### I orginally gave this product one star because I was overcharged redeeming my $ 5 live certificate , but my refund did happen ( although a little slowly ) . I purchased this for my 4 year old grandson for his birthday . We received five hardy caterpillars that all lived ; we released five painted ladies two days ago . I will definitely purchase addition caterpillars in the spring as my grandson enjoyed the whole process and learned quite a bit about butterflys . This was enjoyable for 4 generations of my family .
5 #### Well built and easy to open and close the zipper and fold back up . Caterpillars arrived in good shape and seemed healthy . Climbed to the top and attached just like the instructions indicated . Hatched a few days later ! ! Lots of fun to watch and talk about with the kids . I was amazed how quickly the butterflies emerge !
4 #### I got this for a birthday party . The girl loved it . I heard it was an successful Butterfly farm .
5 #### Fun game , off my experience please only buy from axon directly .
5 #### It 's a fun game but the ants are very hard to get into the pants . My 3.5 year old ca n't do it .
5 #### My 6 year old son loves this game . It goes quick , even boring old mom can be talked into playing a time or 2 !
5 #### We Love this game . The grand kids enjoy it too .
5 #### We purchased this for our Grandson who is 4 years old and he loves it . Our 1 1/2 year old Grandson is able to play as well . Fun game for all of us .
5 #### This game came in a timely matter and was brand spanking new . Thanks to the seller !
5 #### A great stand by for a great toy . My 22 month old grandson should have fun with this toy . Building a face will be so much fun . It is a Christmas gift .
5 #### Had to have this for my granddaughter . It brought memories of my own childhood and she loves it ! Great for promoting motor skills , as well as learning the words : lips , hat , etc . Very happy with my choice .
5 #### What can a person say about Mr. Potato Head except do n't forget your Angry Eyes ! Sturdy plastic with parts interchangeable parts . Every child should have one .
5 #### First off , lets get this out of the way . Butterflies do not come with this kit , and for the people that left bad ratings because of this you need to relax . I know it 's hard these days to not get instant gratification for everything . I know life can be so hard driving your 2 kids to soccer practice in your Yukon while talking on your cell phone , but relax , it will be ok . This is a great gift for a kid . The butterflies come very fast if you order them online . Inside the box you will get a voucher for a free order of caterpillars , you just need to pay $ 5 shipping . So technically add $ 5 to this cost of the product . They come all ready and you get to watch the entire process . We just released them yesterday and my daughter loved everything about this . Highly recommended .
5 #### I bought this at the recommendation of a friend who said her neices LOVED it . And I 'm so glad I did . My girls , 3 and 5 , love playing the game . The younger one likes to put the jewelry on and then pick up the spinner to see her reflection on the mirror on the underside . It 's a simple game for them to follow and they can play on their own . It 's especially fun for them to play with Daddy to see him wearing the princess jewelry .
5 #### My four year old grandson loves this . Just the two of us play . We just see who gets in his color first -- four of each color . He is VERY picky about colors . He always takes the blue and green , so I 'm stuck with the red and yellow . This is one of the few things we do together that I do n't let him win -- he 's better at it ! The materials are cheap -- plastic ants and cardboard cut out-- but durable and providing a lot of fun for under $ 10 . We need things at Grandma 's to play with -- that he does n't have at home . This fit the bill .
4 #### This was one of my favorite games as a child so I bought this for my little cousin as a Christmas present . She has n't used it yet so I ca n't speak to whether it is too difficult for a 5 year old . I 'm really just hoping it can entertain her in the world of YouTube and video games . I did inspect it upon arrival and while the game was pretty cheaply made 20 years ago , it 's even more so now . I 'm hoping she does n't break the ants in half while playing . Cheap plastic and cutting corners have been the death of a lot of my childhood games , it seems .
5 #### " Yahtzee " remains one of the all time great family games . We have a lot of more complicated and newer games , but more often than not no one can agree on which game to play and we tend to default back to Yahtzee . The rules are not too compliacted and the game play moves fairly quickly , but still allows for talking around the table . Highly recommended !

5 #### If you have n't played Yahtzee before , where have you been ? ? I remember playing this while growing up and still love it to this day . It is a game that anyone can play and great for family and friends . I picked it up recently , because we had lost ours in a move and the kids kept asking for it again . We enjoy playing it on weekends or evenings instead of flipping through the channels on the TV . It 's also nice that there is no limit to how many people can play . A TRUE CLASSIC of a game that it a must for your collection .
5 #### I bought this toy for my daughter 's 3 year old birthday . She loves it and and all the silly parts . It could do with some additional parts so I may buy Mrs. Potato head . The glasses do not stay on the ears properly and some of the parts are a bit difficult to remove ( the ears and eyes sometime ) but the good thing is , once in i know it is secure . And when parts are not in use , they can store in his cavity ( the kids do n't like to see it there though , they love the mess )
5 #### Who does n't love Mr. Potato head ? He 's great for teaching body parts and just generally having a lot of fun making goofy faces . I love the creative opportunities this toy has , it 's so flexible as to where you can put eyes and ears and arms ; and of course the storage compartment in the back which holds everything when you 're done . I wish more toys where this well designed !
4 #### Fun toy if you can keep all the parts together . Ca nt go wrong for the price . My son outgrew it pretty quickly but liked it for a while for sure
5 #### Ok - Mr. Potato head brings back memories of my childhood . I do n't recall playing with him all that much as a child but its just one of those toys you have to have . My two year old daughter got quite a few potato heads & additional dress up pieces . We 've got a large container that we store them in and its been daily fun ! Some of the pieces are small ( earrings & buttons ) so we 've had to remove those from our section ... but she loves making him look different daily . It originally helped with learning the eyes nose mouth hands ... and then helped with her speech as well . I 'm actually kind of sad she can say potato now - its one word that she was completely stumped on for the longest time ... "table - low " -- a toy that brings back memories from my childhood and makes memories for my children ! A must have in every family ! ! ! Additional dress up pieces can be found for affordable prices !
4 #### Our only disappointment was that our caterpillars turned into cocoons overnight , and then they hatched overnight , so we missed both of the coolest observational moments ... the butterflies did n't stick around to land on anyone once released either , once they were out , they Zoooomed off ! That part disappointed my daughter a little since the brochure even said they have a tendency to stick around and land on you ... ;) We will be doing this again in a couple years though , it was still fun all the way around . :)
4 #### From watching the caterpillars eat , to watching them make their cocoons , and then hatching butterflies this was a lot of fun for the kids ( and me ! ) to watch !
5 #### My kids love doing this . I signed up for the catepillars online and received them in a short time . The kids love watching the catepillars grow in to butterflys . We set them free after 2 days . They were so pretty .
4 #### What can you say , the caterpillars turn Into butterflies . The kids can see the whole process and it works . Nature is cool .
5 #### We have had this game for 2 years now and my daughter still loves to play . Of course for her half the fun is getting her good natured Dad and/or Brother to participate so they will have to wear the jewelry and crown ! The game is simple enough for very young children to understand but they wo n't outgrow it too quickly . My daughter is 8 now and she and her friends still love the game . The black ring adds a little excitement to the game since you ca n't win while you have it and it is not to easy to get rid of . I like to play this game with my children because they have so much fun with it . They always think it is so funny when I have all the jewelry on with the crown and they always burst into giggles .
3 #### Very fun if you 're a battleship fan .. the other two modes and other skill levels is a nice touch . The only complaint I have is that the sound effects rather suck .
5 #### I have been playing Yahtzee since I was 6 , and I get as much enjoyment out of it now at age 37 as I did over 30 years ago . If you 've never played the game , you are in for a treat . Players role 5 dice and try to rack up points by rolling the most 1 's , 2 's , 3 's , 4 's , 5 's , 6 's , straights , full house , etc . And if you get 5 of one kind ? Yahtzee ! A big score ! Strategy plays a big role in this game , and it can easily be said that half the games I lose , I do so because of my mistakes . Yahtzee is a true family classic .
3 #### While I 'm not saying this is n't a fun game , it does n't have the staying power of word games or logic games . While it does take some skill to determine what item to go for when a roll goes bad , too much of the game is blind luck . It 's certainly helpful with math skills and I recommend it to younger kids that need a fun way to strengthen math skills , when it comes to pure gaming , this one leaves a bit to be desired .
5 #### We got this game for our nine year old son for Christmas . We only had to play it with him a few times before he and his seven year old brother got the hang of it . Now they can play without any help from us . It is also a great game because it is one their dad and I like to play with them . Our two and four year old can even get in on the action by teaming up with one of us and rolling the dice for us . It is a great family game .
5 #### My daughter loves this ! Had to order butterfly 's separate . Durable and easy to carry for young children . Would refer to a friend .
5 #### I purchased this for my nieces 5th birthday . She absolutely loved it ! I had this game growing up and although it has changed slightly it is still a wonderful game !
5 #### This is a fun game , but younger kids may get bored easily if they ca n't figure out how to make the ants jump . It is well made and sturdy .
5 #### I used to play this with my brother ! Now I use it with my 2nd grade class as a reward for good behavior .
5 #### THis game is so CUTE ! My daughter was hospitalized with Pneumonia the Day after Christmas , and she was more or less comfined to her bed ! One day she just really wanted her daddy to stay with her and play this game . And he did and he HAD to wear the crown which put a smile on her face ! She has been home for 2 days now and she even has her older brother playing it with her . We love this game ! Perfecet for little girls !
5 #### I received this wagon second hand , and I 'm glad I did n't spend the outrageous price charged for it . Yes , it 's relatively durable ( although ours literally fell apart under my 2 year old the other day . A nut holding the wagon together worked itself loose on our walk and the whole thing went to pieces . Replacing the nut fixed the problem ) , but it also tips easily . The handle is much too short . I 've had to tie a piece of rope to the handle so that I can reach it without bending over . It is a really rough ride , and my son never looks very comfortable in it . All in all , I think I 'll be passing it on and buying something else . Maybe I 'm just picky , but I 'd rather pay for quality , not the Radio Flyer name . * * * ETA * * * Please excuse the incorrect stars given to this product . I 'm not sure what happened . I meant to give it 1 star , not 5 .
4 #### Not what I was expecting , but the little ones like it .
5 #### Great fun , given as a gift . They loved it .
4 #### Our game went out and one we found was n't as fun and battery went out quick . We enjoy the little brain challenge .
4 #### The object of Hand - Held Battleship is to sink your opponents ( the computers ) 5 ships before it sink yours . Just like the board game battleship , you strategically position your 5 ships around the board and try to avoid hits from your opponent . You can position your ships manually or the computer will do this for you . When it is your turn , you mark the spot you wish to target and fire . If you miss , the word miss will appear on the screen . If you hit , there will be " an explosion " on your screen and the word hit will appear . There are three different games you can choose from . The batteries are included . Electronic Hand - Held Battleship is a great , compact game that you can take anywhere and can be played by the whole family .
4 #### This was a gift to an 8 year - old boy . He seemed to like it and it keeps him occupied . His parents are happy with it .
5 #### This is our second butterfly garden . It is a wonderful spring activity , as we watch the caterpillars get bigger and bigger . Then one day , they start making their cocoons , and then ... butterflies ! We let our butterflies go in our yard , but I know some people are able to bread more butterflies . The container that the butterflies live in is a nice , mesh area where you can watch the cocoons break open prior to letting the butterflies go free . However , it does get stained when they break out of the cocoons . I guess it 's reusable , but I have n't tried to clean it , as it looks kind of icky to me .
5 #### This was out second butterfly garden . It makes more sense to purchase additional gardens when Amazon has a good price , because the price for just the caterpillar is quite high . My kids and their friends LOVED watching the transformation and we were sad to see them go when it was time for them to fly away !
5 #### The Butterfly Garden was a fun , interesting project for my 6 - year - old stepdaughter who loves butterflies . Every day , the first thing she did was look to see if a butterfly had hatched . It was interesting for her ( and for all of us ) to see the metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly . When we set them free , she got to hold them gently , which she enjoyed . The Butterfly Garden is already put together , so there is no assembly involved . Do make sure to put it on some paper towels or old rags as the caterpillars tend to bleed ( and , I think , even spray a bit of blood ) when the butterflies emerge . You can put fresh flowers inside the Butterfly Garden for the butterflies to land on and eat nectar from . There is n't much room for flowers in there though . We got the smallest flower plantings for sale at Walmart that we could find and put them inside and that worked fine .
4 #### I used this in my classroom and it is a great way to display and manage the butterfly lifecycle . It is easy to clean and can be used year after year .
5 #### its a classic and the little ones love flipping the ants into the pants
3 #### This is a classic children 's game that brought back memories of when I played this at my grandparents . The cardboard dog body is a not very strong and kind of a pain to put in . It does n't store in the box fully assembled very well , so the dog is a little tattered . It 's a fun game that children should experience playing , especially since it 's less than $ 10 !
5 #### Excellent turn around time . Received this way before I expected to . A blast from the past .
2 #### We received the product as described , sent in the extra money for the caterpillars , etc . They showed up about 8 business days later which was disappointing , but nonetheless they were hopeful . We followed the instructions to the letter but 4 out of the 5 butterflies died which was heartbreaking for our daughter who received this as a birthday present .
5 #### We LOVE THIS ! I ordered caterpillars at the same time so I did n't have to wait for the " free " ones . Glad that I did , because the free ones ( which cost $ 5 to ship ) seem to take a while to ship . Great for the whole family to watch the process .
5 #### My grandson received this as a gift and we sent for the ' free ' caterpillars . There was an additional $ 5.00 fee for this part . The whole cycle for the caterpillars is very messy but fascinating . After they emerge they are super fun to watch . Just be aware that they will mate . That process takes hours so you will have some explaining to do . Our 6 year old got his education from this . Also , be aware that just as they are turning into the chrysalis , the head will fall off , intact . That scared this little one when he first saw it , but we were able to reassure . I just wish I had understood that would happen . The butterflies to fight at mating , too . One got a quarter of his lower wing torn off , but he is still able to fly so that helps . We had no idea how messy this whole project would be . They drip this red fluid all over the bottom of the garden . We put a paper towel in the bottom and it looks a lot like afterbirth at first and then you get these red dots all over until release . It is an interesting project and a great education . I just wish I had understood all the times that I would have to have explanations . It is a long process for a little one and you must be ready to explain each step of the way . It is a totally wonderful experience , though .
5 #### My grandson has been wanting this game , will be excited to see him play this !
3 #### They ants do n't jump as easily as the ones in my childhood game did . It has proven to be frustrating for my preschool aged kids . Also , the cardboard dog insert in the middle does not hold up very well . We do not bother putting him in anymore .
5 #### It is so nice to see such a simple game is so much fun to young children . My biggest problem was finding this to buy for my grandson ; did n't realize it would be so hard to find , could n't find it anywhere at Christmas time , ca n't believe I did n't think of Amazon first ! You saved the day , and made a little 3 year old very happy !
3 #### It is an okay product , we just need to fill out the card to mail and get the butterfly larva .
4 #### Have given one to a 5 and 6 year old boy and they get a lot of fun and education out of it watching the butterfly grow . You can get the larvae mail order or just do what we do and go outside and find a caterpiller . Kids like the outside adventure much better than the mail order approach .
5 #### I got this for my 4 year old daughter . She loved raising the butterflies . Be warned though , when they hatch they will look like they are bleeding to death but they are not . 4 of our 5 butterflies lasted a while and we released them . They wanted to stay . We were able to take lots of pictures of them climbing on my daughter . We will order mor larvae .
5 #### I gave a five star rating because is a fun game for children . I purchased this game for my 5 year old grandaughter and She loves it . I highly recommend this product .
4 #### Bought it for our 5 year old . Her older and younger cousins all like to play with it . It 's a silly game with no strategic objective , but it generates tons of giggles !
5 #### This is a simple , but very fun game for kids ! It keeps them entertained because of the " skill " it requires to actually flip the ants . Even older kids can get into this game !
5 #### Great teaching tool for kids . We were lucky enough to see the butterfly emerge 2 times . My kids loved watching the butterflies fly around .
3 #### My 7 year old begged me to order this after they did one in his class . So , when I saw the price on this drop , I was excited . Until it arrived , and I realized that I still had to order the actual caterpillars ....... for an additional $ 5 . The overall concept is great , and my kids are excited for the bugs to arrive , but as a parent , I felt a little misled . Perhaps I did n't read the product description well enough .. so next time I 'm in the market to buy bugs , I 'll make sure to do that .
3 #### it comes with a coupon so that you can get the larvae , however they do not ship to Canada . The was a present for our 6 year old grand daughter , but she could not use it without the larvae .
1 #### Very disappointed . I ordered catepillar larva via the website online and they NEVER came . I am going to begin to attempt to reach the company but I would n't waste my time on this if I were you as I 've read this has happened to several people .
4 #### put it together easily kids like it use it around for gardening
5 #### My grandson absolutely loves this game ! Of course he makes up his own rules , but we have had a lot of laughs playing with this ! For the money , it 's great entertainment !
3 #### It was partly made of cardboard .... so disappointing . Wo n't last long with a 4 year old . I would rather pay a few more dollars for a game that will last a little longer .
5 #### Our caterpillars arrived very fast ..... (too fast .... we still had unhatched praying mantis eggs in out butterfly habitat ! ) . My daughters loved watching the caterpillars grow and become chrysalis . After the butterflies hatched , we fed them slices of orange , and we put a potted plant into the habitat to get some eggs . After three days there were easily 70 or 80 eggs . We released the butterflies and started the whole process again ! This has been a great life cycle example for my daughters , and we were flabbergasted over how many leaves a caterpillar could eat in a day ! This was well worth the initial investment . If you have access to a microscope , get a butterfly egg on a slide and watch it change each day . It is amazingly beautiful ! ( ours hatched one afternoon and we found the new caterpillar exploring the top of the microscope . )
5 #### I bought four for my grandkids , one per family . They thought they were great . All of them successful got butterflies .
5 #### I got this for my Grandson 's 1st birthday . He loves being pulled around in it .
5 #### What you have here is one fine game . Classic , traditional , great for all ages . Know a bunch of words ? Short ones ? Long ones ? Skinny ones ? Know any big fat words you just ca n't use anywhere else ? Use them here . Show off how big your vocabulary is , and that you know how to use it . Of course , there are rules about which ones count , but mostly , regular words are OK . Just nothing with capitals or foreign words , unless of course , you are from somewhere else , but then , they are n't foreign any longer , are they ? Order up a serving of Scrabble . Figure out if you need this version or the deluxe version ( which is mighty cool . ) If you are new to Scrabble , this is the version to start with . When you get the game in the mail , call up some friends , turn on some tunes , crack open something tasty and cold , and start munching a few chips . This ai n't a game you got ta be smart to play . I 've seen guys who only know small words , but they could see the best ways to use them . Vocabs do n't win the game . Thinking on your feet will win the game . I fully recommend Scrabble .

5 #### Inevitably someone thinks they have created a new word in the English language . To prevent people from getting a bit pushy , you might want to invest in a dictionary or you can have fun and let things slide . There are some people who will stop at nothing to create words , and that is what makes this game so fun . You will also learn words you never thought of in your life , or teach others a word or two . This is fun for all ages . ~The Rebecca Review
4 #### Ants in the Pants memory from long ago - like playing tidley winks or more current " quarters " without the beer . Bought this for a blind friend who was aggravated by kitchen ants this summer - so the running banter between us was the Ants were ruling his roost . His 77th birthday had me giving him more amusing ants - so Ants in the Pants game was just the ticket to make us laugh . Walter 's grandaughter Sophia ( 6yrs old ) is the one who scooped up the game to take home with her at party 's end . So , the Ants in Pants game rocks All ages!!<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Ants - in - the - Pants - Games / dp / B00000IWDQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Ants in the Pants Games</a >
5 #### The game helps with fine motor skills . I often have difficulty getting the ants in the pants when my two year old and I play . She does n't even try . She likes aiming for me , but that 's ok . She loves it and laughs so hard .
4 #### I picked this game up at a store because it was on sale . Got home and read reviews ... almost returned it . Glad I did n't because it actually works very well for my kids . My daughter ( 4 ) and son ( 2 1/2 ) both love it and can always make a " basket " within about 4 tries . My kids were actually better at it than my husband and myself ! Granted , we have to center the doggy for them so they 're lined up to flip the ants , but I do n't mind that . Definitely was n't too difficult for them .
3 #### I rated this game for my 4.5 years old son . He feels this is a very boring game except that he finds it not difficult to jump the ants to the pant . We bought this game , he played it once , then it is put aside .
5 #### This is a fun family game & fun for the little ones to be able to play along w / too =) ! !
5 #### We bought this for a fall thrmed photo shoot . Our 15 month old absolutely loves this wagon . It took about 20 min for my husband and I to put it together . Very sturdy and looks great . The sides are easy to remove and our daughter has lots of fun pushing and pulling it around .
5 #### Who does n't like Scrabble ? This is the original game . Nicely made .
3 #### I purchased this for my home daycare to play with . We opened it today and tried it out for awhile . I had 2 & 3yr olds and 9 yr olds playing with it . All of the kids had fun but the beans seemed to spill very easily , making for a fast game . I think the concept is great and the kids were quick to learn where to put the beans to make it lean back the other way . But I wish it took longer to spill so they 'd have more of a chance to stack up those beans and problem solve . I 'm hoping with time they 'll get better at it so the fun level increases . We 've only had it a day so I ca n't really rate the durability . I do n't think it 'll take a beating , but if we 're careful it should last a long time .
2 #### i was really disappointed in this product . my daughter wanted it for a science project . the caterpillars arrived a week late . there were 6 of them.\ , only one survived to become a butterfly . there was not enough food for all of them to survive . it was not a pretty site .
5 #### We 've used this every summer since I first ordered it . My kids LOVE it . The catapillars all hatched and grew great . After that we would catch some just around home , feed them then the kids have so much fun releasing the new butterflies in our garden . Word of advice . If you have Monarch catapillers ( Which my son brought me 6 last summer ) Keep the Milkweed plant in a ziploc bag in the fridge , then give them a fresh leaf each day . They eat more and it lasts a LOT longer after being picked . Beautiful butterflies ! :)
5 #### Great Bday gift for our grandson . Some assembly required , but pretty easy ! A memory maker for sure ! !
5 #### nice sturdy wagon , just like the original . wheels are nice and heavy duty
5 #### Wagon arrived on time and assembly was very easy , great buy , I am 73 and a kid at heart .
5 #### Our 3 year old has really enjoyed this ! The larva came 2 weeks after we placed our order with the coupon . It was easy to order via the insectlore website . We have had success with 4 of the 5 larva that were sent . We will do this again !
2 #### It arrived scratched and broken ... Had to return product and buy new from Target
5 #### love this game already wore out the game board and cards - bought this replacement - good card game-
5 #### 2nd year in a row my 9 yr old and I have done this . Catapillars arrived in 3 days after ordering . They have already started the metamorphus phase . This is such a wonderful inexpensive kit to do with your kids . We love setting our free and make a big celebration out of it !
5 #### We are 100 % satisfied with the purchase . No issues and works exactly ask we envisioned . Highly recommend ! !
5 #### Just like when I was a kid , went together easy and was a huge hit with the kid . Nothing to complain about
5 #### I used this same wagon 42 yrs . ago to pull my 2 boys around the block . My 42 yr . old wagon is still being used by me to bring things in from my car . My grandson LOVES the new one I gave him for his 1st Bday . I was missing the " cotterpin " when the wagon came and the Radio Flyer Company immediately sent one overnight to me . The rep I spoke to was VERY NICE and HELPFUL . There are so many " new " Radio Flyer items . WONDERFUL company ! !
5 #### I ca n't believe all the complaining about this product not coming with the caterpillars . Do people expect that live creatures would be able to live in boxes for months on end ? Your kids may have to wait a few days for the caterpillars to arrive , but patience is a good virtue to teach , is n't it ? Plus you get the first batch free . My girls and I have loved the process of watching this process , and I 've enjoyed teaching them about the life cycle of butterflies . It 's a great gift to give anyone .
5 #### a cousin of mine had done this kit , and so I did it with my daughter . its simple and fun , and sheloved it ! the only thing I was a little unhappy with was the hidden fee . I ve already paid for thisproduct and you can either go online or pay by mail to get the caterpillars . granted they give you a voucher so insteadof paying 14.99 for the caterpillars ( what a refill would cost after your one time voucher ) you only pay the shipping of five dollars . still they should really inform customers of that , had I given it as a birthday gift I think a child would be upset that theyhad to wait and pay for the actual caterpillars .
5 #### We love to do this project every spring , we just order new insects each spring and use the same net . The kids love it !
3 #### I ordered The Insect Lore Butterfly Garden for my daughter 's classroom . Included in the garden comes a certificate to redeem the live caterpillars . Everything arrived as expected EXCEPT when I went online to redeem the certificate I was charged an additional $ 5.00 shipping charge . There was no mention of any additional charges when I placed my order . No happy !
5 #### This is a cool product . Nice little cage for bugs . We ordered the butterflies and it worked perfectly . Nice learning tool for children and parents . We have everything from ladybugs to snakes in this .
4 #### I got this for my four - year - old daughter and it was a fun project for both of us . She had a great time watching the life cycle of the butterfly and taking care of her " pet " butterflies after they emerged . Be warned , though : a few of the butterflies might have wing defects or not survive . I believe this is just a normal thing that happens sometimes in nature , but it 's something you may want to be prepared to discuss with your kids . Overall , this was a great product and I 'm glad we made the purchase !
5 #### This was a great project for my daughter . The sad part is it takes a while for the butterfly 's to arrive , so I recommend buying this a few weeks before you actually need this . This will give you time to order the butterfly larval and have them shipped to you .
5 #### I got it on time and as expected . I am happy with the purchase .
5 #### A classic ! ! The kids ( and I ) love this game . I remember playing it as a child . We add a quarter to the bottom of the pot ( a tip I read somewhere ) so it does n't tip too soon .
5 #### Great product , was as described . Will recommend to my family and friends !
5 #### Radio Flyer wagon is a tough rugged wagon that last generation to generation . I have bough all my kids Radio Flyers and there kids are using them now . This wagon is for my use to take chairs to the beach . Highly recommend the seller and the product .
5 #### Great product . The shipping takes a while to get the catapillars , but they were 5 and all healthy and doing well when they arrived . It has been an amazing experience watching their life cycle .
4 #### Purchase for our daughter . She loved watching the larvae grow and truly enjoyed giving the butterflies their freedom when the weather was right . Memorable for all . Fair price : value ratio .
5 #### Bought several of these butterfly gardens for my grandchildren . They loved watching the larvae develop and finally become butterflies . The only problem is refill larvae are very expensive . Too bad . The children ( and adults ) would love to repeat the process each year if it were not so expensive .
5 #### Quick delivery , forgot how much fun this game is . Better than playing it online !
5 #### You can choose when you want to start your butterfly garden , and then it all unfolds as told . Watching the caterpillars feed , grow , and develop into beautiful butterflies was a great experience for kids and adults alike . Refills would be a good idea .
4 #### This kit worked as expected and my kids got a good lesson from it . We lost one of the butterflies though
4 #### Good game for beginning game - players . As mentioned in other reviews , it is not the sturdiest game set , but for the price I believe it definitely is worth it . My three year old likes to use this set to play in various ways . In addition to playing the traditional route ( placing beans on the top until it tips ) he also likes to remove the top of the pot and use the set for counting out beans and placing inside , as well as " basketball " ( throwing the beans inside the open pot , which adds some excitement since it sways as the beans make it in ) . One suggestion for improvement would be to provide the beans in a resealable plastic bag . This would help ensure the beans do n't escape the flimsy box when storing . But if you have a ziploc bag handy when you first open the game , that could be prevented .
2 #### The game does n't really set up properly . Then pieces do n't nestle right so the pot sits oddly and makes the game less fun .
5 #### A great way to introduce kids to nature and the process of larve to butterfly ! It is incredible to watch and kids are amazed . It is a bit sad when you have to let them go but you can always purchase more ! Not very hard and not to messy for in the house . A great project for families !
4 #### We love butterflies and we did n't send away for them yet because we think it would be too cold here in NY . we are looking forward for the spring to do this project !
5 #### I bought Monopoly Deluxe to replace my old set ; it was so old , it only had the 8 tokens ( no battleship or cannon ) . I never knew those were part of the current sets ! Looking at Monopoly.com I discovered the new moneybag token and saw the locomotive which is exclusive to this Deluxe set . The tokens are a beautiful gold tone , the carousel is clever for holding the deeds and you get twice the amount of money of the original set . Community Chest and Chance cards are redesigned and in full color . Rules are nicely written . I had to contact Hasbro concerning the wooden houses ; I had to replace them due to some defects and deformities for a very small fee , but Hasbro made the transaction painless and enjoyable . I agree with some reviewers concerning the way the board is built to fold away ; a strong - handed person like myself has to be extremely careful when handling it , lest it becomes torn . The box should have been made sufficient length to make the board fold out the regular way . The board in the Deluxe Edition allows you to only lay it out on a flat , hard surface . These are only minor complaints , the game is great , and made me a bigger fan than before . The tokens , money and design of the Deluxe Edition has enough wonderful nuances to make most Monopoly fans happy .
5 #### . . .by which all other board games are measured . I 've been a fan of " Monopoly " since I was about 5 . I personally have worn out three sets of the game . ( My deluxe edition got quite a workout in college , when guys would set up a card table in the elevator , and ride up and down and up and down half the night while playing the game . But I digress . . . ) While I 'm not particularly a fan of some of the various permutations of the game ( ie Star Wars Monopoly , Baseball Monopoly , Pokemon Monopoly , etc ) the original game itself is loads of fun . This edition is especially nice . The " retro " look of the houses and hotels , and the ability to keep the game " neat " while playing is an added bonus . I just gave my worn - out set to my kids . Time to get a new one for myself .
3 #### Pieces in this game are certainly not made like they used to be . The pot is n't sturdy and it does n't take long before it tips . I know that 's the object of the game but it is very off balance . More frustrating than fun . The kid likes to watch it spill so I give it a B for entertainment of the little one .
4 #### My 5 and 6 year old Nephews loves this game .
5 #### This Scrabble Game is a Christmas gift for my daughter and her family . It was delivered in a very prompt manner , was packaged well and appears to be in excellent shape . The box I received does not have the same design as that pictured , but appears to be the same game , as advertised .
3 #### I 'm usually only good for about half a game of Scrabble . You really need to play with people with about the same vocabulary as you to have any fun . Otherwise you are blowing away or getting blown away by your opponent which is no fun . You do n't want to feel like you 've won or lost the game after the first few rounds and just going through the motions for the rest of the game . If I 'm playing a classic word game I 'm playing Boggle .
5 #### The best word game for us . Play level starts around 2nd grade , with adult mentors . It 's considered a " classic " which means not being produced in original form . This is a shame . The smaller versions are hard to use for family fun . If you can , find a " recycled " one in good condition , like this one , and enjoy .
5 #### Great quality pegs and board . Love the colors and shapes of these . Both my 15 month old and 4 1/2 year old like to build with these . We also use these to count , add , and subtract with . Price ca n't be beat on Amazon !
5 #### My kids love these . It 's nice that it comes with strings and a board . Everything was great quality . I bought a couple packs and these kept my kids busy for awhile .
4 #### Great pegs , but I do n't like that the actual board is flexible foam . For children who can sit and play quietly it would be ok but I have a feeling mine is going to be chewed on and in pieces soon .
4 #### These were a good value compared to other similar sets . I bought them for my daughter 's 2nd birthday to practice sorting , counting and colors . The orange and red are not very distinct , so it took a little while for her to see the difference , but otherwise they work well for stacking , sorting , etc . As far as lacing , they 're pretty useless . The included strings are pretty short , the pegs can only be laced from the skinny end , and once on the string they tend to interlock on their own , making it a little frustrating for my toddler 's necklace - making ambitions . Buy a different set for lacing practice , and use these for counting , stacking and sorting . ( Oh , and it took my toddler about 7 seconds to figure out she could use these as whistles , so be warned ! )
5 #### Durable . I had one when I was child and bought this for my child . The quality has n't gone down over the years .
3 #### Not great for outside living , if doing that get a all metal one .
5 #### This butterfly garden saw so much use over the years for all manner of critters , not just butterflies . It finally dry - rotted from so much time outside but we sure did get our money 's worth out of it !
5 #### Great family activity . Our caterpillars arrived quickly and all of them hatched into butterflies . Was very cool to watch ! The net cleans easily after the butterflies hatch . We will be ordering more caterpillars next year !
5 #### We are so excited to order our butterflies and watch them grow . I love presents that highlight nature . Thank you Santa .
5 #### This is a very good toy and learning tool for children . Very pleased to have purchased this item and I have no regrets . I would recommend this to anyone .
5 #### My daughter loves butterflies ... all bugs really .. so this should be a fun experiment .. she wanted one when they were at Costco .. but they do n't carry summer things during the winter .. so I was very happy to find Amazon had it .. thank you so much , I do n't think we can order the butterflies until spring , but she is very happy to have this .. fast shipping , great packaging ! Thanks . ! v
4 #### Lots of fun and great for a 15 month old . My little one loves to put pegs in the hole or on top of one another . Great for developmental skills .
2 #### Ok game , but I ask myself why would I want a game that comes with tiny plastic beans ? A poor choice if little pieces drive you nuts .
5 #### This is a fun game , the whole family can play at the kitchen table . My kids are 3 and 6 . Does n't take a lot of skill !
5 #### We LOVE this game ! ! My 2 and 5 year old play it with me . My 2 year old could play it for a good 20 minutes before he 's over it . My 5 year old gets the concept so usually wins and moves on to more interactive toys . But this is a must for game nights with little ones ! They scream and laugh so hard when it tips ! !
1 #### The bean pot does not sit straight making the game useless since it is already tilted to one side . I have tried to get it to stay straight , but nothing works .
5 #### Simple game to play . Kids love it . I find it a bit boring .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for my daughter 's upcoming birthday . She asked for bored games this year and since she will only be turning 6 , I wanted to find games that are not too complicated and are fun . I had this game when I was a child and I loved it , so I am sure that she will too .
5 #### Had this game as a child , enjoyed it so much I brought for grand kids .
5 #### This is a very good quality wagon . Sturdy and easy to put together . Everything you would expect from this great company .
5 #### This classic board game comes now in different formats , but the old board game still is very much fun to play ( we mostly use it in front of the fireplace in the winter ) .
5 #### This is the perfect gift for that 18 month old that loves plugging and unplugging outlets and sticking things inside of anything . A perfect outlet and redirection for mine , so she can get that need to explore out in a safe and constructive manner . Bonus ? Her 4.5 year old sister absolutely loves it , too , and they 've spent quite a bit of time quietly playing TOGETHER with it . :D I love it so much I 'm thinking about a second set for even more pegging fun .
4 #### A nice set - lots of pieces plus laces . A 1.5 year - old plays it well ( lacing is for later . ) Stacking stability is in expected range . I prefer a little softer material / feel for pieces like other brand but just that 's a minor thing .
5 #### My 14 month old loves it ! He has learned to stack the pieces together and I think he will also enjoy threading the pieces when he gets a bit older . I also like that the pieces are quite large . Easier to work with his little hands . I do have to keep an eye on him though , the pieces could potentially get lodged in the throat if he decided to eat them ( which happens all the time ! ) .
5 #### received the butterfly garden kit on time and gave as a Christmas gift to some family kids . They are a big hit and are looking forward to receiving the larvae to watch their butterflies hatch !
5 #### bought this for our 6yr old daughter and she loves it ! just ordered the larve ( $ 5 shipping ) so ca nt say much about it but the idea is fun enough lol
5 #### Great fun . My kiddos loved checking on them daily . And it 's easy to do . When the butterfly 's arrived they were beautiful . Also they did not fly away right away , got some great pictures of the butterfly 's on my kiddos fingers before they flew away . Super fun project . We kept net to order again next time .
2 #### I probably would n't buy this again The quality of the plastic is n't great and I do n't think it will last long
2 #### Game works pretty good but I would not consider this in good condition , it is missing beans and the stickers are all worn off , I would not call this good condition I would say fair or poor . The plastic does not support properly .
5 #### I love my Radio - flyer wagon . It is sturdy and easy to use . I can take the sides off easily for my use . Then I can use this for my gardening , especially in the spring when there are bags of mulch and soil and pots to move . Then when my grandchild comes , I clean it up and use it to pull her around the block . She loves it too ! I would recommend this product to anyone .
5 #### Who does nt like scrabble ? ? We have game night and play this very often . Kids learn spelling also Would recommend it to all
5 #### I am a word nerd , so I love this game ! Great for the entire family and lots of fun ! Could play everyday !
3 #### This was a gift for someone . Everything inside was fine , but the Scrabble box had a medium sized tear in it .
5 #### We had a fantastic experience with this butterfly garden . The kids enjoyed watching the transformation and ultimately letting the butterflies go in our yard . We are looking forward to purchasing more caterpillars and doing it again .
4 #### Ca n't really say too much about it . I have n't even opened the box and now you are asking for a rating . I will let you know in the spring when we use it .
4 #### We were very dissapointed to receive this only to realize we live in the one state they will not ship caterpillars to . The website says they will not ship to Alaska , but the actual product says they will . However , you can not order caterpillars in Hawaii :-( We ended up using it as a gift for some friends in the continental United States .
5 #### Was very pleased with this item . Order the larvae and they got here in a jippy . My children enjoyed watching them thru every change and movement the butterflies made . The best part was letting them go . My kids were excited and filled with joy . Will be purchasing this again ! ! :)
5 #### this has been an activity we 've done the last coupld of years and my boys love it every time ! It 's a great , original gift too !
5 #### Perfect for toddlers learning colors and stacking ... definitely a nice quiet activity .
4 #### Our 2 1/2 year old loves this ! She really likes the string with it also . Good for fine motor skills ! Perfect size pegs .
5 #### My daughter 's OT recommended this toy to develop motorskills and it has been great . I would recommend it to my friends .
4 #### I bought this for my toddler twins to help them with their fine motor skills and it is definitely worth it . We are starting to work on colors and even though they do n't know the names to the different colors , they have learned to put all of the pegs of the same color together . They like stacking them as high as possible . The other side has some shapes drawn out but I do n't really see a use for it since there are n't enough pegs and holes to actually really make the shapes with the pegs . I 'm not sure if anybody can understand this . Either way , the pegs are nice and big but not too big . The not - so - good thing is that some of the pegs do n't fit well together . Some pegs can barely be put together while other ones fall apart right away . It also does n't hold my boys ' attention for very long , 10 minutes at the most , but they do pull it out quite often . I would recommend this peg game to anybody that has a child with busy little hands .
5 #### I purchased this toy a few months ago to add to my homeschool rotation for the little ones and it 's been a great investment . It 's a simple toy , but it has multiple uses . Putting the pegs into the mat , stacking them , and lacing them are all great activities for working on fine motor skills . You can also use the pegs for teaching counting , sorting , colors , and shapes . With older children you could also use them for some math concepts such as early addition or comparison . ( If you have three red pegs and two green pegs , how many are there all together ? Which stack of pegs is highest ? Which is shortest ? How could we make them the same ? ) The board itself is made from a thick rubber foam . If you have one of those foam puzzle floor mats , it 's the same type of material . The pegs are a heavy plastic and large enough that I 'm not overly concerned about them being swallowed . One side of the board is blank . The other side has six shape outlines that each hold a different number of pegs -- great for introducing shapes and counting . The box also includes a short pamphlet with some other ideas of learning activities you can do with the set . My kids have really enjoyed this and I 'd highly recommend it .
5 #### This game is so much fun ! The spin on this word game is that you can build the tiles up to create new words . It makes you think and touch your creativity . In my opinion , it is simpler and more fun than the original Scrabble .
5 #### I have been enjoying Monoply for nearly 70 years . Our set has been played with for many years and the battles over who will win it all;have taken a toll on the board , some pieces have been lost , the cards are pretty beaten up , and the money --- well , it has seen much better days . So I got this Delux set;and I could n't be more pleased . It is excellent in all respects . There are a lot of Reviews already written . By far , most rate it as excellent , though a few not so . I was going to write a detailed review on the board , the cards , the pieces , houses and hotels , the money , and the packageing and the trays to hold everything , both for storage as well as helpful during playing . However , this has already been done in great detail by D.M.Paul on December 14,2005 . I agree with everything that is detailed in this review . So , the most helpful Review that I can write is to read that Review , forget about the poor rated Reviews;and choose this Delux Set whether you are purchasing your first set , replacing your older beat up set , or thinking of giving a set as a gift;you'll be making the right decision .
5 #### This is a great game . The new box is nice because it 's smaller , so it takes up less space . There 's a nice money - holder , and little places for pieces and hotels , and even enough room for all of your old pieces and hotels ( 2 other boards worth ) . Places to store property cards and everything . The comm . chest kind of cards are a little flimsier , but that 's why you use the old ones you have until they wear out . Games are n't supposed to last forever . If you want something that will , do n't expect to pay 18 bucks . A haircut costs more than that , and it only lasts a week . Enjoy what it is .
3 #### Cute did not keep my 4 year old interest past one use not a repeat toy . Had to put coins in the pot to keep it leveled long enough to pile on beans .
2 #### Not the game I had as a child , very cheaply made :(
5 #### A good price for a scrabble player . I was happy with the price and it arrived in good conditon and quicky
5 #### My niece and nephews ( and every kid I know who has one ) loved this little butterfly garden . It helps to bring science to everyday life and it is fun to be apart of such a neat project .
5 #### We have 2 because we hatch butterflies and praying mantis every year and they need their own space since one will eat the other . I have purchased this as a gift for a friends son who wanted to hatch his own butterflies and praying mantis as well . We love them .
3 #### A little unbalanced , seems to tilt to one side even though I have tried to adjust it to stay even , but the kids love it . They like getting all the beans ..
3 #### This is a fun game , but is cheaply made . Not how I remember it as a child , but I like that it teaches counting .
4 #### The game was so much fun to play . We enjoy bringing this game out during game night . Everyone should have it .
5 #### My 3 year old loved this ! He was so excited to feed the butterflies watermelon and release the butterflies . We will definitely order more butterflies next spring !
5 #### Expect to pay an additional $ 5 for caterpillars and up to week at least 2 weeks to get them . Totally worth the extra cost and wait . So much fun and so interesting .
4 #### I really enjoyed Upwords once I got used to the differences from Scrabble . I think it will be a good game for the kids when they get a little older , too . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because I wish the board was a little bigger . Also , there was no cloth bag to hold the letter tiles , so you really do have to make sure they 're all face - down in the lid while you play .
5 #### I shopped extensively and Amazon had the best price . The wagon had to be assembled which was easy to do . The husband did n't swear and actually commented on the quality of the hardwoods and flush mounted screws . I thought I would use additional water sealant but the wagon is nicely finished . Oh , one other thing a standard baby bassinet mattress fits beautifully for some padding . The handle is longer than a generation ago , my 6'1 " husband is comfortable pulling the wagon .
5 #### I bought this game because I remembered how much fun it was as a child . What I did n't realized is that it is a great game for adults to play with children of different levels . My husband and I play like Scrabble , looking for long words . My stepdaughter ( 13yo ) looks for tricky ways to create 2 words at once ( she once made 3 new words by putting a new word between two other words - talk about points ! ) . My stepson ( 12 ) has a limited spelling skills ( underachiever ) but by changing the words he can really rack up the points and keep up with the rest of us . It 's helping us teach him more too . Great game !
1 #### I had expected a game even better than Scrabble , but Upwords is not ! Games fizzle out in no time due to the small board and dullness of having to change words instead of create new ones . Unlike Scrabble , there is no real vocabulary challenge . I do n't recommend this one at all .
5 #### I forgot how fun this game can be ! My son and I play all the time , and it is a great way for him to expand his vocabulary . ( He is an 8th grader ) .
5 #### Good to have the old stand bys in the house , never know when the power will go out and we have to play games to amuse ourselves or kids .
5 #### I was concerned my son who was 7 years old at the time ( now 9 ) would either not be interested or have a tantrum and fling it across the floor ( he 's Aspergers ) . How wrong I was . He checked his little garden everyday and when they crystallized he was jumping in glee . He asked tons of questions and just wanted to learn everything about butterflies . I was beside myself that he actually showed such interest and caring for his project . One morning when we woke up the butterflies awaited us . We went to our garden soon after and released them . They were in our garden the entire summer and he named them all .
5 #### My grandkids love this ( ages 5 & 7 ) , but even the little one ( 18 months ) watches the " babys " to see what they are doing . Easy to use , does n't take up a lot of space ( you can hang it ) and the kids love watching and waiting for the butterflys to emerge . Educational , fun , teaches patience , many object lessons . Overall a wonderful product .
2 #### Very Poor quality product . Nothing like the original ventage game . DON'T buy this game ! ! ! ! We had to put weights on one side to balance it so the kids could play with it . After playing with it one time , they were frustrated that it was so much work to make the balance so they could even begin .
2 #### cheap made and did n't balance correctly , no matter what we did to try to get it to work . Funny little plastic " beans " were hard to handle and did n't seem to make much difference when you added them to the pot . It might tump over after 1 bean or not tump over at all if they all were added . Tried to play it once , doubt it ever leaves the box again unless the grand uses it for something else .
5 #### Fun game ! ! ! Hit at our house and for all family get togethers ! !
5 #### For most of us , life feels like a movie we 've arrived at forty - five minutes late . Something important seems to be going on . . . maybe . I mean , good things do happen , sometimes beautiful things . You meet someone , fall in love . You find that work that is yours alone to fulfill . But tragic things happen too . You fall out of love , or perhaps the other person falls out of love with you . Work begins to feel like a punishment . Everything starts to feel like an endless routine . Life happens . But . It does not happen to you ! You happen to it ! We r not victims ! For everything that happens in life there is a decision I can make that will make the outcome manageable . Poor decisions : sad consequences . Good decisions : Happy Consequences . ; ~PB
4 #### We love scrabble . it has provided us with great family fun since this item was purchased from Amazon . Love it !
5 #### This is super easy to use , durable , comes with a great booklet all about Painted Lady Butterflies , you can easily hang it ... it 's just very awesome . I really ca n't imagine anything you can buy your child that would be more memorable . We received our butterflies fairly quickly . They were tiny caterpillars at first , they quickly grew , and then formed cocoons . We ended up with 8 butterflies . The whole experience was simply amazing ! I ca n't recommend it highly enough .
5 #### This is a great product . My boys loved watching the process . Everything goes perfectly if you follow the directions . I was worried the catapillars were dead on arrival , but they perked up later in the day . My only warning is that when the butterflies hatch out a reddish goo comes out with them & that reddish goo will go through the bottom or sides of the habitat onto your table . We originally had it on my dinning room table , but moved it when they were ready to hatch ( thank goodness ) The directions do warn you not to worry about the goo , but do n't warn you it will soak through . Do n't set the habitat on anything nice in your home . That is the only minor negative . It 's a great project for small children & there are so many kids books out on butterfiles to make it even more fun .
5 #### For now she loves all the pieces separately , but has not figured out how to play :D
5 #### Nicely crafted simple wooden shape sorter . Sturdy with smooth finish . Removable top is a plus . Would recommend .
5 #### Smaller than expected but we love it . Very nicely made and looks great in the house . It has a square , circle and triangle so it 's very simple . Top comes off and fits perfectly back in place and every shape fits inside . The handles make it easy to carry around as well .
5 #### The toddler likes it . The little handles are perfect for little hands .
5 #### Scrabble is one of the few games that has withstood the test of time . This version is fantastic , comes at a great price and is used on a weekly basis . This is one of the best games available to keep your mind active , especially as you get older . It 's highly recommended .
1 #### The butterfly net was fine . But , it would of been better if we actually could get the butterflies ! The Insect Lore company is TERRIBLE with customer service ... absolutely horrible . I tried 5 times -- no joke!--to get the free caterpillars per the coupon that came in the butterly net package . And 5 times was told to leave a message for customer service -- no one ever called me back . And , 5 times was disappointed and left frustrated and angry that I could n't get anyone to filful my order . I originally ordered the caterpillars online but for some reason my order did n't go through right . So , I got a letter in the mail saying to call or mail in payment again . I wanted to call thinking it would be easiest that way and 5 times got nothing . My daughter was sad over this because she so badly wanted it . Oh , and at the final attempt , I asked the person on the phone who could n't help me AGAIN and advised that I leave ANOTHER message for customer service that Insect Lore did a big promotional campaign and because of that could n't handle all the calls coming in for ordering -- three words for Insert Lore : Not My Problem . If you say you sell something then sell it and treat your customers right because now , they lost me as a customer forever . So , buyer beware ... if you want those free caterpillars get ready for headaches . I finally gave up and returned the net .
5 #### My brother and I had this game when we were little and we really enjoyed it . So I thought my son would enjoy it too . He did ! He has fun with this game and others like these games .
5 #### Do n't spill the beans -- love that saying . Gave as gift . They loved it .
3 #### Sadly my package came squashed but hey ... it does n't keep us from playing the game ! !
2 #### The item arrived right on time , but it was n't clear to me that you have to order the caterpillars separately AND you have to pay an additional $ 5.00 AND pay postage to send in the form . This might turn out to be really neat , educational , durable , we do n't know yet- but it should show in big print that there 's additional effort and cost required . This stuff is n't easy to explain to an exicted 5 yr old
5 #### Well made , lots of fun and such a good learning tool for color and shapes . Out little guy loves this one .
5 #### Love it shipping was fast my son really enjoys the colorful shapes , and I as a mother enjoy the fact it 's safe and Eco friendly
4 #### I bought # 2 kits for B - day presents . The larvae was ordered a week in advance . They have not arrived as of yet . After purchasing the kit- I saw on TV where I could have gotten the # 2 kits for a WHOLE LOT LESS $ .. Paid to much for them online ... live and learn . But the kids were excited to receive them .. so now we wait to see how long till the insect arrive ?
5 #### I purchased this for my nieces and they had a great time with this ! It 's perfect . They are 4 and 6 years old and were fascinated with the entire process .
5 #### Item arrived on time and what I was expecting to receive .
4 #### The bucket does n't stay together as well as you 'd think it should , and the hands do n't hold the bucket level , but other than that it 's a nice game . My kids love playing it .
5 #### Cute game for the little ones . I would stay pretty small though . It is fun but only for littles . Older kids will get bored quickly .
5 #### This was an amazing gift for my 5 and 3 year old . We made a growth chart to go along with this . I recommend this item to anyone because even as an adult it was amazing to watch the rapid growth and development .
5 #### In these days of video games , it 's refreshing to have an old school game which challenges your brain to think beyond its capacity . I enjoy this game a lot . Thanks to the seller .
5 #### Great Game I purchased it for a teacher and her classroom to play when they ca n't go outside . They like it .
4 #### My only complaint is that this game includes the letter K , which is almost never used in Spanish . Anyone who gets the K is screwed .
5 #### We play this game all the time with my brother and sister and sometimes as a family . Definitely educational . I recommend going online to scrabble dictionary for free rather than buying one .
3 #### I bought this for the babies in my home daycare and the first day it was on the shelf one of the babies managed to scrape off a good layer of green paint with his little teeth . Allow use only under supervision .
4 #### Perfect . Simple shapes and easy for little ones to let the blocks escape ( maybe too easy , but I have no problem with that ) Quality is excellent , the wood is solid and seems impervious to little ones hands and teeth .
5 #### Great classic game ! My kids always want to play it .
4 #### I remember this as a kid . But this version is cheaply built . Works . Kids enjoy , but I had to balance the pot manually by sticking electrical tape to the inside of the pot or it naturally sat tilted to start . Needed to glue pot togeather as well as the tabs did not hold it well .
5 #### If you have never played it is a relatively simple concept . Add beans to the top of a pot that moves when the load amount changes . It teaches kids simple physics and plays pretty quick . A cheap , simple classic that any small child ( that is old enough to know not to stick plastic beans in their mouth ) will enjoy .
4 #### It is a great game . They sur do n't make them as sturdy as they did 30 years ago !
4 #### We bought as a replacement for one that we gave away many years ago . I thought I 'd upgrade , but could n't bring myself to pay the prices just to get better features . It 's good as a learning tool . If it get bumps in the process and tiles scatter , then we usually just quit the game ( It 's a good excuse when some of us get tired of playing and a younger child is n't totally ready end it ) !
4 #### I bought this as part of my daughter 's Easter basket . She is 4 years old and Loves butterflies ! It is extremely educational . She really enjoyed getting the eggs in the mail and watching the caterpillars grow . We even saw the caterpillar make its cocoon ! The only things that I did not like is that the caterpillars were already hatched when we got them in the mail . And you have to keep them in the plastic cup they come in until they make their chrysalis , and it is sort of hard to transfer over to the butterfly pavilion . Other than that , GREAT EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY ! And so much fun ! I know my DD will remember it for a long time ! I even learned a lot about caterpillars and their life cycle !
3 #### I bought the butterfly garden for my daughter 's pre - school . It arrived within a few days . Just note that once you receive the box you then need to order the caterpillar larvae and that took 2 1/2 weeks . The kids have been very excited to see how big the caterpillars have grown in just a week . They ca n't wait to see the whole cycle . ( I also bought a chart showing all the stages from egg to butterfly . ) It 's a great project for almost any age group , with adult supervision and extra materials such as books , posters etc . The children will release the butterflies into the school garden and will have learnt a great deal about one tiny insect , it 's transformation and the importance of nature .
3 #### I bought one of these to raise and release some Black swallowtail Caterpillars I found at work last year . The kit itself is fine and does work to keep them safe from being eaten , but I dislike the fact you can order caterpillars through mail . It ca n't be very healthy for them and seems like a cruel thing to do . Instead of paying $ 5 to ship sick or dead caterpillars look in your own backyard . Do some research into what butterflies are in your area and plant host plants that those butterflies lay eggs on . Then use the kit to raise and release your Butterfly . Better for the caterpillar and saves you from having upset kids .
5 #### Happy to have this game for my grandson . He has his mommy 's original game so we want to keep that as a memory .
5 #### Cute game and not as cheaply made as other Hasbro games I 've bought . Am a big fan of Hasbro - cheaply made or not = all fun ' n games .
2 #### Not the fun game I remember as a kid . The " beans " are plastic & the kettle is even cheaper plastic & tips really easily . We ca n't get more than a few beans on top before it tips so it makes for some really short unchallenging games . My 4 year old gets bored with it quickly .
2 #### It did not hold my children 2 and 4 for long at all . They played with it for 2 minutes then got bored with the game . The beans fall over the side very easy so they got frustrated . It could be for older children but then it would be to childish .
5 #### 3 year old granddaughter likes it at Nanas house .
5 #### I use to play Do n't Spill the Beans as a child and loved it ! So I bought the game for my 3 year old daughter . It 's a classic game and still fun today .
5 #### I bought this for my son when he turned 1 and he still loves to play with it at 2.5 . It 's just quality wood and he ca n't stick the blocks in the wrong place .
3 #### I think this design could be greatly improved with a couple small hinges and a latch . It would add another element to the toy without worrying that the top will get misplaced and then he could also take the shapes back out himself . We have lots of Plan Toys and they are well loved but I returned this shape sorter and purchased an Ambi lock - a - block instead .
5 #### Wonderful from 7 months on . Then , she mainly liked to dump things out and then put in her mouth . Baby is now 10 mos and loves taking the top off taking the pieces out and putting them back in . In and out . Sometimes she likes to peek through the top and play peek a boo . Sometimes she tries to place the blocks on top of the top when it is on the floor , getting close to the " correct " shapes . It feels nice to the hand and will continue to interest her . My daughter says it 's good that it does n't have too many blocks - too many and the child does n't feel a sense of manageability . Great . I 'd buy it again . ( Yes , top does n't fit snugly . But for a tight fit , you 'd probably have to pay a lot more )
5 #### my daughter loves this shape sorter . she stacks the blocks , and puts them in the holes . i like that there are n't too many blocks or holes , and each shape can only fit in one hole .
5 #### I was looking for this game , which my husband enjoyed playing as a kid and thought it would be nice for Christmas
5 #### This is a wonderful toy . It well made , the balls little but usefull , even my 4years old boy loves to play with it ! . I 'll recommend it to everybody . very challenging too .
5 #### Scrabble is an amazing game and for the people that prefers to play in Spanish it is just perfect .
5 #### This is a great toy . My kids loved it . Be aware that you have to send away for the caterpillars . It can be a bit hard to wait , so make sure your kids know this up front . It was fascinating for the whole family to watch the caterpillars do their thing and then hatch . The habitat is very durable and served as an insect habitat all summer long after the butterflies had been released .
5 #### I do n't think Scrabble needs a review , but just in case : this is a great game . I like it more as an adult . I grew bored with it as a child . And , being the youngest by many years , it was also a game I could never win . No fun ! But I like it now !
5 #### It 's Scrabble ! How can you go wrong ? This is the classic board , with simple racks and a flat board . Functional and inexpensive . The only real annoyance is that the tiles can get skewed / disorganized on the board while you 're playing since they do n't have the raised grooves that the deluxe boards do . Still , perfectly manageable .
5 #### Thus game has provided many hours of fun for my granddaughter and me . Easy to play , easy to understand rules . Good choice .
3 #### I had never played this game before and bought it as a Christmas Eve surprise for our three year old son . The product came in a box that got all bent in shipping . Other reviews seem to love this game , but our son just did n't seem to get it . We ended up enjoying Candyland as a family much more .
5 #### I play this with my grandsons . They are almost four now . They enjoy watching and waiting to see who spills the beans . It is nice to have a game to play with them that does not involve a computer or tv . The memories of playing and laughing are well worth the price of the game .
5 #### At 6 months baby loves this toy . At 7 months she was scrapping the paint off the blocks with her two new pearly whites , so I had to take them away . I was n't too concerned since it is non - toxic , safe paint , and I trust the company . For now , she just plays with the box and stacking cups that she takes in and out of the wooden box . I know this toy is not intended for baby 's this young , but it 's never to early to teach them about shapes , sorting and stacking ! At least this baby loves it at this age !
4 #### It seems great ! we 'll see if my child ( who is n't even born yet ) like it ! But it looks great .
5 #### Excellent quality toy . My daughter has been playing with it since about 9 - months , though even now at 16 months , she ca n't always get the triangle . At first , I was disappointed with how easily the top comes off , but now I am glad , as it means she can do it herself . Fair warning , it does n't really bother me , but the yellow from the lid has rubbed off onto the top of the box with repeated use .
5 #### Well made . Only 6 pieces so this was a great toy for my 1 year old . We started out with this one and then moved up to a wooden cube that had more shapes .
4 #### As usual , this wooden toy from Plan Toy is very well made . Although it is not something my daughter would go for all the time ( I blame that on having too many toys to choose from ) , when she does go for it she would spend a lot of time with it . Even before she knows about shapes and sorting , she enjoy playing with the blocks and looking at the different colours . Overall , I am pleased with my purchase .
5 #### Super fun game for people of all ages ! Once you start playing you ca nt stop .
5 #### Scrabble ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Scrabble - Classic - Edition / dp / B00000IWDB / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Scrabble : Classic Edition</a > ) is an entertaining way both to stimulate young brains and to keep mature brains developing . This kind of play is beneficial . There is nothing wasteful about the time spent playing Scrabble . ( Unless you are playing with someone who spends too long trying to think of a word . ) There is some correction needed on the description of Scrabble . One is the age limit ! It is recommended that a player be eight years of age to enter the Scrabble community ; but with today 's child prodigies , I think this age for eligibility could be lowered to six . Since the pieces are tiny , and the wood looks delicious , it is not safe to leave around where it could entice little ones to eat them ; otherwise younger brilliant children could use the tiles for their enlightenment when the game is not being used by the conventional players . The upper age for playing Scrabble is ninety - nine . I do n't know why one - hundred - year - olds would want to give up Scrabble ! With the widespread concern about the waste of fuel , maybe it is time to play more Scrabble . This game is fun , and it has been around unchanged for about fifty years . People still love it . It requires nothing but two , three , or four brains and a comfortable place to spread the board . Every household needs a Scrabble game . Despite its longstanding popularity it is still reasonably priced . It would make an ideal gift for many occasions .
4 #### I played this game as a child so when I saw it I thought my 3 - year - old son would love it . He does ! We play it as a family and each time we just have so much fun together . He totally gets putting the beans on the top of the kettle , he 's taking turns ( so important ) and he gets that it 's one bean ( not 3 or 4 ) at a time . Such a great way to teach your child manners and counting and have fun doing it .
4 #### I remember playing this game 40 years ago with my sisters . While the new version uses plastic beans instead of the real thing , it still delivers the same level of fun .
5 #### Great game for little kids . Simple to learn , simple to play . I bought it for a 4 year old , he enjoys it .
3 #### This is an okay game , but I got it for 5 dollars so I ca n't complain much . I will complain about the smooshed box , though .
5 #### This is one of my favorite games . It is also an excellent way to enrich one 's vocabulary . To this day I recommend using a dictionary when you play just to be sure no neologisms sneak in . Still , the extent to which other players will try to win can be as fun as the game itself . I love this game !
5 #### A great way to pass time , teach kids how to spell and learn the meaning and purpose of words . Definatley to be played with a dictionary ( I suggest the Oxford scrabble dictionary which not only tells you if words are valid but also gives their true scrabble score ! ) It 's a good laerning curve but can cause lots of heated debate ! !
4 #### This is one of our most favorite games when playing the kids sequence with the animals or the regular one with adults it is fun ! It is hard to play with a toddler but they like to flip the cards and put the markers anywhere . A little bigger playing board may be nice but other than that it is a great toy to take with you . Not for in the car though . too many small pieces .
5 #### We have used the butterfly garden twice already . I ordered the larva online ( 5 bucks I think ) and shipping was pretty fast , within 4 or 5 days . Since my daughter was in the 5 - 6 range when using , it involves some adult help ( transferring the cocoons , feeding , placing in a safe area away from curious cats , etc ) . I like that there is an option to reorder more caterpillars from their website . The two times that I ordered , I received 5 larva each time and all hatched ( even when one of the cocoons fell off the paper when transporting ) .
5 #### I bought this in 2008 for the boy I nanny and he still talks about it . He just asked if we could order more caterpillars . The ordering process was easy and , if I recall , all but one of the 8 - 10 caterpillars we got turned into butterflies . He really enjoyed it because he got to release them into his garden .
5 #### I got this for my eight , six , and four year old kids who love watching , " Wild Kratts " , on PBS . They really liked the Monarch butterfly episode -- so I thought this would be a neat project . To be honest , I figured out of the five caterpillars , we 'd get maybe 2 - 3 chrysalises ... and maybe 1 or 2 butterflies . I was completely wrong . All five caterpillars turned into painted lady butterflies . We fed them w/ sugar water on carnations for a few days and then let them go . It was super neat and cool . Highly recommended . Caterpillars come with everything you need ( food , etc . ) All you really need is a straight pin or safety pin to pin the paper with the chrysalises to the " garden " net thing . Buying two carnations to drizzle sugar water on them once the guys turn into butterflies is optional . You can also soak a sponge with sugar water or use a balled up paper towel .
5 #### This is a very high quality , sturdy , wooden toy , thus it is heavy and you will have to supervise baby during play time . 12 month old really enjoys pulling off the lid to see where the blocks go . We also use the blocks for stacking . Edges are smooth so I have no worries about splinters .
5 #### My granddaughter absolutely loves this wooden shape sorter . Colors are bright and she loves the clunk sound they make when going in the box . She takes the lid off , puts the shapes in the box and puts the lid on . She dumps them out and try 's to use the sorter and is successful enough times to back to it again and again . She takes the shapes and stacks them up . Very versatile toy !
4 #### My son has n't been too interested in this toy yet , but he is only 16 months old , so I 'm guessing he will get there someday . In the meantime , I love it because of how simple , attractive and well made it is .
3 #### I grew up playing htis game and just loved it so naturally I thought my kids would love this game too . We have played it once . They have no desire to play it again . ANd , my kids in general so like board games .
5 #### This game is so much fun ! Even my mom who hates to play games with me , will play this game ! I like this game because everyone can play it ! Fun and educational at the same time as you learn to build words and you can even use it to show how to use a word and grow from it . I think this game is worth the money they charge . My only regret is that I did n't get one with a turn table luckily my mom had one from the 70 's and we use it . My advise buy this game !
5 #### Adults love this game because it 's challenging and makes them think , and the educational opportunities for kids to broaden their vocabularies and learn spelling skills are obvious . Suggest buying a dictionary as an accessory . This is a great game and will continue to stand the test of time
5 #### This is a classic game , what else can be said about it ? Well how about " speed Scrabble " a new way to play without using the board . Each player takes five tiles and makes a scrabble matrix . As soon as one player uses all five tiles , he say 's " take two " and everyone has to grap two more . You can change your matrix at any time and you build it using standard Scrabble rules . When the tiles are finished , score like normal and subtract unused tiles . Can be played with any number of people , just open up another game and mix the tiles together . As for the normal way to play , my only objection is the time spent waiting for other players to move and the fact that through bad luck you can get six vowels and the " Q " , but other than those minor objections , this is one great game . A classic . Highly recommended .
5 #### I live in Puerto Rico . My friends and I usually play in both in English and Spanish at the same time . But if you what to learn Spanish I will recommend playing the game entirely en Espaol . I will give you the pros and cons of this version : Pros : 1 . You can make higher scores in Spanish . K-8 points , W-8 points , Q-8 points but much easier to use , LL-8 points , RR-8 points , -8 points , and it is much easier to get rid of all your letters than in English . 2 . Spanish words are written just as you pronounce them ( that is why there are no Spanish spelling bees ) . 3 . You can learn Spanish in a fun way , plus the game can be used in English and it has a couple more vowels . Cons : 1 . There are no really good Spanish dictionaries , other than the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary ( Amazon has it at a reasonable price ) . And no Spanish Scrabble dictionary is to be found . This will make it hard on verb conjugation . Whether you play it in Spanish or English or both the Spanish tiles are definitely better . Go ahead and try this version . Come on , you know you what to .
5 #### I 've used this in my classroom many times and it is great ! Kids enjoy watching the metamorphasis of the caterpillars to butterflies . This time the purchase is for nieces and nephews . I 'm sure they 'll have the same reaction as my students .
5 #### Two of my children received two butterfly kits for their birthday and we are currently waiting for our butterflies to emerge . This kit is very easy to use and crazy fun . The kit comes with the mesh habitat and a certificate to receive caterpillars in the mail . What arrives a few days after you order them is a plastic container with larvae ( caterpillars)inside for which you put honey water in the bottom and close with the paper lid sealed under the plastic lid . The caterpillars eat the honey mixture for several days then attach to the top of the paper lid while making their chrysalises ( about 2 - 3 weeks wait for this ) . A few days after that you pop the plastic lid off the container and pin the paper to the side of the mesh habitat wall . When the butterflies are emerging you drop flowers and/or sugar water soaked tissue balls into the bottom of the habitat and watch your butterflies eat . We are at that stage now ( waiting for the butterflies ) so I do n't know yet if we keep the butterflies for a day or more . The instructions say to wait to release based on outside temps ( over 55 degrees for several days in a row ) . Our instructions also say the new butterflies might lay eggs so I 'm waiting to see if we get a full life cycle and can start over ( for free ! ) . Either way we are very happy with this item and I highly recommend getting it .
5 #### I bought this for my 2 and half year old daughter and 11 year old step son as a summer project . They loved it but what I did n't count on is how much the rest of the family would enjoy it ! Me , my husband and my 60 + year old mother in law were all fascinated by it . The concept of caterpillar to chrysalis to butterfly was nothing new to us but to see it in person was truly awesome ! I even talked my mother into getting one to do herself ! It was amazingly simple to do and so awesome ! You will not be disappointed .
4 #### Give this 4 stars and not 5 because they do n't tell you that you have to send away for the larvae for a $ 5 charge and wait several weeks . if this were explained on the Amazon website , it would be a little easier to handle . As is , it is an unwelcome surprise . That said - a nice habitat , lots of room for 4 butterflies ( which you send away for ) and beautiful monarchs emerge at the end of the process .
5 #### I got this for my granddaughters ( Sierra & Autumn ) . We had many hours of laugh 's and fun . Thank you Milton Bradley
4 #### My grandson loves playing this game ! Of course his favorite part is when the beans actually spill so he tries to make them tip over ! These Cootie Games are easy to assemble and fun to play ! Making memories !
3 #### This game has changed a little bit since I was a kid . The pot will NOT sit straight at all , so one side is always destined to lose . It is actually kind of irritating . Otherwise , I have enjoyed sharing this game with my own preschooler as I remember playing it a lot in my own childhood .
1 #### Milton Bradly makes some of our favorite family games , but this is not one of them . It 's cheap plastic , with poor fit and finish . We ca n't get our bean pot to balance evenly , so it starts to tip even before we put the beans on .
3 #### I use this game as a reinforcer than speech therapy . It requires no set up and can easilty be used with a small group . It is n't overly exciting but it keeps the kids engaged long enough . It is cheap and you have to apply the stickers yourself .
5 #### I love wooden toys . Plan Toys seems to make really excellent toys too ! And the fact that they environmentally source their wood allows me to sleep a little better at night . This toy is well made and will definitely be one we hold on to for a long time . My toddler loves playing with it . Because the lid just sits on top , she is able to take the lid off by herself and dump the blocks back out . Excellent toy and worth the money !
5 #### This toy is well made and has rich colors . Three simple shapes are perfect for babies as they work on learning this new skill . The blue shelf is on a hinge that lets you drop the shapes out . My son also likes to just press down on the shapes to move the shelf . It really is a simple and beautiful toy . Better than I expected .
5 #### The plan toy shape and sort it our gives our grandaughter some valuable experiences in matching shapes with holes to get the pieces back into the box .
5 #### I got this tor for my 16 month old son . He enjoys using it but can get frusterated with it at times because there are 4 or 5 sides that have different shapes to sort out . A few of them even look similar . i believe the toy is for 2 + He has no problems with it if I show him where the shapes go first . He can take the lid off himself
5 #### This is such a great game ! Our family loves tyring to figure out who committed the crime . Doing it this way is much better than actually killing a family member just for fun . We had to stop doing that last Christmas because our family is not big enough to support many games .
5 #### We got 5 caterpillars , all 5 turned into butterflies . Be patient , we did have one slow caterpillar and I did jump the gun on him , thankfully I placed him in the cage anyway and he did turn . My daughter ( 4 ) decided that we should let them go instead of tryi8ng to keep them life we did with the lady bugs . We released them all 1 - 2 days after turning into butterflies . It seems to take them a little while to learn to fly . Great and priceless learning for my child .
4 #### I have n't tried my Insect Lore butterfly kit , but I have seen it in action in a K classroom where I was student teaching several years ago . The kids ALL loved it as did I , so I wanted to do with my 4 year old daughter this summer . When I tried to redeem my coupon online for the caterpillars ( they are free with coupon but you have to pay $ 5 for shipping and handling ) , I kept getting this message : Online Credit Card Authorization Error : 203 . I called their customer service ( a very short wait and decent customer service ) and the rep informed me that they do n't send caterpillars in the hot summers to my region ( N. Nevada ) because they wo n't survive the transit , even rush or overnight . She said they start sending them in September ( and probably in Spring too ) . I wish I had known that before I got my daughter all hyped up . From Insect Lore website it says , " If seasonal temperatures are extremely hot or cold , expect a short delay in delivery to ensure the health and happiness of your live critters during transit . " It does n't clearly mention that they do n't send the insects in the summer time , and I do n't consider 2 - 3 summer months a " short delay . "
5 #### Both my 3 and 6 year olds learned how caterpillars turn into butterflies from this butterfly garden . They got a kick out of releasing the butterflies after they matured .
5 #### My husband and I bought this for ourselves and we love playing it . It 's a very fun challenge to try to come up with words when you only have a few letters to work with ; it certainly exercises your mind !
1 #### If you like tons of tiny pieces to clean up ... And tons of choking hazards this is the game for you . Pros : Idea is neat , balancing beans until the bowl tips over . Cons : Around 60 tiny plastic beans to clean up . Surface of the bowl has very little traction so beans slide and tip off very quickly . The game is too hard for children under 8 , and not interesting for children over 8 . Suggestion : Buy " Do n't Break the Ice " instead ... Kids love it and it is made by the same company and runs the same price .
5 #### This is a fantastic game for little kids . You take turns putting beans into the pot until finally it flips over and spills the beans ! It 's a simple game for kids that does n't require reading and does n't take too long so it fits even short attention spans .
3 #### I remembered this toy from when I was young , so I ordered it for my daughter . She loves it but it has cheap plastic parts . I expect it be broken soon .
1 #### This is definitely not the same game I remember playing as a kid . This version is cheaply made junk . The bean pot is made of two thin plastic halves that snap together . It 's supported by " hands " that are even flimsier and make the pot tilt in one direction before you even put any beans on it . Even if you try to load up the opposite side of the pot to balance it , it stays tilted and the beans all end up sliding down to that side and off the pot . My 4 - year - old daughter and I tried playing it several times until we both got frustrated with it . Now it just sits boxed up in a corner of her playroom , because whenever I ask my daughter if she wants to play it she says " No , it 's no fun " .
4 #### I rated this game for my 4.5 years old son . He loves this game , because he thinks putting the beans on the pot is fun . We learned this game from his OT , she modified it by requiring to use a tweezer to pick up the beans and put on the lid .
3 #### I guess I do n't know what I expected with this one . Maybe some magnetized pieces so they are easier to keep in the box when not in play ? I love playing sequence and so do my kids , but with little ones , it was sometimes hard to keep track of all the loose pieces .
3 #### even as a kid , I never played this game . I got it for my son 's 7th birthday , as we have Clue Jr. and he enjoys that very much . I do n't know , maybe this game will grow on me more , but I actually like Clue Jr. better , I think it is more fun . I know this is a classic game , but the game play just seemed odd to me . It does get kids thinking about strategy and makes them have to remember details , which is why I rated it high for educational . Overall , this wo n't be one of the go - to games on our shelf , though , as we have many , many more interesting games than this .
5 #### This is a fun game to play . A game that the whole family enjoys . Strategy and wits to overpower the others . All ages enjoy playing Clue .
5 #### I bought this for my friend 's son as his 4 - year - ld birthday gift . The whole family totally enjoy it , and they have been ordering more and more larvae since two years ago . we have been sharing the joys of this toy together . Now my son is about to turn 4 , and this is def a must - have for him . I also ordered this for all his day care friends who turnd 4 as their birthday gifts , and everyone loves it !
4 #### My 7 year old godson found this present to give to his parents for Easter . A way to give something to them and to him at the same time , I think ! The kit arrived in time , without the live caterpillars . These are shipped separately when you have the Garden assembled . When the caterpillars arrived they gestated a few weeks and voila ! Butterflies ! My godson was thrilled his folks absolutely delighted that he had an engaging project for a few weeks . Very worthwhile .
5 #### Our little guys are in chrysalis stage now , my little girl ( almost 3)may be a bit young to understand the concept , but we are explaining and showing anyhow . We the adults think this is really cool . And it will be another experience for her .
4 #### My 21 month old daughter loved this since I opened it & it kept her engaged . I love the quality , all the pieces and box are solid wood , except the bottom of the box is a little different ( thinner ) , however it is pretty solid / sturdy . The box 's walls are put together by something similar to a dovestail joint ( glued ) ; this means no nails . All edges of box , lid & shapes are rounded & smooth . The shapes fit only in their corresponding shape slot ( no cheating :) . The box has two openings on the sides to use as handles . The lid sits on a short grove on top of the box & is easily removed by child without assistance ( If you tip it over , the lid would fall ) . My only issue is that MY lid did not sit flat , the top is slighty warped & it wobbles a bit on top of the box ( like a wobbly / uneven table ) . The defect was not significant enough for me to return it , however this would be better if the grove for the lid were a little deeper & of course the lid is flat . Overall happy with this product , it is well made & my child loves it . Oh , and the paint seems good , no chemical odor . Box measures 6 " wide & 4 " high . [ If this helped , please like my review , thanks ]
4 #### I purchased this shape sorter for my son 's first birthday . I was attracted to its simplicity . It 's also environmentally friendly ... and WOOD . It arrived well - packaged and in a timely manner . The colors are bright and we have n't experienced chipping or flaking . My son enjoys using the toy as intended . He also likes to remove the lid and fill the box with other toys . I do n't mind this , but it would be nice if the lid was attached with a hinge or something ... to encourage it to be used as intended . Also , the box portion is unpainted and unstained like many other Plan toys , leaving it susceptible to staining . A good rub - down with linseed oil or applying a child - safe water - based lacquer solves this . An overall wonderful toy with some small cosmetic issues .
5 #### I have two other shape sorters and this one is definitely the best for a baby just starting to sort shapes . First my son liked to take the lid off and just take the shapes out and then put them back in . Eventually I noticed that he figured out how to get the circle through the hole . He is still working on the triangle and square , but can get it occasionally . It 's also a challenge for him to get the lid on right , but he keeps working at it until he gets it . It is very well made with smooth corners . I am very happy with this purchase .
5 #### Yes , the lid does come right off . But for the reviewer complaining that their child has more fun taking the lid off than sorting the blocks : is n't this a toy ? If they 're having fun doing their own thing , i 'm not sure what the trouble is . Sooner or later they 'll get into that obsessive sorting stage . This toy is very solidly built . The blocks are solid wood , the box is sturdy , and the lid fits perfectly on top . It does n't lock or clip or lock in , there 's no hinge . It 's a piece of wood that rests on top of the box , and that makes it very easy for the child to remove it and pull the blocks out so they can start sorting all over again . I ca n't speak for other parents or their kids , but mine loves to upend the box and dump everything out , lid and all . He would n't be able to have that fun if the lid locked into place , and i 'm glad i do n't have to be involved in liberating the blocks every time he 's put them all into the box . ( And for anyone who does n't know much about the Plan Toy company , my favorite thing about them is that they use food - grade dyes for their products , so you never have to worry about your child ingesting toxic chemicals by chewing on them . They also source renewable wood and engage in a variety of other eco - friendly policies . )
2 #### Like the other reviewer mentions , the lid is far too easy to remove and there 's no hinge or anything to keep the lid permanently attached to the box . Needless to say , my 15 month old is more interested in pulling off the lid than he is in sorting the blocks . I 'm hoping that I 'll be able to find the lid when he gets old enough to learn how to put the lid back on and use the toy the way it was intended to be used .
4 #### Can you use deductive logic to eliminate options and determine the three elements of the crime . A great and colorful game which is a classic , made better by new editions such as the simpsons .
5 #### This is another of the classic games that have enjoyed enduring fame and popularity for good reason . " Clue " must surely be to detective games what " Monopoly " is to money games . The concept is pretty simple , really : you use cards with various weapons , rooms and people on them and try to work out who the murderer is , where they did the terrible deed and what with . These items are randomly inserted into an envelope that is in the middle of the board . You move around each room , and try to find out what is going on . Who knows : it might be you . While simple , the game is loads of fun and there are certain strategies to it . After the first few times of getting whipped , you will figure them out soon enough . But basically , " Clue " is just plain fun and it requires very little to set up and enjoy . Happy hunting ! Oh , and by the way , the Butler did n't do it .
5 #### I bought this for my daughter who loves butterflies . I have to admit that I loved it as much as she did . I was so excited when the first 2 butterflies emerged , I could hardly wait for her to finish her bath before I told her ! We are going to order our second batch of caterpillars today .
5 #### I 've played this game literally dozens of times and it 's still fun for me . I do agree with what one reviewer said ... after a while , the combos can be the same , so they threw in another card to change it up ... I've done that too and it totally adds a new perspective . I 've loved this game for years , if you have n't played it yet , please do !
5 #### Very interesting and educational product . I just wish it came with the insects instead of having to send off the card and wait .
3 #### It 's not that I have n't had fun playing this game , it 's just that it really is n't fun without the right number of people playing . There is too much dependance on getting lucky and if the skill level between playes is too great , it 's a cake walk for the more logical thinkers . I also do n't think this is the kind of game you can keep playing over and over like scrabble , boggle , or any number of card games that all have a lot more variance in play . I 'm not totally knocking " Clue " , but it 's one of those games that gets tiring after a few times of playing it .
5 #### This is a great little kit . Both my kids ( 6 and 2 ) enjoyed watching the caterpillars grow , form the chrysalides , and turn into butterflies . All five of our caterpillars made it to the butterfly stage too . I do have a warning though . When the butterflies emerge , they excrete a bright red liquid ( meconium ) resembling blood . Since the bottom of the habitat is just thin nylon , the liquid soaks through and stains whatever surface it is sitting on . Just make sure you have a towel or cardboard under it , before the butterflies emerge .
5 #### We are thrilled with our butterfly garden . It is so cool to watch the caterpillers grow and change into butterflies . We are homeschoolers so this is an all around unit study for our family . My only complaint is that you should know that ordering the larvae is going to cost you extra . I ordered a kit a few years ago and it came with a certificate to send for the butterflies . They were $ 3 . We just ordered another kit as gift . The caterpillers certificate in there cost $ 5 . Luckily they were good friends and after the present was opened I took the certificate so I could send for the caterpillers myself . Otherwards I would have given $ 3 with the gift to pay for the larvae ( forgetting about inflation ) . But it is a great kit . I know we will order caterpillers time and time again ! !
5 #### The game itself is a game that everybody knows . It 's rules are the same , everything included works well , fits well . The only downside is that this is the travel version , so it 's incredibly small and does n't have the full functionality of a larger board . I should have known this given the title ...
5 #### Mr. Boddy has been murdered somewhere in his mansion . Fortunately , the suspects and weapons are still there , so it will be possible to solve the crime . Now you must help one of the suspects search for clues to figure out what really happened . You never know , you might have done it as well . I 've loved this game since I was a kid . The challenge of trying to solve the mystery before your opponents is wonderful fun . And I 'm a sucker for a good mystery . Since the game changes every time you play , it never gets boring . The game can be as simple or complex as you let it , teaching logic and basic elimination in a fun setting . This popular game has been around for years and shows no sign of dying , for good reason . All generations can gather round and play for hours of fun . Just be sure to watch out for Mrs. White with the rope in the billiard room .
5 #### After the huge pile of boxes under the tree had been opened yesterday , this one was the hands - down hit with my daughter . We played round after round after Christmas dinner was finished , remembering how much fun we had playing Clue when we were kids . Nothing about the game has changed in the last thirty years , except maybe Mrs. Peacock 's hairstyle on the box cover . Older kids ( 9 + or so ) can play with adults with no serious disadvantage . I rated the educational value as 5 stars because the game is based on deductive reasoning ; kids learn to test a hypothesis with the suggestion / alibi format . This is a classic that belongs in your game closet , pronto .
3 #### kids wish more players could play at once but otherwise as described and fun play
5 #### this was for my 4yr old son and 9 yr old daughter . This was great , we received 10 live caterpillars watched them eat and grow and turn into the crysilis attached the paper under the lid with a close pin to the butterfly container with in a few days they were butterflys . We soaked a sponge with humming bird food and watched them eat for 2 days then we let them go . Althrough 2 did n't turn in to butterflys so we only had 8 to let go . but its a great life lesson for $ 30 total . We are born we grow up and one day fly away to live life for our own . If you want these to hang around your yard get some butterfly attracting plants .
5 #### My sister - in - law bought this for my 4 - year - old daughter 's birthday . She was terribly excited ! Found out it 's $ 2 cheaper to order the caterpillars by mail than online so chose that route . Received the caterpillars within two weeks -- all living . Within two weeks of having the caterpillars they * all * turned into chryasildes and within another two weeks all had hatched into beautiful butterflies ! My daughter loved the whole process -- it was so neat to have her see all the transformation up close . She even got to hold a few of the butterflies before she let them fly away . Completely pleased with product and plan to order the tadpole / frog kit next !
5 #### I have to agree with the other reviewers that this toy is a toddler pleaser . My daughter got the Mr and Mrs Potato head version of this at age 18 months and she just loves it . ( the Mr and Mrs version has one head but " lady " parts like earrings , fancy shoes , bow lips ... ) She learned the names of all of the parts , including shoes , glasses etc , and quickly is learning the correct place for each part . She carries around the head like a doll and loves to put the pieces into the case and dump them out and so on for what seems like forever . The suitcase comes apart sometimes , but is easy to click back together , is very durable , and a great way to keep the pieces all together . I highly recommend this classic , which ( unlike many revamped classic toys ) has stayed true to its original concept with the improvement of a storage feature and durable parts . Did the original have a compartment inside the head to store pieces ? I ca n't remember , but this one does , so if we feel like just taking along the head with a few parts we can leave the suitcase at home and still keep the pieces all together . We 've had this toy for several months and have n't lost a piece yet , even though it 's visited every house in the neighborhood .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Mr Potato Head . You and your children will have hours of fun making up silly faces no matter what their age . My daughter received this for her second birthday and was playing with it straight away - the pieces are easy to insert into Mr Potato Head and any piece can go in anywhere making for some interesting " Mr Potato Heads " . The suitcase is a fabulous idea - so many pieces to make so many different combinations of faces and they all fit into the suitcase for storage and for taking on car trips or visits to grandparents . Fantastic toy !
5 #### As another reviewer quipped , I played it as a child , I play it as an adult . I must admit that I had n't played this game for a long time , but when my 8 - yr old son pulled it out of the game closet at Gma 's house we had a great time . My son enjoyed it so much that he asked for a copy for Christmas ... and Santa willingly obliged . We now play " Clue ! " regularly . It 's a great family game . Now that our children are beyond " Candyland " and " Chutes and Ladders " we are happy to move on to games like this one . Just in case you 've been off planet for the past 30 years or so , here 's how the game works : Up to 6 players roll a dice and move their marker around a board that represents a mansion as they seek out which person in the game was the murderer , what the murder weapon was , and which room the murder was committed in . If you are clever enough maybe you 'll be the first one to figure out " who done it ! " A great family game ( as long as you do n't think about the murder aspect too much ) , and the game 's never the same twice ... and if it is you 'll never know until it 's all over . " Clue ! " is a timeless classic that is destined to be around for a long , long time ! Good luck , and pass the rope , er ... popcorn Alan Holyoak
5 #### With paper and pen in hand , we would cross off all the suspects as we knew they were no longer suspect . We did this in a most serious way , determined we would find out who the murderer was , who did it and what they used to do it . Sounds awful , but kids do n't think of it that way . Before the game starts , three cards are selected and put into a small paper envelope . Just make sure no one sees the cards . Then let the game begin and learn to look for clues , analyze the results of your choices and as soon as you think you have figured it out , you can look at the cards . If you are wrong , you are out of the game ... so be really sure ! I enjoyed this game until I was about 12 . I play it now and then with my nieces . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### Got travel Sequence and travel Rummikub at the same time . For guys , or anyone with big hands , Sequence is easier to handle than Rummikub .
3 #### I thought it would be more like the game that we play at home but it only has one card for everything . The game is still played well , but on long flights the games end quickly . It 's not really a strategy game like the home version . It is compact and is nice to travel with .
5 #### My three year old is absolutely loving this kit ! All of our larvae are now in their cocoons , and we are awaiting the arrival of our painted lady butterflies in a few short days . It has been amazing listening to my three year old tell all of her family and friends what she has learned about the caterpillar / butterfly life cycle . Great gift for any child !
5 #### We received this as a gift . The next day I ordered the larvae online and within a week they were here . All 5 survived to become pupae and then butterflies . We just released them last night . The mesh cylinder works well , the directions are simple and easy and it really happens totally by itself . We watched them emerge from the cocoons , fed them and observed them for a good 4 days before releasing them . They are clam enough to be held in our hands before flying off . Will keep the container and feeder for another year ! We had done the ladybugs in the past and will do that one next . Then ... praying mantis ! !
5 #### So my greatest concern was whether our larvae would make it to us alive and they did . They are growing so fast ! And I 'm so glad some reviewers mentioned having to order the larvae after you buy this garden , well it made sense but it did n't occur to me before then . I ordered ours online for $ 3 and they arrived in just a few days . My son is almost 4 and really does n't like bugs but he really is enjoying this ! Assume all of the larvae grew to beatiful butterflies unless I follow up and report otherwise ! And BTW I got the butterfly garden for $ 13 on amazon .
2 #### The CATERPILLARS are NOT included and you have to pay $ 5.oo to get them shipped . What a joke . The TV commercial advertises " call now and get 2 sets of caterpillars " , well , you have to pay extra and WAIT for them to be shipped ! VERY disappointed ! We have n't played with it yet . Still waiting for the Caterpillars !
4 #### My 3 YO likes his truck , but it does n't compete with the Vtech train his 1 YO brother got for his birthday . I 'm eager for spring when they can both play with it outside in the dirt . Right now it 's in our living room .
5 #### My twin boys received these Tonka Bulldozers within the last year . One of the wheel track belts came off and somehow we lost it before we could fix it . After looking for replacements parts everywhere I finally wrote to the company . Today I received a complete replacement of the bulldozer . Amazing customer service ! I never heard back after she requested photos of the bulldozer and my address . I was just hoping to not to have to pay for the part . So happy . I loved Tonka as a kid and now my boys do too ! And my boys love their Tonka bulldozers , even when the one was missing its track :)
5 #### I bought this for my 2 yr . old grandson . I 'm sure it will be played with for years to come .
5 #### We just had our first butterfly emerge . It was pretty " exciting " and " cool " . We really like it and so does our 4 year old . You do have to pay an extra $ 3 for them to send you the caterpillars . They guarantee that you 'll get at least 3 perfectly formed butterflies . You do n't even have to do much work , especially at first . The caterpillars come in a plastic cylynder with food in it ... you just watch them until they all form chrysalises ( no additional feeding needed ) , then you move them to the habitat and wait ... then you have to do more work and keep them fed . Overall , a great educational and fun thing to do & watch . 5 stars .
4 #### My 23 month old son got this for Christmas and he has n't put it down since . He has a blast creating all sorts of wacky faces and even gives Mr. ' Tato Head ( as he calls him ) his own voice . The case is a nice idea , but it 's hard to jam everything back into after you first open it . I just got one of those small Rubbermaid totes and I store everything in there .
5 #### This is just the coolest toy . Easy to play with , the plate moves up and down . Made a three year old speechless .
5 #### My five - year - old son can hardly wait to get up every morning and check on his caterpillars . They grow amazingly fast , come equipped with all their food , and are fun to watch .
4 #### We bought this on sale half price for my nephew and decided at the last minute to also order one for my 2.5 year old . We love it ! ! ! He 's learned so much and shows everyone who comes over . Even Hubby and I can sit and etch for quite awhile . Seriously recommend this to everyone !
5 #### I was first introduced to the basic head by my sister who gave it to my daugther when she was 19 months and I thought she is just going to use it as a ball ... Was I wrong ! ! ! ! I ended up buying this suitcase and thinking of buying more parts ! ! ! ! She loves to create what ever in it , and it is easy for me to play with her ... It a different way to be creative and use imagination ....
3 #### We 've had this set at our house for about 2 years . It 's nearly everything a child could want for Mr. Potato head . Plenty of variety . All good stuff . All except for the case . The case for this is a piece of junk . I comes apart every single time it 's opened . This was a very poorly thought out design . I finally chucked the case and we now keep all our Potatohead stuff in a big Ziploc .
4 #### I really think you can never go wrong with Mr. Potato Head ... it teaches kids problem solving and creative thinking , while also letting them practice their small motor skills . Plus , it 's fun ! I 've caught myself reliving my childhood by playing with this toy as well . I will say , at 18 months , my daughter still puts a few of the pieces in her mouth . So , we took away the earrings and flower so she did n't try to swallow them . The one dissapointment is the suitcase . I thought it 'd be a great way to keep all the pieces together , but ... First , the case falls apart on a regular basis . It 's easy to put back together , but it 's a pain to deal with . Second , it 's difficult to simply throw all the pieces into the case - they really have to be put in a certain way to all fit in properly . I can do it with a few minutes of work , but I ca n't see my 18 - month old having enough patience to do it . I gave up on the suitcase after a few weeks , and put the pieces in a see - through bin . The case is a nice idea , but it did n't work for us . The problems with the case would not stop me from getting this set though - it offers a lot of variety !
5 #### An excellent toy ; it promotes motor and gross skills as well as creative thinking ; the children are not only proud of their creation but you could determine thier understanding quite a bit . it holds their interest because it provides versatility . Excellent choice .
5 #### My oldest had to have Mr Potato Head when Toy Story came out . Of course the cardboard box did n't last long & the pieces were scattered & lost but with this set the container is plastic & it is easier to keep the pieces together & hold their attention longer . It is now being played with by child # 3 , so I would say it is definitely worth the money . My only complaint would be the container could be a little bigger to allow little hands to put the accessories away easier . But all in all , it is a great toy .
5 #### Purchased for my one and only grandson . He is 3 . I had purchased a dump truck for his birthday in October , so he was thrilled to get another " Tonka " . It is n't the Tonka from my childhood , but it still withstands heavy use by an all - boy 3 year old .
4 #### I got this toy for my little man - who is almost four . He loves it , but has a little trouble adjusting the blade . I was a little disappointed with the amount of plastic on the toy . We 'll see how it holds up .
5 #### This was a gift for my son and he just loved it . What was really great was that the whole family could enjoy the butterflies ( even the cat , though maybe not in the same way ) . The net is durable and you can rig it to hang if you want but we left it on the table . The woman who gave it to him as a gift ordered the caterpillars also and she was able to specify the date they were to arrive . They came on time but they already were forming into their crysalis so by the time he opened his gift , they were already hanging upside down . It was July and a particularly hot time and when I called the company they explained that the process can be faster in the heat . But , they said without hesitation , they would send out a coupon for FREE ( no shipping costs , either ) caterpillars so that we can order them again once the weather cooled down . Within the week we had the voucher ! They valued our experience and I will remember that in future purchases .
5 #### I could n't be more happy with this kit . Hardly any maintenance other than feeding butterflies with orange slices everyday . I love the way the caterpillars are self contained and self feeding so there 's no worry in getting them to eat and drink . Out of the 5 caterpillars , one did n't make it but the rest developed normally and are now happy and healthy butterflies .
4 #### I got the butterfly garden for my five - year - old daughter and immediately mailed in my coupon for the caterpillars . I received them within a few days ! Loved the fast service ! The five caterpillars were well and carefully packaged and started forming cocoons on the lid of their jar in less than a week . The instructions were a little hazy on how to get the critters out of the jar and pinned inside the butterfly garden , but my wife was able to figure it out . In a few days , we had five butterflies flitting around inside the netting and happily enjoying drinks of sugar water ( the instructions with the garden tell you how to do this ) . We probably could have held on to them for a couple of weeks , but my little girl insisted they should be let free and so we released them in our backyard after a few days ( though a couple did n't seem to want to go ! ) . Overall , the experience was a lot of fun and I 'll very likely order more caterpillars in the spring so we can do it again .
5 #### I purchased this set for my 4 yr old daughter last Spring . Ours ( purchased from a warehouse store ) came with a coupon for free larvae ( no additional cost at all ) , a large mesh garden , a poster , a dropper for feeding the butterflies and a flower garland . We sent in the coupon and within 2 - 3 weeks , got two containers of larvae in the mail . We followed the instructions and during the next several weeks , enjoyed watching the larvae grow into caterpillars that turned into 10 beautiful butterflies . My daughter and I truly enjoyed this experience and releasing them outside and seeing them fly away was a very special moment . I want to mention that some reviewers indicate the process could potentially be too gross for young kids to handle ( due to the release of meconium ) but we did n't find that to be the case at all . This is a great product and we are looking forward to growing butterflies again next Spring .
3 #### Our caterpillars were n't moving much upon arrival , but the instructions said that was normal . So we followed everything to the dot , including waiting by the mailbox for the delivery ! The caterpillars ' movements reduced to zero and eventually I decided they had passed on . We did not get much out of this kit , unfortunately . Perhaps summer of 2010 was too hot for postal insects ! We did use the mesh cage several times capturing live butterflies in our garden . Even some fireflies . Got something out of it , I guess .
5 #### This Butterfly Garden is the perfect gift for children : potentially educational , fun , easy to take care of , and also interesting for any adults around . I 've bought a few of these for younger relatives , and the reviews have always come back positive ! This is a FANTSTIC birthday / Christmas / etc . gift if you have young kids to buy a present for .
4 #### I bought it for my grandson . He is loving it
5 #### Me and my boys are all enjoying our battship
1 #### pieces break , not good storage for small pieces , too difficult to follow computerized voice and instruction for kids and adults . gave it away . do n't recommend .
4 #### Fun , game , setting it up takes a few minutes , but my daughter loves the sound effects
5 #### Great product and quality . I like so much . It is a good product and good price I would buy again . Thank you .
4 #### My daughter enjoyed this toy . The net can be used again so you only have to buy the caterpillars .
4 #### Flick it does n't work all the time but otherwise it 's in great condition
1 #### My son got this for Christmas we 'd only played it a few times and the electronics stopped working which makes the game completely useless . I wish he 'd gotten the one that did n't talk , at least games that do n't talk are n't " broken " and unplayable if the electrical component dies .
5 #### This was so much fun ! I gave this kit to my son and he was absolutely magnetized by this . Once you get the kit , you have to send in the form with a small s / h and , in about a week & 1/2 you get little critters ( look like dark maggots ) creeping and crawling around a cake of solid sand ( I am aware that this does not sound good :) . Then , they make their way to the top of the lid and instinctively hang upside - down by their own silk and turn into this weird shell - like creatures . Then , they pop out and become beautiful butterflies that you can release . I think I had as much fun with this than my children did . Of course , the habitat can be reused and all you need are the larvae ( inexpensive ) . Have fun ( hope I did n't gross you all out ... but , hey ... that 's nature :) Miles
5 #### I ordered this for my 6 year old son and he enjoyed it very much . He watched the caterpillars grow and turn into butterflies . He was very fascinated by the whole process and loved releasing the butterflies in our yard . I highly recommend this product . Also the product has a support site if you have any questions while raising your butterflies . Great fun .
3 #### Electronic or not , Battleship is a classic , but messy none the less . It 's loud and annoying . Learning to play the thing is half the battle .
5 #### Played this game at a family members house and had to get it . So much fun and its basically bingo / checkers with playing cards .
5 #### This kit is just an awesome thing for your entire family . Everyone at our house has enjoyed watching the ten caterpillars grow and form their chrysallis . And now we have 8 painted ladies flitting about the habitat . A friend told me they will go wild over watermelon , ca n't wait to try it . I plan to purchase a kit for two friends ( one age 7 and the other age 5 ) who have birthdays this summer . The only thing I would say is that it was a bit hard for my kids to wait for the larva to arrive in the mail . That was the only part that was disappointing for them . But of course , it was also a good lesson in patience . Goodness knows that never hurts . Ha ! ha ! This really is a great " toy " for either a girl or a boy and would be appropriate for a whole range of ages . I could even imagine adults / senior citizens enjoying watching this process !
5 #### At first , I hesitated purchasing the electronic edition of Battleship which cost $ 40 over the traditional one for $ 15 . I am so glad I purchased it ! I have 4 children , 3 of which are old enough to play and understand the game . They play for hours , with each winner playing the next person ! Definitely worth the money , and a great gift if you can put aside the actual battling aspect of the game !
5 #### Vibrant shades that keeps a 5 year old occupied
5 #### Please be aware that these are small tubs of Play - Doh . I am a teacher and I purchased these as prizes and give - aways . My students love them and often use them for stress release and keep them in their backpacks . I received an assortment of 10 different colors .
5 #### All of the colors of play doh is there . The packaging is easy to find . It can be put away very easy .
5 #### I have three kids and they all loved this gift . We paid the $ 3 ( I believe ) to get the butterflies . They arrived as promised a week or two later . We followed the slightly confusing directions and 4 out of the five larve turned into butterflies . It was kind of chilly so we waited to release them after a week when the weather warmed up . One of the butterlies died after about five days but the other three we released . Note- after they ' hatch ' , there is what appears to be blood on the netting of the habitat . My daughters and I were concerened that somehow they were hurt , but this is not the case . We looked it up and it is just part of the natural process and I believe is just extra coloring from wing developement . Make sure you explain that this could happen ahead of time just so kiddos do n't get scared that something is wrong . We are keeping the habitat and saving it to order more butterflies in a couple of months . I highly recommend this toy !
5 #### This is so interesting and fun for kids of all ages . This was purchased for my 6 year old , but the whole family ( and even the neighbor kids ) had fun watching the caterpillars change into butterflies . What a great toy ! There were a few times that I wondered if it was n't going to work , but after patiently waiting we were not disappointed ! ! Beware , our cat found it exciting , too , but despite the cat knocking over the caterpillar jar and the butterfly habitat , three of the five butterflies survived . Simply a wonderful toy . I would buy it again in a heartbeat .
1 #### Yes , it 's great to watch caterpillars grow , but this is NOT a kit to hatch them . The price you pay is for a pop up butterfly tent and a plastic pipette . The caterpillars cost you an additional $ 5 . I received this as a gift and was really disappointed I had to pay to get the caterpillars . Buyers , beware .
5 #### great for collectors f star wars and others . there is a chip that comes with the figure and you just put it on the com tech and the figures talk . thanks for your great service on this .
3 #### When this first came out at a price of $ 20(or however much it was a year ago ) , I said to myself that I would not be getting this UNLESS they did COMMtech chips for POTF figures . No way was I gon na spend $ 20 on this ! Well , I broke that rule . I bought it when it had been discounted to $ 10 . But I was not too impressed with it . Some of the chips were OK- giving off good lines and sounds . They improved as the figures came out . But the majority sounded nothing like who they were supposed to be . Then came the breakthrough : Power of the Force COMMtech chips ! Now these were the real deal . Han , Luke , Greedo , more are coming out after Leia , Darth Vader , and Admiral Motti . Next up Porkins , Obi - Wan , and Chewie(playing chess )
5 #### My five - year - old was learning about the butterfly 's life cycle at school and I thought getting this live butterfly garden would be a great idea , and it was ! We bought one through Amazon and another off a different site with the same wonderful results . Like many other reviewers have mentioned , it 's preferable that one waits until spring to order this as firstly , the larvae will not travel well in the cold weather , and secondly , releasing butterflies into the frigid cold would be a cruel thing to do . Also , the kit does NOT come with the larvae - you need to mail in the voucher that comes with the kit together with a minimal processing fee of three dollars and the company will send the larvae and food . We received five larvae in their own little container and food . All five turned into butterflies - and watching the entire process / life cycle is a wondrous experience indeed ! My daughter was amazed at how the caterpillars turned into chrysalis and finally transformed into butterflies - the expression on her face alone was worth the entire experiment . The butterflies are the painted lady variety and are beautiful to behold - we released them after a few days . This is a wonderful learning and observational tool which will encourage children 's interest in science and to appreciate the beauty of nature . Highly recommended !
5 #### We actually bought one of these two years ago . It was a fun and educuational project for my four kids . Make sure once the first butterfly emerges that you watch the rest of them very closely so you do n't miss the action ! All 5 of ours emerged within hours of each other . We have n't reused the habitat ( which would have been nice to do ) , as it costs just about as much to get a new pavillion as it does to buy " replacement " caterpillars .
5 #### Great Toy for hours of fun ... NO cheating with this electronic version . Great Sound affects . Good Choice .
5 #### Daughter loved these . We used them for her " Treasure box " prizes for potty training .
4 #### Great buy ! It was a good price , however 1 of the containers was n't all the way full and was kind of shriveled and dried up . Maybe the seal was n't tight for some reason .
5 #### There 's no real secret here - if play - doh makes it - it 's likely a good / great product and this is no different . Great color choices , still nice & moldable .
5 #### I 'm gon na get one of these ! I remember playing with this at my cousins ' house when I was a kid ! Ahh the memories !
5 #### I loved this game when I was younger and was so glad to be able to find another one I could use . Maybe I will even let my son get to use it too
4 #### I highly recommend this kit ! This is an good educational project that kids love . My older kids did this when they were young , so I bought this for my youngest daughter to experience this . Be aware that your kit wo n't come with live butterflies in it . You get a certificate inside to send away to order them . I remember sending in money to order the butterflies with the certificate . So if you are getting this as a gift , remember that the child wo n't get butterflies immediately and you should throw in some cash to purchase the butterflies . Check inside the box so you can see how much they are going to cost . It 's not that much more for the butterflies . It 's worth it . Make sure you also tell them to keep and read the informational pamphlet included . I think the pamphlet came with the butterflies , but it is very important to read . The book is an added bonus , so I got this particular habitat because of it . Just be aware that when you send your certificate in for your butterflies , you will not be getting MONARCH butterflies for your kit .
4 #### We received 4 live caterpillars and 4 great painted ladies emerged . They were so fun to watch and release . I only wish I 'd known we needed to buy the caterpillars beforehand . Customer service was great , too .
5 #### This is the greatest idea ever ! See , I 'm a kid with low self - esteem . I get bullied all the time and I 'm afraid to talk to girls . There 's really been no cure for problems like these , until now ! With Live Butterfly Garden , I can snag innocent butterflies from their comfortable habitat and force them to live a miserable life in a little confined cage net thing . My , how the tables have turned ! Now I 'm the one bossing others around ! Fly my underlings , fly ! Huh , you 're sleeping ? ! Lets see how sleepy you are when I vigorously shake your cage ! It 's really empowering bossing around these butterflies . Although this does n't change my school situation in the slightest , I 'm the master of my own domain come the weekend !
2 #### I was n't expecting these to be this small . From a great deal , it appeared to me like they were very expensive . I would get a lot cheaper elsewhere !
5 #### All the colors you need in good size containers . Product was not dried out when it was received , provides hours of fun for both child and adults !
4 #### This was a Christmas purchase in our house this year and we have found the game to be incredibly fun from the familiar classic level to the very strategious advanced level . The one drawback that we have found is the annoying fact that the pegs do not fit well in the vertical grid board and are always falling out , or in the case of the planes are sometimes impossible to get out without the pliers that we keep handy when we play . There are four holes on the grid that are part of the support pegs and these holes will not hold a peg for anything . This really detracts from an otherwise superb game .
5 #### Four - year - old and two - year - old grands were fascinated watching the development of THREE painted lady butterflies ... and then we released them ... FUN and EDUCATIONAL !
5 #### This is the second times we got this product . The first one was a birthday gift for my son who was 3 years old . This time I got it for him , as he really loves insects especially caterpillars and butterflies . He goes to park everyday to catch butterflies and then releases them after 1 or 2 days . We fed the flesh flowers sprayed with sugar water . We love this kit . We received the caterpillars about 1 - 2 weeks . All 5 caterpillars are alive . They were tiny , seeing them double in size everyday is amazing . After we release the butterflies , the butterfly garden is very useful for my son to keep the bugs he catches everyday .
5 #### Great value for the money . The kids love playdoh .
4 #### Colors are good . Play doh is play doh . Keep it covered it wo n't dry out . Only issue is that cans were smaller than I expected . My son was excited regardless as he got TEN colors of play doh to play with . And mix into one color within a week .
3 #### Small containers , hard to tell by picture , just ok for the price .
3 #### so I 'd highly recommend just buying a couple cans of the large playdoh . Reason being - if you have a 2 year old ... and you want her to somewhat play by herself ... you will constantly be changing out the color of playdoh in her hands if you by 10 different colors . The quality was pretty good - I felt like maybe the stuff I bought at the store was a little less dry ? But not sure - I do n't buy playdoh often .
5 #### We received our catepillars in a timely manner ( about 2 weeks ) . We received 5 catepillars . 4/5 made a cocoon . However , only one attached to the top of the container , so we had to move the oters by picking them up and transferring them into the butterfly home . I really did not think they would survive the move , as they were wiggling all about , but one hatched , and today we heard something , and sure enough we watched the cocoon turn into a butterfly . There is still one cocoon sitting on the bottom , and the one that DID attach and is hanging has still not " hatched " . This has been one of the best purchases I have ever made on amazon . We will be ordering more catepilllars soon !
5 #### Great toy . Easy for any baby to hold . Only wish there was a little ball inside the bell to make the bell a little louder and more fun .
5 #### My 4 month old granddaughter loved this . It was easy for her to handle and she seemed to enjoy the bright colors !
5 #### Fun game . Fun to play with a few people or a big group . Well made game too .
4 #### These are tiny . I should have looked at the dimensions . They are not full size . My son did love it though . Next time I will just buy some full size ones from Dollar General if they still sell them there .
5 #### well what can you not say about play doh ... It 's play doh .. it has given my grand sons and me enjoyment when we play with it and making / forming different things with it .
5 #### I put together a artist gift set of various art supplies for my 20 month old grandson , he loves every bit of it . If you are looking for a way to entertain a youngster , or teach them about art , and it helps build coordination as well .
5 #### My granddaughter ( age 10 ) bought this with her own money . It was a very interesting and exciting process to watch from caterpillar to butterfly . She took it everywhere she went to show others . She will always remember this experience .
4 #### Who does n't love play doh ! Played with almost daily at our house !
4 #### Its playdough , what more can I say ? Maybe a better variation of colors would be nice but the kids are n't complaining .
1 #### These are LITTLE cans , not regular size to the price is decieving .
5 #### This is a great toy for children , and they will love it . However , you as a parent will hate it . It is extremely loud and after your kids play it constantly for hours on end you are on the brink of insanity . So basically what you need to ask yourself is Are you more worried about your kids happiness or your own sanity . On the other hand it does help improve memory skills . Another game which is not quite as loud that is similar to this one is Simon 2 by Hasbro . I think this one is a little better though .
5 #### Perfect starter kit for my daughter . Great price too .
4 #### Thought it was full size , turned out to be the medium ( between the little ones and full size ) .
5 #### The Qualtiy is Great , the Delivery of my purchase was even better , I can not think of one bad thing to say ? as a Quality Manager for a huge company I am very happy with the Price and Quality of my Purchase .
5 #### We got this for my son when he was 9 . He is now 10 1/2 and still loves it and plays with it regularly . This is a good challenging game and even we , the parents love it . One thing my son loves about it , is that you can set it to play a variety of different games and when he gets really good with one game , there is another one to challenge him . He can play by himself or with others .
4 #### These are great , both my 2YO and 6YO have loved it ! Be aware though , you have to send away for the butterflies / food . It 's not a big deal - you fill out the enclosed card and send in $ 3 . However , if you 're giving this as a gift you may want to open the box & send away for the butterflies first . It 's a little disapointing for the kids to find just the empty bug house inside .
5 #### great game , fun to play for young and old . You can play it using a lot or a little strategy . I enjoy playing with my daughter
4 #### Received both games today , will be gifts for kids
5 #### Just as expected . Does n't stain ... Will get stuck on stuff . Keeps my son occupied for hours . Great to use at restaurant .
2 #### Tiny hard to open containers . Was expecting bigger containers for the price .
5 #### What kid does n't love play - doh ? Our two year old is no exception . He is always looking for different colors to use , so I like that is is a great variety . The containers are small , but a good enough size that they can be used to make all different sorts of creations . I think this product is a good value .
4 #### We got this for my 7 year old nephew . Within 30 minutes , the entire family was playing with this toy on the ' group ' setting , where you play and pass it . Everyone was addicted , and my brother phoned the next morning to tell me that as soon as my nephew woke up he wanted to play it more , and they played it for an hour ! A FUN toy , and great for co - ordination and speed !
5 #### VERY educational .... My 6 year old loves it ! ! ! It is NOT something that can be done without an adult . You will need to help your child every step of the way . It takes about 3 weeks for the entire process . When the Larva arrived it was alive and well . Age group : Kindergarten and up ! It 's an amazing project !
4 #### Great collection of colors that are different from the standard basic set - did n't realize the containers were so small ... my 5 year old grandson kept running out of the color he wanted ... but Play - Doh is always fun .
3 #### These are smaller containers then I expected . They are also very hard to open . The kids ca n't open them and I have a lot of trouble . There are other sets of Play - Doh ( at Toy R Us ) that are bigger and better ..
5 #### Just the right amount for our Granddaughter to play with .
4 #### Great little case of playdoh but these are the smaller containers not the standard sized ones .
5 #### Same as when I was young ... for great grandson ... first thing he did was try to eat ... A word to the wise ... supervise the little ones
5 #### How long has it been since * you * had a toy ? Yes , you ! If it 's been awhile , this is a great one to get . You can play it by yourself ( a great stress reliever ) , or with one or more other people . You have to be quick - they do n't give you long to " flick it " , " spin it " , " twist it " , " bop it " and " pull it " ! The music provides you with a rhythm and I find it a toss - up whether or not to go with the " music " and rhythm , or to do the required action the very second you know what to do . A good friend came and played it for the first time and was getting around 5 points for a couple times , then got something like 52 , which is our record . It 's a very fun game , and could be habit - forming ! The only downside is that it can be very annoying to listen to if you 're not the one playing it .
5 #### I bought this as a summer learning experience for my sons , ages 3.5 and 4.5 . It was such a fun thing for us to do together ! They were amazed by just how much the caterpillars grew during the first week . Transferring them to the " tent " after they were in their chrysallis form without disturbing them too much was tricky , but my husband and I managed . It definitely takes two adults . My sons ( and our two cats ) were thrilled to see them emerge as beautiful butterflies . In fact , my older son cried tonight when we released the five butterflies . He had become connected to them as he checked them each day to see their progress . We 're already planning on ordering more larvae so we can watch the entire process again . Just note that there is an additional $ [ ... ] S / H fee to get the larvae sent to you . I was n't aware of that when I purchased the kit online , however , the extra money was well worth it !
5 #### These are just the right size for my 2 year old , not too much for him to make a mess , just enough for him to make noodles with . He loves this stuff and there is enough of them to last a long time . This was a great buy for the money .
5 #### Great way to stock up on a variety of colors . Very afforadable and can use over and over as long as you close the lids after each use .
5 #### This is a really fun game , but somewhat easy - going . Definitely a classic , for me !
5 #### Highly recommend this Butterfly Garden - Easy to take care of - GREAT science learning experience . I have given several to my 7 grandkids over the years and they never get tired of them .
3 #### This is really very poorly made . Did n't take long for the handle to break off .
3 #### It 's hard to play because the game is small so kids move it and your hippo ca n't eat the little balls unless the game is totally flat . It 's ok to play but I should have just got the big set instead of the little one . I ordered this one instead because i did n't want to have to worry about losing the marbles or any kid putting them in their mouth . This one is all enclosed which is nice but its cheaply made and hard for the kids to actually play .
5 #### great no marbles everywhere . my granddaughter loves Doc McStuffin so she calls it gobby gators
4 #### Cans of Play - Doh were very small , but the colors were great !
3 #### I used it as an add - on becasue my daughter LOVES playdoh and will play with it for hours . I am totally at fault because I did n't read the product description , but these are really small tubs . Really small . That was pretty disappointing for what I paid for it , but oh well . At least she is having fun and I learned my lesson !
4 #### The cans are * VERY * small . But hey , it was cheap so I should n't complain too much . Not too bad for little kids and you do get alot of colors in this pack . These cans are way smaller than they used to be when I was a kid . It 's incredible how much the cans have shrunk ! I guess to save money & make more profits , companies are putting things in smaller containers these days . So if you are thinking can of play - doh like they used to have in the 70 's , forget it . These cans are way smaller . But if you can find this at a really good price here on Amazon , it 's still a good buy because of the price and the number of cans you get .
5 #### Perfect size playdoh containers for little hands , however the lid is very tough to open , it 's on there ! great price .
5 #### My kids ages 11 - 14 boys and girls . Love this game . They gave played for hours . A must get . My husband and friends even enjoyed this as well and they never like games .
5 #### I love this game . It 's simple and fairly quick . My 5 year old understands the simple rules . My 10 year old has taught a couple of friends . It 's so fun ! I had never heard of it until someone brought it out on a game night . Highly recommend .
5 #### I loved that the balls were contained in this version !
1 #### Cheap and does n't really work well . Instead of feeling like a quick travel Hungry Hungry Hippos game , this feels like a cheap cash - in to fool people . Avoid this product
5 #### So fun ! My 8 and 9 year old sons love to play this game ! This super fun , a thinking game , and something the whole family will enjoy . Grown - ups too !
5 #### play doh ! what else can I say ? Every kid loves it !
5 #### You can never have too much Play - Doh on hand when grandchildren come over ; love the range of colors in this group .
1 #### Buyer Beware ! If I had read the 1 star reviews before purchasing , I would have noticed that this " case of colors " is really a 10 pack of mini - playdoh tubs , not the full sized ones . Not a bargain , at all , but since I ca n't return them , well , live and learn .
5 #### My girl really love to play with Play - Doh even now she going to 7 but she still love to play with it :)
5 #### This was bought as a b - day present to go along w/2 Play - Doh Kits . The mom said that 3 of the four kids ( # 4 is only a year ) are always asking her to get the Play Doh out for them .
3 #### In theory , this is a great toy . We got this for our 5 - year - old son to play while out and about . Only after a few times did the handle on one of hippos fall off .
2 #### waaaayyy too small .. even for a travel toy . The balls get stuck inside .. you have to shake it to release them . Sitting in the yard sale pile !
4 #### The little balls get stuck in the corners sometimes .
3 #### It 's okay . It is sometimes hard to use . I like that the balls can not escape the game .
1 #### Returned it . No longer the one pictured in the photo ( the pink and yellow pair ) . Now much flimsier and does n't work well .
2 #### This item is very small and breaks easy . Not good for travel as the small marbles go f lying all over the place .
1 #### I totally agree with past comments about the head not always going up and the balls not going in . My 3 year old decided it was n't a fun game because it was " broken " . lol - i donated it to HOPE , maybe someone else can have fun figuring it out ...
3 #### So so game . My niece keeps going back to it , but loses interest pretty quickly . It 's really not as good as original hungry hippos .
5 #### Lots of fun colors . containers are quite small , so a bit hard to get the dough out & back in , tho .
5 #### These are great for my kids . They get 1 tub of playdough and pick the color they want if it gets messed up or yuckie then it gets thrown away . The tub is a perfect size for single use . when I get down too about 3 tubs i just reorder some more . Its easy and cleaning it is cake . Mommy could n't ask for more .
2 #### These are very small . I can get more for the same price at my grocery store .
5 #### Not dried out , just like you 'd buy in the store !
4 #### Fun game for the whole family - really enjoying it .
2 #### I like the regular Boggle , this one just seems to be a waste of money when you can make the regular version adaptable to a younger child . My 5 year old did not find it as a game , he was extremely bored with it . Also , I can do this with a set of flash cars and letters .
1 #### Missing some of the dice . I ordered a new game but received a used game with missing pieces . This was a Christmas gift so I ca nt return it .
3 #### Great concept . Does nt keep the attention span too long
3 #### I thought these were the larger containers of Play - Doh ; that was my own fault . I bought this case to use as an activity at a birthday party and they were still enjoyed just the same .
5 #### great set . my 3 year old enjoys play doh and mixing the colors . good variety
5 #### Happy times with these containers . Could n't be more pleased . Great deal .
4 #### My oldest had the original Hungry Hungry Hippos game , I remember it being loud , a pain in the neck , marbles always being lost and it ended up in the garbage . When my youngest now asked for it , I tried this version . It is small and only 2 players , but much less noise , much better made and the clear dome means no more losing our marbles . I 'm pretty happy with it , though quite honestly the game gets pretty boring ( even the original bigger version ) . I think it will be good for road trips though .
4 #### Fun game for two . Nice that the balls ca n't come out ( or you have other problems ! ) . Great for travel . Great to practice counting ( balls collected ) and the concept of Less / More . FYI - this is not a quiet game , so airplane usage could be iffy , but certainly great for car travel .
4 #### Have had this game with children . Just do n't have enough pieces
4 #### Our four year old likes to play this game .
4 #### Would have given it five stars but three of the cars ripped when we were trying to get them off the holder . It 's cute and easy to play .
4 #### It is a learning game for one . My daughter likes it because she can play by herself and peak . It is a good way for her to start learning words for reading and spelling .
5 #### Excelente educational toy , came on time and perfect packed , my son loves this toy and in general I m very satisfied thank you . I 'm definitely recommend this store .
2 #### I got this thinking it would a great little toy for my toddler , but i could n't even get the hippos to ' eat ' the balls . The mechanism keeps getting jammed , the balls keep getting stuck in between the hippo and the plastic dome ... i got frustrated with it so i could only imagine the melt down with my child . It does say 4 and up , but i am well over 4 and i could n't get the toy to work . waste of money , get the real one .
5 #### When playing it 's almost random on who wins , so the effort / work for both players can be the same and both will win about the same number of times . With 10 balls used , ties are also possible . It 's good that no pieces can be lost . My daughter likes to be the one to re - deploy the balls into the arena . This game may break easily , but for about $ 7 , I 'll just buy another one . UPDATE : We have played this game maybe 120 times , and it has n't broken yet .
4 #### This is a nice compact travel game . My son loves to play with this but it was not too durable . One hippo did n't work anymore and can not get the balls as quickly as the other hippo so there was always an unfair advantage when playing with this game if one hippo is not working .
5 #### This is small , but the kids still play with it from time to time . They do n't play long , but they do come back to it which is good that they do n't leave it behind . It 's hard to keep still even for their little hands because it 's so small so I ca nt ' play with them , but they play together ok .
4 #### Great , classic game that 's now portable . The only issue is that the marbles sometimes fall down the side ledges and out of play . This is still a worthwhile buy .
5 #### Bought these for party favors & when you divide the cost per child , you just got a great deal . Love buying the Add On Items , some real deals ! Genius on the part of Amazon , always keep me spending more !
5 #### Play - doh is great . I wish it did n't dry out so easily , but that 's just the way it goes . These are lots of different colors , fun to mix , and fun to play with .
5 #### Who does n't love playdo - my boy loves the range of colours . Compact containers so great for travelling .
1 #### Ca n't ever go wrong with play - doh even in teeny weeny containers
4 #### I bought this game as an alternative to buying the full sized due to the marbles . I have a child under 1 still at home that likes to put things in her mouth . This version of Hungry Hungry Hippos is great because the balls are contained . With the full version , the marbles are loose , can get lost or swallowed . The only downfall is that this smaller version is only for 2 players . I recommend !
3 #### I loved this as a kid , still like it now as an adult . Read the reviews about the flimsy quality and it is n't as well made as I would like BUT we did n't have any problems using it , and it is still working 9 months after purchase . It is fun and is small enough for car or plane . It has no educational value that I could determine .
5 #### This is a wonderful game for my 4 year old who is starting to recognize letters and words .
5 #### I bought for my nephew who is learning his letters and sight words . He loves playing it !
4 #### We have really enjoyed this game . There are two versions to play , allowing the game to be useful at different ages . I do find it a little hard to play the easiest level with my 5 yr old son as it seems kind of pointless to me , but it engages him and my 8 yr old daughter is able to play down to his level . The higher level of play is more fun to play with my daughter .
3 #### For the great deal , I purchased these without looking at the size . I was thinking they might be the bigger cups but they were actually the smaller sized cups . Great for one kid , but not two .
5 #### Playdoh was as expected ... playdohy , colorful , and full of promise of plenty of mess and picking it out of my carpet in the near future . Son loves the stuff so I will continue to buy it .
5 #### Enjoyed by grand children . the game allows us more interaction and for the family it was great . Still playing days later
5 #### Great fun for kids and adults . And families that play together stay together . My gand sons , ages 6 - 8 love this game .
5 #### Son loves the game and loves to invite his friends over to the house to play . A little different spin on the traditional Monopoly - instead of developing the concept of financial exchange with money , this game translates financial value into " presents " at a party . Yes you have to pay if you land on a position that has a party going on ( and all of them do ) but you pay more if a present instead of a hotel is on site . Seems odd to me , but the children like the game !
5 #### My 4 - year - old loves playing this games . It is kid - friendly version of Monopoly . The game last about 20 minutes , which is long enough . She enjoys handing out the party cards and distributing the money . The product was delivered on time and was as described .
5 #### Got this as my contribution for family game night and included in a gift box for my niece . She had heard about it and was excited . Packed well , arrived as promised in excellent condition .
4 #### Bought this one on a whim with Pop Up Pirate so that there would be some " easy " and silly games in the house , and this one was an instant favorite for my 4YO and the family members that are frustrated by strategy games . Now they have 2 games they can play with her ! I love it because the marbles stay in that plastic globe and are n't flying all over the place ... And although it 's kind of loud , it 's NOTHING compared to the " original " Hungry Hippos , with 4 of those plastic things whacking away . And though she and I only play it a couple of times a week , it keeps a favorite place on our coffee table . Totally worth the price .
5 #### I like this because it is small , easy to pack and you wo n't lose the marbles . We really enjoyed playing this game .
3 #### We bought this four our son and daughter because the reviews of the big one say they are garbage any more . It is a christmas present , so I can not comment on the toy itself yet .
5 #### We got this for my daughter originally just because she wanted it . However , I found that this was actually a really great teaching tool for teaching basic addition and subtraction and how to manage money . We bought it when she was 5 ( almost 6 ) and now that she is 7 1/2 she still loves it .
5 #### We bought this for our 4 and 6 year olds for Christmas . We played it four times the first day . The four year old one 3 times , the size year old the other time . No we did not let them win . Mean kids ! Anyway . Yes - good game . Does n't last too long so no one gets bored . Great introduction to a classic game .
5 #### kids just love it ! i keep buying more and more play dough . Its worth every penny for the fun and creations kids make out of it
3 #### Since I do n't know what the normal oz . are in a play doh can , I was pretty shocked at how small these are . If you 're not good with oz ..... the can size is seriously about 2 inches tall if that gives you an idea of how much playdoh is in each can .
5 #### had plenty of play time with this product . My princess loves it and it keeps her busy , would buy it again .
4 #### I 'm sure it would be good for multiple children to play together ; but when there 's only one child in the family and a bunch of adults , it 's pretty boring . My 5 - year - old nephew is advanced and does n't need to see the word at all like the instructions say . So , we just keep it covered and he looks at the picture and says what it is , then spells it .
5 #### This is a fun game for my 8 & 9 year old .
5 #### Boggle junior is the perfect game for the little ones that ca n't play the regular boggle . They allow the adults to play while they play with their own . As a great fan of all word games I buy these as gifts for the children in my life .
4 #### Fun game . Very straight forward and easy to learn . It 's a bit too luck driven with the Jack 's typically dominating the game , or simply drawing a sequence of numbers where your opponent might not but still a fun entry - level game , especially for the price .
5 #### My 6 year old son loves this game ! He played the junior version with a younger friend and I really had to talk him into buying this one so he would n't grow out of it too quickly . This was the right choice for him and he no longer minds the lack of colorful pictures . A mix of strategy and luck , it entertained the whole family including grandparents .
5 #### I found this game in micro pub . I loved it and ordered it for my kids . The strategy element is awesome ! I have been so impressed with how my kids have chosen this game over their cell phone games ! Easy and fun to play .
5 #### I forgot to mention that you need a long thin phillips screwdriver to put the batteries in it since they go under the smokestack , which is something I could n't find right away & could be a problem if you 've got kids jumping up & down wanting to play .
5 #### My 5 and 6 year old love playing Monopoly withmy husband and I so I was excited to try this out . Its a huge hit ! I played with them the first time so I can explain how to play as we went along and now that they know how , they can play just the two of them if they wanted . Although I do enjoy playing with them . I really like that the bills are small so they can easily count money themselves . This game is so much better for them than the regular Monopoly because of how easy it is and we can actually play from begining to end without getting bored of it . And I have to say that I love the whole " Go to lunch " instead of " Go to jail " . Such a great game for kids . I would highly recommend this game ! We love it !
5 #### I purchased this classic Play - doh , but with new colors . My grandson loves it . It does not crumble and or dry out too quickly . We are very pleased with this purchase .
3 #### Ok is it just me , are alll play - doh lids THIS hard to open ? It seriously hurts my fingers every single time ! Even after opening many many times the lids have not loosened . I mean its nice that they wo n't dry out easily because the lids are so tight , but seriously , ouch ! And nevermind my 4.5 year old having any independence while playing with these , there is no way he would ever be able to open by himself and I 'm not going to open all 10 just in case he wants that color . So there 's my rant ... Otherwise I do like that they are in small containers ( Which i did n't pay much attention when ordering so I did n't realize how small they were going to be . ) But its nice to have lots of small colors instead of a few large ones because in a few months they 've all been mixed together anyways by the kids . Nice and soft , does n't leave hands feeling yucky , endless fun :-)
5 #### I bought one case of Play - Doh plus two separate bags of " tools " for my grands . Opening a fresh canister of Play - Doh , taking a sniff , and working the contents through your fingers remains one of the simple joys of life , no matter what your age is . This product is just right for creative kids and nostalgic and/or Zen - moment - seeking adults .
5 #### I thought these were full size containers but they were a bit smaller than I thought . For the price its still a really good deal . 10 different colors keep things interesting and gives a lot of variety .
5 #### Ordered for our 4 year old grandson who loves Play - Doh . These are not the big cans , they are smaller , but the right quantity for play time fun .
5 #### A great art / toy for children . Super fun , and requires not batteries ! And they can use their imagination ! Hours and hours of fun for a very good price !
5 #### When I ordered this case , I knew there were a lot in there . When it arrived , I was still shocked at the amount ... I would not hesitate to order it again if the opportunity arose .
5 #### Years later n we still have it n play it :)
4 #### This is a nice , simple " game " . It is really more of a game version of flash cards , but it keeps my pre - k daughters interest . It makes learning spelling and letters more fun . I would not recommend for kids older than kindergarten .
2 #### Kids did n't play with as much as I thought they would
5 #### This game has been great for my 3yr old and my 2nd grader . There are cards that are two sided . One side has three letter words that are matched with a picture . The other side has more blends for 4 letter words with pictures . My 3 yr old can look at the word and find the matching letters to make the word . My 2nd grader can look at the word then cover it with the flap on the board and look for the listening sounds .
5 #### Most junior versions of games are just a simplified version of the original . I love this one since it 's a bit different . Rather than the general idea of a city with famous streets , railroads , and utilities play is centered around an amusement park . It 's much more fun for little kids and appeals to their imaginations a bit more . As an added plus it helps kids practice their math skills .
3 #### I bought these for Easter to mix in with the eggs . I had forgotten they were so small otherwise I would n't have bought them as they do n't hold a lot of play doh and they hurt my fingers to open . Bigger pots are much easier to open . As other customers have said , you can get play - doh for cheaper prices elsewhere which is what I 'll do next time .
5 #### Yup . It 's a pack of play doh colors . Just like it says . Kids love it . Which is what I wanted it for .
5 #### This is exactly what I was hoping for . it has stayed pliable and soft for weeks . We do n't use it for extended period of time at any one use or we switch colors to keep it from drying out . It has vivid bright colors and is so fun to play with . Much better than I remember growing up and much better than any recipe I have tried . Yes this is a little stinky and VERY salty , but I am fine with that .
5 #### Who does n't love play doh ? we donated a case of colors to a silent auction for my son 's preschool and another toward a classroom .
5 #### What can I say , Play - doh , I hate it , my son of course loves this stuff and he plays for hours and eventually they all end up one color , but he can got several play days out of this set . Good set .
2 #### The play - doh itself ? Of course that is great . The size however . I thought I was getting full size containers . These are small . Not the tiny Halloween sized one but small . For the price I could have got more at target .
5 #### Brio 's lineup of battery operated engines leave the Thomas the Train lineup of battery - operated engines in the dust , and this one is the leader of the pack . Our kids love playing with all of them , but the Brio ones just seem to be more reliable , and it 's not really hit - or - miss . The Mighty Red Locomotive is especially great because : 1 . It 's got a switch to put it in neutral if your kiddo wants to push it around , saving the motor and gears from extra grinding . 2 . It takes two AAA batteries instead of just one , and the extra voltage seems to give it the extra oomph an engine needs to pull more than a couple cars at a time , especially if the track layout is n't exactly perfect . 3 . Goes both forward and reverse . 4 . It 's red .
4 #### I hate buying batteries and therefore try to not have toys that take them in our house . This is such a big hit that I can somewhat look passed it . I like that it can go forward or backwards and it does a good job pulling 2 - 3 train cars . I just wish the battery life was a bit longer , although even when it 's dead it still gets played with so I guess it 's not so bad .
5 #### I ordered two of these for my son 's BRIO train collection . I love that they are strong enough to pull multiple cars and they work with cars from other train collections . He loves that they make noise !
5 #### Because of the good reviews of a Brio battery train , I went ahead and spent the money . I 'm glad I did - it 's a well made toy and goes and goes . It can pull around 5 other little trains up and down and around corners with ease . I 'm looking to buy another soon .
5 #### First , please be aware this is a toy . It 's not a real stem locomotive . I say that because I 've seen reviews for this complaining about power . Excuse me , but I 've seen this engine pull 10 Brio cars UP and incline . Did it go slow ? Yah , duh . But it did it . I have not found a better electric engine . Forget push - trains . Get this .
4 #### Bought this for our 15 month old grandson . He likes to push the clown back in but is n't adept enough to hold and wind the crank yet . It also has a wheel that turns and clicks , as well as a button the squeaks when you push it . Hopefully he will be able to work it by himself soon .
5 #### Great game for kids learning to read and spell !
5 #### I am a school - based OT with a son in 4k who struggles with letter recognition and sounds ( a requirement for him to move to 5k ) . This game has been a fun way to practice at home . It is motivating because his older brother can play with him as well !
5 #### Perfect ! Great way to teach spelling to younger kids !
2 #### I thought this was a game for 2 players but there is only one card / letter cube holder . I guess we can play by just setting the letter cubes on the card . My kids are good at taking turns and sharing but it would be nice if they could play at the same time . Especially since they are preschoolers . Also seems expensive for what it is at $ 13 . Disappointing for sure . We have not played yet- but at first glance- it was not what I expected at all .
5 #### My 4 & 5 year old daughters LOVE this game ! I love that they can play together or solo .
5 #### This is perfect for my son ! He loves to spell out words and asks to play this game often . He is 4 years old .
5 #### Amazing . Love it . Not much else to say .. Its a classic and we ca n't wait to use it !
5 #### With the instructions , a power tool and a little patience , this was easy to build . It took about 30 minutes . The tires smell funny , but that 's because they 're new . We used it for trick - or - treating and it carried two six - year - old children all through the neighborhood . Trick or Treat ! Treat !
4 #### I love this ! Easy to assemble . The only 2 issue I have are .. the tires have a strong order even days later , geez it smells like a tire shop in our home . Also I wish ( for safety reasons ) that the handle could be locked in place to prevent it from slamming down on a person or thing
4 #### This is n't the same Radio Flyer from my childhood . The steering mechanism is kind of cheesy and it feels like it could break any moment . The metal is thinner overall and mine has a big dent in the front from the handle hitting it already . My son loves it though and that is what matters . We had fun putting it together but Its not going to be an heirloom toy though .
5 #### You want some fun ? Buy this game ! It can work both ways as a party starter for a group of people or a quiet game , our family loves it . Everywhere we go everyone asks did you bring Sequence . My daughter loves it too great family/ good time game
5 #### This is a fun game for my 5 year old daughter . She wants to play it everyday and it 's not near the tedious game it is with the adult version . Definately recommend .
5 #### I gave this to my 6 year old niece for her Birthday and she loves it . I 'm told by her mother she plays it all the time . What 's good about this game is that my niece along with having fun is also learning as well . She 's learning about money and practicing her math skills . The game also helps her to learn to follow directions and take turns . Her favorite part about the game is winning . This game also takes a lot less time to finish than regular Monopoly which is good for childrens short attention span .
4 #### Got this for my son ( 6 1/2 ) for Christmas , as he 's really into the more grown - up style games , but does n't have the patience for all - out Monopoly . My brother had this when he was younger , so I knew a bit about it already . There are no property cards to have to keep track of , no houses or hotels to jack up rent , and the dollar amounts are smaller so it 's easier for younger kids to do the math when they are buying , selling , and paying opponents . My son really enjoys it , so I was glad I could find it for him .
5 #### This game is a lot of fun ! My children love it ! I wrote a detailed review on my blog , I loved it so much ! This game was a present for my oldest daughter from Santa . However , my four year old loves the game as well . It is easy to play and does not take nearly as much time as traditional monopoly . I would say one game lasts anywhere from 30 - 45 minutes .
5 #### My son is 5 years old . He was thrilled with this present . It is a great starter to teach children about money and value . The pieces are big enough for small fingers to handle easily . The instructions are simple enough for my 5 year old to get the hang of the game by playing it once .
5 #### I bought this extra set for my Granddaughter 's birthday , along with the Ice Cream Playset . Affordable and made a nice addition to the gift .
5 #### This was a great purchase as we have loads of colors and choices . The size containers was great , as sometimes it 's out too long and you loose product with drying out . This allows smaller waste if that occures .
5 #### Great product and my kids have enjoyed it . I got it before the date given which was a plus . The only thing I failed to look at was the size of the containers . These were tiny ! Then again , it was my fault .
5 #### Great colors and lots of fun . My 3 year old loves them . The play - doh was soft and easy to remove and play with . The containers are pretty durable so it 's nice to store the play - doh back in there
5 #### These are little cans , but they hold just the right amount for little hands . I like the black one best !
5 #### My grandson and I love to make things and Play - Doh is one of our favorite crafting tools . Ca n't wait to see what we make this week !
5 #### Small containers of play - doh but worth the price . I thought they would be the full size . Would still buy again .
5 #### This is one of my favorites -- it just does its thing all day long . It wo n't pull a super - long train up hills , but it is the BEST engine for testing new layouts that the kids create -- it shows them which turns are too tight , which slopes are too steep , which connections are too sloppy . Notes : It turns itself off after 4 minutes of no touch -- 4 minutes seems too long . It is difficult to change the AAA batteries -- the little screw is located in the smokestack . Forward and reverse directions . Back when we got this , they ran about $ 40 -- that seems about right for all the fun we have with it .
5 #### I have read the other reviews . I do nt ' know if we are just lucky or if things have changed with this train . We have had this train for several years now . It has been a sturdy long lasting train . This is one of the go to train engines in our train building / playing . It will pull other train pieces up hills and around corners . It will not pull up a lot of pieces but four or five it will pull behind him without any problem . We have found it helps to build your train on a sold piece of ground ( like the kitchen tiled floor ) . We have also found it will not take overly sharp corners like some of the fancier pieces that you can buy will make . However , we rarely have problems and my kids love this train piece . The one negative- it eats batteries like crazy . Enjoy .
5 #### I do not know why so many of the other reviewers have problems with this locomotive . Maybe they got an early version or something . I received mine yesterday and it runs just fine up and down hills , in and out of curves as well as with and without wagons ( I have been testing it with up to six wagons without problems even on hills ) . The locomotive is much stronger and faster than the smaller battery driven engines . It is also easier to control than these engines as the control buttons are larger . It may be used as a traditional hand - pushed locomotive by switching the last button ( this is also a feature not found on the smaller engines ) . And finally it generates sound whenever it starts moving ( the sound last for about 5 seconds and then it shuts up ) . So , all in all , this locomotive has been a great investment . Check it out if you are running a battery powered Brio railway .
3 #### I thought these were the larger size play dohs but they were tiny . My fault for not paying attention but my kids are happy nonetheless
5 #### The colors are bright and the quantity is just enough for her to be able to maneuver it . The price was just right and as long as we keep them in the jars included they have n't dried out significantly . And the ones that have dried out slightly due to overuse ( pink and red ) , I was able to re hydrate them using instruction that come with the box .
4 #### I shy away from playing board games with small children because it 's hard enough for me to figure out the directions , but then I have to teach a game I 'm not familiar with to a youngster , well ... it 's too much for this old girl sometimes ! But , not so with this game . The directions were easy to follow , the game itself is easy to play , fun , fast and entertaining , even for adults . Do n't be afraid to give this one a try !
4 #### This is a very cool game for kids learning basic math . It 's fun , and it 's very simple . My husband complains about some of the rules , like that on some of the chance cards you can just " take " people properties . But he is a die hard real Monopoly player . I believe it is very suitable for children .
4 #### We bought this game for our 5 year old daughter . She seemed interested at first but got bored after about 15 minutes . We have not played the game since . My wife and myself liked the game ( it brought us back to our childhood ) . In a few years I think my daughter will like it but for now it takes a little too long and does n't hold her attention .
5 #### Let 's face it , Monopoly can get very long and is certainly not fast paced enough for a younger child nor is it simple enough for one . Monopoly Jr. is the perfect way to take a great adult game and make it pleasing for the younger crowd . It is based on a theme park with ticket booths , rides , and vendor stands . There are still properties , actually , ticket booths ( although you do n't have a choice to buy them , if you land on it you must purchase it ) . There is money and chance cards . Everything is much more simple and yet moves at a fast enough pace to keep even a 5 year old engaged . If you land on a ticket booth that is not yours , you must pay . And like regular Monopoly , if you own all the colors in that set , rent is doubled . So children need to understand how much it costs for one and for two . They also need to pay attention to their properties to make sure other players are n't passing by without forking over the dough . We have found nothing yet that would improve on this version of Monopoly and I have purchased a number of them as birthday presents . I would recommend this for ages 5 - 10 . As a parent , I do n't mind playing this one over and over . The game changes each time and the thrill of getting the dark blue properties just before GO is still there .
5 #### This is an easy to learn game that has a different game play every time ! It 's a bit of bingo and poker combined . You can have 2 - 3 teams of single players or multiple players . The object of the game is to create a 5 card sequence much like bingo . Players put down a card and add a chip to one of the 2 locations of that card on the board . Although the goal is to create a 5 card sequence , players can strategically place chips to block the others . The twists are the one - eye jacks ( can remove a chip from your opponent 's growing sequence ) and the two - eye jacks ( wild card that allows you to place your chip anywhere on the board ) . My 13 and 10 year - olds really enjoy the game . It captured their attention for 3 - 4 rounds in one sitting . As compared to the multi - page instructions of the Euro - games , this game is more approachable both in terms of complexity and set - up . In addition , its affordable cost is excellent for multi - generational families . An 8 year old child will have as much fun as an an 80 year old great grandmother !
2 #### Child did n't get it . Mom did n't see the fun in it either . Maybe we 're missing something ? I 'm a literature nut , the child reads quite well for her age but neither of us enjoyed this game .
5 #### Fun game ! My son likes it . I learned how to spell using Boggle when I was a kid . Hope it will help my son
5 #### My kids pull this around every where . The nostalgic me says every kid should have a retro , medal , Radio Flyer .
5 #### My 3 & 4 year old grandsons are heavy into play - doh and it seems we never have enough . When I saw these as a low - price add - on gift , it was a no - brainer !
5 #### Who does n't like Play - Doh ? This collection of colors is wonderful and will be used a lot at my house when the grandkids come over . Nice price Amazon !
4 #### These smaller than regular size tubs are difficult to open . No child can do it , my fingers are still sore from prying the different color tubs open , because of course she had to try every color right away .
5 #### Hard to go wrong here . The kids love this stuff and , if isolated , it does n't make too much of a mess . I got two of these and we just made it through one .
1 #### it is my own fault for not reading the description closer , but these are the little tiny cans . I paid around $ 8 , and it was a total rip off compared to buying the big containers at Walmart . I 'll be more careful next time .
5 #### How do you write a bad review for playdough ? Maybe I was lucky , but I got all different colors , all soft and pliable , nice packaging , and two day shipping . It might be all of a dollar or so cheaper in the stores , but when you live in the middle of nowhere , Amazon is your best friend in shopping . I bough this item several months ago and just got around to writing this review . The playdough is well used and still in great shape .
5 #### My husband and I love Monopoly but needed something simpler to play it with our 4 - year - old and the Monopoly Junior Edition fits the bill perfectly . The premise is simple and easy to understand , making it fun for our child . The game includes little ticket booths in various colors [ to correspond to one 's chosen token ] that can be ' purchased ' and put on different places on the board , and which can then be used to charge ' rent ' when another player 's token lands on it . The currency denomination comes in $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , $ 4 , and $ 5 and our 4 - year - old was able to handle giving and taking of ' currency ' quite well . The only thing that we had to help her with was reading out the " Chance " cards which require some level of reading skill . Other than that , this is a fun game with simple rules that is not as competitive as the more grown - up version of Monopoly [ which can even test the mettle of seasoned players ! ] . If your family loves Monopoly and wish to include young members in the game , then the Junior Monopoly may just fit the bill .
4 #### Although some adults might feel a slight twinge of regret seeing a " new " version of a classic game they grew up playing , this version is much better suited to very young players ( four or five - year olds , perhaps ? ) The rules are much simpler , the rewards come quicker and playtime is greatly accelerated -- teach your kids the basics of capitalism in mere minutes ! I 'm not wild about some of the property titles ( the board is meant to reflect an amusement park and has lots of properties named after junk food and some soon - to - be - dated cultural references , such as the " American Idol " TV show ) but overall , this is a good introductory kid 's game , and is definitely worth picking up . ( Joe Sixpack , ReadThatAgain children 's media reviews )
5 #### My son is 5 and loves it ! Easy to play ... learn math ... Great fun & educational too !
5 #### I got this for my daughter for Christmas ! She loves the original Monopoly I thought she would enjoy this version.(more geared to her age level ) I was right , she LOVES it ! ! Its simple and easy to play , and it makes it fun for kids to play for long periods of time if they want to . Teaches beginning math and reading skills . I would Recommend to any parent who loves Monopoly !
5 #### Sturdy and wonderful . It is n't super loud which is a huge plus !
2 #### I was excited to find this toy because it uses the winding motion of a jack - in - the - box but is sized for little fingers . LIke all the Tolo toys we have , it is bright and colorful , but we seem to have gotten a defective unit . The little man pops up in the middle of the song ( " This Old Man " ) instead of at the end . Frustrating . I notice also that our 2yo has trouble pushing the little man back down -- he wo n't stay . I can do it , but it takes a delicate touch , something toddlers do NOT have . In addition , the squeaky button on the side is hard for little hands to push , and even in big hands it sometimes squeaks , sometimes not . If it worked right it might be good , but as it is we are disappointed , and ca n't recommend it .
5 #### I remember playing this game as a kid and I just bought it for my 3 year old son who 's learning to read . While he may be still a bit on the younger side , he does enjoy matching up the letters to spell the words . It 's a great , fun way for him to learn to spell and read .
3 #### It was much cheaper than I thought it would be , but for the money it makes sense .
2 #### Not really a true game . It 's just lettered blocks and some cards . The instructions just said here are some " suggested " ways to play , make up your own version .
5 #### My daughter loves this game and I love that she is able to learn while playing it .
5 #### Great game for a child ! My 2.5 year old plays it in short spurts .
5 #### A fun learning game for centers in my first grade classroom !
5 #### The little grand kids love playing with this at our house . But better yet , we use it as refills for the creative clay in our Cranium games . The clay only lasts so long , and play doh is a great substitute .
4 #### The description does say " 2 oz cans " , but I had n't thought about how small this is . Still , it is nicely packaged -- a little box with the tops showing the colors , neatly shrink - wrapped . It would be good for especially small hands , or when you want a bunch of colors that do n't take up much space . Nice - looking for a gift , but do n't buy if you want full - sized cans of Play - Doh .
5 #### this is a lot of fun , the kids love to play with play doh and this just keeps them even busier sitting in one spot at a time . YAY !
3 #### I know it says the oz on the product description but who honestly knows how many oz the standard play - doh size is ? My kid ate the label off those months ago .
5 #### Always go with the original stuff . Play - doh is play - doh . The containers are the smaller ones , so do n't get in a huffy when you do n't get the big containers .
3 #### This is the classic game Monopoly simplified to the point where there is no strategy whatsoever ( and therefore no linking of decisions with consequences ) but I must admit that my five - year - old loves it and it may get him interested in the real game someday . Not only is it reduced to pure chance , but the rules are written so that the games are very short , since you lose when you run out of cash regardless of how many " ticket booths " you have on the board . The rules are written so you are forced to buy properties you land on , and you end up paying up a lot before your cash flow builds ( and this is with only my son and I playing , the effect would be greatly multiplied with three or four playing ) . On top of that , the board is little so that if you are in the habit of rolling the dice in the middle of the board , you are continually knocking the " ticket booths " off their properties , and if that were n't enough , the actual tokens are so big that only two can fit on a given square , but the game can be played by up to four people . So , for new depths in fun - for - kids - while - parents - suffer , try this game . Too bad it could n't have been made interesting for kids and their parents .
5 #### This is mine and my husband 's favorite game . When we come to my mom 's to visit , my family all get together and play games . I do n't want to have to travel with ours , so I bought one for her house . Super fun game .
4 #### Bought this as a gift . I am sure will be fine . Fun game , we have this game as well
5 #### Love this game ! We can play it just the two of us or play it as a group ! Easy to learn rules fast but still super fun !
5 #### Easy to put together . The instructions can be better to depict parts sizes though , namely the nuts and bolts .
5 #### Great for hauling boxes from storage and hauling things for picnic and also hauling little children .
4 #### Received the package on the date that was promised . The playdoh containers are of regular size not the mini ones that you sometimes get for free at various places . So , i think for this price , 10 containers of regular sized playdoh are a decent deal .
4 #### The container sizes always make it hard for me to tell which set is offering the best deal . If this is currently priced at $ 5 , you are getting four ounces for a dollar . The other sizes seem to give you at least 4.5 ounces for a dollar . By the way , play doh is made of wheat , so be cautious if it 's going be be around someone with celiac disease .
3 #### Great colors and good price , but I think my husband thought these were standard size play - doh containers . They are not . They are more like party grab bag size .
5 #### It 's play - doh ! Has n't changed since I was a kid . I liked the smaller containers ( do n't feel as bad tossing one when it dries out ) . The colors are bright ! Perfect for all the play - doh factory type toys where it all gets mixed together quickly anyways .
4 #### What I did n't like about this game was that it left the player without many choices at all . Land on a space and you must buy the ticket booth . Thinking about it , I think occasionally you may get to make a decision with a chance card , but otherwise , it all depends on the roll of the die . What the kids and I DO like about it , however , is that it is fun . Somehow , more fun than a simple game of chance should be . A nice way to spend an evening with my boys , 4 and 6 . Considering the money you can spend on toys these days , this is well worth the ten bucks or so !
5 #### My son loves the game . It utilizies many of the same strategies as the full version , but is a little easier to play . Adults enjoy the game as well . A bit of warning , playing a full game all the way out ( driving other players to bankruptcy ) can still take a long , long , long time !
4 #### This game is fun , but tends to get a little bit old waiting for someone to run out of money . I would get it again though , my kids like it for a while , we just usually end it on our own .
1 #### The package did not mention that it was a choking hazard for children under 3 ! ! ! I plan to complain to the manufacturer . Its definitely a hazard if your child is still teething -- my 19 mo son who still likes to chew up stuff decimated a piece . I luckily fished out the red star in four pieces from his mouth before he could swallow and get into any trouble . So while I no longer give the toy to him , I plan to once he is over the chewing stage since he loved fitting the pegs back , and stacking and sorting and it definitely kept him educationally engaged . 3 stars on the durability since while he can chew it up , its an engaging toy , and my friends 3 yr olds enjoy the toy too . Also , Lauri replaces pieces for [ a nominal fee . ]
5 #### I bought this toy for my girl 's first birthday . She really enjoys it . It is very sturdy and the shapes are bright and colorful . They are made of unbiteable hard plastic , but not too hard for little teeth . The pegs and board are made of high qualty wood with child safe paint . My baby chews on everything , but has not been able to damage this toy in any way . She likes to play with it and is able to place the shapes over the pegs herself . She has not figured out how to sort them by shape or color yet , but she will and it is a good learning toy too ! A must have toy for all toddlers , fun and educational .
5 #### I love this game . We use it to practice our letters , sound , and reading short letter words . One side is beginners , easy short vowel words and the other it more challenging - consonant blends and long vowels . This is a must have for homeschooling and/or preschoolers at home .
5 #### Highly recommend ! Great fun helping the little ones start to learn to read while having fun ! ! ! Grows with the child ( letters visible to match or not ) . We also plan to use note cards with sight words from her class . To make it exciting for her I use my phone timer to time myself , 10 seconds . It 's a hoot !
3 #### Really cute toy but wish I 'd just gotten a traditional jack in the box . This is well made though and was delivered as promised . Disappointed that cranking device is broken and now just turns without playing music .
3 #### I do like how the timing of the " POP " is different everytime . For some babies it may be okay , but my grandson likes more of a pop . It kind of fell flat as the pop is minimal and not surprising at all . Maybe other babies will find it great , but my grandson is more of a " thrillseeker " . I feel sorry for his mom ...
2 #### My mom bought this toy foor my son for Christmas last year ( 2010 ) . My son is just about 2 1/2 now . I wanted a jack in the box so that my son could work on his motor skills and oppositional skills . He loves being surprised too . For the 11 months that we have owned this toy my son still ca n't crank the handel . I myself find it kind of awkward to do so . The toy is cute and has n't broken ( yet ) . The star on the front turns and clicks . My 4 month old loves when I turn it . The button for the squeaker on the back is kind of hard to push ( for me ) . My two year old has n't tried playing with the button because it 's so hard to push ( he has other toys that squeak when you push them and he can do it just well ) . So , in conclusion , because the toy is so awkward and hard ( for a child ) to manipulate our toy has been not much more than space taking up my kids ' toy box .
2 #### Altho I love the looks of this toy ( bright colors ) it is n't very engaging . For one , it takes too long to wind the toy to where the clown pops up . I think it 's a cute addition to my grandson 's toy box , but as far as entertaining him ... it does n't .
5 #### We have had metal ones in the past and have always had a hard time wrestling the clown back in his box after he popped up . The top of the Tolo one is so easy that even my almost-2 - year - old can do it with ease . It is fun , bright , and makes her smile . My only question is why does it play " This Old Man " instead of the usual " Pop Goes the Weasel ? " Whatever song it plays , it is a great toy .
2 #### " Jack " does n't pop up after only a few weeks of owning it . Do n't waste your money .
5 #### Ours came with missing parts & some shipping damage . 1st off top score of FIVE STARS to Amazon Prime for dealing with problem . As for damage , the fact that this wagon is tough enough to take it & still be able to be assembled and work is impressive . Had a dented hub but axle & bearings were tough enough to survive . Major dents / twists in wagon body could be evened out with hand tools , again amazing that steel was good enough for this . As for paint , it is on so heavy and well , it survived being dented and returned to fairly normal without cracking or chipping . Now , my kids are using it to carry 40 lb bags of sand as daddy works on their play area in back yard . That is one TOUGH Little Red Wagon !
5 #### This is a very fun game to play . Yes kids 9 & up can play as well .
4 #### My 3 year old nephew loved this gift when he opened it . I think he played with it the following day . He definitely got a kick out of it .
5 #### Great Doh assortment ! Great Value I 'm always in the need for basic Play Doh colors ( since all the kids mix them ! ) and having enough when my daughter preschool friends are over . As much as we try not to mix colors , having this great value lets me purchase more than one assortment of colors . It 's great to have duplicates of each color as well so no one is arguing over a color ! Love this ! Go buy some play doh and get ready to make new creations ! ! !
5 #### Nice set of bright colors , including black ! Small pots but there 's plenty for keeping little hands occupied . Will buy again once my daughter has mushed them all into a brown brick .
5 #### My 2 year old loves play doh and this big pack has all the colors she could possibly want to play with . It is still in use and has not dried out .
3 #### If you want a simple , fun board game that the children can play without you , this is it . My 3 year old could play this game with her 5 year old sister . Children just move pieces around the board and collect or pay money . BUT , if you want an educational game that teaches your children about money , DON'T BOTHER ! The " money " comes in $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , $ 4 , and $ 5 increments , so there 's very little math that really needs to go on for the children to play . I had been hoping for just $ 1 , $ 5 , and $ 10 like real money , but was sorely disappointed .
5 #### This is a wonderful game ! ! ! My 6 year old loved to play Monopoly , but it was very hard for her and no fun for me . This version is WONDERFUL ! ! ! My little girl can count out her own money and tell me what to pay when I land on her property . I like and want to play this game with my daughter . My 3 year old can also play this game with a little help .
4 #### I baby sit a lot , so I bought this for when the kids come over . It 's not hard at all , there is n't much thinking involved and the kids actually enjoyed it . But I will say that they outgrew it really fast . Pretty soon they were wanting to play " real " Monopoly with the " big kids " . And I must say , they won a lot ! Over - all though , it 's a good starting point to a good " real " Monopoly player .
5 #### My son receive this as a gift when he was four . He loved playing this game on the computer and loves the board game version even more . We have lost a few of the " ticket booths " but when you 're five that just does n't matter . A great way to start the foundation of adding and subtraction . The money could be a little more durable but overall for the price you get great family fun !
5 #### Monopoly Junior is a great scaled - down version of the classic game that is appropriately designed to make it a fun experience for younger kids . The game board is smaller ; the money comes in increments of $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 3 , $ 4 and $ 5 ; the markers are large plastic cars ; and the gameplay is not so brutal :-) This is a great introduction to the classic game for younger players .
1 #### Read the review by " freckledwitch " - she has described my feelings on this " game " exactly . It 's pretty much spelling flash cards , there is no game .
5 #### Awesome game ! really help toddler learn letters and words .
5 #### Gave this as a Christmas gift to a very gifted 3 years old and he LOVES it ! It came highly recommended by his Preschool teacher and it was a definite HIT !
5 #### Our new favorite family game . It takes about 15 minutes to finish a game . So , it is quick enough that everyone enjoys it . We played with my 7 year old and he loved it and was able to participate without any help . There is enough strategy to keep everyone engaged . But , not so much that it is too difficult !
5 #### Great product ... small cans but enough play - doh for little hands . Colors are as pictured . Satisfied with and would recommend the item !
5 #### My son loves playing with play - doh but always mixes colors or gets them dirty . With these sizes he can play multiple times and still have a lot of options .
4 #### The children enjoy the variety of colors , but there is n't a whole lot of any one color . These are not full - sized containers of Play - Doh . I do n't mind , but depending on the project a child is making , there might not be enough of one color .
5 #### my toddler boy really exited to play with it ! but i always need to keep watching him due to swallowing
4 #### My 21 month old loves this toy . She can assemble the pegs herself and puts the shapes on , but her favorite thing to do with it right now is scatter them everywhere . At least stepping on the foam pieces does n't hurt your foot .
5 #### Christmas gift for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves it !
5 #### These little letter cubes are great and have endless teaching possibilities . I got it to entertain my 3 year old son while I put his twin sisters down for nap . He loves it and has created his own games . He is already learning sight words . I highly recommend this product ! I ca n't say enough positive about this little box of letters and cards .
5 #### Monopoly junior is a great game in every way . It lets kids play the junior game before getting to the more difficult game , the Original Monopoly real estate game . All the bright colors on the board and the pieces makes it even better for kids to get exited . This game has it all from fun to educational content to duribility . Great toy must have .
2 #### . . .but I just ca n't get excited by this game . I learned how to play " Monopoly " at the age of 5 . My eldest son learned how to play at 8 . My kids enjoy the real game . They do n't enjoy the " kids " version . Kids are brighter than most adults give them credit for . The original game is a wonderful teaching tool on a number of levels . I do n't see the point in " dumbing down " when it is not necessary . Parents , teach your children how to play the REAL GAME . Then , there can be some valuable family time . The adults will too quickly get bored with this version -- and frankly , so will the kids . Do n't waste your time or money .
3 #### I bought this toy for my 6 month old because she loves bright colors and musical things . I was diappointed because it bored her the moment I placed it in her hands . She was unimpressed by the pop up head , the music and the shape . It is too large for her to manipulate and though it is very durable ( nothing broke on it yet and she plays tough ) I do n't think it was worth the money and do n't recommend it .
5 #### Babies like to pick things up ... then they throw them . This jack - in - the - box is just about the right size for a baby to have fun . I always feel anxious when she drops it on her leg or foot , but she never gets injured . The face is n't threatening and the crank is easy to turn . My daughter likes the button on the back that squeaks . The star on the front makes a ratcheting sound and there is a mirror on the bottom .
5 #### My 3 yr old Grand daughter loves these ! As long as we keep the lid on they do n't dry out easy at all , after prolonged storage , they may need to be kneaded to bring the softness back into play , but these are great ! We have been using them to teach her the colors and it 's been a great teaching tool !
5 #### Who does n't love playdoh ? I do n't think you can really give playdoh a bad review unless you 've never dealt with it before and you do n't know the nightmare that is playdoh smashed into your carpet . But assuming you know that , this is a nice mix of colors and a good size for little kids .
5 #### I bought these as " prizes " for my kids rewards program we do at home . They are just enough play doh to play with , without being a giant mess / waste !
4 #### This is a nice set of colors . Just want to share that this set is n't the standard size play dough you find in the store . They are miniature sized - about half or less of a normal container . Kids still loved them and gives variety . Price okay too . Good size for stocking stuffers or Easter basket treats ( that 's what we used them for ) .
4 #### Play - Doh is an excellent product . I purchased this for my grandchildren .... they spend many hours using their imagination to make all kinds of fun things .
5 #### These are the little 2.5 inch tall bottles . They come with a great selection of colors and are just the right size for my 2 year old .
5 #### Lasts over a year outdoors through rain and sleet ! Classic great product .
3 #### My almost - three - year - old was bored with this toy after a couple of minutes . :( I bet this item is more entertaining a younger crowd .
3 #### This is a cute toy but I thought it was made of wood . That 's my bad for not reading the description but the pieces were destroyed pretty quickly .
5 #### This is a fantastic toy ! It is sturdy and easy to store . There are endless educational conversations to have with toddlers about color , shape and number as they sort the items . My favorite baby / toddler toy of all time .
5 #### Keeps the kids occupied for a long time as young as 15 months . Be sure to stay with the child to oversee the use of the small pieces . Love it !
5 #### Great toy and learning object for kids .. Good value too .. Definitely recommend it ..
3 #### Kind of boring game for my 4 - 5 year old . She had fun with it a couple times and now it just sits on the shelf . It 's not really so much of a game as just find the letters and spell the word , with or without looking at the letters on the card .
5 #### Got this for my kids when started to learn phonics . They used both modes of learning . It kept them interested for a little bit though . They would do 10 minutes and then they were done . For the shot time that keot them interested it was huge hit . They are going to be almost 6 and they play with this ocassionally now wanting to test themselves with the spellings !
5 #### Bought this for my grandchildren , as my own children had it and loved it . Great for letter recognition and simple spelling .
4 #### My son just turned 4 and is learning his letter sounds and this is an easy , fun way to do it . There are two ways to play but the first one is n't a game , it 's just matching the letters . In the second game the letters are covered and it has helped my 6 year old work on sounding out his words . My youngest son really likes matching the letters and collecting the cards .
4 #### my grand daughters love play doh and we go through a lot of it . The case of colors keeps them busy and we use it to mix new colors . Its a great learning tool and keeps them busy for hours
4 #### Got these at a good price and used them as party favors . Good size , quality . Would buy again & probably will for my kids since we gave them all away .
1 #### This pack may be cheaper in local stores , but on Amazon the various multipacks of Playdoh are roughly the same price per ounce , except for the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Play - Doh - Case - of - Colors / dp / B00000IWIT / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Play - Doh : Case of Colors</a > , which costs about twice as much per ounce . The breakdown : < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Play - Doh - Case - of - Colors / dp / B00000IWIT / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Play - Doh : Case of Colors</a>&nbsp;is about .52 per ounce ( 20 oz at $ 10.50 ) . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Play - Doh - Classic - Colors - Assorted-4 - Pack / dp / B001E2IBOU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Play - Doh Classic Colors Assorted - 4 Pack</a>&nbsp;is about .25 per ounce ( 20 oz at $ 5 ) . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Play - Doh-24 - Pack - of - Colors / dp / B000V64HZ2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Play - Doh 24 - Pack of Colors</a>&nbsp;is about .26 per ounce ( 72 oz at $ 19 ) . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Play - doh - Mega - Pack-36 - cans / dp / B0050D1V2I / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Play - doh Mega Pack 36 cans</a>&nbsp;is about .23 per ounce ( 108 oz at $ 25 ) . I like the smaller cans , because my kids are hard on Playdoh and I like to be able to open a little at a time . Hope this helps !
5 #### My son loves playing with this , and the cups are small enough size that we do n't have a lot of clean up issues .
4 #### The play - doh was a good purchase and the kids love it . It keeps them busy . The only thing I was a bit sad about when I got the package in the mail was that they were the very small containers of play - doh and I was expecting the normal size containers . Other than that the product was perfect .
2 #### The printing on the game board does n't line up properly . and the cards seem to be two different sizes from two different decks . Friends complain so much we do n't even play it much .
5 #### I bought this for my 2 year old child . I definitely used to have this as a child . A true Classic !
5 #### Product is as described . Shapes fit well over the pegs and my children have lots of fun playing with these and sorting them by color and shape . I would recommend these to kids over 18 months old .
5 #### Gift for 2 year old . He loves it . He can sort , count , and identify colors and shapes . Nicely made . Overall happy .
4 #### Bought this for a flight journey and kept my 2 year old busy for sometime . This is best suitable for travel as it is a compact and quiet toy . The pieces are too flimsy for regular use .
5 #### These are a great size for our little ones fingers . The colors are bright and the texture and material of the product is perfect for your toddler . We even recommended them to our neighbor and she bought a set that her daughter loves too !
4 #### I really wish these were made of something more sturdy . they are light and a material that some kids ( like my son ) just HAVE to chew on . Also the foam board that the pegs go into is very flimsy too , and the pegs keep falling out . * * EDIT * * We 've had this for about 7 months now , and my son still loves it and plays with it fairly often . The foam IS actually sturdier than I originally thought , although it does still feel cheap , it has held up very well . Updating my review to 4 stars .
5 #### I love this little puzzle . Keeps my 2 year old very entertained .
5 #### Bought this for my grandson -- he loves it This is a game he requested so I am sure he is enjoying it .
5 #### It 's play - doh what else can I say . It is a gift for a future birthday so I imagine it will be well received by the recipient .
5 #### Very happy with this purchase . Amazing colors and very fresh . The only minor negative is the size -- the jars are rather small .
5 #### Cheaper than store cost . If only my kids learned how to put the lids back on so they did n't dry out . This is a great deal for a case of playdoh .
4 #### I was surprised to see how small these were . Shame on me for not paying attention to the size of our existing playdoh cans , but these are less than half the size of what I think of as a playdoh can . It is n't as nice a deal as it may look . The playdoh is fine , no issues with that . Just disappointed in the tiny blobs we received .
5 #### Great toy , for sorting and classifying shapes and colors . Perfect size for toddlers .
5 #### My little one played with this for quite some time considering his attention span is so miniscule . He loved fixing and removing the pegs .
5 #### CAME WHEN PROMISED . JUST AS DESCRIBED- PRICE IS WELL BELOW RETAIL !
5 #### the 3 - year old loves it . her big brother just borrowed some for a school art project . there are a lot of colors , and the sizes are small enough that there 's no chance they will dry up and go to waste . we DO keep them in the sturdy display " box " they came in , to help keep track of them .
5 #### My kids are obsessed with playdoh . They carry around these cans like they are filled with gold . So I save them and hide them and only break them out on special occasions when I need to keep them occupied . Great starter kit . Cans are good size for toddler hands , and a good variety of colors . Great price also .
5 #### This item was a Christmas present for my 2 1/2 year old daughter . She loves it ! It is also helping her learn her colors . We make sure she puts back each color before she opens another because she is too young to understand you ca n't un - mix them and also watch her to make sure she does n't sample any ( though it is supposedly non - toxic if she did ) . Overall it 's 10 small containers of play - doh . If you had it as a kid then you already know what it 's like . If you did n't have any as a kid ... Buy it for yourself because you missed out .
2 #### If you want to spend the money on something you can use a few times , then it is ok . After opening each box , you have about two days before it dries out and gets hard . I always keep the lid on but still dried . I opened one color at a time ( one in a week or so ) but decided to make my own :)
2 #### I should have listened to other reviewers . This is nothing more than a set of colorful flashcards . Do n't waste money on this game .
5 #### I chose 5 stars because of the educational quality of the game . My 4 year old and I will play this . It does not require skills and helps the little ones match up letters on the picture with letters on the dice . Would n't be appropriate for older kids but perfect for pre readers or early readers / writers .
4 #### Time will tell .... seems red wagon not particularly exciting in kids tech age .... 4 yr old did n't look at it .... old school ... still in box .. gpa liked it . LOL
5 #### We play with these everyday , great tool to learn shapes , colors and matching
4 #### My 2 ( almost 3 ) year old daughter loves this item and uses a similar one in therapy . There are a 2 things I would change which is why I gave it 4 stars . I wish the base was sturdier . Whenever she picks it up the whole thing droops over and falls apart . I also wish the pegs stayed in the base . Sometimes she would rather just pull them out instead of sort . These 2 things do not really change the functionality but are more of an annoyance on my part . Like I said , my daughter does enjoy it .
5 #### Got as a gift for a two year old . It 's tough to find something to hold her attention very long , but this did !
3 #### This is n't what I was expecting . The entire thing is foam , and kind of flimsy , not very entertaining for my 3 year old who needs to learn his shapes and colors . I would be concerned that the pieces are too small and little ones would want to chew on them ?
5 #### Great product for time with the kids something that gets the away from the TV on cold wet days , good to stimulate creativity with all the things you can design with playdoh
4 #### taste as cool as it looks ... jk ... great buy ... only complain is kids see all the containers and by the end of the day they are a big brown ball , BUT not play doh 's fault ...
5 #### Got these with some tools and I feel the kids like it more than the expensive sets they sell .
3 #### However- WARNING this is a lot of play doh . If you are buying for your house just get a smaller box . Once my toddler saw this he wanted to open all 36 containers at once . I donated about 3/4 of this to daycare .
5 #### On a recent beach trip that turned into a stormy stay - inside trip unexpectedly , I logged into Amazon.com and ordered a few kids games ( via overnight shipping ) . My toddler and neice loved this game ! We brought the game back with us , and my kiddo asks for it reguarly . He has fun finding the letters and building words .
5 #### My kids love this game - esp my 5 yr old- She derives such pride out of doing it all by herself - and its nice that she can sit for a good amount of time and play unassisted :)
5 #### I used to play this with my older child and totally forgot about it till me 3 year old pulled it out today ! She loved finding the matching letters to make the words and then spelling the word back to me ! She felt so accomplished after each word ! ! ! A great game and introduction to spelling / reading ! ! !
5 #### Who does n't like Play - Doh ? This was a Christmas present for a 5 year old and she plays with it everyday .
4 #### My kids enjoy play doh and breaking these small containers up between their stockings was easy ! Also , I felt the price for the 10 was good .
3 #### For some reason I thought these would be full size cans , but they are n't . I 'm disappointed in the tiny cans and the value does n't seem as good now . Oh well !
5 #### This is the perfect pack of play doh for toddlers ! My 3 year old loves play doh but I do n't like giving her an entire tub of it . These containers are about half the size of the regular play doh tubs and has a great variety of colors . I let her play with 2 colors at a time just so it does n't get too messy . I highly recommend this for children who are just starting to be introduced to play doh . I love amazon ! Best customer service .
5 #### This is a great educational game ! My niece is currently learning to read and her mom found this to be a very useful game . It helps her identify letters and familiarize herself with words .
4 #### Bought two of these for my twin toddlers and at 2 1/2 they are just a little young for it but it will be great fun for them once they catch on a little . Right now they are n't able to quite understand the objective but I am continuing to work with them . They have known their letters for about 6 months but ca n't quite figure out that those letters make words . So the age limit seems appropriate . Simple game with lots of room to grow .
2 #### This is a nice idea for helping children to become more familiar with the alphabet and words and spelling , but there is one huge drawback . The game uses only capital letters . Children are not typically going to see EGG written , but egg . They wo n't see NEST , but nest . My older two children ( when 4 and 2 ) used to try to match up the dice with the cards on their own ( no rolling , just turning the dice to find the letters ) , and thought it was fun . But , it did n't translate to them recognizing the words in other contexts . It could n't , because the game uses all uppercase letters , whereas in real - life lowercase is used . It also is often difficult to get the letters you need to finish the word , since there are a limited number of dice with lots of letters . You can spend a lot of time just rolling and rolling and rolling , waiting for the right letter to come out . That 's frustrating for little children . Considering the capital letter drawback , the gameplay issue , and that the game is basically heavy - duty cardboard flashcards with several dice , I would pass on this game .
5 #### Great product , my 2 1/2 year old grand daughter loves it
4 #### I wish I could find the exact one my son therapist uses . It has two to three rows of five . It is much bigger . But this one will do to start wit . We just received it today and my boy loves it
5 #### This case of colors was on special for $ 5 for the 10 pack . Play - doh is a staple in our house - great way to encourage creativity . I highly recommend the play - doh brand
4 #### This set has a nice selection of colors . The one negative is the amount of play - dough in each container , they are very small canisters . If you 've used play - dough , you know what your getting . My daughter is happy .
5 #### This is a great assortment of vibrant colors . The size of each is about perfect , sometimes the bigger tubs dry out so fast they go to waste .
4 #### This game is similar to flashcards . You have an image on one side , and the word on the other . The cards are of good size , and the images are fairly easy , to figure out . The timer can make it more exciting for older children .
5 #### I highly recommend this for pre - readers who recognize the letters of the alphabet . This game reinforces letter recognition and gives kids confidence and insight into reading . Best of all , it can be played with 1 player ! My 4 year - old loves to play games and gets frustrated when I ca n't play with her , but this is one she plays by herself ! Very stimulating and educational for 3s and 4s , but they will probably grow out of it once they can read . My daughter did n't seem to care that she could n't read before playing this game , but in the past 2 days since I opened the game , she has really shown an interest in learning to read . Desire to read is very important for pre - readers , and this is the only thing I 've found to encourage that besides the most important activity of all - reading to her .
1 #### My husband & I love to play boggle so we were excited to find boggle jr to share with our kids . We could n't even finish playing one time . This is not a game . You do n't roll the dice or play in any way . This is a " learning " activity , but it is n't fun at all . I am very disappointed in this .
2 #### This game was not engaging . My son did not find it interesting . He has not asked to play with it again . You push the dice around to match letters on the cards or to spell the words yourself . If you want to have a fun game with more of a challenge and an element of chance , try What 's GNU . It is much better for beginning readers and it actually fun for older kids or adults .
5 #### This is a quality learning toy , as children can sort by color , shape or make a pattern .
5 #### We bought these after seeing a bunch of Lauri toys on display at a convention . My little kids love them , especially my almost two year old . She will sit for well over an hour sorting through the shapes , making different stacks and removing and replacing the pegs . The pegs fit easily but are sturdy on the peg board . The shapes fit nicely onto the pegs so there is no frustration for her . Would highly recommend .
3 #### My 19 month old daughter is so interested in this . She tries so hard to play with it . Sadly , the pegs come right out of the base when she puts the pieces on and off , the pegs need to be permanently affixed to the board and the holes of the pieces need to be a bit bigger . It 's a great idea , the design execution just needs a bit of tweaking .
5 #### Good quality product , no chemical smell . Made in USA . I wish that the box were a bit more durable for storage purposes .
5 #### My 1 year old loves these , love that you can sort by shapes and colors , now just need to figure out how to not lose the pieces .
3 #### This is a cute little toy . Bought it for my grandson who is autistic . Only thing I was n't crazy about is the foam is soft so it is more pliable than I like , not very heavy duty . He likes it though . I would not buy this for a child 1- 2 years old or one that is inclined to bite things or they could bite off a piece of the foam . My grandson is 4 .
2 #### Tubs are very small , holder is cardboard and it is more money than walmart . There is really not much more to say than that . Love playdoh ..
5 #### Who would not love all these different colors of Play - doh * This set offers lots of choices and lots of fun time . Thank you
5 #### I 've bought a lot of playdoh , over the years , and this is an affordable assortment of colours . For about $ 8 , you get 10 2 oz cans , which is 1 lb and 4 oz of playdoh . This item also has free shipping on orders of $ 25 or more , which is great for people , like myself , who need to ship it long distances , since it is kinda heavy . My niece enjoyed it so much , I later bought the 24 can and the 36 can case of playdoh on Amazon , both of which are also very affordable , and qualify for free shipping . Playdoh is just a really great product .
5 #### I bought this playdoh to go with Doctor Drill and Fill and my 4 year old loves it . It was fresh and good quality just as I 'd have bought at the local store .
4 #### Rather than call Boggle Jr a game I would call it an educational tool . It is very boring ! It has several dice and each of the sides are labeled w / a letter . There are also flash cards that you put in the holder and cover up the either 3 or 4 letter words and look at the picture to spell the words with the dice . That 's basically it . Whoever spells the most words correctly wins . Not the most fun game but would be great to teach or improve childs spelling .
5 #### I agree that the " game " is more learning vs playing per the directions . However , a little creativity and a fun , educational time can be had . The newest version that I play with my 3.5 year old son has us splitting the dice and taking turns rolling our dice with the goal of getting one of the word 's letters . He has fun rolling and searching his lot even if he does n't roll a needed letter . Plus he can easily handle 4 dice . When you roll a " needed " letter you place it in its place . The player who fills in the last letter " wins " and gets to spell out and say the word . Sometimes we make up our own songs about the winning word . This version easily keeps him happy for a half hour at a time and he has also played his own take on his own .
5 #### There are many ways of playing with this game . My child would hold up the cards like flash cards and play " teacher " . She would roll the cubes like dice and try to get certain letters . She would sort the cards alphabetically ( find all the words that start with " B " ) . As she grew , her game play evolved . Now she is 3 and a half and she has no trouble spelling the words if she can see the letters . Turning over the dice and finding letters on more than one dice is just a part of the problem solving process . I expect if she keeps playing with it she will know how to spell all the words before she starts kindergarten . I recommend this toy for very bright children . My child is bored with a lot of toys , but keeps coming back to this one .
5 #### I bought the rado flyer classic red wagon for my two year old grandson . He loves it and pulls it with all his toys loaded . It is also nice for my daughter to pull my grandson around in on her walks . Very nicely made . I recommend it .
5 #### My family LOVES this game ! My 9 yr old begs us to play this daily !
4 #### Play Doh has always been a great buy for young and old . Also purchased Doh Tools to go along with the fun .
5 #### I bought these to use in my Cranium game ... perfect size ... all colors .... great for the entre family . Good price , fast , safe shipment .
2 #### Not sure if I got a bad box but the quality of these was so bad I threw them out . I have had store bought play - dough previously and it was elastic and fun and fairly clean . This boxed set was gooey and did not shape well . It just made a mess and was not the same quality at all .
3 #### I was really excited to get this play - doh for my boyfriend 's niece ... I thought it would make a great gift . When it arrived I was a bit disappointed because the play - doh jars are TINY . I mean there is hardly any play - doh in each one ... I was expecting larger jars . It 's good for the variety of colors , but the size of the jars are definitely a bummer . I would n't order again .
5 #### Playdoh is a classic and a must have for any child . This set is fantastic for any kid who likes to create with more than one color at once . It also works wonderfully for group activities . Just pass out each playdoh container and let the kids go to town ! They often end up trading bits of playdoh anyway and all have a blast ! It also offers a nice variety of colors in this pack .
5 #### This set of playdoh is great for group activities or just having around for one creative child . It offers a variety of colors which is always nice for children who want to take the time to sculpt something multi - colored and complex . You just ca n't beat playdoh for fun ! These also make a great idea for children 's parties . Give all the kids a container and let them go to town !
5 #### I bought this for my 1 1/2 year old who loves to stack things , but I think my 3 and 5 year olds enjoy it just as much or more ! Worthwhile purchase !
4 #### My son likes this quite a bit and has gotten very adept at shapes , counting them , or sorting . I 've put a few of them through the laundry machine accidentally and they survived no worse for the wear . Since the pegs are not glued , however , a small box or something to keep the shapes when not in use would have been nice . Would still recommend !
2 #### This is very poorly made . The bottom piece and all the shape pieces are cheap foam , and the plastic pegs do n't stay in the holes very well . Nonetheless , my preschooler and toddler love it and have had loads of fun sorting the shapes and colors . It 's not worth the money as far as quality , but to me it was worth the money for keeping my little ones distracted and learning at the same time !
3 #### I guess that is my mistake for not reading the whole product description as I did n't know it was all made out of foam . Like we all know ... you get what you paid for ...
5 #### Got this for my 1 & 3 year old to do while homeschooling my other kids . Keeps them busy and they can play together . He 's learning shapes and colors while she 's getting to assist and keep occupied . Win win .
5 #### This fits the bill and it also works with shapes since there are five different onces included . The textures are nice too .
5 #### Forget everything else . This is the definitive version of Tetris . The graphics are great , the sound is great , and most importantly , the control is head over heels better than any other port of Tetris I 've played . Better than the Tengen original , better than the NES original , better than the GB original , and better than any other future version . The control is what makes or breaks a Tetris game for me , and this version trumps all others . The perfect Tetris .
5 #### the game came to me just like he said just the game it worked just like the game should work .
5 #### My niece love Play - Doh and I was told to get her some more for her birthday . So I bought them this case which includes ten 2 - ounce cans of modeling compound . The cans are a little small so just be aware of that . All 10 colors are different and some hard to find . My niece plays with it all the time and loves molding the Play - Doh into many different shapes . I highly recommend it .
3 #### So expensive for the product ! Then I saw it in Walmart for 1/2 the price I paid ( I thought they were the big containers ! ) and NO SHIPPING ! I really feel ripped off with this purchase .
5 #### This toy was great for our trip - kept our 20 month old occupied for a good 20 + minutes at a time .
5 #### This toy is fun , educational , and made in the USA . My son is 2 1/2 and his cousin is 3 . They both love this toy , and will sort , take apart , and put back together multiple times . I like that there are different ways to play with it . We like the material it 's made out of too . Good product !
1 #### I did n't realize this was so flimsy . , I thought it would be on a sturdy base . The pegs do not stay in place , therefore the shapes fall off as the pegs come out of othe holes in the base . I should have returned the item , but I did n't want to pay the return shipping and out littlel one plays with it as is . I do not like this toy ,
5 #### I got this as a gift for my 2 year old ... she seems to be able to understand it ... so , either it is age appropriate , or she is a genius . Like most other parents out there say about their kids , I 'll just say that she is a genius . Cute , learning toy ... recommended ...
5 #### great game ... kids finally old enough for this after playing animal sequence ( for little ones ) for so many years
5 #### You will love Tetris DX ! I had the Tetris Gold Collection from Spectrum Holobyte CD for Windows , and I did n't think I would like this one , but it hooked me ! You can change the music , pause the game and it keeps 3 of your highest scores . Very addictive and enjoyable !
5 #### My daughter loves it and learned her shapes and colors really fast by using this , and to her it is just plain old fun .
5 #### My baby really loves this toy ! She 's just starting to be able to identify " star " and " heart , " but I think this will help her with circle , square , and triangle when she 's ready . Other reviewers are right -- it is a little tricky to get the shapes off of the peg without me holding the platform steady for her - but it 's not as hard as I thought it would be because the holes are bigger than the pegs . She also likes to put them onto other options ... the top of a plastic spoon , etc . The dogs are eyeing the pieces jealousy so I see some canine ( as well as human ) teeth marks in their future ... but the colors are vibrant and the texture is really soothing too !
3 #### I 'm sure that this toy would be very educational and probably would be for a lot of toddlers , but not my 2 - year - ols grandson . Actually using it is a challenge since the pegs pull out so easily he does n't use it in the way it is intended . Instead of putting the shapes on and taking them off , he pulls out the whole peg , shapes and all , defeating the whole purpose of the toy . To salvage this , I tried using a good glue product but that did n't work . Plan B is to try a glue gun and see how that works out . Plan C is to buy him one in which the pegs do not come out . Did n't want to have to do that but I think that 's what 's coming . I 'll let you know ... 03/07/12 Well , I got out my handy glue gun and went to work . This time it took him a little longer to pull out the pegs , but out they came ! ! This is fine if your child likes to put the pegs back in , but for my grandson , it 's a no go . I 'll be buying another product . Sigh .
4 #### We were introduced to this game by family and we really like it . It is fun with just 2 people but more fun as teams . My husband hates playing games but he really enjoys this one . We may need to order a second set to keep in our camper for the summer .
4 #### My twin toddlers love sorting and stacking and it keeps their hands and minds busy . Mommy really likes that . I recommend this item .
5 #### This is a fantastic learning toy for little kids . In addition to practicing hand - eye coordination kids can practice matching colors and shapes together . Toys such as this can be useful when kids are trying to learn their shapes and colors . The construction is sturdy as well .
4 #### I bought this after reading many reviews ... and I 'm glad I bought them for my 11 month old - but my husband will be making a sturdy fixed base for the shapes . As other reviewers noted - the pegs come out way too easily for a not - so - coordinated little one . He just tears everything apart and ca n't even try to put the shapes on the pegs without them popping off . Overall i do like the shape / color combination though .
4 #### Great fun ... we use 2 die instead of cards . 7 or 11 used to remove opponent piece or as placement of piece(s ) !
5 #### Years ago my granddaughters played with Lauri puzzles so I wanted to purchase some for our great grandson . I am not disappointed .... the puzzle pieces are durable , soft , easy for a 2 1/2 year old to handle . He loves putting the different shapes on the pegs . For quality and durability as well as learning experience I give this puzzle and hearty two thumbs up ! !
5 #### My daughter got this for her first birthday and still plays with it all the time , 6 months later . She loves it so much that we even take it with us when we travel . I wish the box were more durable . She tore it , and it 's nice to have a container for all the little pieces . She still chews on things -- the rubber pieces are very durable , but not totally tooth - proof , of course .
4 #### I use this item for doing developmental evaluations of children up to 3 years old . It is very useful for that purpose but I find that only about 25 % of the kids are interestesd in it . The ones who like it seem to like it a lot but the high energy kids do n't really like it much . Maybe it would " grow " on a kid if they had it in their home but in general I 'd only recommend it to families whose kids like fine motor tasks like puzzles , shape sorters , etc .
4 #### My mother originally bought this toy at a garage sale , so of course it was missing pieces . Being a teacher I immediately saw the learning potential ( colors , shapes , fine motor , counting , sorting , etc ) . I did some research and found this product ( least expensive after shipping ) at a store called LiveandLearn . The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because the pieces can easily get lost . I bought another one to replace the one with missing pieces . My daughter really enjoys this toy .
1 #### My daughter is 18 months old and takes this toy apart every time she plays with it . She pulls the pegs out and puts them in her mouth . Then she tosses the shapes everywhere . Not exactly a sorter ! Just a mess . Save your money !
5 #### This is a really great preschool toy . I bought one for my two year old and he really loves it . He will spend a whole hour playing with it . The chunky pieces and pegs are great for little hands , and the bright primary colors and variety of shapes are great for learning . The pieces also work well for making a color shape matrix to go along with my kindergartner 's math . This toy was a wonderful homeschool investment . The one caveat is that I have to watch my two year old and make sure he does n't bite the pieces .
5 #### I love this game . We played it camping and in the house with four people .
5 #### I bought this shape shorter for my 21 - month - old son , and he wo n't put it down ! The only drawback(which is pretty unavoidable ) is that the pieces are small and sometimes we have trouble finding them .
3 #### My 2 1/2 year - old loves this , but the pieces are rarely used for actual " stacking . " If you buy it , be prepared to find the pieces tucked away all over your house !
4 #### One of our top family games . The game 's box was more damaged than the seller led to believe . I 'm a little upset about it . The game itself is in perfect condition though . I will only buy new games from now on . Not worth the few dollars savings .
5 #### Get the game , play with friends and family and enjoy the time together .
5 #### This game is so much more than a matching game . It takes luck and strategy to win . I can not believe it would be fun for large teams but 2 against 2 or 1vs1vs1 is perfect .
5 #### You will need these score pads if you are a Yahtzee fan . All of the scoring sections are clearly outlined and every page is printed neatly . At a party , it 's easy to run out and it 's easy to neglect stocking up on enough pads . You get a generous number of sheets ( 80 ) and can score up to 6 times on each one , but Yahtzee is so much fun , you always can use more . Do n't let yourself run out ; if you 're a constant player like I am , you can never have enough . A fine accessory for playing Yahtzee .
5 #### A great game ! Some strategy involved but not so much as to distract from a lively conversation . Perfect !
5 #### Boggle is a great word game that is fun for the whole family in which players have three minutes to find as many connected words as they can in a 4x4 grid . It does n't take long to play ( only three minutes to be exact ) and you do n't need a lot of space to play it . It uses a lot of the same skills as scrabble , but unlike in scrabble you wo n't keep getting beaten every time by that brainy uncle who must have memorized the dictionary , because most of the words that can be found are only 3 or 4 letters long , and even younger kids have a fair chance to win(occasionally a very long word can be found however - my personal triumph was the 8 - letter " nicotine " ) . Also , you WILL learn new words you never knew existed from this game when people guess them and make you look them up - crazy words like " hie " and " tat " and " coe " . Overall a very fun game well worth buying , although I wish they still made the bigger version , because that one 's a lot of fun too .
5 #### Boggle is a fantastic game . It is most enjoyable and challenging when you play with others who are your intellectual peers . I love playing this with my brother ( a lawyer ) , my dad ( a geologist ) , my mom ( who knows everything ) , and various and sundry other people . Turn the timer over and watch the pencils burn up the paper ! Remember , you earn points only for words 3 letters long or longer , AND for words that no one else comes up with . A challenge ? You bet ! You can make all kinds of words from letter cubes that are adjacent to each other . It 's also a great way to learn new words ( mostly out of desperation ) . Be sure to keep a dictionary handy to check one another 's word efforts . How about these that I picked up by playing the game : scree , scurf , jape , berm , and many more . This is a great game for small get - togethers . The game can last one round or many , depending on the group . This is also a fun game for children as well as adults . When children and adults both play , you can simply score adults vs adults and children vs children . Fun for everyone . 5 star game all the way ! Affordable , durable , and endlessly fun ! Alan Holyoak
4 #### Came dented but we kept it anyway as it is sturdy and nice .
5 #### I love this game . It 's so simple . I can play it with my 6 year old , or with my husband . As long as you can spell a handful of three letter words you can play . The fact that it only takes 5 minutes to play a round ( counting 2 minutes to find words and 3 minutes to go over the lists of what you 've found ) , you can play even when you have a few minutes . It 's a good way to encourage reading and writing for the very young and nice to have a game all ages in our family can play .
5 #### What else can you say . Radio Flyer is an icon in wagons ! It was a gift for a great - granddaughter .
5 #### Great game - lots of fun to play with friends or family . I am well - known for being impulsive and a terrible strategist , but when I play this game , I find myself paying very close attention to each move made by each opponent , as well as my own - I like to win ! Well worth the money - you 'll get a lot of use out of this game for sure !
4 #### Love this game ---but the board is pretty small and hard to see / read .
2 #### When I receive these and was very disappointed . It is very thin flimsy paper and a very small pad . The only thing good about them is I could probably make copies of my own in a higher - quality card stock for when my granddaughters play this game . I would not buy this product again .
5 #### always play so more sheets are needed ! This fits the need !
5 #### I wanted to buy boggle and saw its now 49 $ for a new one . That s crazy . I got a used one ( here on amazon ) but it had no timer so I sent it back . I got another one and it was ok . My assumption is for whatever reason is that they stopped making it but the demand is high enough that people will pay crazy prices . Its still a classic and great game at any price , good for learning and improving vocabulary , mental ability and even for learning english ( by non english speakers ) .
4 #### My favorite word game of all time . I 'll play this over Scrabble any day . I grew up playing this with my mother and grandmother all the time and learned a lot of basic tricks ( spelling 3 - letter words backwards often gives you another word , double up on words by adding -s , -ly , -ed , etc . to the end ) . It also helps that I 'm really good at it , probably because I 've played so much . I 've never gotten tired of this game and have been playing for at least 20 years . Writing these comments reminds me that I should get a new copy , the one I have is the same one I got 20 years ago and is getting kind of raggedy . I 'm thinking about moving on to Big Boggle now that I 'm all grown up .
5 #### Good quality .... five stars for the game itsself .... just love this family game and always wanted the original
5 #### I love this game . We 've had our set for more than 30 years , and every time we 've played the game it 's been fun . It combines skill at picking out letter patterns and word recognition with a knowledge of vocabulary . However , unlike some word games , one does n't have to have a huge vocabulary to do well at it , since most of the words that are formed in the four - by - four letter grid are fairly short and basic . As a result , kids ( probably anyone over 10 years of age ) and adults can do equally well and have as good a time . Since there 's a three - minute time limit on each round , quickness counts , which tends to favor youth , who are generally good at recognizing patterns . Moreover , the game is practically indestructible . I 'm sure we 've played thousands of rounds over the years and the game looks the same as the day we bought it .
5 #### We got one for our son many , many years ago . It comes in handy for a lot of things . Now the grandson has one , & dad especially loves it as he knows how useful it is . Every little boy should have a Radio Flyer .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with Radio Flyer ! Classic wagon ! We are pleased !
5 #### I bought this for myself for Christmas . I love to garden and this really helps to haul soil , fertilizer , compost and plants around in . Makes me feel like a big kid .
5 #### Score cards have n't changed a bit . Worked perfectly for our new yardeze game . Was nice I did n't have to run all over town to find them .
5 #### Played this with friends and had to have my own . Now my grandchildren request it when we play games . Fun ! ! !
3 #### Did I actually buy this from Amazon ? I do n't really remember . I used to play it , back before Bookworm came along , but now it just lingers on the shelf ... I think . I suppose I should go see if I actually have it .
4 #### This is what the world needs more of ! ! Getting back to family game night . I love this game since I am a kid . I purchased this for days we want to spend time together and it 's a lot of fun . Great game that makes you think . Put down the video games and get this game or one like it . You will be glad you did .
5 #### OK , I 'm a nut for word games , but Boggle has always been one of my favorites . It 's fast - paced and varied - even the same letters in different places make a whole new game . Any kid old enough to recognize words can play , but no one is too old for it . Highly recommended . -- wiredweird
3 #### My dislike of this product is not an Amazon issue . It is the manufacturer 's issue . We use them because there is nothing else and the old ones have gone the way of all good things . The new ones are annoying on two counts : 1 . every other column is shaded gray , which makes pencil writing hard to read ( maybe we are just old ? ) 2nd . The back side is blank rather than having a place to record multiple scores of players . Sigh .
5 #### AMAZING GIFT ! I bought this & assembled it for my nephew . easy to assemble & beautiful . I will buy this for my son on his birthday I love it .
5 #### Our 11 year old grand - daughter loves to play this game .
5 #### I had one of these growing up , and I remember playing it for hours on rainy days or days it was too hot to go outside . This is the second one I 've bought for my daughter , and she loves it . My only complaint on this particular one is that the overhang for the door is a bit too thick , so in order for it to be on the door and the door to close fully , there has to be a big enough gap for it . Otherwise , the quality is good for an easy indoor activity .
5 #### I loved this game as a child and still do as an adult ! My husband even likes it and he 's not a real game - guy . Do n't know why it cost $ [ ... ] + at the stores , though !
5 #### Arrived in great condition , as described . So many score cards , you can have a Yahtzee marathon !
4 #### A classic . Drives smoothly and is attractive and durable . I knocked off a star , however , because we had to run to the store to buy another nut - it did n't come with all that were needed for assembly . Also , the holes for the bolts were n't perfectly aligned . It all worked , but was more of a hassle than it ought to have been .
5 #### This games is very simple to play and very simple to setup . It only takes about 3 minutes to understand the concept and start playing the game . I can not think of any other word games that has as much educational value and fun other than the " Scrabble " which is another classic game . It is also very inexpensive .
5 #### We could n't bring ourselves to spend well over $ 100 on the wagon with hefty rubber tires . This was a great option . The bigger tires make it roll over our yard easily and are smooth on the road . Our son certainly loves it . I realized too that the short sides ( vs. those with the wood slates ) makes it easier for our guy to get in and out .
4 #### This is a funa and easy game to play . You can whip it out any time you 're bored and you only need 2 players to play .
5 #### I love this game and have for years . With so many words to make and such variety with who you play against and what letters might come up , it 's always a different game every time you play it . The only drawback is the noise when shaking up the letters in their box . I would like to see a version that was n't so irritating in that respect . As a tip , if the noise bothers you and you play the game a lot so it 's worth the effort , put some thin felt strips in the box top ( the kind with the self - adhesive backing ) so when you shake it , it makes less noise .
5 #### Was very happy with the early arrival of this game . The game was just as advertised and arrived in perfect condition .
4 #### The cardboard back is less then ideal but for the price its fine .
5 #### I bought this for my grandson so that he could play indoors . We just hang it over the door and he plays . No damage to anything at all .
5 #### it all works fine , you can even dribble the ball on carpet
5 #### Our family enjoys playing Yahtzee , so when we ran out of cards , I looked to Amazon for more . The price on these were n't bad at all , so I purchased these . We 've used many , since we enjoy playing Yahtzee so much . It comes with lots of score cards , so this will take us quite awhile to use them all up . Since there are so many , the kids will play the game by themselves , and I do n't have to worry about running out of score cards . The kids also like to keep the old score cards in the box , so we can look back and see who all has won games in the past .
5 #### Got these to go with a giant yard dice set . Great family fun !
5 #### Ok , maybe it 's not quite as lofty as Scrabble , but this is one timeless and very fun game . It can be played with two people or more , has no set time limit or set finish point . It is played by all players at once , no taking turns like in some games where everyone else has to sit around and wait . Everyone plays off the same set of letters , so there is no difference in players chances for getting a good score , it 's all skill . This is one of my very favorite games . Highly recommended .
5 #### I have rediscovered this game which I used to play as a child . My husband and I play it together and have a fun competition . Also , it is small enough to take on vacation when there are spare moments and my cousins loved playing with us .... ages 8 - 16 . Of course they found words that I did n't ! It really forces you to think , see and use brain power which so many other leisure activities do n't force us to do these days . And best of all you can play this with as many people as you have !
4 #### Very small , but good for a toddler to pull around , and GREAT for decoration .
5 #### we play Yahtzee all the time and I have ordered these pad numerous times . They are just like the original ones and enable us to keep playing our favorite game .
5 #### What can I say ? I wanted to play Yahtzee , but I did n't want to buy the set with the cup and the awful felt - lined tray . So I ordered 100 dice and these scorecards . Perfect ! The scorecards arrived quickly and in good condition . My kids and I play often , and we plan to hold a Yahtzee game night with friends soon .
5 #### Fun game to play . We play 2 - 3 players can play with up to 6 . Simple rules , my parents play all the time . One of their favorites .
5 #### So happy I bought this game . A definite one to have in your game closet . Played with regular playing cards , corresponding to the playing card pics on the board . Placing chips on the board according to what cards you hold .. Object is to get 5 chips ( of your / or your teams ' ) in a row . A sequence . If you are playing with four people . Two sequences first for your team , wins . Wild cards make it fun , just when you think you have it ! Fairly quick game . Easy to learn .
5 #### Devotional image from Rick Warren We capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ ( 2 Corinthians 10:5b NCV ) . Heres the secret to temptation : Do nt fight it . Just refocus . Whatever you resist persists . Did you know that in the Bible , not once are you told to resist temptation ? We are told to resist the Devil , and that s a whole different issue . But the key to overcoming temptation is not to push back . Its to change your focus . Whatever gets your attention gets you . The battle for sin always starts in the mind . That s why the Bible says in Psalm 119:6 , Thinking about your commands will keep me from doing some foolish thing ( CEV ) . Why ? Because if you 're thinking about Gods truth , you 're not thinking about the less important stuff . Its true in every single area of life good or bad . If you focus on godly things , its going to pull you that direction . If you focus on the stuff that s at the movies and in magazines , its going to pull you that direction . Whatever you focus on gets your attention . Whatever gets your attention is going to get you . The key is to just change your mind .
5 #### One of my favorite games ! ! Love it ! ! Great addition to game night !
5 #### This is a great game , and an important predecessor to modern variety games ( like Cranium , Rigamarole , Quelf , etc . ) . All it really is is Charades , but instead of acting out one charade at a time , each player acts out 4 of them . Many of the clues are super - easy to guess , many are much more difficult . If you have a well - stocked game closet at your house , you can make your own variety game like this : Use a Candy Land board . Get out your decks of cards from Pictionary , Trivial Pursuit , Guesstures and Balderdash ( or any other 4 similar games ) . Assign each game a color , and choose one color to be a " player 's pick " . Move along the board , playing a round of each game from the assigned color that you land on . First one to the castle wins ! Good luck !
3 #### This is a fun party game , but it 's only good for about a half - hour . For a really super evening with friends , I prefer games like Rigamarole and Cranium that have a variety of different activities ( including games like Gestures ) that really get the conversation and the laughs going .
4 #### I bought this with the monopoly game because you always run out of the money when playing the game . $ 50 and $ 100 are always the first to go . Hopefully , I wo n't run out now . If I do , I 'll buy some more .
5 #### It 's an amazing game . I had a wonderful weekend playing this game with my family .
5 #### So relieved to find these . Fast shipping and exactly what we needed !
5 #### What can I say they are Yahtzee score cards . Arrived on time .
4 #### This is one of those games that 's great in a large group and only fun the first few times you play . I give it a recommendation , because at the right time and place it 's a perfect game , but do point out that it 's not a classic any time any place game , and it 's definately not one that two or three can play by themselves .
5 #### This is simply charades with rules , which is both good and bad . There are two sets of word / phrase cards , one with more difficult words / phrases that are worth more . Every card has two words / phrases , one more difficult and rewarding . They 're placed in a thing that makes the cards fall one by one . You have to get your team to guess what you 're acting and quickly grab the card . I think it 's better without keeping score . This is a pretty good party game . I recommend it for any group of 3 or more friends or family members , especially one that ca n't come up with any charades things to act .
5 #### This game is basically a twist on the traditional game of charades . Players take turns choosing four cards , each of which have two words on them -- an easier one and a tougher one ( for less and more points respectively ) . They then place those cards in a card holder that has a wind up timer in it . When the timer starts the person has to do things to get their team to say the word on the card . When they do so , the player grabs the card and pulls it out of the timer unit . If it takes too long for the team to guess the word the card drops down into the timer unit and those points are lost to the team . It 's a gas to watch people grabbing for falling cards and seeing their faces as they see the card slip out of sight ! My family and I love to play this game . It works well for players of many ages ( including children ) . The range of questions makes this game workable for children from about age 8 or so on up . It also works well as a party game for older folks . Great stuff , great fun , but does n't really teach you all that much -- oh well , not every game has to do that ! Have fun . Alan Holyoak
5 #### So fun . Easy to understand and great fun to play with friends and family .
5 #### Traditional Yahtzee cards ! Used for game table at wedding . Big hit !
5 #### I needed a new one for my wife , easy to set up . thanks
4 #### My son has had this wagon for almost 2 years and its held up well in just about every way easy to assemble and well made for a Chinese made product .
4 #### Our Monopoly game is almost 40 years old , and we needed some more money , so we ordered this . I really like having crisp new bills , but I wish the colors were all the same as the original colors . My grandkids , however , like the new colors . This definitely makes playing the game easier and more fun .
5 #### My kids play with this everyday ! Best purchase ever !
5 #### I ordered this for my mother - in - law after her 1960 's era Radio Flyer wagon finally rusted out and broke off the axle . She had wanted me to search for used ones on eBay , not wanting to part ways with its rustic charm . I convinced her to buy new . She is absolutely thrilled with it . She says it 's just as sturdy , if not more so than it 's old fashioned predecessor . The only differences are the lip of the wagon is larger and easier for little hands to grip , the handle tucks conveniently under the chassis for easy storage , and the angle of the axle is more limited , presumably to guard against tip - overs .
4 #### they do what they need to . Its a score pad .
5 #### This was exactly what I was wishing to purchase . This will go great with our current monopoly game . I purchased a retro style game ( with original tokens not the stupid ones out now ) but playing with a lot of people the money got scarce . This product was a perfect fit to filled the gap . I would recommend this seller to others .
5 #### I got this set to use on monopoly Jr. ( It only comes with 1 dollars ) . To teach my 4 year old add , subtract in a fun way . The 1,5 and 10 much needed , the rest I save till she gets old enough for monopoly .
5 #### Excellent . This is not the ' newer ' plastic model , but the old Real McCoy .
3 #### This is great , to have extra Monopoly money , but I wish the colors matched the money that came with the game . I have two Monopoly games , one produced in 1999 and one produced in 2015 , and this money does n't match either game . $ 500 - - dark orange - yellow ( in both of my games and this pack ) $ 100 - - beige ( in both of my games and this pack ) $ 50 - - blue in both of my games , but PURPLE in this money pack $ 20 - - green ( in both of my games and this pack ) $ 10 - - yellow in both of my games , but BLUE in this pack $ 5 - - pink ( in both of my games and this pack ) $ 1 - - white ( in both of my games and this pack ) I fear that adding this money to my current games will be confusing because the colors do n't match .
5 #### These work exactly as I would expect even though we have an older version of Yahtzee .
5 #### We all love this game . Have played with 2 player and with two teams of 2 .
5 #### Great game . We have turned several friends on to it . Fun to play with couples , using guys against girls .
3 #### Ok quality , but the colors are mixed up . Like the $ 50 bills are n't blue and so on . So they ca n't be used as extras , only by themselves . Disappointed .
5 #### These are the SAME EXACT score cards you get when you buy the Yahtzee set . Not this as others have said I 'm not sure where there possibly would ever be a problem with this as it is exactly what you order and you keep track of Yahtzee on them . Good price and prime shipping yay !
5 #### The wagon can be used for a lot of different things . When my twin grand daughters were about 18 months old , we took them to a pumpkin patch and they loved riding in it .
5 #### Sent to my Grandmother , so we can play when we are all there .
5 #### Fun and easy laid back game . Brought it into work to play during lunch with coworkers .
5 #### Great classic game that works really well with multiple ages all playing together . Simple enough for our younger kids to understand , but still fun for older kids and adults . If you have really young kids ( 5 or 6 and under ) , the junior version is really great too !
5 #### Just like I had as a kid . That one lasted from 1963 to 2003 , then somebody stole it from my Dad 's front yard . He was using it to take his garbage cans out . Otherwise I think it would still be going strong .
5 #### These will be use at the game night party , and the cards are very good .
5 #### such a fun game . easy enough for a small child , but plenty of strategy and challenge for adults .
5 #### Perfect exactly what I needed and I love them . i used some for decoration for game night and i put them rest into our game for extra money
4 #### The good news is that I was able to put the wagon together , myself . The not - bad - but - not - great news is that there are already a few scratches on the wagon where my screw driver and/or wrench slipped and scratched it . It was a little cumbersome for one person , very doable , but cumbersome . As for the directions , they were mostly simple and done via illlustrations with a few printed statements , which should be read before completing the steps . I got stuck on the first actual step in putting it together . I thought the shipment was missing a piece . The drawing showed it to be about the same size as the tires . After some frustration , I realized the parts I was missing were only about 2 or 2 - 1/2 inches big . After that , I found the part nestled within the bag of nuts and bolts . This is a good product , but If I had to do it again , I would go to a local store to purchase this product . That way , it would be scratch free ( at least for a little while ) and I would have remained calm , cool , and collected instead of stressing out about maybe missing a part and having to return the wagon to amazon.com
5 #### A must for any Monopoly player who keeps running out of money . They seem to just give enough money to supply a few people at the start . The extra bag of money helps alleviate this issue .
5 #### Great game ; we have had bridge players " indulge " and enjoy the strategy involved , but it can also be played by kids .
5 #### bought for my mom and her friend they really like them
5 #### keeps score , do n't try to do it w/o these score cards
5 #### These are better than the ones that came with the game because they allow for bonus Yahtzees .
5 #### more money to spend wehn we play . but colors are different that original ones ,
5 #### Who does n't love Yahtzee ? It is great to be able to buy the score cards so easily on Amazon .
5 #### the girls love them and they are very good quality ! !
5 #### Built like the little red wagon I had as a kid .. Grandkids love it
5 #### fun and simple game with a cut throat edge .
3 #### I 'm sure it seems dumb to not give Yahtzee score pads a 5 . I get it . They keep score . However . The designers have put this big logo at the top and removed the place where you put your name . There 's nowhere to put your name . This is a super silly complaint but why , Yahtzee ? Why ?
5 #### I bought these replacement tablets for my mom . She loves them , the look like the original tablet and they arrived quick and on time .
5 #### Nice to have the extra paper . I loved this game as a kid and now I 'm teaching my grandson ! I love Amazon
4 #### These cards have the traditional score keeping guidelines . The only thing missing is the totals on the back ( game 1 , game 2 , etc . ) but it only takes 2 seconds to write it yourself on the back of the sheet . Ca n't find these at any store so it is DEFINITELY worth the price ! ! !
5 #### The colors are a little different but worked perfectly with the game .
5 #### Love this game such a fun addition to any game board .
4 #### Purchased as a gift for someone . They appeared to like it .
5 #### Love to play yahtzee , so we ; needed new score sheets to continue our games with friends and family . much needed
3 #### These are a cheap reproduction of the originals . Looks like they just reproduced one side . No back side for keeping track of scores . Next time I 'll make my own .
5 #### My 10 year old granddaughter loved to play this with us on her last visit . Not too childish for adults , nor to adult for children .
1 #### It is the Monopoly money for sure . The original amounts . But the price probably just best to buy a new game , unfortunately .
5 #### I made a monopoly set for someone 's birthday and used this money for the game . Made it seem like a real game .
5 #### I love it when a toy is made as tough and durable as they used to be if not better . I bought this for my grandson who was turning three . A wagon lends for so many play adventures . I was very impressed with how well this is built and still has the same nostalgic look to it as the wagons we had as kids . We set it up for him in advance so it was ready to play with right away . The set up takes a little time and the tires smell pretty strongly , but it was n't that difficult . They have also made it so fingers do n't get pinched like they used to . My grandson has had a lot of fun with this along with his two sisters .
5 #### nice cards at a reasonable price used monthly in game day we have and is a great product at a great price
2 #### Sorry .... but to " Old School " eyes , it is hard to use the new and improved ( not ) score cards . Every other column is shaded , but my 50 + eyesight makes the shading hard to see . Please bring back plain , black and white . But it really does n't matter since my last order will last for 10 years . :)
5 #### I bought this for my father , who lives in an assisted living facility where they play this all the time . He gets a tremendous enjoyment from this game , as do the other residents . I am writing this based on their reviews as I have yet to play this with my father . It is a combination board game and card game . The pieces seem well made and sturdy . I am anxious to learn , but may not be able to get it away from the other residents to do so !
4 #### We love the wagon . First of all we opened it to install it and it said you need some small engine oil to put it together so that held up the process a little . Also when we opened it , I was very disappointed because the bed of the wagon had two large dents in it . We were unable to send it back because we wanted our son to have it for Christmas and we were n't sure that we 'd get a replacement in time . It 's a very nice wagon with a long bed . We will get our money 's worth through out the years for sure . Beware if you are ordering in a hurry incase there are issues .
5 #### My child is getting this for Christmas tomorrow morning . I put it together last night without any help and it took me about 20 minutes . I used some bike grease on the pivot plate and it glides side to side very smoothly . The box was pretty hammered when it showed up and is shipped in the actual box that reads radio flyer all over it ! ! ! I was so glad my neighbor snagged it before my child got home from school . If it is a gift make sure you state it is at checkout and maybe pay for the gift wrap service just in case . Aside from the box looking like Ace Ventura delivered it , the wagon was in pristine shape . The quality is amazing and I am glad I purchased this over a generic model . I have no doubt this will last a lifetime .
5 #### We ordered these because our game had run out of score cards . These were in fact score cards . They are just like the ones that come with the game . I will order more next time we run out .
5 #### This is apparently the same amount and distribution of money currently provided in the classic Monopoly games . In other words , it is exactly the same pack of money you get if you buy the game . You get the following : 40 - One dollar bills 40 - Five dollar bills 40 - Ten dollar bills 48 - Twenty dollar bills 23 - Fifty dollar bills 23 - One Hundred dollar bills 23 - Five Hundred dollar bills I do n't know why they insist on having these amounts in the pack , but at least you know what you will get . I still say that they should at least double the amount of one hundred dollar bills , since people tend to run out of them quickly ! I bought two . I am very happy with them . How excited can you get about play money ?
5 #### Got these when it was time to teach the game to my granddaughter . We have plenty of dice but no score cards . My daughter told me I could have just printed them out on Google images , but these are great for me . I 'm a bit nostalgic and for $ 5 would rather have the real thing ! The six year old beats me almost every time . What 's with that ? ? ? ! !
5 #### Solid , well packed , easy to assemble , and a good price . We will enjoy this for years .
5 #### oh what i can tell about this game . I recently came to know about this card game at our last family trip and now hooked to this game . This game is so much fun when you play with 6 people/ 3 teams . We spent on an average 4 - 5 hours whenever we played . We just want to keep playing this game whole night .
5 #### As a 5th grade teacher and mom of a 10 year old , I would highly recommend this game ! My kids love it ! !
5 #### This is a really fun game to play as a family . We play with our 8 - year - old son and 6 - year - old daughter . We play teams- parents against kids , and the kids have actually beaten us several times :) It will no doubt become a staple for our family game nights .
5 #### Good product that was a good price . Came exactly as described with no damage . I would recommend to anyone who needs extra score cards .
5 #### While of course you can just keep score on any old sheet of paper , these score cards do make it easier . They 're great to have around for new players who are still getting the hang of it . It helps when kids are keeping score too !
5 #### New scorepad to be used up We have a start on doing that . Great item and was just as advertised .
5 #### " < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Yahtzee / dp / B00000IWH6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Yahtzee</a > " remains one of the all time great family games and if you play it enough , you are going to need replacement score pads . These are good quality and are highly recommended !
5 #### They 're just score cards ! This is a great game the whole family enjoys . I have a 6 year old daughter that likes it . Okay maybe she likes shaking the dice ( I had to line the cup with felt to keep the noise down ) .
5 #### Great game . My family and I love playing it . We had bought a kids version for my daughter so she understood how to play this one at age 6 . Lots of fun .
5 #### Most popular game at our holiday get together . Fun for 2 , 3 or 4,6 . We played all . Absolutely recommend for family fun . It arrived on time and as expected .
5 #### This is a great family game to get your child thinking about next steps .
4 #### Got this for my 8 year old 's birthday . He loves it ! It comes with two large magnetic blocks , a bunch of British pennies , and an instruction manual describing how to create all kinds of gravity - defying penny sculptures . He 's been following the directions all by himself and has done quite a few so far . He 's amazed !
5 #### My husband and I like playing games and this is one we frequently play together and have for years . We think it 's a better game with just 2 people , but 3 can play .
5 #### Full size , old school Radio Flyer wagon . This is the one you want !
5 #### I wanted a magnet kit for my 7 - year - old nephew and after looking and looking , landed on this kit . It provided hours of fun on Christmas day as my nephew played with these pennies and magnetic bars alongside my wife , my brother - in - law and others . An enclosed booklet offers helpful tips on how to use these bars since placement is key based on the type of magnetic sculpture you make . I think this would also make a great office / cubicle gift for adults .
5 #### I bought this item for my grandson for Christmas . He absolutely loves this . It combines his favorite things , money and magnets . He can spend hours playing with it . I would highly recommend this to anyone even adults .
5 #### I have gotten everything I hoped for . Good Product !
4 #### We gave this gift to one of the adult kids to have a new game to play when visiting . We have played it several times now . Both with teams and a few 3 person individual games . The game play and tactics are different depending on whether you are solo or not , which is nice . Easy to learn to play ( < 5 minutes ) Game time : Teams : 10 - 15 minutes Individual : 20 + minutes Once you learn the idea of the game , having the right tactics ( and getting lucky ) will produce victory . Overall , it is an interesting game . We 'll have to see if it continues to be pulled out of the pile when we get together .
4 #### purchased this wagon for my in laws to move boxes and carry groceries in so they would n't have to carry so much . is very sturdy once assembled , but not the easiest thing to put together . there were directions included and all the hardware but it is a lot . it took my husband over an hour to but it together- and he is a carpenter so he is pretty handy at stuff like this . other than that no complaints
1 #### This product arrived on time . The package was not damaged . However , the product inside was damaged but usable . It is too big to send it back .
5 #### It is indeed the classic wagon . It will feed your nostalgia . Well made . I use it around the yard for gardening , but it remains a great children 's toy too . You will have to assemble it .
5 #### Sturdy , beautiful and just what I wanted for my granddaughter .
5 #### Durable and will last a lifetime . All children should have one as a child .
5 #### Great fun for any family or group of friends !
5 #### This game is so much fun ! ! I buy this for friends and family all the time who have never heard of this game before . Its very challenging and includes lots of strategy !
4 #### SUMMARY - Simple 5 in a row game that is fun for all ages . This game will appeal to a wide range of audiences - had fun playing this with 3 generations at Thanksgiving ! HOW TO PLAY - separate into 2 or 3 teams with equal numbers of players . Teams can be from one to six players each ( although you could do more than that ) . Players will have a hand of playing cards , and each turn will play one card and use a chip to cover one of the two spots on the board that match the card . Get five in a row either once or twice ( depending on player count ) and your team wins ! One eyed Jacks can be used to remove an opposing team 's chip , and two eyed Jacks are wild . WHO IS THIS GAME FOR - Families - especially large ones ! It 's hard to find good games for over 4 players but this is one of them . Will appeal to kids as young as 5 and grandparents as well . PROS - Can learn how to play in minutes . - Short turns so large player counts work well . CONS - Not much strategy - Component quality is ok but not great - It 's 5 in a row - you will get bored of it after a while
5 #### Purchased for grandson and he loves it . Uses it all the time to haul things around for his parents and himself . Had it ship directly to him and his father said it was easy to put together etc .
5 #### . . .in an extremely convenient and durable format . No more wrecking the game because someone accidentally ( or deliberately ) shoved their chair into the table ! In this beautiful edition of this classic game , letters stay in place . The swivel feature , allowing all players to see the game " right - side up " is also an added benefit . Yes , there will still be arguments over the validity of words ( save yourself -- get the Scrabble Dictionary ) , there will still be frustrations when someone takes the " triple - word score " that you had the PERFECT word for ( after all , how many letters have both ' z ' and ' j ' in them ! ) , etc . BUT the inconveniences of the standard edition have been cleverly eliminated . A great game and a great value .
5 #### I played scrabble with my grandmother many years ago and still remember those games . It 's a fun way to learn new words ( and beat the pants off your opponents if you can score the triple word ! ) The idea is simple : create words from tiles you select ( 7 tiles reside on your holder at a time . ) This version of the game has a great swivel board and custom holding slot for each tile , so they do n't slide off the board places . Spend the extra and get this ' deluxe ' version ; you 'll be glad you did ! :)
5 #### Remarkable . Scrabble is cool . Hep . Rad . Outta sight . But Scrabble in this deluxe form is sublime , intoxicating . The pieces stay put , thanks to little walls around each space . You can spin the board so as to not need to examine it upside down . The pieces never slide around . The plastic coating lets you wipe it off , unlike the cardboard version which stains . Nothing is compromised from the original , flat cardboard version , but everything is improved . OK . Not everything . It still ca n't help you dump the Q , Z and J at the end of the game without a U. And it is unlikely to assist you in stopping your grandmother 's amazing ability to squeeze you out of that triple word score you hoped to grab with a seven - letter word . Take that up with Gram . Just remember who made you the cookies . Seriously , I recommend this to any family or commited Scrabble player . Families need it for that ` full - body contact ' style of play that sometimes happens with children or cats involved . Commited Scrabble players need it for pretty much the same reason ! I fully recommend this game . Anthony Trendl editor , HungarianBookstore.com
5 #### Great game of strategy . Wonderful fun with family and friends .
5 #### This is my sons favorite game . He loves to play banker .
5 #### Very fun ! ! Board is an it small but it is so worth having and playing ! We play with my grown kids and grandson
5 #### This is the only way to play scrabble ! the tiles settle into blocks that prohibit them from being knocked around , the playing board is a turntable ... it is a quality piece .
5 #### This was pricey , but I think we 'll get our money 's worth . The pieces stay in place , but what I like best is the rotating board . Expect to get years of enjoyment from this .
5 #### I really like this game very challenging and fun .
5 #### Just what I expected . Easy to put together and my daughter loves it , just like the one I had as a child .
5 #### This is one of my all - time favorite games . It sounds boring as hell when you try to explain it or just tell people the name , but once they get going they always end up loving it ! I 've converted a lot of skeptics . It seems super complicated once the board comes out but the rules are very simple and it 's easy to transport . Playing in teams makes it even better in my opinion , and especially in multiples of 3 .
3 #### The game itself is not a very fun one . The rules are complicated and are open to interpretation . What is more often times my friends argue over them . The quality of the game materials is OK , but I wish the cardboard would be thicker .
5 #### One game that every one should own .... Lol My family and I like to play board games , and this one is a must have , for people who enjoy board games !
5 #### Suggestion : figure out what you are going to do with it before you buy it . I did not and bought just because it rang the bell from youth . Saw a great idea -- but not for me . Picture showed someone using it with ice for drinks ( sodas , etc . ) out around the pool .
4 #### Always a fun game , I like Monopoly and the kids ' really enjoyed it a lot too . I would buy again .
5 #### I loved playing this game as a kid and love it even more playing it with my kids . I would rather have the paper money than the electronic " credit card " version .
5 #### I have a friend who will be bedridden for over a month , so I got her a few old favorite games to help her pass the time . Her husband loved the idea ( because it would keep her from trying to get out of bed if her mind was occupied ! ! ) Now friends are coming over and playing the games with her , and they are having some good old time fun !
5 #### Just bought this for our seven - year old . We play it all the time . Everybody in the familiy loves this . Great mix of card and board game .
5 #### Bought for my parents and they play it almost every night .
5 #### It 's Monopoly ! Any questions ? ! If you have n't ever played it , WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ? ! ? ! Sure games could last a few hours , but you 're creating memories ! We sometimes just call it quits in the middle and add up money / properties to determine a winner when kids ( wife ) start feeling tired of playing ! haha
4 #### After years of playing sequence for kids , I decided my kids were old enough to play this one . I found it much more challenging and fun to play in teams , but my kids do n't usually want to play it . It takes much more time and concentration than the junior version - something my kids will have to get use to .
5 #### I see some mixed reviews on this product but i have played enough different versions of this game to know not all monopoly games are suppose to be the same . I played this version for the first time yesterday and i must say i really enjoyed it . It is one of my favorites . I love that it is so streamline . Luxary tax is now $ 100 instead of $ 75 so you do not have unnecessary time wasted making change . Also income tax section now just says $ 200 instead of 10 % of your total net worth . Most people never do the math for 10 % so it makes sense just to make it $ 200 . Many of the rules seem to be clear cut and all . I really had fun with this . I did not get to use the new red dice but i love when there are variations to the game to add some spice to it .
5 #### My grands are visiting and they love the game . They are into buying , selling , making someone bankrupt . I will not be playing when they leave but will remember it as a fun game ,
5 #### There are two things that I love in this world .... reading and playing scrabble ! Now , imagine my delight when I saw that there was a scrabble board that ( 1 ) would not only hold your tiles in place , but ( 2 ) you could turn the entire board in the direction of the player whose turn it is . So although it is the same old game ( the new scrabble games come with directions about how you can make " q " words without the letter " u" ... although I am not convinced about that advice ) , there are definitely a new variations on the theme . I love my scrabble game and whenever possible I make guests play with me . There are no spills or movement at all ! It 's great .
5 #### Never had a wagon growing up so I ca n't make any comparisons , but this is everything I hoped for . Easy to use , surprisingly good turning radius , full of all - American childhood nostalgia , and my children love it . I have a two and four year old . 2 yo loves to ride and pack it full of toys , 4 yo loves to pull , so it 's a perfect for our group . Have used in the house , around the block , and over grassy fields and mulch - covered trails ( and have only owned a week ! )
4 #### It is the classic version . I do n't know what happened to my original one but when my wife suggested we drag it out and play ? ? ? It took a while to hunt this version down but we are happy to once again own it .
5 #### Going to be a collectors item . I love Monopoly games , they are cool and fun to play with .... one day soon .
4 #### I bought this so we 'd have the " original " Monopoly with the iron . I gave it four stars simply because the actual game box , not the packaging , had two holes in the bottom . Thankfully , nothing in the game was damaged . It would have been a bummer if it would have been a gift . Otherwise , it came on time .
4 #### I definitely recommend this version of Scrabble over the standard version for these reasons : -There is a cloth bag , which makes a better " grab bag " for choosing tiles , meaning you do n't have to spread them down on the table . -The tile racks have a listing of how many of each letter appears in the game . -The board has slots that hold the tiles in place ( see more on this below ) , which is a lot better than the flat board where tiles shift around easily . -The board rotates , allowing all players to have the board facing them during their turns . -The instruction book includes a listing of a Q - words without using a " u " and also all allowable two - letter words . There are some downsides to this version , but mainly only in comparison to the old deluxe version . -This version 's letter slots are very shallow ; letters still shift slightly . It is a lot better than the standard version but not as good as the old deluxe version that had deep plastic slots . -The board is somewhat flimsy . The old version was made very well and not cheaply . This version is definitely plastic and probably is n't as durable , although I have n't had any problems with mine yet , except for a slight drift when the rotating wheel is in a certain position . For the versions of Scrabble that are currently available , I would say this is a good choice , but like other reviewers , I do wish the manufacturers had stuck with better materials and workmanship !
5 #### My daughter loves monopoly but is ready to move up to the non kid version of this game . product arrived quickly and in perfect condition for Christmas .
5 #### ! This is just like the one that my parents purchased 30 years ago for my brother and I. My son loves to ride in this , the ride seems very smooth and my husband also likes how the handle is long enough that it does n't break his back to pull . Beautiful , classic product- I would highly recommend !
5 #### We have started a new tradition of giving our nieces and nephews what we call " The Dick and Jane Little Red Wagon " as a present on their third birthdays . Call it nostalgia , or whatever . Unfortunately , we had a very difficult time finding this particular model . We were adamant about finding a metal one , you know , the one from the Dick and Jane readers of our youth . We were able to find one at Walmart , but it had to be ordered and would n't arrive until the following Friday . We would need to pick it up at the store and then assemble it . When telling a friend about this , she suggested ordering it from Amazon , which should be re - named , Amazin ' , because we were able to get the exact same model at the same price , and have it shipped directly to the birthday boy 's house ! Plus , no delivery charge , no tax and it arrived in two days , instead of 5 ! From now on , Amazon will be the first place I look .
4 #### We have hours of fun playing with friends . I wish they would make bigger boards for easy access without feeling cramped
4 #### We love to play games as a family . There are four of us that usually play : my husband and I , our 9 year old daughter , and my 83 year old mom . We enjoy playing both board and card games and Sequence is a great combination of both ! The game itself is really simple to learn and played in up to three teams . When the four of us splay , we find it simplest to play two teams of two . The game indicates that it 's for ages 10 and up , but my 9 year old had no trouble mastering it , although she sometimes does n't always pay attention enough to the strategy aspect . My 83 year old mother also has trouble with strategy sometimes ! I like that a game usually goes quite quickly ( less than one hour ) . This is definitely a new favorite for us and I highly recommend it .
4 #### This is a nice game to play but it takes time to learn the rules and play the game . It is good for my 5 year old son to learn to count money and decide whether he has enough money to buy property .
1 #### I could not believe this " deluxe " version was so poorly made . I have a previous deluxe edition and this one does n't even come close . The tile holders on the board are so shallow and made of flimsy plastic . The tiles constantly come out and mess up the board . The board itself is smaller , the turnstile is n't attached and the overall plastic on the board is cheaply made . I am so disappointed they charge $ 35 for this product and it is going back . I am getting the Onyx Edition from Barnes and Noble instead .
1 #### I totally agree with every poor review on this game . I did not check the reviews before ordering as I NEVER THOUGHT Parker would go the so very cheap route . Tried to send them an e - mail . It would not go through . Have a feeling they know what we are going to say . 1 Star is too much for this product ! Poor quality ( tiles do not stay in place , STICKERS for letter value , plastic is ready to crack right out of te box ) Poor customer service ( site says you can send e - mail but mail does not go through ) .
5 #### This is a gift to our great - grandchild 's 1st birthday . The wagon is still the same after all these years . Too bad it is made in China .
5 #### arrived just as descriibed . had one small dent in side , but not enought to worry with . heavy duty . good product
2 #### So , you want to buy Scrabble , huh ? You were playing at your Grandmas , and you saw she had this cool version with a rotating turntable , wooden tile holders , nice deep pockets where the letters sit on the board . You decided to buy one yourself here at amazon . You ordered it , excited to have a high quality Scrabble in your own possession . You get it in the mail , you open the box , thrilled to own Scrabble , but then .... the unthinkable ! ! This ai n't your Grandma 's Scrabble ! ! What they have done , is turn a nice idea into the cheapest thing they could come up with and still call it " deluxe Scrabble " . PLASTIC . Everything is PLASTIC . The tiles might be wood , I dunno I did n't bite them , but everything else is cheap , thin plastic . Does n't turn nice like the old version . And the biggest kicker of them all , is the board itself . Gone are the nice deep squares the tiles would sit in - where even if you bumped into the game or table , they would stay put . Now it 's shallow grooves , and you have to be careful not to turn the board to quicky or they 'll move easy . You 're better off buying an old one at a garage sale .
4 #### My parents have had a Deluxe Scrabble board as long as I can remember ( I 'm 25 ) . This board is a step up for a regular scrabble board and looks stylish , but is not near the quality of their board . The plastic dividers between grids are very short - maybe 1 mm high . The material underneath the grid ( with double score , triple word score , etc . printed on it ) seems to raise up and not lay flat against the board . I do like how each tile holder gives you the # of tiles for each letter . The board does raise up very high ( compared with the old version ) when you use the turntable . All in all , I 'm definitely happy to have a Scrabble board for my own house and I will enjoy playing it with my husband . However , I do agree with the other reviewers that this is a step down from the old board . A few inexpensive improvements could have made a big difference .
5 #### I 've been playing sequence for 20 years . It was a family favorite on summer vacations when I was a kid and now it 's becoming a favorite with my family as an adult . Easy to learn and simple to play . It is fun and challenging and the teaming up is the best part . Definitely worth it to add to the collection .
5 #### I love this game ! The turntable makes it much better than the one we had before . It is worth the exxtra money !
5 #### Still the quality brand name Radio Flyer that it 's been since my childhood . Brings back a flood of memories . Our Rector asked if anyone had a little red wagon that could be used to bring up the offertory gifts during our Eucharistic service . No old wagons available so I set about finding a classic red wagon . Radio Flyer to the rescue . Found exactly what we needed on Amazon . Arrived on schedule and was easy to assemble .
5 #### I 've had my Scrabble Deluxe for a few years already , and absolutely love it . As some users have pointed out , the board and tile holders are made of plastic . A bit more durable than the traditional cardboard version if you ask me . I have not seen the old deluxe version , but I 'm happy with this one ! For those of you accustomed to the standard cardboard version , the plastic grid and swivel board is a welcome upgrade . No need to worry about sliding the whole board around or letters moving around ! The cloth bag for the tiles is a nice touch over the old plastic bag . Scrabble is suitable for people of all ages . Parents , this is an excellent educational group / family game that will help your children build their vocabulary ! If you do decide to purchase Scrabble , be sure to purchase a dictionary in case there are any disputes over the spelling of words . If you 've never played Scrabble before and want to give it a try , look for a game called Literati on Yahoo Games , and play it online for free .
5 #### I purchased this for my granddaughter off her Amazon Wish List . She loved it ! Ca n't go wrong with a classic Radio Flyer Red Wagon .
5 #### This is a really fun game . It is simple enough that my 6 year old has really enjoyed playing with us , but complex enough that it holds an adults attention for several games . A good addition to a family game collection .
5 #### If you love to play Scrabble , you really should get this edition . The tiles fit nicely on the board and do n't move around as easily as they do on the regular Scrabble board . The grooves that hold the tiles more in place are not the irritating , snap - in kind . Instead , it just has grooves high enough to hold the tiles better , but not entirely . Being able to swivel the board to the player making their turn is a great bonus and the tile holders have a display in front of you reminding you of the number of tiles available in the game for each letter , which can come in handy when you 're waiting for a Q to make some amazing play and realize the one on the board is the only one there is . The bottom of the game board holds the tiles in their bag as well as the tile holders , keeping things neat and making it easy to put away or set up for next time . Very classy . As soon as we saw how nice it was , we got rid of our original Scrabble game board . We also purchased the travel edition because the box for this particular deluxe edition is really large and if you take your games with you on vacation , this one would take up too much space .
5 #### The deluxe scrabble edition is great because it has a big board , big tiles , and you can twirl the board around to face you if you want when it 's your turn . It 's a bit bulky so you do n't really want to try to lug is places , unless it is to the occasional friends house . But Scrabble is a great word game and very addicting . On my edition I like how the plastic racks have the letter count right on it so you do n't have to look it up . I do have to say the board does n't appear very durable and everything is mostly made of plastic . It does n't get much abuse being at home all the time .
5 #### There are many hidden trivial facts about Monopoly which I 've discovered through various books and resources . For those of you with inquiring minds and interest , here are a few of them . Marvin Gardens has a few interesting things about it . First , it is misspelled by one letter on the property space . The word Gardens is properly spelled . It 's the first word , Marvin , that is misspelled . The real Marvin Gardens is actually Marven Gardens . Second , Marvin Gardens is the only oddball street property on the board . It is not found within Atlantic City , New Jersey , which the other street properties are . Marven Gardens is found in nearby Margate , New Jersey . There are four railroads on the board , marked by the engine icon . This however is a misconception . There are in fact only three . Have a close look at the four properties . Pennsylvania Railroad , B&O ( Baltimore and Ohio ) Railroad , Reading Railroad , and Short Line . The trivia facts underlying the railroads are as follows . The Pennsylvania RR and the Reading RR once were the Pennsylvania - Reading Railroad . In other words , the two names were together as one . The B&O ( Baltimore and Ohio ) was a separate railroad line . Here is the big one regarding the remaining property . The fourth railroad property is another oddball . Known as the Short Line , it is not a railroad at all . It is a bus line . I have ridden the Short Line with my Grandma Balen to and from Trump Plaza .
5 #### I already reviewed normal scrabble , so this review is just about the Deluxe Edition . I got this as a gift and I appreciated how much easier it was to play because the board spins and the letters are secure . A must when you are playing on the kitchen table in a crowed house . Worth the extra money in my opinion .
5 #### First off -- I love scrabble . I have played the traditional game for years . The problem is that when you turn the board around when you change turns the letters moved -- we got this version because it appeared to solve that problem with he grid . Well , the grid does hold the letter in place , but for a " deluxe " edition , it just seems , well , cheap . The board is a cheap flimsy plastic , as are the tile racks . The original game wih the wood racks just seemed to be a better product . The board in this game , while it has a grid , is just a thin / light weight plastic . It just does not seem that they put a lot of effort into the production . Your money is better well spent on the original version .
5 #### An oldie but goodie ! Must have game .... perfect for family night or as a gift ! Great quality & price ! A+++++++++++
5 #### This game can be played with children younger than 8 as well with modified rules ( that simplifies the pricing , etc . ) . A strategy and negotiation game that plays faster with fewer people . Best w/ 3 - 4 people that can multi - task .
4 #### Scrabble is an old favorite that will be around forever . It 's a great game to play for two or more players . You start off with seven randomly choosen letters and have to create words that connect to eachother all over the board all while racking up as many points as you can with each letter . it 's a great thinking game ... get 's you digging through your mind 's vocabulary bank and using your internal spell - checker . Educational and fun at the same time .
1 #### We wanted to get the deluxe game thinking it was the same as the original plastic turntable scrabble ... WRONG . This set is so cheaply made . The letter holders are plastic and move around as you 're rearranging your letters . There are n't any holders on the game board so your letters fall out of their spaces pretty easily . And the board itself is just flimsy cheap plastic . Do yourself a favor shop ebay and look for the 70 's orginal deluxe board . That 's the only way to play this game .
3 #### We have the standard Scrabble set . But when I played with an old ( 1980s ? ) Deluxe Edition Scrabble with raised grids and swivel board , I immediately ordered a Deluxe Edition for myself . But I am greatly disappointed by this new Deluxe Edition . This item in general is of cheaper make than the older Deluxe Edition . The grids are shallow , so the tiles are not securely anchored in each slot -- a major reason for my purchase . The turntable as well as the tile holders are flimsy , made of cheap plastic . ( If you use the pedestal for the turntable , your board will rise about 4 to 5 inches above your table ! ) For [ money amount ] , one'd think that MB would be able to maintain the quality of this classic game , if not improving upon the older version . That being said , this version still will perform better than the standard edition . So if you want a brand new Scrabble game , this is definitely the one to get . And , if you play on the floor a lot , maybe you actually will like the high - platform game board . On the other hand , if you want a Deluxe Edition because an older set impressed you at some point , this is NOT the one . One can get the older Deluxe Edition on eBay .
5 #### I have a copy of the original Deluxe Edition that has an additional feature that this Deluxe Edition does not have . This edition has the standard sturdy letter tiles familiar to all Scrabble players , a tile bag , and a wonderful playing board . The board is mounted on a lazy susan to make it easy to point at the current player . Each " space " is surrounded by a raised ridge that keeps the tiles from sliding on the board . What this edition does not have is the special tile racks that were in the original Deluxe Edition . These racks had a peg system on the top for keeping score ( a feature I really liked as no one could say that we should not keep score because they could n't find a pen ) . This edition comes with more standard tile racks ( the wood ones ) . Overall , a wonderful way of playing this classic game ( although the special board does not fold so the box is bigger than the original ) . I just wish they had included the special racks when this was reissued .
5 #### We do n't have a child . We needed a way to move heavy objects to the back yard and to carry garbage to the curb . I first saw this during Hurricane Sandy recovery . People were bringing bottled water home with it . I knew we had to get one . Sturdy , a little tricky to put together ( give yourself lots of room )
5 #### Love this game ! It was new to us , easy to learn and one of our go to for game night . It last about 30 mins depending on how many " sequences " you go for . We added the jokers and made them " exchange opponents chip for your chip " rule . So much fun ! !
5 #### It 's hard to imagine life without Scrabble ! It 's been around for over 50 years and is still as fun for all age groups . You can play with kids and help them learn new words , or play with adults and get into heated discussions over the " reality " of the words they have played ! I 'm a huge Scrabble fan . I play it in real life , on my computer , and on the internet . This Deluxe edition definitely gets a ton of play time in our house . The raised edges for the squares are HUGELY helpful in keeping everything in place as you work on the game . The swivel base is also a great addition . You simply spin the board to face the next player - nobody has to try to play upside down or sideways ! Well worth the extra money just for those two features . Definitely a game to play often !
5 #### The game itself is world class - a pure classic . This version is not worth [ the money ] however . I opened up this game and was very disappointed at the quality of construction . Very light and flimsy plastic board , where the price and the picture on the box make it look like wood ! The letter grid could come in handy with kids or something , but overall this is very chintzy = especially for the price ! Even the hollow plastic letter holders feel like something that would come in a cereal box . Get the standard version even with its drawbacks . I 'm taking mine back its so utterly hokey .
5 #### Some people hate monopoly , others love it . Me , I like it . I 've been playing it for nearly 20 years , ever since I can remember . You really should pick up this fantastic board game and play it with your family and children . If you do n't , you will be missing out on one amazingly popular game .
4 #### Monopoly is a game where you buy properties that have been mortgaged by the owners , and you must buy them for a * * * * load of money . It is absolutely the best board game series ever made . There are tons of special editions for monopoly , for example : Spongebob Simpsons Family Guy This product is a must buy . BUY IT NOW !
5 #### One of the best board games out there . We bought and gifted 5 of them in total
5 #### We love Sequence . We are bringing these two to Europe to our relatives .
5 #### An American classic ! An exercise in capitalism . What happens to economies as capital is amassed . Does the entire economy tilt so that the rich get richer . A great game which is both simply fun but drives home a lesson of greed aggression and investment . Perhaps a bit disturbing , but also based on limited assumptions , it is a great and frustrating game simultaneously .
4 #### " Monopoly " is a classic of veritable fame around the world , and the many editions stand testimony to it 's enduring popularity as " THE " ownership game of our time . Starting with a small amount of money , with a healthy streak of greed , ruthlessness , and underhanded exploitation , one can acquire enough property to establish themselves as the prime force to be reckoned with . The potential for wealth is very high , and will make former - friends out of your nearest and dearest quite well . " Monopoly " is a great game , and it comes with shorter rules for a quicker game , if you have little time for the longer version of it . Of course , if you have the time , the longer version is much more fun and more challenging . Things can turn very quickly in the game , so there is no resting on your laurels here ! Good luck and happy hunting ! Remember : money is everything and you have no friends in " Monopoly " !
5 #### Monopoly may well be " the " game of the 20th century . Players work their way around the board acquiring properties , utilities , railroads and wealth . The goal is to accumulate wealth faster than your opponent with the goal of eventually bankrupting them . The game can be played until only one player is left , or following a time limit . Why a time limit ? A game of Monopoly can literally turn into an " all - nighter " . I have been involved in 3 player battles of Monopoly that have lasted well over 6 hours . Granted , most Monopoly games do not take this long , but on the other hand very few finish in under 2 hours . Monopoly is a rarity in our modern busy culture ; a game that is time intensive . Most modern quality games ( like Lost Cities or Ingenious ) , even though they are a blast to play , games are designed to be played in 30 minutes or less . For this reason , Monopoly might not have the appeal it once had . I for one still find it a joy to play , and with the hundreds of versions and styles available , you can play Monopoly in any genre you like . My favorites are Star Wars Monopoly and Wisconopoly .
5 #### beat game to play with family and friends and kids 6 years and older
5 #### I ordered this for my daughter , son in law and their children and they love it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I looked at stores locally for this item to give to my grandaughter for her first birthday . It was nowhere to be found even in the largest toy stores . They had the plastic version and some other similar things but we wanted to get her the Radio Flyer . Finally found it on Amazon and had it in 2 days . It looks great and will provide years of fun we hope , just like we had as kids .
5 #### We love playing this as a family . Our boys had Sequence Jr and grew into this one when our younger one was 6 . ( older son was 8)
5 #### I grew up playing this game and was excited when I was reminded of it . I added it to my Wish List and received it as a gift . I immediately taught my then 6 year old how to play . Of course her strategy was weak , but she loved being able to play it . She thought it was great . I also challenged my teen son . I love that it 's simple enough for the young crowd but complex enough for adults to find fun as well .
5 #### This is actually the second time I have bought this game . We used the other copy so often and for so many years , we had to purchase another copy . A great game for young kids as well as adults . Our family enjoys !
5 #### Has become a family and gang favorite . Own two sets and gave a third one as present .
4 #### This game always takes a long time , and very young kids can get pretty mad at paying mommy for staying at her hotel ! ! ! When they lose , it 's pretty tough on them too , as they put so much time in on the game and it can be a long while before the other players are out of the game - leaving the very young children bored or annoyed until the game is over . I guess that sounds like a sorry sport of a kid , but I 'm really talking 4 and 5 year old kids ... and this game is too long and too much for them . For adults , it 's a fun and classic game ... but it is almost always a very long game ! There are lots of little pieces and lots of cards and money ... so careful not to lose them all !
4 #### This is a great game for anyone that is probably 10 or older . The game is all prdicted by a roll of a dice because maybe you could land on Boardwalk , or get thrown in jail . One bad thing about this game always is that it takes too long .
5 #### I love this game . It is a fun game for players who like to play in teams . It is strictly a game of chance . There is little skill necessary and children as young as eight could play it comfortably . It does not involve any reading skills . It is played on a board , with chips of different colors , using a deck of cards to determine where a chip is placed . It is a game where there can be a certain amount of socialization .
5 #### Now it is more fun to play with real money , in life that is .. but as a kid , this was the most fun ever . The only time I hated playing this game was with my mom , because she always won . Now , when I played it later with my brothers , I would win . This game is just so much fun , because it really teaches you to think about investing . It also teaches you how to bribe your one brother into selling all his good cards . I think it is great , just keep your eye on the person playing banker ..... have you ever noticed that they win ? Ok , jokes over ! You will find kids will pick a favorite piece and want it every time they play the game . I still get roped into playing this game now and then . It has a lot of childhood memories and good fun times associated with it . Buy it .... common you can afford it . After all , it comes with a bunch of money . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### the game play is so awesome and me and my friends love playing ti so much .
5 #### It 's a classic . Husband says every kid has to have one . 3 - 1/2 year - old daughter likes it ... but not as much as her princess dress and her baby . I have to agree , though , it is a classic and this wagon is made to very high standards - excellent quality . Very strong , great finishes , pretty easy to assemble . Has the feel of something very durable . Unless she rides it off a cliff ( which she wo n't ) she 'll be able to give it to her kids which is more than we can say for the princess dress !
5 #### If you 're like me , you 've seen the plastic versions and they just seem cheap . Once you 've put this thing together and you hear that satisfying " clunk " of the steel tow - bar hitting the red body , you 're taken right back to your childhood . Purchased mine locally to save a few bucks , but felt compelled to write a review because I was so impressed that this wagon stood the test of time ! Thank you Radio Flyer for keeping the original available !
5 #### great game and a lot of fun . We play it often with 2 or 4 people . Good buy
5 #### This is one of my favorite games to play with my friends . I love playing with three couples and seeing how well they can communicate without actually verbally communicating . It is easy to learn and anyone of all ages could play .
5 #### I love this game ! My husband not so much because he ca n't beat me nearly as much as I beat him :) but it is fun and really easy to get a hang of the rules . We like to pull it out when we are watching a movie after the kiddos go down for bed just so that we 're doing something .
4 #### We bought the children 's version of this game for the kids and ended up enjoying ourselves . For Christmas this year I bought this for my wife . It 's not our favorite board game but we enjoy it every time we play it . Lots of fun and just a little more complex than the kids version .
5 #### Bought this for my granddaughter 's 9th birthday . She loves to play it but we adults enjoy it even more , had to buy one for us also .
4 #### This is the older version of a game that is now digital . I sought out the older version as we had tried the digital batter - operated one and felt that we kept getting the same words over and over again before we had played for very long . That is not a problem with this older version but you do run into the problem of being in the middle of a round and getting back to the beginning of a card and having to stop and change cards .
5 #### Easy to learn ! fun to play . Family time increased
5 #### Just got addicted to this game over the holidays ..... love it . Also love that you can play with just a few or we also played with 8 . Fun game .
3 #### A terrific game that teaches kids to walk on eggshells around their father and his rage . From the same people who put the " fun " in " dysfunctional parenting " with games like : Stay Away From Mommy When She 's Sobbing , Tell Grandpa Everything He Wants to Hear , and Eat Your Feelings Away .
4 #### This is a neat game and the concept is great however , it can end up being very , very , very long ! Especially if you play with more than one other person because the cards get dealt so thinly , and you land on spaces and you have to push the alarm clock so often . I once played a game that lasted an hour and a half ! Now I 'm not complaining about that fun that I had with my family but , this is not the sort of game you can just sit down and play a quick round of . You have to be in it for the long haul ! Still a great game that teaches numbers , counting , and ever a little bit of colors ... if you have the patience .
5 #### Love this game ! Very easy to learn and super fun . We have played with 3 teams of two and one on one and it is always enjoyable !
5 #### Our family loves this game . By combining strategy and a bit of luck , it is fun for the whole family .
5 #### We have adult children who love to play this game !
5 #### I bought this for my kids ages 4 and 5 and they loved it . I was looking for the original one but this came close and was nice having a smaller version to have more room into game closet or for long car rides .
4 #### My child received this one Christmas at 5 years old . She still plays with it regularly and I like that it is compact for storage and travel . However , the cards can easily get lost . I also think the manufacturers can do better with the female / male options . There are way more male characters in the game than female .
5 #### Just as good as the full size game but fits in my purse . My favorite feature of this product is that when you slide all the faces down on one side , you can flip it over and it 's ready to play a new game on the other side . The game comes with two halves that fit great together and even have a slot to store all the cards inside so no worrying about losing cards . This is a genius design for this game in my opinion .
5 #### Love this little travel game ! I bought it for a very long plane ride with my 6 year old and this worked out very well ! . It 's hassle free and everything clips together for mess free storage .
5 #### My daughter loves the full - sized Guess Who game & this travel edition delivers the same fun & all pieces snap together - VERY convenient ! !
5 #### I love this game ! It is very simple but lots of strategy involved !
5 #### For family gatherings we play this game alot . Laugh a lot . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### No one ever wants to play this game but they always end up joining in ! It is so fun and everyone stays active in the game the whole time .
5 #### My new favorite game ! Can be played with two people and up to twelve players . So far , we have only played with two players . It is a strategy card game with a board . The basic rules are that each player gets seven cards and a bunch of chips / markers . The board has cards ( two of each card ) printed on it . You play your cards one at a time and place your chip on the corresponding picture on the board . First person to get five in a row twice on the board wins . Jacks are wild --- depending on which Jack you have it can either be played on any place on the board or be used to remove an opponent 's game piece . Game play is about twenty to thirty minutes . Mostly a strategy game . Does n't take a lot of skill , but will make you think . I love Jax games and ca n't wait to buy other versions of Sequence . This game would be good for die - hard board game fans or for those who only play on occasion . It says that the game is for players eight and up , but I think it depends on the specific child . Would not be good for small children since the game has small pieces . Board itself is nice quality as well , as are the game pieces and two decks of cards :)
2 #### The number of red chips is not what its supposed to be . Thought the bag of reds looked small upon opening . Counted all of them out . 50 blue , 50 green , but only 35 red . What the hell .
4 #### Easy to travel with . The cards are hard to move sometimes but it 's a travel game not a game you play at home . It works well for when we travel .
4 #### bought these for our road trip with a 4 year old for 6 hours . Kept her occupied for quite some time . Some of the cards do n't slide in very well and get stuck , but it 's workable . I love how they snap together and the cards are stored within so noting gets lost , especially in the car . Just in case , we pack it in a quart size zipper bag for traveling .
5 #### Got this for my 4 year old and we love it ! Recommended for 4 and up . We got two sets !
4 #### Fun game for a few players . There are three colored tokens , red blue , and green . you can play with as many players as you wish you just need to break up into teams . The game board has playing cards spread out around the board , two decks of cards minus the jacks are shown . You start with 5 cards , they are smaller than normal playing cards . Like the ace of spades , or three of hearts , etc . During your turn you place a color token of your team on the game board ver the location of a card you have , like I have the 3 of hearts and place a token on the board over the 3 of hearts , then pass the turn . You keep going until one team has five tokens on the board in a row , diagonals count . However the Jacks are wild cards , the one eyed jacks allow you to remove ANY token from the board and the two eyed jacks allow you to put a token on any open spot ( like a wild card ) . Team play just alternates team players and you work together to win . Its VERY simple and fun to play .
3 #### The compact size is nice , but the people cards just slide up and down in the slots instead of flipping down ( like the regular size version of this game ) , and the cards are already getting mangled and bent ( we 've only played the game a few times ) , so I fear it wo n't last .
3 #### The people are made out of pieces of paper that you push up and down . I do n't foresee this lasting a long time with use from little children . And it was hard for little hands when still developing fine motor skills to push the small pieces of paper up and down . My son loved the game though
3 #### Kids lived playing this game and it was easy to set up , however pieces popped out easily and game fell apart easily . Also , it was very difficult keeping track of all the small pieces , especially with kids .
3 #### Did n't care for this travel game . Too many small pieces that can get lost easily while traveling . A great game to play at home though .
4 #### I bought this for my 9 yr old daughter for Christmas and she loves it . We were out of town for Christmas so it was great fun to play in the car on our long drive home .
5 #### This version is compact enough to pack for trips , but we 've been using it at home , and do n't feel it loses anything from the larger version . The kids play it over and over again and it does n't seem to get old .
5 #### My kids love this game , they want to play it over and over . It is pretty fun , you have to think quick and pick a person you 're in tune with , that thinks like you .
5 #### One of my favorite card games as an adult ...
3 #### The card that the other person is supposed to guess wo n't stay in the slot . Also all those loose cards have no where to go and fell all over the car . The two pieces do n't really click together for storage .
5 #### Great game for young and old alike . Our whole family plays it .
5 #### I really enjoy this game . It 's a rather simple game that 's based on strategy and little luck . It requires very little set up and you can typically get through a game in less than 30 minutes ( with three players ) . Sometimes , it 's nice to have a simple game on hand that does n't take a lot of setup , I find these the easiest to play during the week or with friends that are n't that into board games ( more complex games do n't hold their interest ) . I Highly recommend it !
5 #### Hours of fun and entertainment for the whole family . Easy to understand and get the hang of .
1 #### It scars my 4 year so much he wo n't play it
5 #### Kids love it , it 's a quick easy game with simple instructions . Just , do n't drop daddy otherwise he can break and the game changes after that moment happens .
5 #### Thank you for a well kept game . It was in good shape . Very happy to have this crazy game , again !
5 #### This game is played as often as the family can time for . ALWAYS LOTS AND LOTS OF LAUGHS
5 #### A great game to play anytime ..... moves fast , anyone can play and it can become hilarious . No complicated directions and everyone always loves it .
4 #### The game is fun . They categories are good . Our family of 4 ranges from 12 to 41 and we all enjoy it and feel pretty well matched . But we found ourselves really wanting to change the rules of gameplay somehow ... because the way you score points is just by chance , not by skill of knowing the answers . Whichever team is left holding the question wheel when the randomized time goes off does n't get the point . It does n't matter if you answered 10 more right than the other team or not . But it was fun and hopefully we can find a more competitive way to play the game .
5 #### You ca n't beat this game ! Fun for everyone . it 's like hot potato but way more fun . I highly recommend this game if you 're looking for something to entertain with .
5 #### Love , love this game . I also love to give this game as gift .
5 #### We love this game . This is a family favorite
5 #### Fun game to play with the family ! Bought it because of the nostalgia and still loved it as an adult ! My son would get a bit frustrated by getting sent back to bed quite a few times lol but then still asked to play again . My only complaint is that you have to put the stickers on yourself ( typical ) and there 's no going back once any bit of the sticker touches the toy because it will rip very easily .
5 #### a must for board game lovers ! loads of fun
5 #### I bought a few games recently , and Sequence is probably the most fun out of all the them . Blocking other players is satisfying and hoping no one blocks you while you wait for your turn is suspenseful . It 's good for kids and adults .
5 #### Made a perfect Christmas gift . The kids loved it !
5 #### kids love this game . we had it when they were kids and i gave it do charity and boy were they not happy so I had to buy it again . lots of fun to play
5 #### Very cute game . 7 & 4 year old love this game . Easy to play
5 #### My almost 5 year old twins and 8 year old love this game . It keeps them occupied for a while . I like that it does n't require batteries and makes minimal noise :)
5 #### So much fun for the entire family . Ca nt put this one down .
5 #### loved this for my first child and bought a " new " game for my son . We love to play as a family
5 #### This game is tons of fun for our family ! My 4 year old and 10 year old enjoys playing this !
5 #### The kids love it . Fun for the family , easy enough for the kids .
5 #### This game is now a digital game , but I wanted the older version . When it arrived , it was exactly what I was looking for . Sometimes the non - digital is better and that 's what I love about this game . I ca n't see how this could have been a better purchase for us ! This game really makes you utilize your brain very quickly . I love how it keeps us on our toes and laughing .
5 #### Loved this game as a kid , Thought it was so fun ! Really fast shipping when it came i was pumped . My kids loved it just as much as i did ! Took a few minutes to set up and put the stickers on and we played 3 times in a row . Thanks !
5 #### FOR THOSE PARENTS LOOKING TO GET YOUR KID OFF THE VIDEO GAMES FOR A SPELL AND SPEND SOME QUALITY TIME , THIS IS THAT GAME FOR YOU . MY HUSBAND , MYSELF , AND OUR TWO KIDS WERE CRACKING UP LAUGHING WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME . I LOVE ANYTHING THAT ENDORSES FAMILY TIME TOGETHER . IT WAS NOT HARD AT ALL TO GET THE PIECES TOGETHER EITHER . VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE .
5 #### This game is fun to play for kids and adults . It is great for family game night .
4 #### This is a good game for about any age from 10 - 12 on up . Gets your heart racing trying to beat the timer . Easy to play because one can describe the " word " in about any way imaginable with as many words as you want to use . The only negative thing about the game is the device that holds and rotates the word . It is very difficult to see the word and it would be a good thing if the company would revise the window to show the word more easily .
5 #### We have owned this game for so many years I had to order another one for a family member who kept borrowing it . I started playing this with my kids even when they were too young to quite get it . We adjusted the rules according to their age and we have had a blast playing this game for years . It takes a lot of abuse as everyone get so loud and excited that we have flung the disk in the air and pounded hard on the timer . All ages can have a great time with this game . Now my kids are all grown and we adults are still playing this as well as they are introducing it to their friends . Even when kids are too little and you know they will not know a definition , we would allow them to click once to the next word . We even changed it if we did not have enough players so that one was a floater . This made it a family friendly game for the get go . Buy this as you will find it to become one of your favorites . Just wish I could buy new cards . That would be my only complaint .
5 #### I remember playing this game when I was little , and now I am enjoying playing it with my kids . When the daddy does " wake up " we all scream . It 's kind of like a jack - n - the - box . Fun game , easy to play !
5 #### Love this game . My son had this when he was little . It brought back good memories . My special needs students enjoy the surprise of daddy popping up
2 #### My daughter was so excited when Santa brought her this game for Christmas , but she lost interest in about 15 minutes . It takes forever to " Wake Up Daddy " . Very disappointing
4 #### Good game . Makes you have to think . Good for kids and adults .
4 #### Sequence is a card game that plays a lot like a combination of Bingo and Connect 4 . The game uses two decks of cards , a board with representations of playing cards printed on its surface and chips to claim the cards on the board as your turn arrives . The object is to get 5 chips in a row for a Sequence , with 2 Sequences winning the game . During your turn , you must lay one of the cards in your hand into the discard pile and claim its match on the board with a chip . As more chips are added to the board , the possible sequences add up and become more difficult to defend , until one team breaks through for 5 chips in a row , aka a sequence . This game can be fun AND frustrating , but I would recommend it all the same .
5 #### Learned this game this summer at an off - grid bungalow in the Gulf of Thailand . It was the most popular among the guests and we played for hours on end . It is easy to learn . It is most fun played in three teams of two players each but can be played in other ways . Once you start playing you will quickly become addicted . Ordered it when I got home for the family and my husband , who hates game time , really enjoys this game . My daughter , who is almost 8 , is catching on and will probably " get it " soon and be able to join in the fun without help . The in - laws like it too .
5 #### this game is a LOT of fun . we played with only 4 people ( 2 couples ) . girls against guys and while it took a round or two for the men to catch on , once they did , the game ended up being very competitive and fun .
4 #### Hey -- I 've never played this ' card - based ' version , but I 've played the electronic version many , many times . It 's just one gadget that displays the word and is the timer . You pass the gadget when your team guesses correctly . the team who is left holding the gadget when the timer goes loses . It even keeps track of the score . For those of you who have exhausted the cards and do n't want to keep buying more might find the electronic version to your liking . ( Just search ' catch phrase ' here on Amazon ) . Regardless , this game is alot of fun and really easy to teach new players how to play .
5 #### Whether old or young , cold or hot ouside , sober or intoxicated , day time or night time , if you have 3 or more people together , than you have instant fun with this game . This version with the paper card that rotates through the push button clue device has got to be the most durable thing ever created . When this game gets going , people get to hitting , punching , and tossing this as fast as they can . Once you start this game , you ca n't stop . Well worth the investment , you will get your money 's worth . Enjoy
5 #### I bought this game for my 15 year old daughter ; her friends ca n't get enough ; her older brothers always made her bring the game to every family function to play until we bought them their own ; it is so much fun and has brought out the laughs so many times ; well worth the money and is played over and over and over - you wo n't be disappointed . Best investment for family fun and memories and we have had some classics from our family time with this game . It always follows dessert ! put the dishes away and get ready to play catch phrase . All of my older children 's friends ( in their 20 's and plus ) have now gone out to purchase their own - the more the merrier ; just expand the teams and pass it on for fun fun fun .
2 #### Low quality construction . Kids have a hard time putting the pieces together and keeping the board in order while playing .
3 #### The pieces are made out of thin cardboard . I do n't expect it to hold up very well . The game is fun , though .
4 #### IT 'S A GIFT ( NOT YET GIVEN . ) THE QUALITY IS WHAT I EXPECTED ... VERY GOOD AND IT HAD RAVE REVIEWS SO I AM ANXIOUS TO GET FEEDBACK ON HOW MUCH THEY LIKE IT.ITS A GIFT
4 #### My little girl loves this game and easily learned how to play it . She is only four by the way , but has been playing it for the last year . It is one of her favorites and mine too . It is quick to play and we can easily play it three or four times in a row in less than a half hour . It is true that it does not fit properly back into the box , but that has not been an issue for us and it could be more sturdily made , as our button sticks once in a while . Even with the couple of things that could be better I would still recomend it . Even my 10 and 11 year old pull this one out to play .
5 #### A fun game . And I do n't usually like card games .
4 #### Sequence consists of one board with two decks of cards imprinted on it . There are two decks of cards are used to play the game , plus three different colors of chips . Designed for two to twelve players . You are dealt approximately 6 cards and use those cards to put your chips on the board . The goal in sequence is to get 5 chips in a row , and get the most sequences on the board before it is full .
3 #### Kind of dinky - not as big or the same quality as the game I had growing up .
4 #### My six - year - old son has such a hard time with typical win / lose games because he feels bad if he loses and he feels bad if his family members lose . As we were setting it up , he whined , " Ohh .. I do n't like games where you win or lose ! " We just finished the first game , and while I think it will get boring after a while , it 's easy enough for him to grasp , and has just a little strategy to it to keep it interesting . I agree that it 's for younger kids , like the previous reviewer mentioned . I 'm just so glad to finally play board games with him !
4 #### awesome game for 4 , two people can also play but its more fun for 2 couples
5 #### This is one of the best games for ages 10 and up . The whole family and friends ca n't get enough !
5 #### You just ca n't go wrong . My kids have been playing this for years .
2 #### I bought this one thinking it was the old version due to the picture but it is actually Hasbro 's new connect four version which is definitely not as durable . Annoyed that I was misled but still love the game .
5 #### We used to play this game with our kids when they were young . It is a simple game of strategy that they fairly easily grasped at about the age of four , although all the strategies that could be employed may have taken them a couple of years to learn and appreciate . The game can be played in a matter of minutes so that there is plenty of time to play numerous rounds within the attention span of young kids . I believe it helped both of my kids learn that it is fun to compete with their minds , a quality they took with them all the way through their graduate degrees and use in their respective professions today . It also helped teach them that to lose means to try harder next time . They also enjoyed playing Connect Four with their grandparents , who were quite beatable opponents . Now that my wife and I are grandparents , we could not help but remember the hours of enjoyment our family had playing this game . So we just had to buy Connect Four games for our grandchildren in our daughter 's and son 's families .
2 #### I ordered the original style game and was sent the fancy new black , red , and yellow version . It was not what the kids originally wanted , nor what I preferred . The only reason I did n't return the item was because my children did n't want to wait for me to send this one back and get the new one . So be aware that you may not get the original style .
5 #### Tis is a fun game for all ages we love playing it with the grandbabies when they come over and send it home with them so they can play it with daddy and mommy . Highly recommend .
3 #### When the mobile app versions cost from a few cents to a dollar , $ 20 seems steep for such a simple game . I used to love playing this game when I was a kid , so I got it for my nephews .
4 #### This is a very good game for kids of any age . I needed a new game because my old one fell apart after 40 years ... LOL ! I was expecting a Milton Bradley game because a MB Connect Four game box is what was depicted when I ordered and what I owned previously but the Hasbro is OK too .
5 #### I remember playing this when I was a kid , could n't believe my kids wanted it for xmas too ... so they got it . The one that arrived was a different version though , the black framed one . Does n't matter - plays all the same .
1 #### I am extremely disppointed in the fact that the I was not sent what was portrayed in the picture of the Connect Four Game . I was under the impression that I would be sent an older game ( still new in box ) . Instead I received the newest version - which I could have purchased at my local Rite Aid for a lot less ! ! ! ! The newer styles just DO NOT last ! ! I was very much so looking forward to the exact game that I played as a child with my sisters . Feeling nostalgic & moderately sad . :(
5 #### Great gift for a 5 year old . This gift is an oldie but goodie . Would highly recommend it to anyone .
5 #### I love this game and children of all ages can play making this great for a family .
5 #### This is a wonderful game for two people to play and for adults as well as children . It helps in cognitive development since the person must develop strategies and learns how to use defensive moves to block the opponent and win the game . The more it is played the faster the participants become in anticipating the moves of the opponent and planning how to win the game . It 's called vertical checkers ; I do n't think of the game in that way but I have played it with children as well as adults . I have worn out my Connect Four game and purchased one this year to give to grandchildren for Christmas . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Our six year old granddaughter had this on her gift list and it has been a big hit , She , her friends and brother have been enjoying it for 4 months now and have not tired of it . This is a toy that allows children to think , plan and create a strategy in a high touch way ( as compared to high tech ) Highly recommended .

5 #### My 6 - year old loves this game ! We 've been playing it almost every day for the past 3 weeks and I still enjoy it :)
5 #### I 'm a " senior " , and my guy and I like to play Rummikub and Yahtzee . Thought I 'd find a game that not only would be entertaining , but also help keep our minds sharp . Well , this one sure fits the bill ! You really have to think and make a lot of little decisions of where to go on the board as you 'll usually have several efforts at a sequence going on at the same time . And you are also trying to stop your opponent from making a sequence . Thank goodness for the Jacks , which are either wild or you can remove one of their tokens from the board ! I can foresee us playing this game a lot in the future !
